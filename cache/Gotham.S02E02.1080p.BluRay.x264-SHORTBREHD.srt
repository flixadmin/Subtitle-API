1
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:03,213
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:06,466
My best wishes to Commissioner Essen.

3
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:08,301
Welcome back, Jim.

4
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:12,514
<i>I don't know how you pulled
this off, but I'm glad you did.</i>

5
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,434
<i>Sometimes the right way is
also the ugly way.</i>

6
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,145
<i>There's been an incident
at Arkham Asylum.</i>

7
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:20,855
<i>Six inmates have escaped.</i>

8
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,774
Barbara Kean was one of them.

9
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,234
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:28,113
The world sees criminal lunatics.

11
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:30,115
<i>I see brilliance.</i>

12
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,702
Gotham would tremble before you.

13
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:39,624
<i>"I beg of you, my son,
please choose happiness,</i>

14
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,960
<i>"unless you feel a calling.</i>

15
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:44,337
"A true calling."

16
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,174
<i>Mr. Mayor.</i>

17
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,301
- <i>No!</i>
- You want to know what I really am?

18
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,304
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Shall I tell you?

19
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:55,306
<i>Please, please</i>.

20
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:58,143
At heart,

21
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:02,021
- I'm an ardent student of human nature.
- Oh.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,566
<i>Fascinating paradox, we are.</i>

23
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,611
So wise, and yet so foolish.

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,739
So brave, and yet so fearful.

25
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,658
For instance, this is a glass jar.

26
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:17,287
Inside it is a hairy spider.
A tarantula, I guess, but I'm no expert.

27
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:21,666
In a minute, I'm going to open that little
hatch in the front of your box,

28
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:25,670
I'm going to drop the spider inside
and I'm going to close it.

29
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:28,339
- No, no!
- That's choice A.

30
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,594
Choice B, I open the hatch,

31
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,014
<i>you speak to your lovely secretary
Maggie on the telephone,</i>

32
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,391
you tell her you've run away
with some woman,

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,103
you'll be sending
written instructions shortly.

34
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:45,231
So which is it, choice A or choice B?

35
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,525
Choice B, please.
Please, choice B.

36
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,069
The telephone. Of course.

37
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,031
It's human nature.

38
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,953
See? There is no spider.

39
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,294
But if you don't do what I ask,
you'll wish there was one.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,630
Why are you doing this to me?

41
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,757
Don't fret so.

42
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,551
You're part of a great endeavor,

43
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:15,637
a great cleansing.

44
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:20,642
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor.

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,688
Monsters who will cleanse this city

46
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:30,193
in blood and fire.

47
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,906
Can you confirm that?
Yeah? Okay.

48
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,241
Because we're going to roll with that
right away.

49
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,076
You've got to confirm it though.
Do you understand?

50
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:39,828
Otherwise, you can get in
a lot of trouble.

51
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,499
What the hell is this?

52
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:47,836
"Where is Mayor James?
Who is his mystery lover?"

53
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:50,129
No one cares who the mayor is banging.

54
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,257
You can do better than this, people.

55
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,926
Now go out and get me
some headlines, damn it!

56
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:01,766
Yeah. All right, all right.

57
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,269
Oh, my goodness!

58
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,104
Oh, my God!

59
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,316
Perfect.

60
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,110
Next.

61
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,529
Mister X.

62
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,705
A little to the right.

63
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,541
Okay, that's the spot.

64
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,298
Perfect.

65
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,552
What shall we do with the spare?

66
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:42,765
Oh.

67
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,519
I know.

68
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,319
Aaron, would you kindly?

69
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,801
Now, that's a headline.

70
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,186
You all know what we're facing here.

71
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,397
Forty-eight hours ago,
six criminally-insane inmates

72
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,441
were busted out of Arkham Asylum.

73
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:37,236
Yesterday, four of those inmates
broke into Yellen Shipyard,

74
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:40,114
kidnapped seven workers,
then dropped them off

75
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,699
the roof of the <i>Gotham Gazette.</i>

76
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,701
As of now, we still have no leads

77
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,454
on the person or persons
behind the breakout.

78
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,539
Jim Gordon's lead. Jim.

79
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,208
These are our targets.

80
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:57,423
Jerome Valeska, 18 years old. Matricide.

81
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:04,263
Arnold Dobkins, schizophrenic.
Poisoner, rapist.

82
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:10,228
Aaron Helzinger. Killed his entire family
with his bare hands.

83
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:15,441
Robert Greenwood.
Killed and then ate a dozen women.

84
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:23,366
Barbara Kean. Killed her parents.

85
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,954
We're going to work this
in groups of four.

86
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,665
I'll hand out assignments
throughout the day.

87
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:34,043
Alvarez is my coordinating officer.
Any questions?

88
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,879
Let's get to work.

89
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,514
Fine job yesterday, gentlemen.

90
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,934
We opened big.
The whole city knows your name now.

91
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:53,021
So, bravo.
Let's give ourselves a round of applause.

92
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,193
Now that we have Gotham's attention,
it's time for the Maniax

93
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,945
to make a grand entrance.

94
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,197
Wasn't that it?

95
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,491
That was the overture.

96
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,412
Now the audience is hushed, expectant.

97
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,623
The curtain rises...

98
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,667
Then what happens?

99
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:21,049
Oh, then we confront Gothamites
with their most primal fears.

100
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:24,469
Take from them all they hold
dear and sacred.

101
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,137
And then what happens?

102
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:32,894
Why, then we offer them salvation.
And then they are ours.

103
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,605
Let's get busy, man.

104
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,901
Patience. First, you gentlemen
need to learn a little stagecraft.

105
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,820
- Stagecraft?
- You're going to be on TV.

106
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,865
You have to present yourselves
with style and vigor.

107
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,451
Dobkins, say,
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."

108
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,287
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

109
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,122
Again, with a smile.

110
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,251
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

111
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,504
You.

112
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,052
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

113
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,972
Not bad. Sinister and authoritative.

114
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,018
Never mind.

115
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,395
Jerome.

116
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:24,028
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening!

117
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:29,033
Very good. Boyishly charming.

118
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,870
The laugh is fabulous.
Use that.

119
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,080
Ow!

120
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,582
Ow! Ow!

121
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,504
Oh!

122
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,005
Now me.

123
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,095
I am so glad
that you two are getting along.

124
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,890
But we're a little busy here, so if you
could leave the poor mayor alone.

125
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,433
- We're bored.
- Yeah.

126
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,686
Why do the boys get to have all the fun?

127
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,730
Your time is coming. I told you.

128
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,652
You haven't killed him, have you?

129
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,112
No, I don't think so.

130
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,784
Nope, hanging in there.

131
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:16,414
When? When is my time coming?

132
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,710
Soon, very soon.

133
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:24,672
Why don't you tell me about James Gordon?

134
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,302
What do you want to know?

135
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:43,774
It's hard to believe.

136
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,568
My father's been sneaking
down here for years,

137
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,486
and I never even knew about it.

138
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,364
That makes two of us, doesn't it?

139
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,578
Wait. Let's just think about this.

140
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,623
Are you certain you want to turn
that bloody thing on?

141
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,832
Of course I'm certain.

142
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,792
Have you thought it through, Master Bruce?

143
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:05,421
This computer could contain all my
father's research into Wayne Enterprises.

144
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,925
All this time, I've been looking
for a smoking gun, and here it is.

145
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:13,387
Exactly, a smoking gun.
Now, guns are for grown-ups, aren't they?

146
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,351
It's a metaphor, Alfred, not an argument.

147
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,646
Here it is.

148
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,236
It's working! It's working.

149
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:32,406
What are you doing? Alfred, stop!
What are you doing?

150
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:36,077
What are you doing, Alfred?
Alfred, stop it! It's ruined!

151
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,163
It's ruined! What's wrong with you?
Why would you do that? Answer me!

152
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,998
It had to be done, Master Bruce.

153
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,668
This was the key to exposing
Wayne Enterprises.

154
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,255
Everything that I've worked for,
everything my dad worked for

155
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,757
is now gone! Because of you!

156
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,511
If I'd known what was down here,
I would have never helped get you in.

157
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,138
I mean, look around you. Look, look.
Liters of blood.

158
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,683
A bulletproof vest with two slugs in it!

159
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,851
Guns, weapons!

160
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,688
I mean, whatever's on that computer
probably killed your father,

161
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:07,566
and I'll be damned if I see you suffer
the same fate, Master Bruce.

162
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,404
I'm trying to protect you.

163
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,745
I'm trying to keep you safe.

164
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,625
I want you to go.

165
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:26,419
- Look, I know that you're--
- No.

166
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,004
- Upset, and it's been--
- Alfred.

167
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:32,925
I want you to go and never come back.
Do you understand me?

168
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:36,262
You're fired.

169
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,529
Very well, Master Bruce. As you wish.

170
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,287
Ooh, shiny!

171
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,124
Give that back.

172
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,584
I saw it first.

173
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,463
No, you didn't. I said give it back.

174
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,923
Make me, you little brat.

175
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,759
Ooh!

176
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,347
Your samurai skills are excellent,
Greenwood-<i>san,</i>

177
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,516
but they are nothing compared to me.

178
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,103
Prepare to die!

179
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,276
That's enough! I said...

180
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,945
I tried to stop them.

181
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:38,449
Boys, we're a team.

182
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,451
We don't fight amongst ourselves.

183
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,329
Yeah, we're a team, boys.

184
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,914
And I'm the captain.

185
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,459
Captain of my foot.

186
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:53,547
I've murdered a dozen women,
terrorized the city.

187
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:57,426
What have you done? Chop up your mommy?

188
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,054
Everybody has to start somewhere.

189
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:05,226
See, I have vision,
and ambition, and brains.

190
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,895
You're just a nutty
old cannibal.

191
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,981
How many people can you eat
before that shtick gets old?

192
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,150
I could eat one more.

193
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:17,279
I can see we're going to have to
resolve this one, once and for all.

194
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,915
You all know this game, right?

195
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,166
Oh, love it.

196
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,173
Who wants to be the boss?

197
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,093
Ladies first.

198
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:02,950
Hey, Greenwood, what's the secret
to good comedy?

199
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,874
Timing. And what's courage?

200
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,713
Grace under pressure.

201
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,759
And who's the boss?

202
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:31,479
I'm the boss.

203
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:41,530
I believe you are, Jerome.
I believe you are.

204
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:44,033
<i>Arigato, sensei.</i>

205
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,493
Whoo! Hee!

206
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,245
Thank you.

207
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,873
Four lunatics and Barbara?

208
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,917
Brother, you got no luck.

209
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,419
I told you civilian life was better,
didn't I?

210
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,672
Yeah, you did.
Actually, that's kind of why I'm here.

211
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,132
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

212
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,592
What are you doing here?

213
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,387
Jim, you remember Scotty, my girlfriend?

214
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,098
- Fiancée.
- Right, my fiancée.

215
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:09,850
Yeah. Scotty, good to see you.

216
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,645
Relax, honeybun. We're just talking.

217
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,856
Oh, like hell, you are. He's going to ask
you to come back to work.

218
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,526
He didn't ask me anything.
We're just having a chat.

219
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:19,777
Oh, is that right?

220
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,488
Is that why you're here,
Detective, just to have a chat?

221
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,660
No. No, she's right. Harvey, I need
your help. The case is a bear.

222
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,204
We're short-handed, and I was thinking
maybe you could...

223
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:33,666
He has a life. The answer is no.
He is not coming back.

224
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,418
Hon. I'm telling him no.

225
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,963
But it's like she said.

226
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:41,423
I have a life.

227
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,468
I get it. I get it.

228
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:48,222
I'm happy for you. Just a thought.

229
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,641
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

230
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:55,104
Jim, one last thing.
One last thought from your Uncle Harvey.

231
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:59,817
These Maniax killed a bunch of people
from the shipyard, right?

232
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,695
Yellen Shipyard, yeah.

233
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,614
Why there? They could've gone
anywhere, killed anyone.

234
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:11,704
But these lunatics specifically chose
that shipyard. I wonder why.

235
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,874
Good to see you. Scotty.

236
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,712
Yeah, I'll call you back. Commissioner.

237
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,672
Tell me something good, please.

238
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,133
- Harvey isn't coming back.
- That's not good.

239
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,885
But he did suggest
a lead that panned out nicely.

240
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:30,347
Turns out the Maniax stole a refueling
truck from the shipyard yesterday.

241
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:31,682
Why wasn't it reported?

242
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,851
It was one of
over a hundred service vehicles.

243
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,020
Took a while to track down
the entire fleet.

244
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,689
But when we did,
we found that one was missing.

245
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,691
Fully loaded with gasoline.

246
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,151
You get a license plate?

247
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,362
And a description of the vehicle.
Put out an APB.

248
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,197
God, I'm so glad you're back, Jim.

249
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,407
Me, too.

250
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,536
Wish I could say the same for Bullock.

251
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,205
I can't believe he's really gone.

252
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,375
He's a cop. He was born to be a cop.

253
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,669
Not anymore. He's a happy man.

254
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:02,463
I didn't have it in me to push him.

255
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,424
You ever think about that?

256
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,843
Walking away, I mean.

257
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,554
No. You?

258
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,890
I did, for a long time.

259
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,267
But not anymore?

260
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:20,230
I've sat back and watched
old, corrupt, lazy men

261
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:24,568
buy their way into this job and waste it.
Not me, Jim.

262
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:26,362
Not me.

263
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,448
- A new day.
- You're damn right.

264
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,471
I'd just like to say it's been an honor

265
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,933
and a privilege to serve
you and your family, sir.

266
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:58,894
Thank you.

267
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,189
If you need any references,
I'll be happy to provide them.

268
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,196
Is that all you're taking with you?

269
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,533
It's all I have, sir.

270
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,499
Right. Well, oh, dear.

271
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,960
Yes, I best be off.
I've got a train to catch.

272
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,924
Goodbye, sir.

273
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,512
Goodbye, Alfred.

274
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,097
Beg your pardon, sir?

275
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,141
I said goodbye.

276
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:39,435
Yes.

277
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,524
Goodbye, sir.

278
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:06,044
I spy with my little eye,
something that is...

279
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,384
Yellow.

280
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:17,181
Score, Gotham, score! We want more!
Hit them where it hurts

281
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,183
and knock them to the floor!

282
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:20,476
Whoo!

283
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,605
Yay, Gotham!

284
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,708
Oh, hello, Ms. Kringle.

285
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,544
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

286
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,421
How is your day going?

287
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,548
Fine.

288
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,550
Um, question for you.

289
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,641
- Yes?
- Um...

290
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,021
Did you know
that house flies hum in the key of F?

291
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:12,903
No.
No, I did not know that.

292
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,073
Okay, then.

293
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:22,162
- Well, uh, bye.
- Bye.

294
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,506
Damn it!
We agreed you were going to ask her out.

295
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:37,761
We didn't agree to ask her,
we agreed to think about asking her.

296
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,763
But there's no point.
She doesn't like you.

297
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:43,684
<i>Maybe she'll like me.
You ever consider that?</i>

298
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,270
Maybe she'll like me.

299
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:49,606
I got confidence. Ladies love that.

300
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,860
No, she won't like you.

301
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,071
She won't. Go away.

302
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,784
Please, just go away!

303
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,207
Hey.

304
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,018
Whoo!

305
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,312
Ah!

306
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,654
We got a sighting of the stolen truck.
Yeavely Park.

307
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,705
I want you all to know
this was a very difficult decision for us.

308
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,251
It was between you
and a senior citizen bingo party.

309
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,464
In the end, we decided to skew
a little younger.

310
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,884
Youth won the day. Sorry.

311
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:00,636
Give me an O!

312
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,602
- I said give me an O.
- O.

313
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,938
- Give me an N.
- N.

314
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,523
- Give me another O!
- O!

315
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,275
What does that spell?

316
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,527
- "O" no!
- "O" no!

317
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,543
Do it, do it, do it!

318
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,255
Ready? Okay!

319
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,889
This is so embarrassing.

320
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,891
Anyone got a light?

321
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,769
I do.

322
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,822
Stand your ground, boys.
They can't shoot at the bus.

323
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,241
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

324
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:13,875
Aaron, Greenwood, get the truck started.
We're gonna blow this barbeque!

325
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,099
Light 'em up!

326
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,108
<i>I want to go home!</i>

327
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,320
- Everybody okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

328
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,448
Who broke you out, Dobkins?

329
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,784
You're gonna have to talk sooner or later.
Tell me now.

330
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,329
I'm a victim here, sir.
I was coerced, abducted and coerced.

331
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,663
- By who?
- If I tell you that,

332
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,165
I gotta get some kind of guaran--

333
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,796
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

334
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:31,513
I understand
you were just trying to protect me.

335
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,432
But there's nothing,

336
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:38,979
nothing that you can do to stop me
from carrying out my father's work.

337
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,188
I know that now.

338
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,235
I don't want you to go, Alfred.

339
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:50,657
But you're either with me,
or you're against me.

340
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,451
And if you're against me,
I don't have a choice.

341
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,747
I'm with you, Master Bruce.
I've always been with you.

342
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,585
But what you're doing
is tantamount to suicide.

343
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,838
This is big boy stuff.
You're too young. You're not ready.

344
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:06,965
Then make me ready.

345
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,969
You've lived a dangerous life,
and you survived.

346
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,307
So teach me. Teach me how to do the same.

347
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,642
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll train every day.

348
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,144
Yeah, but you said that before,
didn't you?

349
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:22,772
That was before. Now I know the truth!

350
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,442
And I know what I have to do.

351
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,238
I'll even go back to school, if you want.

352
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,533
School, even?

353
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:44,211
If I agree to help you, to make you ready,

354
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:49,591
you must do exactly as I say
and when I say it, with no exceptions.

355
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,051
Is that understood?

356
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,847
Understood.

357
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:02,520
But, in return,
you must fix that computer.

358
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,983
Fix it? How on Earth am I gonna do that?

359
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:11,529
That's not my problem.
I'm not the one who broke it.

360
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,581
High caliber, high velocity.

361
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,709
Judging by the size of the wounds,
it was definitely shot from some distance.

362
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,253
Someone knew how to shoot.

363
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,296
Who, damn it?

364
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,174
And why cheerleaders? Where's the motive?

365
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,134
They didn't even ask for a ransom.

366
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,972
They want headlines. They want mass panic.

367
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,807
- Well, they got it.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

368
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:42,310
Let's see if we can't ID that bullet.
Never know your luck.

369
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,525
- Holding up?
- Holding up.

370
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,277
Love you.

371
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:51,736
Likewise.

372
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,213
Gin and tonic, please, uh, guv'nor.
Ice and a slice.

373
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:16,886
Nice place.

374
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,638
It is.

375
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,225
- Been here before, then, have you?
- It's my regular spot.

376
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,103
Oh, right, you're a local. Nice.

377
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,064
Don't I know you?

378
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,525
Do you?

379
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,861
Yeah...

380
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:38,950
You're that Mr. Fox, that scientific chap
from Wayne Enterprises, isn't ya?

381
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:40,618
That is me.

382
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:45,415
Alfred Pennyworth.
Young Master Bruce Wayne's guardian.

383
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:48,418
Ah, yes!

384
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,172
It's a funny old game, though, isn't it?

385
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,633
Coincidence. I mean,
me bumping into you like this. I mean...

386
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,261
I was just thinking about you.

387
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:03,975
Hmm.

388
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:09,272
Okay, Mr. Pennyworth, I'll bite.
What were you thinking about me?

389
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,858
Oh, Alfred, please.

390
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,444
Please, Lucius.

391
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,739
Lucius. Lucius.

392
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:23,286
You know,
I once knew this geezer called Onslow

393
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,997
in the Isle of Dogs,
in the East End of London.

394
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,042
Lairy little scallywag he was.

395
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,836
He was too smiley by half.
Never trusted him.

396
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,464
Anyway, one day, Lucius,
he comes bowling up to me

397
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:38,676
and he asks me
to do him this right, iffy favor.

398
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,471
It doesn't matter what it was.

399
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,391
The point being,
against my better judgment,

400
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:46,851
I agreed to do it.

401
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,063
But Lucius,
I told him, I told him straight.

402
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,316
I said, "You let me down, Onslow,

403
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:57,195
"I will tuck you up,
sunshine, like a kipper."

404
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:03,410
He swears blind, swears on his mother's
grave he'd never do such a thing.

405
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,996
But, of course, he did.
Couldn't help himself. He let me down.

406
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,292
So I tucked him up.

407
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,587
Like a kipper.

408
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,298
What is a kipper?

409
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,386
It's a type of smoked fish.

410
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,515
Very nice with eggs
and brown toast for breakfast.

411
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:30,854
But what I learned from Onslow is this.

412
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:34,274
There are two types of people
on this planet, you see.

413
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,693
Them you can trust

414
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,363
and them you can't.

415
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,323
I cannot disagree.

416
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:44,868
Which kind are you?

417
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,747
Both kinds of people would
give you the same answer, wouldn't they?

418
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:53,084
Exactly. Exactly right.

419
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:59,132
There lieth the problem, Lucius.
You see, I need to confide in you.

420
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,803
But I need to know
that you're trustworthy.

421
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:08,892
Perhaps I should decline your confidence.
I don't like the sound of these kippers.

422
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,978
Yeah, well,
it's a bit late for that, unfortunately.

423
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,564
I mean, it's you after all,
Lucius, that created this mess

424
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:19,819
when you told young Master Bruce
that his dear old dead dad was a stoic.

425
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:24,574
- Ah.
- Ah. Exactly. See, there's the problem.

426
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,911
I got no one else to turn to.

427
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,915
I have to confide in you.

428
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,167
- I see.
- Do you?

429
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,087
Let me just be crystal clear about this.

430
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,592
If it turns out

431
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,677
that I can't trust you,

432
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:48,264
I swear on my mother's grave,

433
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,683
you, my old sausage,

434
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,395
are a dead man.

435
00:30:57,106 --> 00:31:00,777
I have only the best intentions
for Bruce Wayne.

436
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,409
Well, another gin and tonic,
please, uh, guv'nor.

437
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:11,246
And whatever this young man's drinking,
one for yourself.

438
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,293
How are you at fixing computers?

439
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:21,464
Hey, Alvarez.

440
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:22,799
Yo.

441
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,968
Let Ballistics know
we got a red-ball for them, will ya?

442
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:26,177
<i>On it.</i>

443
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:27,345
Gordon.

444
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,973
<i>Hello, Jim. It's Barbara.</i>

445
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,150
Hi, Barbara. How are you?

446
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:44,362
<i>Oh, me? I'm fabulous. How are you?</i>

447
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:45,863
I'm good. What's new?

448
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:47,824
<i>Mr. Cool Guy, huh?</i>

449
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,494
<i>You must be so mad at me.</i>

450
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,539
Listen to me.
If you turn yourself in, I can help you.

451
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:59,168
<i>How, Jim? By taking me back
to Arkham? I don't think so.</i>

452
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,087
You're sick.

453
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:05,842
<i>Of course. Everything's always my fault.
So typical.</i>

454
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,555
Listen to me. I know you, Barbara.
I know you.

455
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,932
You're a good, kind woman.

456
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,350
This isn't you.

457
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,854
<i>You could always make me laugh.</i>

458
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:25,778
How do I look?

459
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:40,168
I need to talk to Commissioner Essen
right away. It's an emergency.

460
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:41,878
<i>Yeah, go ahead,
she's right upstairs.</i>

461
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,588
<i>I'm sorry, sir, you said this was...</i>

462
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,092
Yo, Commish.

463
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:49,260
Yeah.

464
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,309
Heard you were looking for us.

465
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:00,396
<i>What the hell are...</i>

466
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:02,482
<i>Put him down!</i>

467
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:24,837
Barbara! Don't move.

468
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,008
You're wrong about me, Jim.

469
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,845
I tried telling you, but you never listen.

470
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,431
I'm listening now.

471
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,475
Yeah, sure you are. Now.

472
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,268
Come on.

473
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,313
Let's go talk this through, huh?

474
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,856
Oh, it's too late for that.

475
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,208
Ow.

476
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:16,723
<i>Aaron.</i>

477
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,142
That's enough.

478
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,653
I'm not sick, I'm free.

479
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,321
You don't get that.

480
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:36,826
I could explain it,
but you should probably get back to work.

481
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:38,995
Who knows what went wrong
while you were gone.

482
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,884
No, please!

483
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,703
Hell of a first week you're having,
Commissioner.

484
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:25,416
I wish I could tell you
that things were gonna get better for you.

485
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:26,959
They're not.

486
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:28,127
<i>Help.</i>

487
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,379
Here, bring that up here.

488
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,007
Get a better angle of the room.

489
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:34,967
Why are you doing this?

490
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,636
To rule the world.

491
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:40,640
Blah, blah, blah. But we'll settle
for some dead cops and some good PR.

492
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,143
- Kidding.
- Yeah, whatever, I get it.

493
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,478
You're just crazy.

494
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:47,563
Crazy?

495
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:52,902
Look at me.

496
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,738
You can see I'm not crazy.

497
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:00,827
Very soon, little man, you will be dead,

498
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,663
and the world will go on without you.

499
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:08,125
You'll be nothing.
No one will even remember your name.

500
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:09,794
Mmm...

501
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:15,633
No. That is where you're wrong, old lady.

502
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:19,053
We will leave a mark on this city.

503
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,598
We will spread across it like a virus.

504
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,726
Do you know why?

505
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,688
There's nothing
more contagious than laughter.

506
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:33,943
My line.

507
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:38,322
There's nothing
more contagious than laughter.

508
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,913
That was strangely pleasant. Do it again.

509
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:47,290
Oh!

510
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:49,625
That's gonna leave a mark.

511
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,715
You got me.

512
00:36:58,009 --> 00:36:59,343
My turn.

513
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:04,158
Lee.

514
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,701
Jim!

515
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,328
You hurt?

516
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:11,040
No, I was in my office
and I heard gunfire, and I hid.

517
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,708
Where were you?

518
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,877
Barbara was here. She lured me away.

519
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:16,712
Essen!

520
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,383
<i>It's okay. Just breathe.
Breathe. Come on.</i>

521
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:32,019
Hang on, Cap. Hang on.

522
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,898
Boss. Boss. Stay with me.

523
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:37,566
Breathe.

524
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,532
It's a new day, Jim.

525
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:01,590
This is

526
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,260
indeed broken.

527
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:10,516
- I have a lot of questions for you.
- Ah, I imagine so.

528
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:14,770
Did my father tell you everything?

529
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,773
Heavens, no.
Your father, he was a very private man.

530
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,192
He had to be.

531
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:24,572
I simply helped with technical resources,
like this computer.

532
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,325
Do you know what's on it?

533
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:31,078
No. I didn't wanna know, to be honest.

534
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:35,332
- But you can fix it?
- Mmm, I should think so.

535
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:39,170
But it is going to take some time.

536
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:49,388
Well, uh, thank you, for your help.

537
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,269
I loved your father.

538
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,355
I regret that I never told him so.

539
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,568
I regret that I didn't help him more.

540
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:10,576
Hand me the soldering iron, will you?

541
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:12,995
Yeah.

542
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:17,917
Master Bruce.

543
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:19,710
What is it, Alfred?

544
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:24,090
Okay. How you doing, Mr. Nygma?

545
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:27,510
Okay, two aspirin for you. You're welcome.

546
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,389
Detective Gordon!

547
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:35,810
Bruce.

548
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,812
I heard the news.

549
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:39,855
I was worried something happened to you.

550
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:43,109
I'm very relieved.

551
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:45,736
Me, too.

552
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:50,366
The last time that we met,
I was very hard on you.

553
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,244
I wanted to apologize.

554
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,580
You've been a really good friend.

555
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,481
<i>She was a good woman.</i>

556
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,238
Good cop.

557
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,209
It's good to see you,
but you don't have to do this.

558
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,421
Let's not talk about it.

559
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:48,090
We are who we are, right?

560
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:50,467
No use fighting it.

561
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,262
What did Scotty say?

562
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,931
She'll understand,

563
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,892
or she won't.

564
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,269
Guys. You need to see this.

565
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:03,772
<i>I'm reporting live from
the scene of the G.C.P.D. massacre.</i>

566
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:06,525
<i>We have just obtained
video footage of the attack</i>

567
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,652
<i>recorded by one of the assailants.</i>

568
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:13,115
I wanna warn those of you watching,
what you're about to see is very graphic.

569
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:19,455
<i>Hello, Gotham City! We're the Maniax.</i>

570

<i>And I'm Jerome,
the shot-caller of our little gang.</i>

571
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:28,339

of wisdom and hope</i>.

572
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,177

573
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:38,599
<i>You're all prisoners.</i>

574
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:44,772
<i>What you call sanity
is just a prison in your minds</i>

575
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:48,025
<i>that stops you from seeing
that you're just tiny, little cogs</i>

577
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:52,863
<i>Wake up!</i>

578
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:56,492
<i>Why be a cog?</i>

579
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:59,203
<i>Be free like us.</i>

580
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,579
<i>Just like him!</i>

00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:02,873
