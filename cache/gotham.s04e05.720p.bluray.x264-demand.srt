1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,118
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:04,328
Where are you, Ed?

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,629
What's green and red
and goes round and round?

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,297
Zebra with a gaping hole.

5
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,834
Your brilliant mind is as damaged
as the rest of your body.

6
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,128
I guess she was right.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,796
You're not smart.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,302
We'd need an army to take on Penguin.

9
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:18,887
<i>Makes me miss Falcone.</i>

10
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,519
You came looking for a gangster,
that's exactly what you found.

11
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:22,887
I'm a Falcone.

12
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,017
I need to know
what you're going to do.

13
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,848
You want the city back from Penguin,

14
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,016
<i>I'll give that to you.</i>

15
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,527
Did you really think
I wouldn't figure it out?

16
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,315
The two of you have been
whispering like teenagers for weeks.

17
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,115
You never deserved her
in the first place.

18
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,693
Yes, I killed him.

19
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,196
I am sorry.

20
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,280
<i>There's a legend
about this knife.</i>

21
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,038
<i>The man that killed
my grandfather can't have this.</i>

22
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,201
I promise.

23
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,786
<i>That's Ra's al Ghul.</i>

24
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,627
That knife is the key to everything.

25
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,840
Give me the knife
and I will release the boy.

26
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,546
- Bruce, hand me the knife.
- I can't.

27
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,099
- So who's the vegetable?
- Ah, he used to be a gangster.

28
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,557
Name's Gilzean. Maybe Gold?

29
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,686
He took a slug in the noodle.
Been in a coma six months.

30
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,442
So, hospital brass
wants to free up beds?

31
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,741
Yeah. Say take him upstate.

32
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:34,176
Rest in Peace, Butch Gilzean,
Cyrus Gold,

33
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,003
whoever the hell you are.

34
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,962
Hey, Harvey, has anyone contacted you
about Ra's al Ghul?

35
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,043
No.

36
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,548
I just heard from
Judge Bam Bam's clerk.

37
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,801
- His trial got pushed off the docket.
- And?

38
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,892
And I want to make sure, him being
minister of a foreign country,

39
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,560
doesn't let him weasel out of this.

40
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,222
- He killed the boy.
- That's above my pay grade, pal.

41
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,273
I just bust the bad guys.

42
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,684
Do you?

43
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,904
These are release forms.

44
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,981
Of my collars.

45
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,739
Let me guess, each one of them
has a license from Penguin, right?

46
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,445
Jim, I am stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

47
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,496
Every moop you bust with a license,

48
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,745
the Commissioner orders me
to let him go.

49
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,126
What am I supposed to do?

50
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,666
- Your job.
- I am doing my job.

51
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,002
Gordon, got a call
from the judge's clerk.

52
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,253
It's about Ra's al Ghul.

53
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,211
- Here.
- I'm doing my job.

54
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,057
Master Bruce.

55
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,764
No sleep?

56
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,724
Again?

57
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,439
Once more about that boy's death.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,532
Don't say it's not my fault.

59
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,234
It is my fault.

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,488
- Alex is dead because I hesitated.
- Well, perhaps you did,

61
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,197
but that doesn't make you
his murderer, does it?

62
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:32,001
Ra's killed that innocent little boy
and he's going to pay for it.

63
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,124
You really think locking him up
in Blackgate will stop him?

64
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,545
He still wants his dagger.

65
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,248
Stop going on about
the bloody dagger, will you?

66
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,629
Just so we can just
get some breakfast. Please.

67
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,632
I think I finally found something
in Dr. Winthrop's notes.

68
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,429
There's a description on the handle

69
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,256
that Dr. Winthrop
was able to decipher.

70
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,474
Says the knife is intended
for the one

71
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,268
who was bathed in the healing waters.

72
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,521
Right. Well, assuming that's not me,
that would be our boy Ra's.

73
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,978
But that doesn't have to mean
it's for him to use.

74
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,814
Perhaps to be used against him.

75
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,318
- I see.
- No.

76
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,107
You clearly don't.

77
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,408
What you're suggesting is

78
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,655
that knife and that knife alone

79
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,282
is the only thing
capable of doing him in.

80
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,539
If Ra's al Ghul believes
this knife will kill him,

81
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,327
that could explain
why he wants it so bad.

82
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,408
So he can destroy it.

83
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,044
Before someone fulfills the prophecy.

84
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,966
Master Bruce, I know that
you feel bad about Alex, we all do.

85
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,556
But at this point,
you must remember your vow.

86
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,594
No killing.

87
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,971
No killing.

88
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,189
Taking a life,
never mind how justified,

89
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,237
will lead you down a darker path
than you could ever possibly imagine.

90
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,272
I know. I've been down it.

91
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,609
- Do you understand me, Master Bruce?
- I understand.

92
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:48,903
Good.

93
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,584
Just get yourself ready.

94
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,707
Chop-chop.

95
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,598
Such a tragedy.

96
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,061
He was only a child,
and always so lovely.

97
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,974
A heinous crime,

98
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,311
perpetrated against
such an innocent boy.

99
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:27,242
And his grandfather, murdered,
just the day before.

100
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,083
I'll just be a moment, Master Bruce.

101
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,588
Diplomatic immunity.

102
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,340
You are joking, ain't you?

103
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,642
The Nanda Parbat embassy filed papers
to have him extradited.

104
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,642
- Could happen this week.
- The monster killed a child.

105
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,144
I know. I was there. Look,

106
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,101
I'm telling this you as a courtesy.

107
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,066
- Oh!
- But the news will get out.

108
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,363
When it does,
I need you to watch Bruce.

109
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,944
I'm worried about him.

110
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,117
And you blame me?

111
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,074
You're his guardian, aren't you?

112
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,576
You're supposed to protect him,

113
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,658
and instead you've been placing him
in harm's way.

114
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,993
Oh, I see. So that's rankles, is it?

115
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,077
Keeping you in the dark?

116
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,830
Well, if I was you,
I'd focus on your own job, Detective,

117
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,587
which is keeping Ra's al Ghul
behind bars, tucked up.

118
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,543
Just keep the news away from Bruce
as long as you can.

119
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,175
On that, we agree, Detective.

120
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,469
The boy's been through enough.

121
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,554
Thanks for coming, Barbara.

122
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,812
Hell of a chicken coop.

123
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,852
So what's the angle?

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,435
How about this?

125
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:33,072
Say the word, we'll be home,
drinking Chianti by dinnertime.

126
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,491
I think I'll decline.

127
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,116
So why did you call me here?

128
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,871
To say goodbye.

129
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,920
When I brought you back to life,

130
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,878
I asked you to be
my eyes and ears in Gotham.

131
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,756
- You became so much more.
- Save it.

132
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,554
What about everything
you promised me?

133
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,602
Do as I ask, and I will give you
a gift beyond your imagining.

134
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,831
What the hell was that?

135
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,288
You will see.

136
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,584
Goodbye, Barbara.

137
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,803
<i>Born on a Monday</i>

138
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,938
<i>Christened on Tuesday</i>

139
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,274
<i>Married on a Wednesday</i>

140
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,276
<i>Took ill on Thursday</i>

141
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,946
<i>Grew worse on Friday</i>

142
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,365
<i>Died on Saturday</i>

143
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,908
<i>Buried on...</i>

144
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,201
Sweet mother of Mary.

145
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,530
Never seen nothing like him before.

146
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,907
He's white as a picket fence.

147
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,744
Easy. We ain't gonna hurt you.

148
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,287
What happened to
your drawers, big fella?

149
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,581
Easy.

150
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,002
No!

151
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,098
We're gonna get you, you freak.

152
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,895
Who are you?

153
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,253
"Solomon Grundy.

154
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,168
"Born...

155
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,380
on Monday."

156
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,650
License compliance amongst the GCPD
remains high.

157
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,899
The program is an
unmitigated success.

158
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,450
Numbers, Mr. Penn.

159
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,615
According to my tabulations,

160
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:08,207
86 percent of crime is accounted for
under Pax Penguina.

161
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,995
Which means that
14 percent of crime happens

162
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,829
outside of my licensing system.

163
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,004
The numbers are
very good, Mr. Cobblepot.

164
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,466
Get Firefly. I want examples made.

165
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,592
Yes, that might help.

166
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,801
But then, if scorching a few idiots
was all it took,

167
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,181
anyone could rule Gotham.

168
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,143
Thank you for your insight,
Miss Falcone.

169
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,644
I don't recall summoning you.

170
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,735
I came to see
if you had lunch plans tomorrow.

171
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,068
An invitation?

172
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:46,283
After I killed your father's
last remaining loyalists?

173
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,206
Perhaps you overestimate
the pleasure of your company.

174
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,408
Oswald.

175
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,461
You may think you have everything

176
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,669
but there is
one thing you don't have.

177
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,217
The Falcone name.

178
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,302
A name that once accounted for
all criminal activity in Gotham.

179
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,217
As in, one hundred percent.

180
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,146
Now you're just rubbing it in.

181
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,142
I propose we have lunch
somewhere public.

182
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,151
By doing so, you'll show Gotham

183
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,400
that you have the support
of the Falcone family.

184
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:21,939
And that should be enough

185
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,820
to send those outlying
criminal elements

186
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,822
scurrying back under your umbrella.

187
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,032
Mr. Penn, item number four
on my to-do list.

188
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,253
Kill Sofia Falcone.

189
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,796
Add a question mark, will you?

190
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,588
Tomorrow it is.

191
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,224
God! Your people have pills
for everything!

192
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,522
Insomnia. Anxiety.
You have to have something for me.

193
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,478
I don't know.
A pill to reverse the effect

194
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,279
of having your brain frozen
and unfrozen?

195
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,944
That's kind of specific.

196
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,747
I will not be condescended to
by an idiot in a lab coat!

197
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,241
You're not even a doctor!

198
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,662
Okay, relax, man.
Just tell me your symptoms.

199
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,830
Fogginess of the mind,

200
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,549
decreased capacity to think
ten steps ahead,

201
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,461
inability to solve riddles.

202
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,428
I have got to improve
my brain function.

203
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,176
I could take a pill or a vitamin.

204
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,595
I'll even consider a natural remedy.

205
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,894
I don't want to get your hopes up,
but there is something.

206
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,475
What? Tell me.

207
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,147
A trial drug.

208
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,150
It claims to boost
your natural cognitive abilities.

209
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,482
- That's perfect! Where is this?
- The sample drawer.

210
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,153
- What is it called?
- Smartivia.

211
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,361
Blue pills. Diamond shaped.

212
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,498
Smartivia. Smartivia.
I don't see them.

213
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,124
Try towards the back.

214
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,743
Ah! I don't see it.

215
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,295
Here it is.

216
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,719
A fake gun? Seriously?

217
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,678
Wait, wait, wait.
I just need to know.

218
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,554
Do these work?

219
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,686
No, dummy. They're sugar pills.

220
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,187
And I'm calling the police.

221
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,813
Go on, gently.

222
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,838
Ow!

223
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,385
Butch!

224
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,855
You know Grundy?

225
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,139
Butch.

226
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,567
I have never had an issue with you.

227
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,728
Barbara Kean, she's the problem.

228
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,146
You and Tabitha were
innocent bystanders.

229
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,906
Wow. You don't get much sun. Look...

230
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,366
Man talk too much.

231
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,336
- Collins. Deal with this, will you?
- Yep.

232
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,756
Gordon. Gordon!

233
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,049
- Bruce is gone.
- What?

234
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,795
- You've got to get me into Blackgate.
- What are you talking about?

235
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,049
When we got back from the wake,

236
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,347
he said he was gonna go
straight to bed,

237
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,345
but he must have snuck out
between then and now.

238
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,768
My concern is that
he's taken the knife...

239
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,600
and he's gonna try and kill
Ra's al Ghul.

240
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,980
- You're serious?
- He's being bloody serious.

241
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,810
We gotta go to Blackgate now.

242
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,812
And then you can tell me
the many ways

243
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,272
I failed the child, all right?

244
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,153
- Oh, I will.
- Listen to me.

245
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,701
The boy is on the verge
of doing something that

246
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,994
there's no coming back from.

247
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:58,697
He needs our help.

248
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:01,992
All right.

249
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,743
Let's go.

250
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,948
It's about time.
Shift ended five minutes ago.

251
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,316
Come on.

252
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,057
You weak,

253
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,152
foolish boy.

254
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,747
You're still not ready.

255
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,632
My name is Bruce Wayne. Stop him!

256
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,800
Stop him!

257
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,597
Master al Ghul.

258
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,891
Take him below.

259
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,444
What... what are you doing?

260
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,364
We got your call,

261
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,824
but I checked the logs.
Bruce Wayne hasn't been here.

262
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,710
With all due respect, I don't think
he'd come as a regular visitor.

263
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,420
He's a billionaire, after all.

264
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,873
I think what Mr. Pennyworth
is trying to say

265
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,459
is Bruce Wayne could have
paid someone to get him in here.

266
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,793
No offense.

267
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,466
We just want to look around.

268
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,424
Sure. Whatever you want.

269
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,760
But you came all the way here
for nothing.

270
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,978
And we're gonna need your weapons.

271
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,807
Standard procedure.

272
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,143
Of course.

273
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,296
- Finished?
- That's absolutely it.

274
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,344
Unless you wanna
check my undercrackers.

275
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,422
This way.

276
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,549
Undercrackers?

277
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,348
They're here.

278
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,287
Sugar pills, my foot.

279
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,048
That dream was horrible.

280
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,506
Oh, my God! Oh, you're real.

281
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,388
You know Grundy?

282
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,059
What? No. No.

283
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,511
No, who's Grundy?

284
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,101
Solomon Grundy.

285
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,600
Born on Monday.

286
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,402
Your hand. How...

287
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,197
I'm sorry, what happened to you?

288
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,826
Grundy not know.

289
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,699
Okay, let me get this straight.
You don't remember...

290
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,334
who you are or how you got here?

291
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,708
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,381
Grundy, I don't know you.

293
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,671
Best of luck, though.

294
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,678
Hope you get the skin thing
figured out. Later.

295
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,972
You know Grundy.

296
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,224
You help Grundy.

297
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,900
Be Grundy friend.

298
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,941
I'm attempting to be civil.

299
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,489
But I can't help you.

300
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,528
Why?

301
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,413
I just can't. All right?

302
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,907
- Why?
- Because...

303
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,460
- Why?
- Because I can't even help myself.

304
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,128
Ow!

305
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:45,051
You don't know who you are.
Well, that makes two of us.

306
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,087
I used to be smart.

307
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:48,968
Brilliant.

308
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,467
And now that's gone.

309
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,718
I can't even rob a pharmacy.

310
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,101
So you want me to help you?

311
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,058
I can't.

312
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,954
Well, I am feeling a bit peckish.

313
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,882
We are closed.

314
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,381
Janos.

315
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,138
Last I saw you was
at my tenth birthday.

316
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,810
You bought me ruby earrings.

317
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,345
Said it would be a fitting gift

318
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,226
for the daughter
of the king of Gotham.

319
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,559
Sofia Falcone.

320
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,061
I heard you had returned to Gotham.

321
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:46,904
What can I do for you?

322
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,825
I was wondering how you were faring
under Penguin's rule.

323
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,911
The Szabo family is quite content

324
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,490
under Oswald Cobblepot's
licensing system.

325
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,617
But even if we were not,

326
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,623
we would be wise enough
to not say anything.

327
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,913
Good.

328
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,420
Because I've invited him
to your restaurant for lunch.

329
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,674
And I want it to be a lunch
he'll never forget.

330
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,521
Bruce...

331
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,238
Where am I?

332
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,908
Beneath Blackgate Penitentiary.

333
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,084
Alfred Pennyworth
and Jim Gordon are upstairs.

334
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:49,377
In the company, unbeknownst to them,
of my men.

335
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,053
Let them go.
They have nothing to do with this.

336
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,428
Still playing
the white knight, Bruce?

337
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,513
You replaced the guards
before I got here.

338
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,019
I'm sure your friends
can fend for themselves.

339
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,064
You applied for diplomatic immunity,
knowing I'd hear about it.

340
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,058
And come for you.

341
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,351
I wanted the knife.

342
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,986
But not for the reason you think.

343
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:15,368
It's been ages
since I first held this dagger.

344
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,080
It was given to me
moments after I was bathed

345
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,407
in the Lazarus Pit.

346
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,536
Submerged in the waters.

347
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:38,013
Suspended between life and death.

348
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,435
I saw a vision of you,

349
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,105
my heir.

350
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,477
You're insane.

351
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,192
I'm not your heir.
I don't even understand

352
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,271
what that means.

353
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,450
It means that you are the only one

354
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,241
who can end my suffering.

355
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:03,992
Please.

356
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,129
You want me to kill you?

357
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,708
Set me free.

358
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,179
Well, thanks for the snack, big guy.

359
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,182
But it's been an emotional day.

360
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:29,726
Gotta go.

361
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,984
Not this again, come on!

362
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,117
I've told you,
I'm better off on my own

363
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,656
and you are, too.

364
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,033
So let go!

365
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,906
Let go!

366
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,198
Hey, freak.

367
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,576
I knew we'd find you.

368
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,540
And it looks like you got a friend.

369
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,169
I assure you, we are not friends.

370
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,675
Get 'em. Both of 'em.

371
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,877
No, no!

372
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,805
Grundy!

373
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,103
Hot! Hot!

374
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,736
Grundy friend, help!

375
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,148
Don't leave. No. Help!

376
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,451
Help. Hot. Hot!

377
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,070
Hot!

378
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,331
Grundy friend not dumb.

379
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,163
Grundy friend...

380
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,332
smart.

381
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,833
Oh, yes.

382
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,048
Yeah, you're right.

383
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,759
Water beats fire.

384
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,386
That was smart.

385
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,510
Oh, boy.

386
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,263
I can't breathe.

387
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,861
Oswald.

388
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,948
- They said this is their best table.
- Interesting choice.

389
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,042
Are you sure it's not too intimate?

390
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,379
The point was to get the word out
that the Falcones support me.

391
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,707
Don't worry. People will talk.

392
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,255
I chose this place because
I heard your mother is Hungarian.

393
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,132
I thought you might like
a taste of home.

394
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,201
I can assure you, Oswald,
I'm not here to poison you.

395
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,407
Perhaps.

396
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,080
Well, the chef likes to go heavy
on the paprika, doesn't he?

397
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,295
How is the food otherwise?

398
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,505
Serviceable.

399
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:08,101
Well, I'm stuffed. Thank you so much
for meeting me, Miss Falcone.

400
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,099
And thank you to your family
for their support.

401
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,392
You can't leave
until you've tried the goulash.

402
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,775
If it's anything like
the chicken paprika, I'll pass.

403
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,067
It's a house specialty.

404
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,696
My mother made goulash.

405
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,248
Brought the recipe from Budapest.

406
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,000
Handed down through her family
for 300 years.

407
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,876
I doubt this will hold a candle.

408
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,820
- I'm leaving.
- Oswald.

409
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,610
Oswald!

410
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,371
It took me forever
to find his mother's recipe.

411
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,952
Did you follow it exactly?

412
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,330
I followed the recipe to a T.

413
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,457
The little man didn't like?

414
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,335
Honestly, I don't know.

415
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,017
How long have you worked here?

416
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,553
Two years, thereabouts.

417
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,855
I was in Blackgate for a time.

418
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,224
- We must not have overlapped.
- Yeah?

419
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,936
- As a guard?
- As a prisoner.

420
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,354
Oh, yeah.

421
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,730
Heard about that.

422
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,700
Is there a reason why you're not
taking us through maximum security?

423
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,945
Prisoners are in the yard
this time of day.

424
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,872
Been some changes
since you were here.

425
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,961
McCloskey? That's funny.

426
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,248
I know another J. McCloskey
who works here.

427
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,011
My cousin. Gets confusing sometimes.

428
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,344
All right. Let's go,
through this door.

429
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,184
I've got to say, mate, I really love
what you've done with the old place.

430
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,435
However, I've got a question for you.

431
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,097
Yeah?

432
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,936
Where are the real guards?

433
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,375
Where is Bruce Wayne?

434
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,829
- Ra's al Ghul has plans for the boy.
- Where is he?

435
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,122
You'll never find him.

436
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,254
Oh, you underestimate
my resolve, pal.

437
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,259
Well, at least we know Bruce is here.

438
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,260
Well, we've walked the floor.
Where could he be?

439
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,470
There's the yard.

440
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,642
The tower, but they're too public.

441
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,476
There's a sub-basement.
Accessible by the service elevator.

442
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,643
Which way?

443
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:22,787
God.

444
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,207
Who did I tell you, specifically,
not to let in here?

445
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,343
Miss Falcone is here to see you, sir.

446
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,973
I'm sorry, Oswald.
I'm not sure what upset you, but...

447
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,050
Enough!

448
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,062
Did you think I would really believe
this was all some coincidence?

449
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,771
That goulash tasted exactly
like my mother used to make.

450
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,686
You can't fault me
for the restaurant's authenticity.

451
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,071
You're buttering me up.

452
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,856
But for what?

453
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,821
Is it so hard to believe that

454
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,199
someone would want to do
something nice for you?

455
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,825
There was only one person
in my whole life

456
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,374
who ever did things for me
without wanting something in return.

457
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,369
And that was my mother.

458
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,336
Then I envy you.

459
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,667
My father never helped anyone
unless it benefited him.

460
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,802
And eventually, it drove away
everyone who loved him.

461
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,513
Go. I'll decide
what to do with you later.

462
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,105
- Oswald, I only want to help you.
- Oh, you wanna help?

463
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,393
Try leaving.

464
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,063
Your foot.

465
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,406
It's just the weather.

466
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,117
What are you doing?

467
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,455
- Don't.
- It's okay.

468
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,756
And I won't judge.

469
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,691
When I was a child, I broke my ankle
while playing with my cousins.

470
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,530
I was desperate. Crying in pain.

471
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,498
My father told me to put ice on it.

472
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,118
Toughen up, stop with the tears.

473
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,209
But my mother went with me
to the hospital.

474
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,924
And on the way, she told me

475
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,423
that cold
actually increases the pain.

476
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,639
What's needed is warmth.

477
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,470
My mother.

478
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,060
She used to sing.

479
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,466
This may be hard
for you to understand.

480
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:19,089
But I have walked this earth
for centuries...

481
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,799
waiting for you, Bruce.

482
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,889
Only you can kill me,

483
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,392
and only with that dagger.

484
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,190
That is my curse.

485
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,022
That is the meaning of my vision.

486
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,775
I don't believe you.

487
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,572
- Believe me.
- This is just another manipulation.

488
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:42,945
See.

489
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,739
Look.

490
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,784
My true form.

491
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,089
Every moment of my life is agony.

492
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,968
End my suffering.

493
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,798
Whatever your curse is,

494
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,264
you deserve it for what you've done.

495
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,771
You're angry, Bruce. I understand.

496
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,098
But unless you strike me down

497
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,229
with that blade,
you will never be free.

498
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,310
No!

499
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,521
I won't.

500
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,360
Then allow me to tell you
what will happen...

501
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,738
if you don't kill me.

502
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,909
I will disappear.

503
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,336
And let you live your life.

504
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,501
You will follow the path of light.

505
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,796
Grow into a fine man.
Become a husband.

506
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,256
A father.

507
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,011
There may be a day when you forget

508
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,054
I ever existed.

509
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,485
But then, I will return.

510
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,566
And I will kill everyone you love.

511
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,111
Just as you watched your parents die.

512
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,873
Just as you watched me
slice your friend's throat,

513
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:16,085
I will slaughter your wife
and children before your very eyes

514
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,758
and there will be nothing
you can do about it.

515
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,380
Die.

516
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,110
Yes.

517
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,823
Are you going to arrest me?

518
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,405
For what?

519
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,950
For murder.

520
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,252
I don't know what
I just saw in there.

521
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,787
But as far as I'm concerned,

522
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,920
Ra's al Ghul's men
broke into Blackgate and he escaped.

523
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,637
I betrayed myself,
and my parents' memory.

524
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,720
I took a life.

525
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,306
I did exactly what Ra's said I would.

526
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,689
Just because you know
you're capable of doing something

527
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,357
doesn't mean it has to happen again.

528
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,646
Bruce, you and I have known
each other a long time.

529
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,740
Since the night your parents
were murdered.

530
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,406
Now you may not feel like
you're that kid anymore,

531
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,782
but I know that you are.

532
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:13,823
One who believes in doing good,

533
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,492
and fighting for what's right,

534
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,088
who will do anything
to keep the people he loves safe.

535
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:27,052
Nothing that happened today
changes that.

536
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,809
What are you doing?

537
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,519
You said it yourself.

538
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,563
It's over.

539
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,191
No.

540
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,156
- Can't let you do that, Master Bruce.
- Alfred.

541
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,492
Listen, we started
this vigilante caper

542
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,824
to prepare for Ra's return,
didn't we?

543
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,914
It's become so much bigger than that.

544
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,255
I see that now, I mean,
I was wrong and you were right.

545
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,379
You can make a difference.

546
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,138
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

547
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,886
I made that decision
the moment I killed Ra's al Ghul.

548
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,768
I took the dark path.

549
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,560
Yes, you did.

550
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,193
And it's gonna be a long,
bumpy journey back.

551
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:34,654
But I believe in you, Master Bruce.
I always have and I... I always will.

552
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,158
And I understand
that you don't feel worthy now.

553
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,791
But when you do, this...

554
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,924
this will be waiting for you.

555
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,546
As will I, sir.

556
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,652
These guys that attacked us,

557
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,704
they didn't even have five bucks
between them.

558
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,911
We need a new plan.

559
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,788
What?

560
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,957
Truth.

561
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,461
Grundy friend know...

562
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,296
Grundy?

563
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,557
You deserve to know...

564
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,927
you and I,

565
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,017
were the very best of friends.

566
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,230
And then something happened to you

567
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,729
and I just didn't recognize you.

568
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,361
But what is important
is that with your muscles,

569
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,234
we can make money.

570
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,242
And with money,
we can make me smart again.

571
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,115
And then we'll figure out
what happened to you.

572
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,793
Just trust me, okay?

573
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,457
Grundy, come on.

574
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,728
Yeah, come on!

575
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,337
What is this? A knitting circle?
Let's see some blood!

576
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,248
Hey, I'm looking for the person
in charge here.

577
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:53,875
You're looking at her.

578
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,344
What do you want, squirt?

579
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,383
Well, if there's money to be had,
we'd like to put our hat in the ring.

580
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,427
And who are you?

581
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,099
I'm... Hey!

582
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,388
Come back.

583
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,066
I'm this fine gentleman's manager.

584
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,982
Trust me, he's a monster.

585
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,857
Well, more grist for the mill.

586
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,570
We'll get you patched up.
Then we'll talk.

587
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:23,572
Hey!

588
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,282
Go get the doc.

589
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,495
All right. One, two, three.

590
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,424
Hey, doc! Cherry wants you
to come look at some new guy.

591
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,506
I'll be right there.
