1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,580
- Have you heard they started their bus already?
- No?

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,540
One month into high school
and they started a bus.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,060
Ingrid... I miss you.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,500
You look like a slut.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,860
She seemed cool.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,780
Maybe I can get a friend of yours?

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,150
You invited people to a cabin trip
that was supposed to be just us.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,940
Two guys?!

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,500
- Can I see your messages, then?
- I already told you it's ridiculous!

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,160
Why don't you just trust me?

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
SHAME

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,240
SATURDAY, 5:11 P.M.

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,420
- I'll call you later, okay?
- Yeah.

14
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,860
Eva... I'm sorry.

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,020
If I knew how important this cabin trip
was for you, I wouldn't have invited the guys.

16
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,500
I didn't know
it wasn't that important to you.

17
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,180
It was important to me!

18
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,780
But...

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,300
It's important to me to
also spend time with my friends.

20
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,180
It used to be important to you, too.

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,660
It is important to me.

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,460
But it's not important to me to
spend time with your friends.

23
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,590
I said you could bring friends!

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,820
- Can't you just--
- Get some friends?

25
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,820
That's not what I meant.

26
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,980
But it's what you're thinking.

27
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,340
I don't know what the right answer is.

28
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,700
Just be completely honest.

29
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,380
Completely honest?

30
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,460
Eva, you are the coolest girl I know.

31
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,500
You're pretty, sweet, smart, and funny.

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,980
But...

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,940
I don't know what the problem is.

34
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,420
You have to find new friends!

35
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,780
Get yourself new friends!

36
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,460
Anyone who gets to be your friend
is really lucky.

37
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,440
- Don't know what to say, huh?
- I nailed it.

38
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,460
You nailed it.

39
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,250
Hope you had a nice trip!
Love you! Mom.

40
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,040
Noora has accepted your friend request.

41
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:16,590
Congratulations on having me as a friend!

42
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,000
Hey girl!

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,230

Hey girl! What's u

Hey girl! What's up

52
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,370
Hey girl! What's up?

53
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,710
Hey girl! What's up?

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:09,830
Hi, is what I meant. Wanted to write "Hi", but then

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,050
Hi, is what I meant. Wanted to write "Hi", but then

I pressed the send button and so it was just "H". Haha.

101
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,270
MONDAY, 10:29 A.M.

102
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,140
Hey.

103
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,300
How are you doing?

104
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,140
I'll sit here, then.

105
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,460
Hi. Or... H?

106
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,180
H. H.

107
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,580
- Did we have homework over the autumn break?
- Yes.

108
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,900
- Fuck!
- Eva?

109
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,060
What does the main character of this story do?

110
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,480
She feels alone.

111
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,180
Noora, I don't want you to respond for Eva.

112
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,350
She hadn't found her homework yet.

113
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,240
I was just helping. You asked it the wrong way.

114
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,590
The right way would be:

115
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,840
What are the main characters of the story like?

116
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,980
You're right. I'm sorry!

117
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,360
- I lived in Madrid.
- Okay, okay.

118
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,300
That's why I don't have friends. In Oslo.

119
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,420
Oh.

120
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,060
So what's your excuse?

121
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,860
Strong body odor.

122
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,000
...I got it, listen. "Cultural relativism..."

123
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,590
TUESDAY, 11:50 A.M.

124
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,380
- How did you pronounce it?
- Yeah, "cultural relavitism".

125
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,100
- No, it's not "relavitism", it's "relativism".
- Oh, yeah.

126
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,740
You should have gotten a 6, but you got a 5.
You're not so damn smart after all.

127
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,740
- Hi! Thanks for last time.
- Hi!

128
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,900
I can't remember if I greeted you properly.
I was a bit out of it.

129
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,580
- Vilde.
- Eva.

130
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,660
I just wanted to say that
it was so nice of you to help me!

131
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,740
No, no. It was nothing!

132
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,990
We were wondering
if you're already on a russ bus?

133
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,170
- No.
- That's perfect!

134
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,930
We just formed a completely new bus group,
and we really want you to join.

135
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,200
I don't know, I haven't really started
thinking about russ time.

136
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,580
It's pretty important to think about it,
if you want to be on a bus.

137
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,070
I don't know what it's like in Trondheim,

138
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,180
but here in Oslo
you have to start planning really early,

139
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,660
otherwise you end up on a bad bus,
or you have to be a walking russ.

140
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,260
Being a russ is not
just about russ time,

141
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,820
it's also about being social
and coming together.

142
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,780
Yes, think of it a like a sect, right?
Once you're in, you can't get out.

143
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,600
It all ends in a collective suicide
in a hookup ring at Tryvann,

144
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,260
on the night of the 17th of May in 2018.

145
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,690
She's just joking.

146
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,550
Would you like to join a bus meeting?
Friday, after school.

147
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,140
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Yeah?

148
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,580
That's so cool!
If you have any friends, just take them with you!

149
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,660
- I can ask around.
- See you later, then.

150
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,220
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

151
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,860
She was sucking on that spoon,
and looking him straight in the eyes.

152
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,380
- Chris?
- Yes!

153
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,980
Who is she?

154
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,800
THURSDAY, 2:02 P.M.

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,980
H. As in, "Have you got a drug problem?"

156
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,500
Or H as in, "Have you got any plans for Friday?"

157
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,060
Hi!

158
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
Hi.

159
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,820
- Vilde, this is Noora.
- Hi.

160
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,700
- I was going to ask if you talked to Chris?
- No.

161
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,540
We can't have the bus meeting at hers,
her mom is having a wine reception.

162
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,490
And we can't have it at mine,
because it's too much stress.

163
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,740
- So I was wondering if we can do it at yours?
- My place?

164
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,220
Yes! But how many are coming?

165
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,290
- Do you want to join?
- For what?

166
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,520
- Bus meeting.
- Bus... meeting, what?

167
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,900
We're going to make the world's coolest russ bus.
Do you want to join?

168
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,530
No.

169
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,940
- Then we'll be three.
- Hi, guys, say hi to Sana, she wants to join.

170
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,140
Yeah... how do you know each other?

171
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,020
We met at a Ramadan programme
in the mosque.

172
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,100
She's joking. We have German together.

173
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,820
- But you want to come to our bus meeting?
- Yes.

174
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,260
Yeah... is that okay, then?

175
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,300
- What's the problem?
- No…

176
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:42,260
Since you're Muslim, isn't it true that
Muslims aren't allowed to be russ?

177
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,300
No, it's punished by stoning.

178
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,060
- When is the meeting?
- Tomorrow. Who's hosting?

179
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,420
- Me.
- Just text me your address, so I can GPS it.

180
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,740
- Auf Wiedersehen!
- Auf Wiedersehen!

181
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,060
It means "see you later".

182
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,980
- She can't be on our bus.
- Why not?

183
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:17,660
- We'll give her a chance, she was really cool.
- We? You're not even on our bus.

184
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,620
- No, but if she's joining, so am I.
- Awesome!

185
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,580
Shit!

186
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,810
FRIDAY, 6:50 PM

187
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,410
We have a really big advantage
over the other bus groups.

188
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,130
I already bought a lot of toilet paper.

189
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,530
Vilde managed to buy toilet paper for
40,000 kroner with a credit card for another bus.

190
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,680
Anyway, we're left with a profit of
60,000 kroner. So I've made a budget.

191
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,180
According to this budget,

192
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,880
you need to make 50,000 kroner
in addition to the toilet paper sales.

193
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,580
So I need all of you to have an individual plan,
for how to make the rest of the money.

194
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,780
- What is it?
- We're wasting time on toilet paper.

195
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,630
No use having a budget
without enough people.

196
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,500
It's important that we
have a grip on the budget.

197
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,370
Listen,
we're the biggest losers at school.

198
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,980
If we don't want to end up in a loser van,
we need a strategy.

199
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,540
- We're not the biggest losers of the school!
- Weren't you thrown out of another bus?

200
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,300
- I wasn't exactly thrown out...
- Yes you were.

201
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,720
Listen, Hilde. It'll be really hard
to work together, if you're in denial.

202
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,100
Just acknowledge that we're losers?

203
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Do you think so yourself?

204
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,110
Hello?! I'm a Muslim girl
in this white, faithless, country.

205
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,230
I'm the biggest loser of them all.

206
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,100
- You talk really maturely.
- Thanks.

207
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,680
But what do you want us to do?

208
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:05,970
First, we need to get more girls for the bus.
Cool girls. How do we do that?

209
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,980
- Ask them?
- Wrong.

210
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,460
We ask no one. We want the cool girls to ask us.

211
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,920
But first,
we need to get something we don't have.

212
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,150
It's a four-letter word.

213
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,100
- "Spenn".
- Cred.

214
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,380
- "Spenn" has five letters, Chris.
- Do we know any '97 guys?

215
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,020
Okay, then we need to find out
which of the '97 guys have the best bus,

216
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,390
get ourselves invited to bus parties,
and get seats.

217
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,060
Any ideas on how we'll do that?

218
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,960
- You guys have to hook up with them.
- Are you serious?

219
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,300
- "You guys"?
- I'm not hooking up!

220
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,370
Okay, so we'll hook up.
What will you contribute?

221
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,020
Are you kidding me?

222
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,470
I'm saving your lame meeting
with a good, strategic plan,

223
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,560
and you're wondering what I'll contribute?

224
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,510
- Does anyone have a boyfriend?
- I do.

225
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,420
- How old is he?
- He's a '99.

226
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,780
- Dump him.
- You're not serious now?

227
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,780
She's the prettiest of us all.
It's a waste if she has a boyfriend.

228
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,020
But...

229
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,100
- Honestly, now. This is really stupid.
- What is?

230
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:33,180
You can't sit here asking us
to use our sexuality in exchange for cred!

231
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,540
- That's... you're crazy.
- No, I'm honest.

232
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,260
Norwegian girls exchange sex for
money, popularity, and affirmation every day.

233
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,540
You might not agree with that,
me neither.

234
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,220
But you can't pretend this is news to you.
It's your culture!

235
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,760
So if you think it's crazy,
I suggest you go out there and change it

236
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,250
instead of sitting here
criticizing it.

237
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,620
But it's a bit too much to ask Eva to
break up with her boyfriend.

238
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,100
It was a suggestion. If she loves her boyfriend,
then that has more weight than what I say.

239
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,340
She can think for herself, she's not a child.

240
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,910
I have a good feeling about this.
