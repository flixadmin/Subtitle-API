[Male narrator] Nowadays, the us
government can listen to anything you say.

4
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,094
They know where you are,
they know who you're talking to,

5
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:55,556
and trust me,
they know who you're fucking.

You turn on a cell phone or a computer,
and you're doomed.

But in Colombia in 1989,
it wasn't that easy.

8
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,901
First off,
there was no Internet.

9
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,402
No cells.

10
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,154
The best they had were satellite phones,

11
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:14,492
and in order to capture a satellite phone,
you had to fly directly over it.

12
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,871
On top of that, the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

13
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:21,332
The landowners, the politicians...

14
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,420
And lucky for us,
the narcos were richer than them all.

[Narrator] And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.

19
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,565
That's why back then, the us government
developed software that could identify

20
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,169
- the voices of our targets.
- [Indistinct chatter on headphones]

21
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:53,322
I got poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.

22
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:56,450
And you guessed it:
No GPS either.

Hammer, prepare to engage.

[Narrator] Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.

25
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:06,252
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

just told us where he's going.

Hammer, disengage.

37
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,202
So who do we give this to? DEA?

46
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:02,892
Got it.

47
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,603
He's meeting lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

48
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,690
[Steve] I would've loved
to go after poison myself,

49
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:13,110
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

50
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:17,198
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

Take Richard Nixon, for instance.

We thought he was one of the good guys.

And Nixon thought Chilean general pinochet
was a good guy

101

because he hated the commies.

And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

157
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,085
Welcome to Colombia

158
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,587
[cheers and applause]

159
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,299
Like goldilocks,
he had three options.

160
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,636
And pay attention, because all three
are important to this story.

161
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:25,519
The ochoa brothers:
Jorge, that's fabio on the horse.

162
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,314
- A typical Colombian smuggling family.
- [Chatter in Spanish]

163
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,817
- They were smart and rich...
- [Shouts] Salud!

164
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,070
But cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

165
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:39,908
Another possible partner
was José Rodriguez gacha,

166
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:43,787
nicknamed "the Mexican,"
for his love of Tequila and sombreros.

167
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,665
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

168
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:50,419
- [Up-tempo Latin music plays]
- [Indistinct chatter in Spanish]

169
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:57,134
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,
even by Colombian standards.

170
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,719
If you make it to the top...

171
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:03,181
- It means you've killed your enemies.
- [People screaming]

172
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,311
[In Spanish]
Hey, partner. What are you doing here?

173
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,146
[Steve]
And sometimes, your partners.

174
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,988
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made gacha too hard.

175
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:26,622
So he zeroed in on his third option:
A man cockroach knew would be just right.

176
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,458
[In Spanish]

177
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,712
[Steve]
Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

178
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,131
The man who would
change my life forever.

179
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,345
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

180
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,889
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,
you name it.

181
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,769
At the time,
Pablo owned half the police in medellin.

182
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,357
But das was Colombia's version of the FBI.

183
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,652
They didn't play by the same rules.

184
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,529
[Pablo speaking Spanish]
Good day.

185
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,573
Pablo Escobar?

186
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,075
Where's felipo?

187
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,202
Felipo's been arrested.

188
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,079
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

189
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,224
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

190
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,668
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- — shut the fuck up.

191
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,878
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.

192
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,546
Show some respect.

193
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,968
Now what's the problem,
Mr. Jose Luis?

194
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,055
How do you know my name?

195
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,307
You're colonel Jose Luis herrera.

196

And that's nacho ibarra.

197
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:39,069
There's Garcia, Lopez...

198
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,196
- Is that Pinilla?
- [Gustavo] Yes, Pinilla.

199
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,406
- That's Pinilla. — yeah.

200

Pinilla...

201
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,909
And with Phillipe is esparanza.

202

I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

203

I don't have all day.

Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.

207
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,349
Who the fuck do you think you are?

208
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,853
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

209
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,730
Because I pay for the privilege, colonel.

210
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,523
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

211
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,400
Where are your import papers?

212
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,737
You need papers for these TV sets.

[Chuckles]

214

Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
medellin police making a shit salary.

- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

216
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,332
It's for Carlitos.

What's she doing with a guy like you?

226
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,627
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?

drop off a few gifts?

- Yes, she's feeling better.

I'm going to tell you who I am.

can't move a finger in all of antioquia

One day, I'm going to be
president of the republic of Colombia.

in producing this exquisite white powder.

311
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,902
[Kevin] Listen, she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

312
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,655
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

313
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,283
[Snorts]
I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.

314
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,078
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

315
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,764
No, the other one.
Of course the blond one.

316
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,548
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

317
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,544
- You dicking me around?
- [Kevin laughs]

318
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,881
Fuck it, I'm going in.

319
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,192
- [Kevin] Go get her.
- [Man] Mm!

320
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,069
- [Kevin] Yup.
- [Man] Hey, while you're up there,

321
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,594
get us another pitcher, will ya?

322
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,806
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

323
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,724
[Men laughing]

324
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,935
[Women talking indistinctly]

325
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,317
How you doing?

326
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,153
Busy.

327
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,283
I just said, "look, if you don't
wanna be there, you don't have to be.

328
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,578
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So, I don't know... [indistinct]

329
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,080
[Men cackling]

330
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,625
[Steve]
Yeah, those bastards got me.

331
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,044
But I couldn't let it end like that.

332
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,964
Excuse me. [Clears throat]
See those guys over there?

333
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,550
Uh, they're fucking with me.

334
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,095
Telling me you were checking out my ass,
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?

335
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,430
You're a cop?

336
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,849
Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.

337
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,100
Drug enforcement?

338
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,186
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

339
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,564
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?
[Clears throat]

340
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,233
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you, uh...

341
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,027
Give me your phone number?

342
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,446
How about a fake number?

343
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,531
That'll work.

344
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,075
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?

345
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,163
[Sighs]

346
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,343
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

347
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,845
Have a good night.

348
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,226
- [Kevin] Aah...
- [Men laughing]

349
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,477
[Kevin] Shot down!

350
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,314
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh, I...

351
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,543
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

352
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,945
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

353
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,489
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... gimme that.

354
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,241
How much did that cost you?

355
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,451
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

356
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,083
[Dial tone]

357
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,544
- [Dialing number]
- [Steve] I figured, what the hell.

358
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:01,047
Worst that could happen,
I'd wake up some grandmother in boca.

359
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,300
[Line ringing]

360
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,638
Hello?

361
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,599
So it wasn't a fake.

362
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:14,143
I thought you might figure it out.

363
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,646
After all, you're DEA.

364
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,108
[Steve]
And just like that... she had me.

365
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:26,573
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,

366
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,449
cocaine had him.

367
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,870
[In Spanish] It's been a while.

368
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,540
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

369
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,043
Would you like a little coffee?

370
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,753
Yeah, a coffee?

371
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:41,838
Yes, a coffee.

372
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,041
- How about you, Pablo?
- No.

373
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,632
[Cockroach] You sure?

374
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:48,845
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

375
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:53,808
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

376
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,562
Little magic leaves.

377
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,399
[Man] The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

378
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:07,447
[Cockroach] Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

379
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,619
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

380
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:16,706
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

381
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,625
Let it dry, dry, dry.

382
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,460
[Man]
You use ammonia to get the paste.

383
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:26,090
[Cockroach] And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

384
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,426
Here is the prize.

385
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,928
It's like the kitchen in your house.

386
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:35,016
Like baking a cake.
[Clears throat]

387
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,020
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

388
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,105
[Chuckling]

389
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,316
Look, an old press, an antique.

390
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,907
Now we put it in the oven.

391
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,618
Here's one.
The other will follow.

392
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,788
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

393
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,040
[Gustavo] Well...

394
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,586
- We'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

395
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,881
- No.
- [Man] You said a kilo.

396
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,383
We'll take five.

397
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:12,387
[Softly]
How do we get five across the border?

398
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,347
That's Gustavo's department.

399
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,063
[Man]
This one has got a good engine.

400
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,833
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

401
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,068
would be under the rear wheel well.

402
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,278
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

403
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,697
Is this easy to take off?

404
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,491
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

405
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,952
All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.

406
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,996
- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.

407
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,667
All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

408
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,919
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

409
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:50,174
Because there are four wheel Wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

410
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,528
- For three cars, that's 60 kilos.
- [Pablo counting softly]

411
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:55,888
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram, what?

412
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,515
$9,000 per kilo.

413
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:00,143
$9,000 times 60...
The profit is $540,000.

414
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,437
- [Laughing]
- That's it!

415
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,400
- Do you know how to drive, cockroach?
- — yeah.

416
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,199
- Ok, Pablo and I drive fast.
- — [chuckling]

417
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:10,111
[Steve]
That's half a million dollars... per trip,

418
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:13,322
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

419
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,910
Easiest money he ever made.

420
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,169
Back in medellin,
Pablo didn't waste any time.

421
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,920
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

422
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:33,050
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

423
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,887
[In Spanish]
How are you feeling, Gustavo?

424
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,474
All this smells like shit to me.

425
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:43,102
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

426
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,521
The stinkier, the better.

427
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:47,440
All right.

428
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,276
What about all these lights?

429
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,363
Is that to tip off the cops,
or what?

430
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:58,785
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

431
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,788
I'm the artist here, clear?

432
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,080
Clear.

433
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,208
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

434
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:09,670
[Steve] It was a mom-and-pop operation,
so small they called it the kitchen.

435
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:13,508
But make no mistake,
it would change medellin forever.

436
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,052
[In Spanish] You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

437
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,848
[Exhales]

438
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,520
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

439
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,316
[Inhales deeply]

440
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,874
[Voice strains]
Let's build them a chimney.

441
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,031
- [Sputtering]
- 

442
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,118
- there you go.
- [Laughing]

443
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,122
[Gustavo]
Gentlemen, the first three?

444
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:48,668
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

445
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,831
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

446
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:54,131
- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.

447
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,718
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

448
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,922
[Gustavo] I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

449
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,936
[Steve] Like her son, Pablo's mother
hermilda was very resourceful.

450
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:11,148
[Pablo speaking Spanish] Hey, mom,
how much do you think we can fit in there?

451
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:14,652
- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

452
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,153
Trust me, pablito.

453
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,197
I love it. Let's do it.

454
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,203
- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.

455
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,164
[Knocking at door]

456
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:28,541
It's Gustavo.

457
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,751
Five kilos, right?

458
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:34,380
[Steve] Pablo loved his young bride tata,
and she loved him.

459
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,883
He was a family man till the end.

460
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:40,136
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the lion.

461
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,059
- Meet my friend.
- — hello, how are you doing?

462
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,264
Hey, Pablo, this is lion.

463
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,535
[Steve] He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

464
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,954
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich, right?

465
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,980
Pablo Escobar gaviria.
How are you?

466
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,607
- Lion.
- — pleased to meet you, lion.

467
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,941
Here's three.

468
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,652
We're going to need two more,
right, mom?

469
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,529
- [Hermilda] That's right.
- Pablito...

470
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:01,032
Make sure it is not you
who wears it, ok?

471
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:04,368
Look, my love...
It won't fit me. [Chuckles]

472
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,203
Try it on.

473
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,496
Come here.

474
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,875
Good, right?

475
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,840
- Two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!

476
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,383
Three.

477
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,093
[Sighs]

478
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,220
- Two more.
- — got it. I'll be right back.

479
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:24,972
He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?

480
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,934
[Hermilda] Listen, lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

481
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:31,604
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

482
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,189
- Aah! — listen to this guy.

483
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,358
He looks very handsome, son.

484
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,777
- Like a fag model, isn't that right?
- — [chuckles]

485
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:42,782
[Steve] The lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

486
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,203
Welcome to the United States.

487
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,956
Thank you. Have a great day.

488
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:50,915
Next, please.

489
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,794
[Steve] His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos lehder,

490
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:59,757
half Colombian, half German,
and 100 percent playboy.

491
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,135
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

492
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:05,012
Go figure.

493
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:09,016
Back in '79, this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

494
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,685
on a fleet of small planes.

495
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,687
- [In Spanish] What's up?
- What's up, son?

496
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,814
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

497
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,417
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

498
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,069
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

499
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,529
You like my jacket, brother?

500
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,740
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

501
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,370
I was in jail for a while, remember?

502
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:33,499
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

503
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,377
What you got there
is the perfect product.

504
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,921
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

505
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,841
[Laughs] It's gonna fuck up their brains,
that's for sure.

506
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:42,967
Yes, sir.

507
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:47,847
Here you go.

508
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,434
Go on. There are five kilos.

509
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,269
Where are you going?

510
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,938
I'm gonna get anotherjacket,
brother.

511
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,357
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

512
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:05,239
[Steve] The lion made more than 20 flights
between medellin and Miami.

513
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,616
Drugs in, cash out.

514
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:10,953
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

515
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:14,498
And in no time,
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

516
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,169
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes,

517
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,629
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

518
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,716
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

519
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,344
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

520
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,889
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

521
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:33,768
Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,
going back and forth every day...

522
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:37,938
You do the math.
No way the lion could transport it all.

523
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,399
Pretty soon,
the lion had to come up with new ways

524
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,568
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

525
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,279
[In Spanish]
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

526
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,865
You guys are pilots,

527
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:51,327
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

528
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,249
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

529
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,294
We'll take four.

530
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,837
All right, much better.

531
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:06,634
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

532
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,762
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

533
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,388
- See you later.
- Later.

534
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,100
Come in, please.

535
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,982
Look, here are the packets.

536
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:25,653
You take a packet...
You dip it in the oil and swallow it.

537
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,029
Easy, right?

538
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,657
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

539
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,825
All right?

540
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:32,993
But with you two,
we have a problem.

541
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,995
You girls are pregnant, right?

542
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,708
That's good, because us customs
won't search pregnant women.

543
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:44,630
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

544
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,842
And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

545
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:50,386
All right? All right. Perfect.

546
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,306
[Steve] During the early '808,
most flights out of Bogota'

547
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,225
had several mules on them.

548
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,394
They didn't even know about each other.

549
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,062
And you know what?

550
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:04,275
Getting in was easy, because nobody
worried about cocaine in america.

551
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,318
All we cared about was grass.

552
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,321
[Clucking]

553
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:13,909
Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

554
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:18,038
Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...
Anything.

555
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,099
But even that didn't do it.

556
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:42,438
The real game changer was filling
lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

557
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,651
[In Spanish]
Do you trust this guy?

558
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:50,321
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

559
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:53,490
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.

560
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,201
But he's got good routes.

561
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,915
- Amigos!
- [Gustavo] Hello, Carlos.

562
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,374
Gustavo gaviria,
nice to meet you.

563
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,709
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

564
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,632
Pablo Emilio Escobar gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

565
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,714
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

566
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,299
Smooth.

567
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,634
Let's get down to business.

568
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:15,596
The lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

569
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,933
- That's true.
- — about how much per flight?

570
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,727
- How far?
- Miami.

571
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,895
[Sighs]

572
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,192
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- — [Gustavo] 1000 kilos?

573
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,027
Counting the gasoline.

574
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:39,954
Carlos...

575
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:41,956
[Carlos] Yes?

576
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:49,380
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

577
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:53,259
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

578
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,094
We'll leave the engine, right?

579
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:57,888
- How much more? — [chuckles]

580
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,391
About... 300 more.

581
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:05,437
All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

582
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,865
[Steve]
Within months after meeting cockroach,

583
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:15,030
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to america.

584
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:19,702
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics, folks.

585
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:23,872
Then Pablo closed the kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

586
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,457
in the middle of the jungle.

587
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:30,504
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest,

588
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:35,592
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

589
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:39,513
[Clanging]

590
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,890
[In Spanish]
We brought you a little present.

591
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,767
- [Chatter in Spanish]
- [Woman laughs]

592
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,269
[Pablo] Brazilians.

593
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:50,149
Best asses in the world,
believe me.

594
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,735
No, I'm not feeling well.

595
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,361
- What's up, cuca?
- Hello.

596
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,322
Hey, Gustavo.

597
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,783
What the fuck is up with you guys?

598
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,536
You're flying around in planes...

599
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,913
- While I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look, cuca...

600
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,666
Look, let us explain what we have to—-

601
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,418
wait.

602
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,796
From now on,
in all of my labs...

603
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,468
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning, with a pool...

604
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,030
- [Gustavo] And whores from Brazil.
- And whores from Brazil.

605
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:22,473
- Just for you.
- One problem.

606
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:26,477
These are my labs. Mm?

607
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:36,570
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

608
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,073
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

609
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:42,409
[Steve] Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

610
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:46,163
They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.

611
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:49,458
Guys used to getting what they want,
one way or another.

612
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:53,253
[In Spanish] How something like this
can make so much money!

613
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:57,508
Now I ask myself...
If I should get involved with this.

614
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,551
What do you think, Pablo?

615
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,012
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

616
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,764
I wouldn't get involved.

617
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:07,101
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

618
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,436
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

619
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,899
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

620
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,902
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

621
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:20,697
the Peruvians will raise the price.

622
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,701
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

623
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:28,205
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

624
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:33,043
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

625
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:37,506
You need a lot of creativity for that.

626
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:41,760
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

627
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:45,639
You deliver the product to me, labeled.

628
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,268
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

629
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,937
Better yet, lehder will do it.

630
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,107
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,

631
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,695
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

632
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,613
The potato business is ours.
We don't need-...

634
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,164
Sounds good to me.

635
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,627
All right,
I will create my own routes

636
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:19,256

[Steve] When istarted, a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

646
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:05,719
And before long,
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

647
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:11,266
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

648

Truth is,
we weren't even making a dent.

649

They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

Pablo's coke flooded in.

It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

And with the money...

Came the violence.

The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians,

and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

In the case of
the state of Florida v. Juan Diego Diaz,

795
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:02,227
after taking into account
all due considerations,

796
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:07,523

or a bond of $200,000.

[Slams gavel]

798
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:12,195
[Steve] I got to the courthouse early
the day of la quica's trial.

799
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:15,365
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

800
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:21,037
The us district attorney said la quica
met his bail of two million dollars,

801
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,833
paid by a wire transfer from, well...
Why don't you take a guess?

802
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:30,380
La quica boarded
and was back in medellin by midnight.

803
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:39,514
From '79 to '84,
there were 3,245 murders in Miami.

804
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,809
And outside the tourist bureau
and the cops,

805
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,311
no one much cared about that.

806
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,857
What got the us government
to take notice was the money.

807
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:54,487
Billions of dollars a year,
all flowing from the us to Colombia.

808
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:58,574
And that... america couldn't take.

809
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,414
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

810
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:08,668
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

811
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:14,048
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

812
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:17,552
Whatever it was, the businessmen
came at just the right time.

It's back-to-school time
for america's children...

814
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:23,933
[Steve] It was time for america
to suit up against a new enemy.

815
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,186
Drugs are menacing our society.

816
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,815
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

They're killing our children.

[Steve] It was classic Reagan.

He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

But it was Nancy who stole the show.

So to my young friends out there,
life can be great.

But not when you can't see it.

as a precious gift to his children.

Just say no.

During his career,
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

But I wouldn't learn that fill later.

My dad volunteered to fight
in world war ii because of Pearl harbor.

But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

No way.

He was a West Virginia farm boy,
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,564
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

It was his duty.

I've learned in the narco world,

it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

They're relative concepts.
