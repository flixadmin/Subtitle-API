1
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,480
There's a big gap.

2
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,480
This feels like the only route.
Let's keep going.

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
You okay?

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,680
It's all right, kid. Never be easy.

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Okay.

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
- One, two, three!
- Be careful.

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
You okay?

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Okay.

9
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,200
- Oh, my god.
- Never better.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
Okay.

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,360
- Whoa... whoa, you're good.
- Shit.

12
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,560
You're good. Yeah?

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
You're good?

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,440
- No.
- Okay, you've done

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,040
way scarier than this.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,760
Remember A.J. Hackett, Snake Dike.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,520
Stupid singing competition.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,040
God, you married this sad sack,
for Christ's sake.

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,680
- Yeah? Okay.
- Okay.

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
One, two...

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,400
three! Come on!

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
I got you.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,560
That's my girl.

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,760
Ew! Gross!

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,880
You guys, get a room!

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
Here comes Ethan Hunt.

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,560
Careful, H, there's loose rock
around the elbow.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,680
Worry about your ropes, bitches.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
I'm fine.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,680
Try to keep up!

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,200
Taking your time there, hotshot.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
Hunter, you show off!

33
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Dan!

34
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,720
Hold on, Dan. Hold on, I'm coming.

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Dan, are you okay?

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
Just hold on. I'm coming down.

37
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,600
Come on. Come on.

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,560
- I can't make it.
- Oh, my god.

39
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,760
Okay, Becky, Becky.

40
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,896
I just need a little more length.

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,600
Can you un-clip? Are you secure?

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,640
- Are you secure?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,400
Okay. Just un-clip and
I'll be able to swing to the rock.

45
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,000
- Okay.
- I think I can reach it.

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Ready?

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,120
- Can you reach it?
- Just...

48
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,240
just one second.

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,776
All right. I think I can make it.

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Hold on, Dan.

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,496
- I'm almost there.
- Just need a little more momentum.

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Okay.

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
No!

54
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Dan!

55
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,760
<i>Hey! This is Becky and Dan.
Leave a message.</i>

56
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,760
<i>Hey, Becky, it's me.</i>

57
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,560
<i>Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.</i>

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
<i>But I...</i>

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,520
<i>I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.</i>

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,680
<i>Sweetheart, I'm worried about you.</i>

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,400
<i>So whenever you stop hating on me</i>

62
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,760
<i>I am here.</i>

63
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,880
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

64
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,880
<i>This is just the voice mail.
You've reached Dan.</i>

65
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
<i>Just leave a message,
I'll hit you back when I can.</i>

66
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,640
<i>Get it off at the beep.</i>

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Hey.

68
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,840
Miss you.

69
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,200
Dad, what? Are you stalking me now?

70
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,480
No, I just don't know what else to do

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,936
'cause you're not
answering your phone.

72
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,200
- Take a hint.
- I think

73
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,696
this is getting
a little bit ridiculous.

74
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,920
"Ridiculous"?

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
You told me I shouldn't
be so broken up about him

76
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,120
because he was an asshole.

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,920
No. I said that
maybe he didn't belong

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
on this pedestal
that you were putting him up on

79
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,920
that he wasn't this martyr that
you've been making him out to be.

80
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,560
This is how you console
your daughter?

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,720
I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
I don't want to move on.

83
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,880
I miss him!

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,000
Every day, I miss
the way he looked at me.

85
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,560
I miss the way he made me feel.

86
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
- Sweetie.
- Don't!

87
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,920
Don't what? What do you think
you're doing, Becky?

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,496
- Getting away from you.
- You are not driving.

89
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,080
- Stop it.
- Fuck off!

90
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,280
You don't get
to talk to me like that.

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
Your mother and I,
we raised you better than that.

92
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,200
So getting shit-faced and pushing
the people away that love you

93
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,280
it's not gonna work.

94
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,120
All right, look,
a horrible thing happened to you

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,040
but you have to start
living your life again.

96
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,200
All right? There's a whole big
wide world out there that needs you

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,800
and believe it or not, I need you.

98
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,760
Let me give you a ride home.

99
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,200
I'd rather walk.

100
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,640
Let me ask you something.

101
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,480
If roles reversed, if it had been you
that had fallen that day

102
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
do you think
Dan is standing out here alone?

103
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,240
Drowning in booze, grief, sorrow,
whatever the hell this is?

104
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,200
He's not.

105
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,520
And you damn well know it.

106
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,000
God damn it, Becky,
I need you to try.

107
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,920
Do you know what I need, Dad?

108
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,680
I need you to leave me alone.

109
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
God damn it.

110
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,880
<i>The number you have called
has been disconnected.</i>

111
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,040
No!

112
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
No!

113
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,400
- Hi!
- Hey.

114
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,200
You look...

115
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,920
- Awful.
- Yeah.

116
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,200
Like really freakin' awful.
Well, come here.

117
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,040
So, what brings you back?

118
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,520
Are you finally ready to rest?

119
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,880
I'll rest when I'm dead.

120
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,800
I have something that's planned
and I need a partner in crime.

121
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,440
Look, your dad called me
a few weeks ago.

122
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
He didn't know who else to turn to

123
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,600
and he said that
you were in a bad place.

124
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,760
He had no right to do that.

125
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,080
He's worried about you.

126
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,880
It's coming up on a year.
He doesn't want you to be alone.

127
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,440
Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier

128
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,320
than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there

129
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,240
is my best friend stuck
in here with him.

130
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,600
So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

131
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,400
You're not gonna like it,
but just try to keep an open mind.

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Look.

133
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,200
The B-67 TV Tower.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
It's only a six-hour drive from here.

135
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,880
I was planning
on climbing it this weekend

136
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,920
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

137
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,680
It would be an adventure

138
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,920
like old times.

139
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,800
And you could scatter
Dan's ashes on top.

140
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,240
I just... I haven't climbed since...

141
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
I get it.

142
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,360
But if you don't confront your fears,
you are always going to be afraid.

143
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,440
What is it that Dan used to say?

144
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,440
"Don't... die if you wanna live

145
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,520
or keep living even if you're dying."

146
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,880
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

147
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,040
No, I'm sorry.

148
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,120
Hunter, I just... I can't.

149
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
It's like I know
I can't do it, I'm sorry.

150
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,800
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

151
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,000
- I can't.
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

152
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
It's okay.

153
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,040
Morning, Princess.

154
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
What's wrong?

155
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,320
"If you're scared of dying,
don't be afraid to live."

156
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,200
That's what Dan used to say.

157
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,480
Let's do it.

158
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,120
Let's climb your stupid tower.

159
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,680
Oh, my god, Becky,
baby, I'm so excited!

160
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,320
I've never actually seen this video.

161
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,680
Shit, I was really ripped.

162
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Yeah! You're awesome.

163
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

164
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,680
Holy shit! Look at your beaming face.

165
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,496
Now, who's this
in the photo with you?

166
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,040
I don't know. It's an oldie.

167
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,040
- Who is it?
- Nobody.

168
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
- Just give it back.
- Hunter has a boyfriend.

169
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,600
It's nothing. Just some guy.

170
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,160
That some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

171
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
<i>Yo, what's up, guys?
Danger D, and I'm back stateside, yo!</i>

172
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,800
<i>Hashtag, super badass.</i>

173
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,560
Okay, in my defense

174
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,840
I may act like a total dick
on camera, but it's worth it.

175
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,160
I get paid for this shit.

176
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,280
It's enough to keep me traveling
and you know me

177
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,120
I have to be doing dangerous shit
to keep my blood pumping

178
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,960
so I might as well monetize that.

179
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,520
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna be a YouTuber

180
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,520
why not be yourself?
You are awesome.

181
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
- Natural born clickbait.
- No.

182
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,000
What we're doing here,
this is clickbait.

183
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,360
Excuse me?

184
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,240
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?

185
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,360
Power ain't free, ma'am.

186
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, and do you know
where the B-67 TV Tower is?

187
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,280
We can't find it on the map.

188
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,320
You don't need a map.

189
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,040
You see that light way up there?

190
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,880
That's your tower.

191
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,400
That's insanely high.

192
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,936
What's with the light? I thought
you said it was out of commission.

193
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,440
So aircraft can see it.

194
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,400
You know, this was once
the tallest structure in the US.

195
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,120
Now it's just this old relic.

196
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,160
They're due
to tear it down next winter.

197
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Becky?

198
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,720
Becky?

199
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,400
- What?
- Give me your phone charger.

200
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
What are you doing?

201
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,320
A very cool life hack.

202
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,160
Now I'm just gonna line up the prongs
with the elements in the lamp. And...

203
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,520
How's that for a dumb YouTuber?

204
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Hey, honey.

205
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,920
Did you sleep well?

206
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,040
I love you.

207
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,920
You're not gonna say it back?

208
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,400
I am saying it.

209
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
One.

210
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
Four.

211
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Three.

212
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,160
I love you.

213
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,480
Hey, come on, Becks. Sun's up.

214
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,200
What up, El Capitan?

215
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't know, but something's up,
sports illustrated.

216
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
Tits for clicks.

217
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,480
Are you live streaming?

218
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,520
No, dude. Shoot now, post later.

219
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,920
Oh, good. I don't wanna be in it.

220
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,200
Hey, guys. Danger D here

221
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,920
and I have somebody
very special for you to meet.

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,200
Say hello, Becky C.

223
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,320
Hi.

224
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,480
And we have something totally
batshit crazy for you guys today.

225
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,360
The B-67 TV Tower.

226
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,600
This bad boy is over 2,000 feet tall.

227
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,920
And your homegirls are gonna
be climbing to the tippy, tippy top.

228
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
But don't worry, Becky C

229
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,400
- because you're safe with...
- Watch out!

230
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,480
Holy shit!

231
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,560
Eight more lives, baby!

232
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,920
Shit.

233
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,600
Looks like we're walking from here.

234
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,840
- How far?
- I don't know.

235
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,320
Like a mile?

236
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,400
Maybe two-ish?

237
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,680
Damn, it's hot.

238
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,000
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

239
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,456
We've got enough water, you think?

240
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,880
Water's check. Harnesses check.

241
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,440
Super badass 4k drone check.

242
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,320
Selfie stick, all the essentials.

243
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,400
- Food?
- Nah

244
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,776
we'll be back in time before lunch...

245
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Oh, Jesus.

246
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,120
Holy shit, they're big.

247
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,120
It's still alive.

248
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Get off of him!

249
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
- Hey, shoo! Hey, shoo!
- Go away!

250
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,240
Go! Just go. Go!

251
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,320
Poor thing.

252
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Pricks.

253
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,120
Survival of the fittest, right?

254
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,680
You'd do the same
if you were starving out here.

255
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
Feeling peckish.

256
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,800
- Hunter.
- What?

257
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
That's funny.

258
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Holy shit, 300 likes.

259
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Oh, wow.

260
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,480
350.

261
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,200
I wonder how many of your followers
are serial killers.

262
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,400
Holy shit.

263
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,760
Looks a lot bigger up close, right?

264
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,800
This is sick.

265
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,680
This is awful.

266
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Hey, guys!

267
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Danger D here.

268
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,920
And we are at the foot

269
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,080
of this stomach-churningly massive
fourth-highest structure in the US.

270
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,600
We 're gonna begin
our grueling journey

271
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,200
with an 1,800-foot ladder climb

272
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,120
inside a steel cage.

273
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
And then after the cage

274
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,600
we have a 200-foot, vertigo-inspiring
mast with an external ladder.

275
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,200
Your girl's gonna be wide open
to the elements.

276
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,600
And then beyond that,
we have the precipice.

277
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,880
The ledge. The top of the world, Ma.

278
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,000
Hunter?

279
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

280
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,120
Babe, of course you can.

281
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,040
No, I really can't. I'm, like...

282
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm petrified. I'm, like, shaking.

283
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm here.

284
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,320
Take a breath.

285
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,480
After Dan died,
I was afraid of my own shadow.

286
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,800
But I pushed through.

287
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,000
I overcame the fear. I took control.

288
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,120
Do not let this fear consume you.

289
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,240
Come at it head on and kick its ass.

290
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,320
If you can beat it,
you can beat anything.

291
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,200
And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.

292
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,280
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

293
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,400
So shut your shit and let's do this.

294
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
God, Hunter.

295
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,280
You know, that's the kind of shit
you should be posting on Instagram.

296
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Come on.

297
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
Dude, this is so cool.

298
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,200
Holy shit.

299
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,560
Look at this.

300
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,840
Damn it, Hunter.
You are such an asshole.

301
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,200
What are you getting us into?

302
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Don't worry.

303
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,600
We've got 50 feet of rope between us.

304
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,360
We're clipped in and we're all good.

305
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Okay.

306
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,320
One rung at a time,
and let me know if you have to rest.

307
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,560
Okay, okay.

308
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,080
See?

309
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,560
It's easy.

310
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,480
Sure.

311
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,880
You're doing great. Come on.

312
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You okay?

313
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
No.

314
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,200
You're doing great.

315
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Come on.

316
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Hunter?

317
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,920
- Hunter?
- Yeah?

318
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,640
Can we rest a moment?

319
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,080
I need a drink.

320
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,480
Of course.

321
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
Those guy lines means
we're halfway up.

322
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Perfect spot.

323
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,800
You wanna know something crazy?

324
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
What?

325
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,320
Halfway up.

326
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,000
That means we've climbed
about 1,000 feet.

327
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,800
So we've climbed
the height of the Eiffel Tower.

328
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Please don't say
shit like that, Hunter.

329
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,800
There's the motel. And the diner.

330
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,400
No way. Looks like a little toy town.

331
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,400
Let's just get this over with.

332
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Yeah.

333
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Come on. Catch up.

334
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
That's it.

335
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,720
Becky, you're doing amazing.

336
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Come on!

337
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,760
Come on, Becky!

338
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,960
Okay.

339
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,800
This is the end
of the internal ladder.

340
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,800
One step at a time, okay?
You got this.

341
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,800
The next 200 feet is external.

342
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,216
I'm not gonna lie.
It's gonna get a little bit crazy

343
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,120
when we're out of
the cage in the open.

344
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
But don't panic.

345
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,840
Hunter.

346
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Hunter!

347
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Hunter! Hunter!

348
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,400
Becky! You gotta come up.
It's so sick!

349
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Okay.

350
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Hunter?

351
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,400
I'm here. It's just like
200 feet more, that's all.

352
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,520
I can't!

353
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,560
Yes, you can!

354
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,200
Just look up and only up.

355
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,480
You're doing great. You got this.

356
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Okay.

357
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Okay.

358
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
Okay.

359
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah! You're killing it!

360
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,240
You're okay.

361
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,200
Remember, only look up.

362
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,800
What the hell are we doing?

363
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Hey!

364
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,480
Stop overthinking.

365
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,000
- How?
- I don't know.

366
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,880
Concentrate on
something else, like...

367
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,320
Sing a... a nursery rhyme
or some shit.

368
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,120
Okay, okay.

369
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,000
<i>Ring around the roses</i>

370
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,160
<i>Pocket full of posies</i>

371
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,520
<i>Ashes, ashes, we all fall down</i>

372
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
<i>Down</i>

373
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,560
I wouldn't have picked that one.

374
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Wow.

375
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,640
Okay. Okay, Becks

376
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,320
this is gonna look
a little bit worse than it is.

377
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,440
Ah, what the hell, Hunter?
Let's just go back down!

378
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,320
Becky, if I let you
go back now, fear wins.

379
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,680
And I'm not going to let that happen.

380
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
It's okay, Becks.

381
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
It's okay.

382
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,240
I've got your weight.

383
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,640
Thanks. Okay.

384
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,560
- Reach up. Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

385
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Okay.

386
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,000
Smooth as sailing to the top now.

387
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,200
You got this.

388
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,800
I actually really do
hate you, Hunter.

389
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,320
Hey, does this ladder
feel loose to you?

390
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,480
Stop, you dick, Hunter!

391
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Sorry.

392
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
What was that?

393
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,560
Come on, we're almost there.

394
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,800
- Come on.
- Okay.

395
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,136
Becky, you're not gonna believe this.
You gotta come up here.

396
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm coming. Okay.

397
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Okay.

398
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,160
Okay.

399
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Hunter.

400
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,000
Hey, trust me.

401
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,320
Okay, okay.

402
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,880
Fuck, Becky!

403
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,640
I'm here. Oh, my god.

404
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,520
Oh, my god.

405
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,680
We did it, Becks! I knew you could.

406
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Here we go!

407
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,800
On top of the goddamn world!

408
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,360
Do you wanna try?

409
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
Shit! Hunter, stop!

410
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,520
Just focus on getting a good shot.

411
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,600
I didn't wear this stupid bra
for nothing.

412
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
No.

413
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,920
No, Hunter.

414
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,120
Swoop it around!

415
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,080
Seize your day!

416
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
Okay.

417
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,360
Oh, my god.

418
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,920
How'd it look?

419
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,560
Insane! Insane. Crazy.

420
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,200
Let's get this bad boy back.

421
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,520
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

422
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,760
Okay. Now the ultimate, Becks.

423
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Your turn.

424
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,560
What? No.

425
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,600
Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?

426
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,800
No. No, Hunter.

427
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,800
The old Becky would have done it.

428
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,880
- Just saying...
- Dude.

429
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,120
Here. I'll hold your hand.

430
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,200
- Okay.
- Yeah?

431
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Okay.

432
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Shit.

433
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,360
Come on, come on!

434
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,920
You can do this.

435
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
You can do it.

436
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

437
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,000
- I got you.
- Okay.

438
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,120
Okay.

439
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,280
- You can trust me.
- Whoa, okay.

440
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,000
- I've got you, Becks.
- Oh, my god.

441
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,320
Careful over the ledge.

442
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Take it easy.

443
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,760
Okay, I've got you. I've got you.

444
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,560
Open your eyes.

445
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,400
Okay, just one more.

446
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,760
You're coming up right now.

447
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,640
My god, you did it.

448
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,920
You did it, you idiot.

449
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,360
Yes! Look.

450
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,000
- Look how amazing these are.
- Oh, my god.

451
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,000
Next time you are
ever afraid of anything

452
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,640
I want you to look at these

453
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,120
and know that you have
nothing to be afraid of.

454
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Thank you.

455
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,760
Yeah.

456
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,480
I'm really proud of you.

457
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,880
Dan would be, too.

458
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Okay.

459
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,240
Okay, it's time.

460
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,680
You and I were one, Dan.

461
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,240
And whenever I needed a laugh...

462
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,880
you told me one of your shit jokes.

463
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,880
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on, it was yours.

464
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
And now you're gone and I'm...

465
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
I don't feel whole anymore.

466
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,560
I miss you just so much and I'm...

467
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,800
I love you.

468
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,920
Goodbye, Dan.

469
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,360
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

470
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,800
I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.

471
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,200
I've just been so far away
for so long.

472
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,800
It just didn't really
feel real until then.

473
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Come on.

474
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,320
Let's get back down on earth, okay?

475
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,856
I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.

476
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,920
I've needed to pee
since we passed the Eiffel Tower.

477
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,680
Okay?

478
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Okay.

479
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,120
- Home time.
- Home time.

480
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,360
- Harnesses?
- Harnesses.

481
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,000
Think of the ice-cold beers
waiting for us.

482
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,480
Oh, stop.

483
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
I've got you.

484
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,880
Okay, slowly.

485
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,080
Okay. I'm just getting a stitch here.

486
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Okay, okay.

487
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,400
Okay.

488
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Hunter!

489
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,160
Oh, my god! Oh, my god, holy shit.

490
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
- Don't let go.
- Yeah, I got you.

491
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Hunter!

492
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,400
Oh, god, please don't drop me.

493
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Don't drop me.

494
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,640
Becks?

495
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
I've got you, Becks.

496
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,560
I can see the ladder.

497
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
I've got you.

498
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,000
I just died almost.

499
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,640
Oh, my god.

500
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,600
Did that really just happen?

501
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,320
- Oh, my...
- Jesus Christ!

502
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,240
I wish we'd filmed that.

503
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
You're here.

504
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,760
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.

505
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
Yeah.

506
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Okay, take two.

507
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,360
Oh, no.

508
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
The ladder.

509
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,240
It's gone.

510
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,160
Hunter, how do we get down?

511
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,640
- Shit!
- Please tell me

512
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
there's a way to go down.

513
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,776
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.

514
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,480
- No.
- Oh, no.

515
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,640
No, no, no.

516
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,520
There must be something.

517
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,000
No. Shit. I don't have a signal.

518
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
I don't get it, either.

519
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,416
I'm sure there's something, I'm sure
it's just really spotty up here.

520
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,456
No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.

521
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
We're gonna be okay.

522
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,416
Freaking out is not gonna
help anything right now

523
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
so just take a breath.

524
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,160
We're stuck on a pizza-sized platform

525
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,096
- in the middle of nowhere, Hunter.
- Becky, freaking out

526
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,360
is not gonna help anything.

527
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,480
It's not gonna help, okay?

528
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
It's okay.

529
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,120
- I'm sure we can...
- Wait, Hunter. Hunter, Hunter.

530
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Look at this.

531
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Oh, my god.

532
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,520
- Binoculars. Amazing.
- Okay.

533
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
We have a flare.

534
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Okay.

535
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,200
- This is great news.
- Okay. Great.

536
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,440
Oh, shit, our bag is down there.

537
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,920
Oh, man, our water's in there.

538
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,936
Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.

539
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,480
- No. No.
- We don't have water.

540
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,736
- No, think about it...
- That's how you die

541
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,816
- The noise!
- When you're stranded.

542
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,000
The noise that this thing made
when it crashed

543
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,800
there is no way nobody heard that.

544
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,320
Okay? I'm sure that there are, like,
multiple calls to 911 as we speak.

545
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,400
Do you really think so?

546
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Yeah.

547
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,280
Yeah, the cavalry is coming, okay?
We just... we just have to wait.

548
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,520
Okay. Okay.

549
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,680
Holy f...

550
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,200
- What? What?
- Becky, your leg.

551
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
My god.

552
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,760
What the hell?

553
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,200
I didn't even notice this.

554
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,920
Whoa!

555
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,080
- Whoa!
- Come here. Let's compress it.

556
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,896
- Are you okay? I know.
- It really hurts.

557
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,056
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay.
- Can you just like...

558
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,640
- Can you warn me away?
- Okay.

559
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,400
- Count of three or something.
- Yeah. One.

560
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,720
Two... Sorry. I'm really sorry.

561
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,680
- I know.
- Oh, man.

562
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
Are you okay?

563
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,520
Yeah, I know I'm like,
I'm okay. It's like...

564
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,680
I really have to pee.

565
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Just go.

566
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,880
- Just pee.
- No, it's fine. I can hold it.

567
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,800
I just need to get comfortable.

568
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,600
Can you go any further?
It's, like, spraying.

569
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,960
- Okay, careful over the ledge.
- I'm trying.

570
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,200
Stop looking at me.

571
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,520
Oh, god. That's a relief.

572
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,800
I'm just grateful
you didn't need to shit.

573
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable

574
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,400
'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.

575
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
All right.

576
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,920
All right!

577
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,680
Do you really think someone's coming?

578
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,120
One million percent.

579
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,480
Hey, Danger D,
what's happening, guys?

580
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,080
I'll tell you
what's happenin', Becky C.

581
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,360
We are stuck at the top of
a 2,000-foot tower with no way down.

582
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,800
And I shot some of the best
goddamn footage of my life.

583
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,920
And no way to upload it.

584
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,120
That's what worrying you
about the situation?

585
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,920
It's quite ironic.

586
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,680
Well, don't worry,
you'll still be famous if you fall

587
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,360
as the girl who died taking a selfie.
Now, that is ironic.

588
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,360
I would like to be remembered
for my life, not my death

589
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,560
thank you very much.

590
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,080
Hashtag, life over death.
Hashtag, Becky's a dick hole.

591
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,200
Hashtag, Hunter says she's doing
this YouTube thing for the money

592
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,640
but really I think
she's just like a "like" whore.

593
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,240
- It's not like that.
- Okay, what is it like, then?

594
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,200
Come on, show us who you are.
Show us Shiloh Hunter.

595
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,520
Tell us why you vlog.

596
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,760
Okay, firstly, you're an asshole.

597
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Yeah.

598
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,320
Secondly...

599
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,920
And this is gonna sound stupid.

600
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,440
But I do this because of Dan.

601
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,640
What happened, it...

602
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,800
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

603
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,920
And I want to spread that message,
that life is short, too short. So...

604
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,320
you gotta use every moment.

605
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,040
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

606
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,480
That was amazing.

607
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,680
Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.

608
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,320
That was really great.

609
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,560
Should I kill Danger D?

610
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,520
I'll help you bury the body.

611
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,040
Oh, shit.

612
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,480
There's like
an old RV thing down there.

613
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Can I see?

614
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,480
Just past the gate, a little over.

615
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
Yeah.

616
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,680
That looks abandoned.

617
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,880
It's been five hours. If anyone
called 911, they'd be here by now.

618
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,760
Oh, my god.

619
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,680
Holy shit.

620
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,520
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here

621
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,680
but we definitely did down there.
Remember I got all those likes?

622
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Shit.

623
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,680
Okay. Okay, so we don't know
at what point we lost service.

624
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,480
Maybe it was just up here
because of some, like, interference

625
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,000
- with the broadcast antenna.
- Yeah.

626
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,856
I think you're definitely
onto something, Hunter.

627
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,520
Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.

628
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,360
- We can try to fish for coverage.
- Yeah.

629
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,520
I just need something
to secure this with.

630
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,600
- My hair tie.
- Yeah, perfect.

631
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,920
Okay.

632
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,360
Okay. Can you message
emergency services?

633
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,080
I don't think so. But I have
over 60,000 followers.

634
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,880
- Okay.
- Help us.

635
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,400
Stuck on B-67 Tower. Call 911.

636
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,040
It's ready to post.

637
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,680
We should hear it when it sends.

638
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,520
Come on, come on.

639
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
Okay.

640
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,160
Okay.

641
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,480
Let me see if I can get lower.

642
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,360
Just be careful.

643
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,920
Got it, okay.

644
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,600
Come on.

645
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,920
That's the end.
I didn't hear anything.

646
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I didn't, either.

647
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,560
I don't think it posted.

648
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,000
Okay, maybe I can get lower.

649
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,000
What? What do you mean? Just...

650
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,280
I've got it. I've got an idea.

651
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,800
Careful, Hunter.

652
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,040
Feels solid.

653
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,560
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

654
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,280
Okay.

655
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,720
- Oh, my god.
- Shit.

656
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,680
- Careful. Oh, my god, Hunter.
- Shit.

657
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,040
- Are you okay? Oh, my god.
- Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,280
Careful. Shit.

659
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,976
I don't hear anything. Nothing.

660
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,400
Okay, you need to come back up.

661
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,000
Shit.

662
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,760
I got it.

663
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,840
Did it post?

664
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,240
No.

665
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
What do we do now?

666
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,520
I don't know.

667
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,680
Wait, hold on.

668
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,600
We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.

669
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,680
Yeah.

670
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,856
What if we just drop the phone?

671
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,096
Okay, but what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?

672
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,120
Not if we reinforce it somehow, so it
doesn't like the egg drop challenge.

673
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,800
Yeah. Okay, shit.

674
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,640
We just need something to...
to put it in.

675
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,360
- Yeah.
- This.

676
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
It's welded on.

677
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,320
My shoe's too flimsy.

678
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,240
- Your shoe?
- Yeah, perfect.

679
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,200
Okay, got it.

680
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,920
We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?

681
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,560
Yeah. Okay.

682
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,600
Okay.

683
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,520
We still need something
more substantial.

684
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,680
Oh, Hunter.

685
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,360
Your push-up bra.

686
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,000
- That is more substantial.
- Yeah.

687
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,560
Dying to get this thing off, anyway.

688
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,000
Thank you, VS.

689
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,360
Okay.

690
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,760
Hope it's strong enough.

691
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,000
Shove it real good.

692
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,280
Okay.

693
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,880
Here goes nothing.

694
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,800
- Did it work?
- I don't know. I can't tell.

695
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,400
Do you see anything?

696
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,280
No, nothing.

697
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,520
Don't worry.

698
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,520
They're coming.

699
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,560
Holy shit! There's a freaking guy!

700
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,040
- What?
- Oh, my god. Yes.

701
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,320
And a dog, too.

702
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,680
- Hey! Up here!
- Hey, help us!

703
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,080
Look, I sent you
the check, man. Come on.

704
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,360
I need that...

705
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,360
- Hey!
- Hey, boy! Big boy!

706
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,800
Parker.

707
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,880
Come! Come on, boy.

708
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,000
No... no.

709
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,080
Shit!

710
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,600
Hey!

711
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,800
Let's go.

712
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,320
Goddamn it, they're getting away.

713
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,160
Parker.

714
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,280
He got the shoe.

715
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,240
- Hey! Up here!
- Look up here. Please!

716
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,040
- Hey!
- Hey!

717
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,320
- He's walking!
- Hey!

718
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,680
No, no, no, turn around!

719
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,080
Turn around! Right here!

720
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,120
Hey!

721
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,720
Shit! Shit!

722
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,080
Hey!

723
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,440
Wait... wait. No... no.

724
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,160
Do not fire the flare,
he's not looking.

725
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,696
This might be our only chance.

726
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,160
No, no, no, he's not looking.

727
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,520
Wait.

728
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,200
Hold on. There's somebody by the RV.

729
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,960
He's setting up a grill or some shit.

730
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,440
- Okay.
- And we'll fire the flare

731
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,120
when the sun goes down
in like... in like an hour.

732
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,480
We've only got one shot at this.

733
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,240
- Oh, damn.
- What?

734
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,120
They're making ribs.

735
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,400
- Oh, no.
- And they have really cold beer.

736
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,480
Don't.

737
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,920
These guys are definitely a couple.

738
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,680
Dirty weekend away.

739
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,560
I'm jealous.

740
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,680
Hey, hey, hey. They're finishing up.

741
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,376
It's now or never, fire the flare.

742
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,440
Is it dark enough?

743
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,800
Okay.

744
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,320
- Shit.
- Shit. What the hell?

745
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,976
- Why isn't it firing?
- I fired it. I cocked it

746
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,440
maybe there's a safety or something?

747
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,056
Shit. Okay, they're going in,
they're going in.

748
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,456
- You have to do the flare now.
- I'm trying.

749
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,520
- Get it to go.
- It's stuck. Okay, I got it.

750
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,600
Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.

751
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,080
- Okay, give me your phone.
- Okay.

752
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,920
Hey, sons of bitches, up here!

753
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,640
Holy shit! Check this out.

754
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,040
Up here!

755
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,456
- Hey!
- Wait, they're looking at us.

756
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
- What?
- They can see us.

757
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,560
Oh, my god!

758
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,240
Holy shit! Oh, my god,
let me see, let me see, let me see.

759
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,880
Oh, my god, they're coming.

760
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,040
Hey!

761
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,000
Holy shit, they found the car.

762
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,680
They found our car,
they found our car.

763
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,120
They have a... a crowbar.
They're probably gonna open the gate.

764
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

765
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,880
- Wait, what the hell?
- Wait, what's going on?

766
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,320
They stopped.

767
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,520
- What?
- Quit chatting

768
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,760
open the freakin' gate.

769
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,840
No. No, no, no. What the hell?

770
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,440
They're stealing my freakin' car!

771
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,320
- What?
- No, you sons of bitches!

772
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Hey!

773
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,200
You asshole! What the hell?

774
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,320
No! I need to see it!

775
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,080
- Oh, my god. No!
- Die

776
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,800
- No!
- You freakin' assholes!

777
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,800
Oh, my god.

778
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,520
Okay.

779
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,200
New rule.

780
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,240
If somebody falls off the tower

781
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,240
they bring the cell phone with them,
and call for help on the way down.

782
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,400
And maybe post that video.

783
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,480
Kidding-ish.

784
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,200
Yeah, my leg. I could eat aspirin
like skittles right now.

785
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,720
Yeah.

786
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,000
It's looking a little funky.

787
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,880
Could use some washing, here.

788
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I'm sorry.

789
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,120
We'll just keep it wrapped up.

790
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,320
What's wrong?

791
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,000
Dan could never say
the words "I love you."

792
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,560
1-4-3.

793
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,560
1-4-3.

794
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,920
Becky, I...

795
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
How long?

796
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,920
Four months.

797
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,560
It was a huge mistake.

798
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,880
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

799
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,560
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

800
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,720
For falling in love
with the same guy.

801
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,520
Who made the move?

802
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,560
- Both super drunk.
- Who?

803
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,560
He did.

804
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,320
But it was
a huge, huge mistake, Becks.

805
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,480
No.

806
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,160
A mistake is
a kiss, a one-night stand.

807
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,640
You said you loved him, so...

808
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,120
It got out of hand.

809
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,760
I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him. I mean...

810
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,000
He listened to me, he was...

811
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,080
He was just different
than every other douchebag

812
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,640
that I'd ever dated and...

813
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,360
And I'd never felt that way before.

814
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,176
And then you asked me
to be your maid of honor

815
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,656
and it all hit me
like a ton of bricks

816
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,400
how messed up this all was.

817
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,240
I loved him, but...

818
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,640
But I love you more, so I ended it.

819
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,920
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

820
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,240
And after Dan died, I...

821
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,480
I just didn't have the strength
to be there for you

822
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,840
to be strong enough for you, so...

823
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,200
So I ran away.

824
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,880
And now you hate me
and I don't blame you

825
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,400
and now we're stuck
on this stupid, freaking tower

826
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,240
in the middle of freaking nowhere.

827
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,680
And it's all my fault.

828
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,200
I am so, so sorry.

829
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,560
What's that?

830
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,160
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

831
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,880
It's been 24 hours.

832
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,120
I think it's time to accept

833
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,400
that either your 60,000 followers
don't give a shit

834
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,720
or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.

835
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,120
Okay.

836
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,920
Well, we've got one more shot.

837
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,560
Your phone.

838
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,120
Yeah, no padding this time, though.
Even less of a chance.

839
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,360
And if this fails,
we really don't have any hope.

840
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,880
How long till we die of thirst?

841
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,600
It's just killing me that our water
is just right down there in that bag.

842
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,520
Yeah, with the drone.

843
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,976
We could've used that to get help.

844
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,520
We could have flown it
back to our motel

845
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,840
with a good old fashioned note.

846
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,000
Wait, maybe I can get it.

847
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,000
What do you mean? You said
it was too smooth. No footholds.

848
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,000
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday

849
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,040
I think the rope
was long enough to reach it.

850
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,480
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

851
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,040
Yeah, I seriously think I can get it.

852
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,360
Hunter, I don't think
this is a good idea.

853
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,200
Becky, I don't think
we have a choice.

854
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,040
Every hour that passes,
the weaker we get.

855
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,560
Besides...

856
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,000
maybe you'll get lucky
and I'll fall.

857
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,000
Hunter.

858
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,600
Be careful.

859
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,560
I'm sorry, Becks.

860
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,240
I love you.

861
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,240
Okay.

862
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,720
Are you okay?

863
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,800
Yeah.

864
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,960
Yeah, all good.

865
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,320
Okay.

866
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
Hunter, careful.

867
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,880
Shit.

868
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,680
I can't quite reach it.

869
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,320
Just come back up.
We'll attach it lower.

870
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,400
Come on.

871
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,680
Shit.

872
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,120
I think I can drop myself lower.

873
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,200
What?

874
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,120
What the hell are you doing, Hunter?

875
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,920
Hunter!

876
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,960
Shit.

877
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,160
I think I can swing to it.

878
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,240
Hunter, no!

879
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,320
Hunter! Come back up!

880
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,560
Hunter, no!

881
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,680
Hunter!

882
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,280
Are you okay?

883
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,680
Yeah!

884
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,760
Is there a way down?

885
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,080
No. The ladder ripped
all the way off.

886
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,360
Water.

887
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,040
- Oh, my god.
- Wait, Hunter.

888
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,360
How are you gonna
get back on the rope?

889
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,200
Shit.

890
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,880
Can... can you reach it?

891
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,680
<i>Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall</i>

892
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,680
Oh, my god.

893
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,160
<i>Humpty Dumpty had a big fall...</i>

894
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,680
Shit.

895
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,440
You okay?

896
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,520
Yeah.

897
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,800
I have an idea.

898
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,080
Okay.

899
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,760
I'm gonna try to hook it on with this

900
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,160
and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.

901
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,560
- Okay?
- That's amazing.

902
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,880
That's some good MacGyver shit
right there.

903
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,800
Oh, come on. Please. Please. Come on.

904
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,360
- You did it!
- Okay.

905
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,520
Okay. I'm gonna jump onto this.

906
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,840
I'm gonna need your help
to pull me up.

907
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,240
- Okay.
- Get ready, Becks.

908
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

909
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,240
Okay.

910
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,760
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

911
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,760
Shit.

912
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,760
Hunter, are you okay? You okay?

913
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,080
Okay.

914
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,960
I'm okay. Let's do this
fast and quick, Becky.

915
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,360
Work together to pull me up.

916
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,240
- Okay.
- I climb, you pull.

917
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,040
Okay?

918
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,080
Okay, now!

919
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,000
I can almost reach the ladder.

920
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,920
Almost there, Becks.

921
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,240
Okay.

922
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,520
Becky! I landed on the bag!

923
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,520
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

924
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,000
I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.

925
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,000
You're gonna have
to pull me up, okay?

926
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,320
Okay. Okay.

927
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,920
I got you.

928
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,160
Oh, shit.

929
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,680
Oh, no. Are you okay?

930
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,240
Shit.

931
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,640
I thought you died there.

932
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,240
I'm not going anywhere, Becks.

933
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,760
That was scary.

934
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,760
- We should ration it.
- Okay. You're right.

935
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,680
Is there any food in there?

936
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,320
No, it's just your cherry lip balm.

937
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,480
I don't think you can eat that.

938
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,480
Okay, it's getting dark. I think
it's now or never on that drone.

939
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,120
I guess we need to...

940
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,480
We need to write a note.

941
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,000
Okay, the receipt from the diner.

942
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,080
A pen... do you have a pen?

943
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,200
Eyeliner in here.

944
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,720
Aren't you glad
I brought up makeup now?

945
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,560
Help.

946
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,880
Stuck on top of B-67 Tower. Call 911.

947
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,760
Yeah, perfect.

948
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,800
Okay. See that?

949
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,400
That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.

950
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,680
It leads to the motel.

951
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,520
Let's do this
while we still have light.

952
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,240
Okay.

953
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,336
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the road.

954
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,400
- Let it drift down as it goes.
- Okay.

955
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,200
Okay, we're almost past the gate.

956
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,400
- Oh, my god. No... no.
- What?

957
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,696
The battery.
It's running out of juice.

958
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,000
Oh, shit.

959
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,200
Hit retrieve. Or has it gone too far?

960
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,520
- Is it gonna make it?
- There's no chance!

961
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,376
- Are you sure?
- It's not even at the gate.

962
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,520
Shit. It's dropping.

963
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,696
- Hit retrieve, hit retrieve...
- Hunter.

964
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,720
- Hit retrieve.
- Okay.

965
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,600
- It's coming back.
- Fly it up.

966
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,240
Give it the best shot
to get back to us.

967
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,000
Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.

968
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,600
- Just get it higher!
- I'm trying.

969
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,640
- We'll grab it when it gets close.
- Okay.

970
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,040
Okay. We've got this.

971
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,760
Get it, Becks, get it.

972
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,280
Nice! Good job.

973
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,400
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

974
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,200
Maybe just turn it off and once
it's rested, it will have more juice.

975
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,040
It's never gonna be enough. Hunter.

976
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,120
What are we gonna do?

977
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,360
Hey, we're not gonna panic.

978
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,320
We're gonna stay calm.

979
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,040
We're gonna figure it out, okay?
There's gotta be a way.

980
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,800
Are we gonna die?

981
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,680
No.

982
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,920
No, we're gonna be okay.

983
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,480
Hunter? Hunter

984
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,080
Where are you? Hunter...

985
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,200
Hunter...

986
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,000
Hunter, where are you?

987
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,560
Hunter. Hunter!

988
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,040
Becky, it's okay.

989
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,080
You just had a bad dream.

990
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:14,000
You're nice and safe, 2,000 feet up
in the middle of nowhere.

991
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,760
I have an idea.

992
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,920
How to charge the drone.

993
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,920
Your dumb life hack.

994
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,880
Becky, you freakin' genius.

995
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,080
I think it's light enough now.
Let's do it.

996
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,960
Okay, it's a standard bulb fitting,
but it's gonna be hot.

997
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,440
It's 30 feet
but it's gonna feel like 1,000.

998
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,000
- Is your leg okay?
- Yeah.

999
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,360
It smells, but it doesn't
hurt anymore. It's fine.

1000
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,760
Okay.

1001
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,600
You can do this.

1002
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,360
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1003
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,560
Keep going, Becky.

1004
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,400
You got this, Becky!

1005
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,000
I can't.

1006
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,400
It's okay, it's okay.

1007
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,560
I can't.

1008
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,720
You can do it, Becky.

1009
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,520
You got it.

1010
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,160
It's okay.

1011
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,040
It's just like pole dancing.

1012
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,120
Okay, cherry pie.

1013
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,000
<i>She's my cherry pie</i>

1014
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,880
<i>My cold drink of water,
my sweet surprise</i>

1015
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,520
<i>She's my cherry pie</i>

1016
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,800
<i>Making my cherry pie</i>

1017
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,120
<i>She's my cherry pie</i>

1018
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,160
<i>My cold drink of water,
my sweet surprise</i>

1019
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,800
<i>She's my cherry pie</i>

1020
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,640
<i>Becky's my cherry pie</i>

1021
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,160
Yes!

1022
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,120
You did it, my little cherry pie.

1023
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,200
Good job!

1024
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,400
- Okay.
- Yeah!

1025
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,520
You did it, cherry pie!

1026
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,080
All right. All right.

1027
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,760
- Okay. Okay.
- Remember, it's hot.

1028
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,560
Be careful.

1029
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,320
Okay, just think back to the diner.

1030
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,720
You're gonna want to line
the prongs of the charger

1031
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,800
with the elements of the bulb socket.

1032
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,800
I don't think it's long enough.

1033
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,080
I think the back prong doesn't reach.

1034
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,520
Okay, you're gonna need
something small and metal

1035
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,240
to carry the current, like a...

1036
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,360
Like a screw or something
that you can jam in there.

1037
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,960
There isn't anything.

1038
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,040
Jesus.

1039
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,720
It's working! It's freaking working!

1040
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,200
Holy shit, my hero!

1041
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,920
Okay, we're gonna need a full charge.

1042
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I don't know.

1043
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,600
It just has four lights.

1044
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,760
Okay, we have to charge it
all the way.

1045
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,120
Give ourselves the best shot.

1046
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,760
You gonna be okay?

1047
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,360
Yeah. I got this.

1048
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,560
You okay?

1049
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,760
Yep!

1050
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,320
Hang in there, Becks.

1051
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,760
Past halfway.

1052
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,800
Get off of me!

1053
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,360
It's okay, it's okay, Becky.

1054
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,480
You've got it.

1055
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,040
Three lights.

1056
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,240
Come on, Becky, you're so close.

1057
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,240
Get the hell away from me!

1058
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,280
You did it!

1059
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,520
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

1060
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,120
Why didn't you catch the bag?

1061
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,000
Babe, you okay?

1062
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,880
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

1063
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,200
Checkout, 10.00am.

1064
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,160
Just a couple of hours.

1065
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,360
You know, he was right about Dan.
He was just trying to help me and...

1066
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,920
and I was so horrible to him.

1067
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,520
If there was anyone I could text,
it would be him. Just to say...

1068
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,840
I'm so sorry.

1069
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,320
I love him.

1070
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,360
I'm tapping out here.

1071
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,640
Stay with me.

1072
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,200
Try to keep your mind occupied.

1073
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,120
Tell me something, something that...

1074
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,480
That you and your dad
used to do together.

1075
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,800
We would watch wrestling.

1076
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,120
- WWE.
- Yeah.

1077
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,640
I forgot you guys were into that.

1078
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,000
Yeah. It was our thing, you know?

1079
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,520
He was always said
I'd be world champion

1080
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,480
with my fighting spirit.

1081
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,560
I always felt so close to him
when we would watch it.

1082
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,720
Okay.

1083
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Name some of your favorite wrestlers.

1084
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,840
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

1085
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,560
The Rock.

1086
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,200
What was Cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing the mask?

1087
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,320
Mankind.

1088
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,160
Mankind.

1089
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,000
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1090
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,080
I didn't.

1091
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,480
Keep going, you need to stay awake.

1092
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,200
Batista.

1093
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,840
Okay. It's checkout time.

1094
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,560
Okay, here it goes.

1095
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,600
Just keep that shit straight.
Follow the line of the road.

1096
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,200
Come on, you son of a...

1097
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,920
I'm past the point of no return,
so how's the battery?

1098
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,040
Should I retrieve?

1099
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,360
No, keep going.

1100
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,400
Come on, come on,
just follow the road.

1101
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,200
Oh, shit.

1102
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,840
It's gonna work.

1103
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,200
Oh, god.

1104
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,200
No.

1105
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,760
Screw your truck.
Get the drone! Get it!

1106
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,320
No... no!

1107
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,680
Go back! Go back.

1108
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,200
No, no, no. Go back!

1109
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,680
Go back!

1110
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,160
Fuck, no!

1111
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,840
Is that a storm?

1112
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,960
It's kind of beautiful from up here.

1113
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,000
I can't survive another night.

1114
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,800
Becky, don't talk like that.

1115
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,640
I just...

1116
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,360
I just wanna sleep.

1117
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,560
You can't sleep.

1118
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,160
The vultures,
they can smell your leg.

1119
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,800
They're waiting for you
to give up so they can attack.

1120
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,040
Survival of the fittest.

1121
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,520
You need energy.

1122
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,880
We should eat something.

1123
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,320
What?

1124
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:53,320
We're 2,000 feet up
in the middle of the desert.

1125
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,120
There's no food up here.

1126
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,560
There's always something.

1127
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,240
It's hopeless.

1128
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,160
Let's send another message.

1129
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,800
We can pad the cell better this time.

1130
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,880
- With what?
- Give me your shoe.

1131
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,200
- I can't.
- Why?

1132
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,240
It's not up here, is it?

1133
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,360
What?

1134
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,040
It's down there.

1135
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,120
It's on your foot.

1136
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,000
But I'm...

1137
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,160
down there, remember?

1138
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,920
I fell.

1139
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,360
You can't have the shoe

1140
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,000
because I didn't catch the bag.

1141
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,040
I bled out.

1142
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:11,400
You didn't really think your scrawny
ass could pull me up, did you?

1143
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,240
You pulled the bag up.

1144
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,840
I guess you were just too afraid

1145
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,320
to realize that you were up here...

1146
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,400
all alone.

1147
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,920
Hi, Dad.

1148
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,160
I wanted you to know that I...

1149
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,000
I found my fight again.

1150
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,240
<i>Please leave your message...</i>

1151
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,000
I wanna live.

1152
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,120
I wanna go home.

1153
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,760
But I'm not gonna make it.

1154
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,240
You were right
about everything and I...

1155
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,920
I'm sorry, Dad.

1156
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,760
By the time you see this...

1157
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,320
I'll be gone.

1158
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,520
I love you.

1159
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,200
<i>You need energy.</i>

1160
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:51,760
<i>You should eat something.</i>

1161
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,200
<i>Survival of the fittest.</i>

1162
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,320
<i>I can pad the cell better this time.</i>

1163
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,400
<i>Give me your shoe.</i>

1164
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,400
Hunter.

1165
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,240
God, I love you.

1166
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,200
I'm sorry.

1167
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:47,200
I'm so sorry, but I really have
to make sure this gets through.

1168
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:49,240
God, god, I'm sorry.

1169
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,720
You can't park here.

1170
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,360
Becky! Becky!

1171
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,200
No.

1172
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:18,960
No.

1173
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,600
Dad?

1174
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,800
Dad?

1175
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,160
Dad!

1176
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,880
I thought that was you.

1177
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,400
Dad, I love you. I'm so sorry.

1178
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:41,800
It's okay.

1179
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,720
I just... I just want you to be okay.

1180
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,680
I am, you know? I'm gonna be okay.

1181
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,880
Really.

1182
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,040
Let's go home.

1183
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,000
<i>Life is fleeting.</i>

1184
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:20,200
<i>Life is short, too short.</i>

1185
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,400
<i>So, you gotta use every moment.</i>

1186
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,640
<i>You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.</i>

1187
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,040
<i>And that shit?</i>

1188
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,040
<i>That would spread
that message far and wide.</i>
