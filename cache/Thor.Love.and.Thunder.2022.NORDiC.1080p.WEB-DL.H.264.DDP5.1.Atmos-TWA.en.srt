1
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,977
Oh, great and mighty Rapu...

2
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:48,106
we pray to you for water and sustenance.

3
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:53,653
I pray to you, not for me,
but for my daughter.

4
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:32,483
I'm tired.

5
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,693
You have suffered.

6
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:18,404
Come to me.

7
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,574
Come to me.

8
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,290
You have suffered.

9
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,505
Come to me.

10
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,977
You have suffered.

11
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:32,395
What do we have here?

12
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:35,899
Look at it.

13
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:37,859
It's gobbling up all my fruit.

14
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:42,614
Rapu.

15
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,452
Bringer of Light.

16
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:48,828
Oh, it's one of mine.

17
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,708
I am Gorr, the last of your disciples.

18
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,794
We have lost everything, my lord.

19
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:58,588
The land is dry.

20
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,924
All life is lost.

21
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:05,261
But our faith in you never wavered
and now we await the promise...

22
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,890
of the eternal reward.

23
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,267
Is this why you celebrate?

24
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:15,647
He thinks there's an eternal reward.

25
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,694
No. No, sorry.

26
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,988
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

27
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:28,493
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

28
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,704
We just vanquished
the holder of the Necrosword...

29
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,289
-You have suffered.
-...before he could harm...

30
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,708
-any other gods with that cursed blade.
-If it's revenge you seek.

31
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,253
He threatened to end my entire empire.

32
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,380
But, my lord...

33
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:43,508
your empire has already ended.

34
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,927
There's no one left to worship you.

35
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:48,596
There'll be more followers to replace you.

36
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:49,973
There always are.

37
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,933
We have suffered...

38
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:55,228
and we have starved.

39
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,024
My daughter died...

40
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,903
-in your name.
-And well you should.

41
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:06,990
Suffering for your gods is your
only purpose.

42
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,409
There's nothing for you after death.

43
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,952
Except death.

44
00:05:13,037 --> 00:05:14,372
You are no god.

45
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,672
I renounce you.

46
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,891
Now your meaningless life
finally does have a purpose.

47
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,561
To sacrifice yourself to me.

48
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:42,025
If it's revenge you seek...

49
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,235
...kill all the gods.

50
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,237
Go to Eternity.

51
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:49,365
If it's revenge you seek...

52
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,577
summon the Bifrost.

53
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:53,912
Go to Eternity.

54
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:57,040
-Kill all the gods.
-Summon the Bifrost.

55
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:58,375
Go to Eternity.

56
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,795
Kill all the gods. Kill all the gods.
Kill all the gods.

57
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,935
The sword chose you.

58
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:19,729
You are now cursed!

59
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:20,980
Funny.

60
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:23,191
It doesn't feel like a curse.

61
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,446
Feels like a promise.

62
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,574
So, this is my vow.

63
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,663
All gods will die.

64
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,419
Come, come, gather round.

65
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:27,839
And listen to the legend of the
Space Viking.

66
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:33,678
AKA the God of Thunder.
AKA Thor Odinson.

67
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,312
Raised in the way of the warrior...

68
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,981
Thor was taught to help win battles...

69
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:48,443
fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.

70
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:54,574
He grew and he grew and he grew.

71
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:57,494
He was sensitive, like a smile.

72
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:00,872
And his loving nature did not discriminate.

73
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,042
He once loved a swashbuckling Passionista.

74
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:07,087
Another time, he loved a Wolf Woman...

75
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,838
on a Woman Wolf.

76
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:15,428
But Thor's one true love was an
Earth woman named Jane Fonda.

77
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:17,973
Wait. No. Jane Foster.

78
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:21,601
But sadly, in the battle for love,
Thor lost.

79
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,564
In fact, he lost a lot of people
in those days.

80
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:27,899
His mum.

81
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,192
His dad.

82
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:30,568
And that guy.

83
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:31,861
And that guy.

84
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,154
And whoever that is.

85
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:34,364
And Heimdall.

86
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:35,407
And his brother.

87
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,034
And his brother, again.

88
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,202
And again.

89
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,456
Poor Thor had to watch his planet explode.

90
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,376
And then he said, "What have I done?"

91
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:50,380
It seemed that everything
and everyone he loved, he lost.

92
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:53,383
And so he hid his heart
behind a big, fleshy bod...

93
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:56,094
so it could never be broken again.

94
00:08:56,511 --> 00:09:00,140
But just because he was done loving,
didn't mean he was done fighting.

95
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:03,852
He teamed up
with the Guardians of the Galaxy...

96
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,438
and set off on some classic
Thor adventures.

97
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:08,481
He got in shape.

98
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,442
Putting in the hard yards.

99
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:14,613
Turning pains into gains,
and never skipping leg day.

100
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:19,075
He went from Dad Bod to God Bod.

101
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,370
But beneath his God Bod,
there was still a Sad Bod...

102
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:23,747
just trying to get out.

103
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:29,544
Because all of the bods
that Thor had worn over the years...

104
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:32,881
couldn't hide the pain
that he was feeling on the inside.

105
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:36,635
So he gave up his search for love...

106
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:40,472
accepting that he was only good
for one thing...

107
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:44,976
Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say...

108
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:48,605
"Thor, we need your help to win this battle."

109
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,358
Thor.

110
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:53,485
We need your help to win this battle.

111
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:54,861
Let's go.

112
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,113
Okay. Come on, Stormbreaker.

113
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:58,657
Back to work.

114
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:01,785
We must hurry, okay?

115
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:04,162
People are dying.

116
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:05,330
See you down there.

117
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,378
Hurry up!

118
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:24,140
Give me those.
You're gonna break 'em.

119
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:26,518
I am Groot!

120
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:28,270
You got sap all over it.

121
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:33,817
-Hello, everybody.
-Well, well, look who it is.

122
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:35,235
How are we doing, guys?

123
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:36,736
Terrible!

124
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:38,822
We're all about to die.

125
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:41,283
You said this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

126
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,327
I said it was going to be,
"Like a relaxing holiday."

127
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:47,622
But look at that resplendent skyscape.
Three suns of Saturn.

128
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,332
What could be more relaxing than that?

129
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,376
An actual holiday!

130
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:53,587
Die Booskan scum!

131
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:57,883
God of Thunder.

132
00:10:58,049 --> 00:10:59,259
King Yakan.

133
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:01,970
You have finally joined our fight.

134
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,723
Well, as they say,
"Better late than not at all."

135
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:06,475
Yes, it's very nice.

136
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:09,686
As you know,
we used to live in a peaceful oasis.

137
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:12,731
-But then our gods were murdered.
-Murdered?

138
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,984
And now our sacred temple
has been left unguarded...

139
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:18,945
and Habooska's hordes
took control of its power.

140
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,407
It is our most sacred shrine
and he desecrates it.

141
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:23,575
Not for long.

142
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:29,289
King Yakan, tell them
what happened here today.

143
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:31,666
Tell of the time that Thor...

144
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,546
and his ragtag, motley crew
of misfit desperados...

145
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:38,590
turned the tide of the battle...

146
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:40,842
and etched their names in history.

147
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,221
For the odds may be against us,
but I'll tell you this for free...

148
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:45,472
Here it comes.

149
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,726
This ends here and now!

150
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,510
He's not going to go into
the temple, is he? No.

151
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,523
Well done, everybody.

152
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,818
We can collectively take credit for that
because we worked as a team.

153
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:06,530
We used our hearts and our minds
to defeat the enemy...

154
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,281
with minimal loss or damage.

155
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,125
What a classic Thor adventure!

156
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,501
Hurrah!

157
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,526
Good book?

158
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,694
Yeah.

159
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:47,571
I wrote it.

160
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:51,241
Wait. You're Dr. Jane Foster?

161
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:52,576
I am.

162
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:54,369
-Hi.
-Hi.

163
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:56,079
How's the Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

164
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,623
It's tough.

165
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:58,957
-Yeah.
-Really tough.

166
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,917
It's... You need a 3D model.

167
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:02,544
You ever see Event Horizon?

168
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:03,754
No.

169
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,381
-Interstellar?
-No.

170
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:08,342
That movie explains everything
really clearly.

171
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,844
All right. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge...

172
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:14,598
folds space, so that point A and
point B...

173
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,601
coexist in space and time.

174
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:19,227
Like that.

175
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:22,481
You just ruined your own book.

176
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:24,274
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

177
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,028
Watch those movies.

178
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,529
-Okay.
-Okay.

179
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,990
Saw the Hot Cheetos, had to get it.

180
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,249
So, how's it going?

181
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,628
It's going amazing.

182
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:52,678
Have you told anyone else besides me?

183
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:57,641
When people find out they start
acting weird. They're just different.

184
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:00,310
I don't need that in my life right now.

185
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:02,062
Anyway, it's not that serious.

186
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,689
Jane, it's Stage Four.

187
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:06,024
Out of, like, how many stages?

188
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:07,776
Four.

189
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:09,152
That we know about.

190
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:15,701
Oh, you have somewhere else
you gotta be right now...

191
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,578
that's more important than chemo?

192
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:18,996
No.

193
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,171
You're trying to get back to the lab,
aren't you?

194
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,007
I have a few ideas I'm trying.

195
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:31,967
Okay, no, time out.

196
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:35,012
I know you think your lab work is
something you have to do...

197
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,764
otherwise you're letting down
all of civilization...

198
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:42,102
but you're not getting what the universe
is actually trying to tell you...

199
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,645
so let me translate.

200
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:46,273
Slow down.

201
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:48,400
You need your energy to fight this thing.

202
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:51,945
I'll fight it my way, okay?

203
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:53,530
Well, FYI...

204
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:57,367
"my way" does not have to equal
alone in a lab.

205
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:02,331
Maybe it's time to
play the Space Viking card.

206
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:03,665
It's not a card.

207
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,625
Yes, it is.

208
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,084
-There's no card.
-There's a card.

209
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:08,629
It's tall, it's blond, and it's gorgeous.

210
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,214
It's a handsome card.

211
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,090
-Jane, are you sure?
-Look, Darcy...

212
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:15,469
I will figure this out by myself.

213
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:26,063
Results are still coming back the same.

214
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:28,649
I'm afraid the chemo has
very little effect.

215
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:32,361
I'm so sorry, Jane.

216
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,990
If there's anything I can do,
or if you just wanna talk, call me.

217
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,798
Smell like a king, because you're worthy.

218
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,300
Old Spice.

219
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:40,262
Cut!

220
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:09,583
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

221
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,168
Home.

222
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:12,503
Yes, home, Father.

223
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:14,671
We're here to take you home.

224
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:17,591
Yes. To planet Asgard.

225
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,094
Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

226
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:22,846
It is people.
It is you!

227
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:27,768
And now, it is time for me
to pass on to the spirit realm.

228
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,147
I will take my place...

229
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:35,234
in the great banqueting hall
of Valhalla...

230
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,736
the resting place of the gods.

231
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,822
Oh, one more thing.

232
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:41,990
You have a sister.

233
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:46,912
And so now, I turn into godly stardust...

234
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,123
and say farewell.

235
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:50,874
Oh, look.

236
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,335
Do you see? It's happening.

237
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:55,796
I'm disappearing.

238
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:01,760
No!

239
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:02,970
Father!

240
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,557
But wait! Brother!

241
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:11,186
An ominous portal hath appeared behind us.

242
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,855
Transform!

243
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:25,409
I am Hela, Goddess of Death.

244
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:30,539
Now, I return to Asgard to stake my claim
as the rightful heir to the throne...

245
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:32,499
and no one will stop me!

246
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:33,667
Join me or die!

247
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:36,045
We will never join you, witch!
Mjolnir!

248
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,217
Impossible!

249
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:45,679
I broke your hammer!

250
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:47,222
Time to die!

251
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:48,682
Bifrost!

252
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,946
You can almost feel the power...

253
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:05,949
of these magnificent and immovable stones.

254
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,869
Okay. Let's head back to the village...

255
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:11,955
where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

256
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:13,666
Come on.

257
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:50,160
God of Disaster...

258
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:52,663
we thank you.

259
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,500
We feared we would be at war forever
without the protection of our gods...

260
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,712
but now, peace shall reign.

261
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,632
In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

262
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:09,680
As is tradition, the protectors of our world
are bestowed with great beasts.

263
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,142
Giant goats!

264
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,394
Look at those! They are wonderful.

265
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:18,314
Korg, look at that.
Those things are beautiful.

266
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:20,816
King Yakan, thank you so much.

267
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:22,735
Listen, about the temple...

268
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:24,028
I don't wanna talk about the temple.

269
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:25,946
I know, but if we were to talk about it,
I think it's important...

270
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:27,489
-It's making me sad.
-...to life and material objects...

271
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:29,033
-And mad.
-Okay, I'll stop talking.

272
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:30,784
Don't forget the goats.

273
00:22:30,993 --> 00:22:33,245
Which you accepted,
and now must take with you.

274
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:34,580
No backsies.

275
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,667
-They are beautiful.
-Yes, they are beautiful.

276
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:41,045
They also scream quite a lot.

277
00:22:41,211 --> 00:22:42,129
They'll be fine.

278
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:44,089
I am Groot.

279
00:22:44,256 --> 00:22:47,092
We need to find the damn remote
so we can download the distress signal!

280
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,136
Retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

281
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:50,554
One of your goats probably ate it!

282
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,431
Goats didn't eat the remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

283
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,016
Well, I ain't digging through their crap.

284
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:56,769
I love them!
They should live with us forever!

285
00:22:56,936 --> 00:22:58,020
Found the remote!

286
00:22:58,228 --> 00:22:59,271
I'm putting them down.

287
00:22:59,438 --> 00:23:00,356
-Me too.
-Is it working or not?

288
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:01,899
No, it's not workin'. It's not charged.

289
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:03,692
-Well, maybe you need to find a charger...
-Get out of my way!

290
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,319
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

291
00:23:07,196 --> 00:23:08,989
-Korg, you okay?
-Yeah, bro. All good.

292
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:11,659
All right. Everybody, just relax.
The goats are gonna be fine.

293
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,327
If not, we can just use them
for meat...

294
00:23:15,204 --> 00:23:16,205
...ting people.

295
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,415
Meeting people.
They're a great conversation starter.

296
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:20,834
And I've been told you can summon them
with a special whistle...

297
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:22,127
that goes something like this...

298
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,296
No, that's not it.
No, that's not it.

299
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:25,965
No, that's not it.
You have a go.

300
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:27,508
No, that's not it.

301
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:29,301
-Oh, hey, guys.
-Kraglin!

302
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,469
No, that's not it.

303
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:32,972
-You been here this whole time?
-Yeah, you said to stay with the ship.

304
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:35,307
This is Glenda. We're married.

305
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,351
I am Groot.

306
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,145
What did we tell you
about jumpin' into new relationships?

307
00:23:40,312 --> 00:23:41,564
That I shouldn't be doing that.

308
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,316
Yeah, you can't get married
on every single planet we land on.

309
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:45,943
I am Groot.

310
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:47,945
Finally!

311
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,905
All right, here we go. Distress calls.

312
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:53,242
Please help us!
The God Butcher has found us!

313
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,618
God Butcher?

314
00:23:54,785 --> 00:23:56,328
He left them hanging as a warning.

315
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:58,289
Look at all of these gods, murdered.

316
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:02,126
Our greatest champions,
now laid to waste.

317
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:03,377
The horror.

318
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:05,004
Who could have done something like this?

319
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,131
Thor, where are you?

320
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:08,841
Wait, wait, wait. What was that? Go back.

321
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:11,343
Play that one.

322
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:14,346
-Thor, where are you?
-Sif?

323
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:15,806
We need you here.

324
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,100
My friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

325
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:19,894
Start the ship, my friends.

326
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:22,021
I don't know,
maybe we should split up.

327
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:25,149
So many people to save,
I mean, look at all of these distress...

328
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:26,817
calls.

329
00:24:30,154 --> 00:24:31,155
Thor.

330
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:32,656
You gonna be okay?

331
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:35,534
I admire your commitment to each other.
It's a beautiful thing.

332
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:37,411
Alas, it's something I'll never have.

333
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:38,954
Buddy, if I may...

334
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:40,539
You may.

335
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:44,668
After thousands of years of living,
you don't seem to know who the hell you are.

336
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,046
I've been lost before.

337
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:49,798
But then I found meaning, I found love.

338
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,093
And yeah, it got taken from me,
and god, that hurts.

339
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:57,890
But that shitty feeling
is better than feeling empty.

340
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:03,020
My hope for you is that
one day you will find something...

341
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,731
to make you feel this shitty.

342
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,567
I have loved before. It didn't work out.

343
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:12,446
They either die a grismal death
or they dump you with a handwritten letter.

344
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:15,950
I don't know which is worse, but it's why
I keep everyone at arm's length.

345
00:25:18,911 --> 00:25:21,038
You've grown too attached.
Damn it, I knew this would happen.

346
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:23,082
You must go. I'll find Sif.

347
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,502
You answer the other calls.
The galaxy needs its Guardians.

348
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:29,046
-Cool, yeah. We were just leaving...
-I know it hurts.

349
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:30,923
But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

350
00:25:31,882 --> 00:25:33,551
To ease the pain, why don't you...

351
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,096
take this ship here
as a parting farewell gift?

352
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:39,056
You're giving me my ship?

353
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,474
Yes, she's yours.

354
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:43,352
May you make as many memories with her
as I have.

355
00:25:43,477 --> 00:25:45,062
She's a temperamental old lass.

356
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:47,481
Will serve you well in a tight pickle.

357
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:48,774
-I'll start the ship.
-Thank you.

358
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:50,234
Goodbye, old friend.

359
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,154
A human handshake...

360
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:55,114
to the Asgardian shake.

361
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:57,867
Into the snake that you cannot trust.

362
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:00,035
You're really dragging this out.

363
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:03,038
And finish with the classic
Asgardian high one.

364
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,127
Let's go.

365
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:10,463
Take care of my crew.
This is gonna be hard for them.

366
00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:11,589
Hurry up!

367
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:12,798
Not her.

368
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:14,300
Remember what I told you.

369
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:16,719
You ever feel lost...

370
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,847
just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

371
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,224
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

372
00:26:26,645 --> 00:26:27,605
All right. Bye.

373
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:33,819
For what it's worth,
let's cling to the good memories.

374
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,157
We Asgardians say, "May you travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

375
00:26:38,574 --> 00:26:41,702
"I'll see you in Valhalla
where we shall drink mead and..."

376
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:45,915
-They're gone.
-Alone again. Just me and you.

377
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,208
Stormbreaker!

378
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:50,169
Watch out, you frickin' crazy axe!

379
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:55,049
So what do we do now, bro?

380
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:56,509
Let's go get Sif!

381
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:13,901
Who or what is that?

382
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:17,196
Falligar, God of the Falligarians.

383
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:19,615
One of the nicest gods you'll ever meet.

384
00:27:21,283 --> 00:27:22,410
Oh, no.

385
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:33,129
Sif, it's me, Thor.

386
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:34,714
Odinson?

387
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:36,298
You're missing an arm.

388
00:27:36,632 --> 00:27:37,633
I'm gonna get you home.

389
00:27:37,842 --> 00:27:39,719
No! Leave me here.

390
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:41,887
I want to die a warrior's death.

391
00:27:42,054 --> 00:27:44,098
On the battlefield. In battle.

392
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:47,143
And then I can claim my place in Valhalla.

393
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:49,520
Oh, I hate to break it to you...

394
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:52,690
but for a warrior to get into Valhalla,
you have to die in the battle.

395
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,443
-You survived.
-Oh, shit.

396
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:57,862
Maybe your arm is in Valhalla.

397
00:27:59,572 --> 00:28:00,698
What happened here?

398
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:02,783
I've been hunting a madman.

399
00:28:02,992 --> 00:28:05,077
I followed him here, but it was a trap.

400
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:06,203
Who is this madman?

401
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:09,040
The God Butcher is coming.

402
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:11,459
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

403
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:13,419
Asgard is next.

404
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:04,989
Look, it's Thor!

405
00:30:05,114 --> 00:30:07,116
-Thor!
-Take Sif to the infirmary.

406
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,242
Hey!

407
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:09,493
Who'd you piss off now?

408
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,245
This is not my fault.
I've never even seen these things...

409
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,246
whatever the hell they are.

410
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:13,497
Welcome back.

411
00:30:39,023 --> 00:30:40,191
Who's the new guy?

412
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:43,027
That guy? You're gonna love that guy.

413
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,710
Mjolnir! Mjolnir!

414
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,962
It's me, Thor.

415
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,421
Have you seen my hammer?

416
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:03,923
Mjolnir, here, boy.

417
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:07,510
Mjolnir?

418
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:12,807
Mjolnir.

419
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:20,064
You're back!

420
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:24,569
Mjolnir!

421
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:53,431
Excuse me.

422
00:31:53,556 --> 00:31:55,474
Hello. That's my hammer you've got there.

423
00:31:56,851 --> 00:31:58,311
And that's my look.

424
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:07,028
Hey!

425
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:10,531
Enough tomfoolery.

426
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:12,867
Why don't you take off that mask
and reveal yourself?

427
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,035
Come on.

428
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:16,913
Hey.

429
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,706
Jane?

430
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:27,340
Let me tell you the legend of Thor and Jane.

431
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:33,054
He was a God of Thunder
and she, a woman of science.

432
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:36,682
And although
they were from different worlds...

433
00:32:38,518 --> 00:32:40,228
somehow, it just made sense.

434
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:44,982
And together they embarked
on a journey of love.

435
00:32:50,696 --> 00:32:53,032
Thor taught Jane the way of the warrior...

436
00:32:55,201 --> 00:32:58,246
And Jane taught Thor the way of the people.

437
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:03,751
And as time passed,
their love grew deeper and deeper.

438
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:08,881
She's incredible, isn't she, Mjolnir?

439
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:14,846
I need you to promise me
you'll always protect her.

440
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:18,558
I love you too, buddy.

441
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:23,646
And love that deep
has a way of becoming magical.

442
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,485
Thor set his sights toward a future...

443
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:31,654
and all it might hold.

444
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:40,079
But the more he pondered a life with Jane,
the more he feared losing that life.

445
00:33:40,663 --> 00:33:42,957
And although Jane didn't want to admit it...

446
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:45,460
she was scared of loss as well.

447
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:51,257
And so, they built walls between them.

448
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,135
Thor got busy saving humanity.

449
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:55,887
Heimdall!

450
00:33:57,346 --> 00:33:59,640
And Jane got busy doing the same.

451
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:01,851
Real busy.

452
00:34:02,018 --> 00:34:07,065
And eventually, the space between them grew
and grew until it became too wide to bear.

453
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:14,405
Something had to give.

454
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:18,159
I have to stay up all night
to go through this data. Okay?

455
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,411
And I have to stay up all night
and clean all of this up.

456
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:22,705
-There's two plates!
-It's two plates and two forks!

457
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:29,045
And then, one night, it did give.

458
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:32,298
Jane wrote a note.

459
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:35,551
And Thor read that note.

460
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,972
And their legend suddenly became myth.

461
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:43,476
Or so they thought.

462
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:47,980
You okay?

463
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:50,983
Yeah, it's a little hot in...

464
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:53,111
Startin' to feel...

465
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:56,155
It's claustrophobic with the helmet.

466
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:01,494
How?

467
00:35:04,622 --> 00:35:05,832
Can we talk about this later?

468
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,458
Yeah, sure.

469
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,751
Great seeing you.

470
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:11,671
What?

471
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:20,304
Kill all the gods.

472
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,762
Hey. Is that the Necrosword?

473
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:03,181
That's cool.
I've only ever read about it in stories.

474
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,309
Then you know this is going to hurt.

475
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:08,019
Pain.

476
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:10,647
What is pain but a construct
invented by the weak?

477
00:36:10,855 --> 00:36:12,023
Okay, that's very sharp!

478
00:36:21,366 --> 00:36:22,367
Ready?

479
00:36:23,201 --> 00:36:26,245
Don't touch my things.

480
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,649
Yeah, you better run, you coward.

481
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,629
The children. They're taking the children!

482
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:18,464
Mommy!

483
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,634
Mom!

484
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:47,869
Shadow monsters. Disgusting.

485
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:53,791
Flew around the world twice.
Nothing.

486
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,294
Cowards must have run away.
We'll find them.

487
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:01,674
-Quite a reunion, huh?
-You're telling me.

488
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:03,676
What's it been?
Like, three, four years?

489
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,095
Eight years, seven months, and six days.

490
00:38:06,512 --> 00:38:07,555
I haven't forgotten...

491
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:10,308
the last time I saw you, or didn't see you,
because you left.

492
00:38:11,017 --> 00:38:13,811
It's kind of an oversimplification
to say that I left.

493
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:16,064
No, you left.
You did.

494
00:38:16,189 --> 00:38:18,066
You wrote me a beautiful
handwritten letter.

495
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:19,359
I should know, I was there.

496
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:22,904
-You weren't there, actually, hence the note.
-I was.

497
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:28,243
And if you weren't there to see me leave,
then maybe it was you that left.

498
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,620
Fair point.

499
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:32,789
Not that it matters.

500
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:34,499
-Like, who's keeping track, right?
-No, yeah.

501
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,168
I suppose we both left and both got left.

502
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:39,003
Now you're leaving again.

503
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:43,341
Miek, we need detailed accounts
from all the witnesses.

504
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,802
Darryl, get me all the names of the children
who have been lost.

505
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:48,763
Your Majesty, my daughter has been taken,
and I don't know where she is.

506
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,431
And she'll be found.

507
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:53,351
Guys, they're bleeding.
Get them to the infirmary. Now!

508
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,561
Darryl!

509
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:58,523
Majesty, should we start working
on a performance of this entire debacle?

510
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,108
The people need entertainment.

511
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:02,026
Particularly now, in times of crisis.

512
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:03,695
Particularly.

513
00:39:05,738 --> 00:39:06,990
I did not hear a, "No."

514
00:39:07,365 --> 00:39:08,616
Nor did I.

515
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:09,951
-Asgard. Night.
-Yes!

516
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:11,286
We open on some sleeping children.

517
00:39:15,582 --> 00:39:17,625
So, that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

518
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:19,294
The old ex-girlfriend.

519
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,545
Jodie Foster.

520
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:21,671
Jane Foster.

521
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:23,006
The one that got away.

522
00:39:23,548 --> 00:39:24,757
The one that got away.

523
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:25,925
That means escaped.

524
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,677
Yeah. Yeah... Yeah.

525
00:39:28,094 --> 00:39:30,263
Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend...

526
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,099
and your ex-hammer hangin' out,
and getting on so well.

527
00:39:37,312 --> 00:39:38,563
What you up to, bro?

528
00:39:39,606 --> 00:39:40,648
Come on.

529
00:39:41,107 --> 00:39:42,442
Come to daddy.

530
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:45,445
Come on. Mjolnir.

531
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:49,449
Hey! There you are.

532
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:50,992
Hey.

533
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:53,077
-Do you know what I think we should do?
-I was just calling you.

534
00:39:53,203 --> 00:39:55,788
-Start an army!
-With what? Half our soldiers are dead!

535
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:57,373
Half our soldiers are always dead!

536
00:39:57,582 --> 00:39:59,042
-Everyone, please...
-Where are the children?

537
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,752
...go home.
I promise you we'll have news soon.

538
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,253
Someone needs to tell us what happened.

539
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:03,922
We shall find them.

540
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:07,175
-I just don't understand.
-You know what?

541
00:40:07,383 --> 00:40:08,635
This is all our fault.

542
00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:09,844
Stop it!

543
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:11,054
Asgard!

544
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:22,982
My friends, we must not quarrel.

545
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:26,361
In times like this, we need to unite,
come together.

546
00:40:27,112 --> 00:40:28,947
I see what's happening here.

547
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:30,949
You're afraid.

548
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,493
Scared.

549
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:35,870
Afraid.

550
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,080
Anxious.

551
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:42,836
If we are to find the children,
we must first look within ourselves.

552
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:47,632
I'm sorry. Miek, it's very hard
to give a rousing speech with the... noise.

553
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:49,134
-What are you doing?
-She's taking minutes.

554
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,677
Precious minutes we don't have.

555
00:40:51,845 --> 00:40:52,762
You want the kids back?

556
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:55,515
I'll be back in a minute.

557
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:57,809
You can write that down, Miek.

558
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:01,855
No!

559
00:41:10,613 --> 00:41:13,533
Stormbreaker, what are you doing?
Is this about Mjolnir?

560
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,368
Everyone, out!

561
00:41:18,163 --> 00:41:19,122
Didn't find them.

562
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,248
Bae, your cape's on fire.

563
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:21,374
It's fine. It'll grow back.

564
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,542
I'm invoicing you for this.

565
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:23,585
Listen.

566
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:25,170
What do we know about this guy?

567
00:41:25,336 --> 00:41:28,131
-He travels through shadows.
-And he creates monsters with them.

568
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:29,883
Absolutely freaky monsters.

569
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:31,926
He also wields the Necrosword.
How do I know that?

570
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:33,386
Because he almost speared me
in the face with it.

571
00:41:33,553 --> 00:41:34,637
What's a Necrosword?

572
00:41:34,846 --> 00:41:37,640
It's an ancient weapon that's been passed
through hands since the dawn of time.

573
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:40,351
It has the ability to slay gods...

574
00:41:40,518 --> 00:41:43,188
but it slowly corrupts and kills
whoever wields it, which means...

575
00:41:43,354 --> 00:41:46,316
-So, it infected him.
-It's infecting him. Yes. It must be.

576
00:41:46,608 --> 00:41:50,987
So basically, we're up against a cursed,
shadow-zombie kidnapper.

577
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:52,822
Awesome. When do we leave?

578
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:53,990
Thor.

579
00:41:54,783 --> 00:41:55,825
Can you see me?

580
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:57,160
Floating head alert.

581
00:41:57,243 --> 00:41:59,162
It's Astrid. Heimdall's son.

582
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:00,955
Astrid, are you okay?

583
00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:03,124
I no longer go by the name Astrid.

584
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:05,210
I'm now known as Axl.

585
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:07,504
He's a singer from a popular band
I heard on Earth.

586
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,838
-G N' R.
-Astrid...

587
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:10,924
your father gave you
a very tough Viking name...

588
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:12,592
and I intend to honor his wishes.

589
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:13,760
-Axl.
-Astrid.

590
00:42:13,927 --> 00:42:15,053
-I said Axl.
-Astrid.

591
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:17,305
-Axl!
-It's asshole. Now listen to him!

592
00:42:17,472 --> 00:42:20,141
All right, fine, Axl. Where are you?

593
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:23,436
I'm not sure. I don't know how to use
my magic eyes yet.

594
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:25,063
Your father taught me
and I'm gonna teach you.

595
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,607
I need you to focus and hold out your hand.

596
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:30,235
Okay, good. Now focus.

597
00:42:30,402 --> 00:42:31,569
Close your eyes.

598
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:38,576
Thor!

599
00:42:40,537 --> 00:42:41,871
Hey, how's it going, kids?

600
00:42:42,038 --> 00:42:43,873
"How's it going?" Look where we are.

601
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,959
We're in a cage made of spikes.

602
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,253
Yes, right. Not good. Yeah.

603
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:49,379
Are you gonna do something?

604
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:51,172
Yes. Yes, I am, but just not right now.

605
00:42:51,297 --> 00:42:53,299
I'm the vision ghost. Look.

606
00:42:54,718 --> 00:42:56,386
-See?
-What will happen to us?

607
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,098
Who can tell? I mean,
this is a very, very bad situation.

608
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,684
You know,
the good news is you're Asgardians.

609
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:04,936
So, if you die, you'll end up in Valhalla.

610
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:06,229
Oh, my God. Go away.

611
00:43:06,354 --> 00:43:07,439
Wait, wait. Listen.

612
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:12,485
Okay. It's all right, children.
Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

613
00:43:12,652 --> 00:43:15,905
Listen, I've got a plan, okay? I'm putting
together a really, really good team.

614
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:19,826
We've got Uncle Korg, King Valkyrie...

615
00:43:20,785 --> 00:43:24,331
my ex-girlfriend, Jane, which is a whole
other story I won't bore you with, okay?

616
00:43:24,497 --> 00:43:26,458
But it is a top-notch team...

617
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:28,585
and we're gonna have you home
before you know it.

618
00:43:28,793 --> 00:43:29,919
Yeah.

619
00:43:37,302 --> 00:43:38,345
I know where you are.

620
00:43:41,473 --> 00:43:42,682
I'm gonna get you out of here.

621
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:45,393
I'm scared. We all are.

622
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:48,563
Thor! Thor! Save us.

623
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:53,318
Get me out of here.
You take care, okay?

624
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:55,278
Take care. I'll see you soon.
All right?

625
00:43:55,403 --> 00:43:56,696
Axl, get me out of here!

626
00:43:58,239 --> 00:43:59,282
They're in the Shadow Realm.

627
00:43:59,407 --> 00:44:00,408
How do you know?

628
00:44:00,575 --> 00:44:03,203
The heavy atmosphere there
has a darkness like no other.

629
00:44:03,328 --> 00:44:05,330
It's as if color fears to tread.
It's unmistakable.

630
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:07,707
Well then, if it's color we need...

631
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:09,668
let's bring the rainbow.

632
00:44:11,711 --> 00:44:13,588
"Bring the rainbow"?
Is that a catchphrase or something?

633
00:44:13,755 --> 00:44:15,298
She's only been a Thor for a minute.

634
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:18,176
I mean, saving lives, she's quite good at.
But the rest of it, she needs work.

635
00:44:18,301 --> 00:44:20,178
-How many catchphrases have there been?
-A lot.

636
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,682
Yep. Jumped the gun.

637
00:44:23,932 --> 00:44:26,935
Hang on, he moves through shadows
and he's going to the Shadow Realm...

638
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:28,561
it seems like that's where
he's going to be the most powerful.

639
00:44:28,728 --> 00:44:30,689
You're right. We can't just go
marching in there. It could be a trap.

640
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:32,274
We'd be endangering the children.

641
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:34,276
We need reinforcements.
We must raise an army.

642
00:44:34,401 --> 00:44:35,652
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

643
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:37,028
-I'm thinking it.
-What are we thinking?

644
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:38,572
-Thinking what?
-I'm thinking it too.

645
00:44:38,738 --> 00:44:39,906
Omnipotence City.

646
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:42,742
What's Omnipotence City?

647
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:45,120
It's the home of the most powerful gods
in the universe.

648
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:47,122
We could pull together
the greatest team ever.

649
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:49,374
We could recruit Ra, Hercules...

650
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:50,625
Tūmatauenga.

651
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:54,504
Quetzalcoatl, maybe. And Zeus,
the oldest and wisest of them all.

652
00:44:54,629 --> 00:44:55,922
Did you say Zeus?

653
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:56,923
Yeah, Zeus.

654
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:58,383
Like, the Zeus. Zeus-Zeus?

655
00:44:58,592 --> 00:44:59,843
I'm not sure if he has a second name.

656
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,220
Do you think my god will be there,
Ninny of the Nonny?

657
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:04,347
You never know, Korg. But if they are,
we'll ask them to join our team.

658
00:45:04,514 --> 00:45:05,348
Yes.

659
00:45:05,515 --> 00:45:06,516
Stormbreaker.

660
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,185
All right. Calm down. Relax.

661
00:45:09,352 --> 00:45:12,230
No, no, no, mate, we are not traveling
in Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

662
00:45:12,355 --> 00:45:13,231
Look what just happened.

663
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:15,567
We can't exactly go in your tiny, little,
flying portal horse, can we?

664
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:16,610
We won't all fit.

665
00:45:16,776 --> 00:45:18,153
What are you talking about?
Warsong's awesome.

666
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,404
Stormbreaker's awesome too.

667
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:20,864
Stormbreaker just needs a conduit.

668
00:45:21,031 --> 00:45:22,407
Anything that can handle space travel.

669
00:45:22,616 --> 00:45:23,783
I love it when she talks shop.

670
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:25,118
It has the power to get us there...

671
00:45:25,327 --> 00:45:28,914
it just needs something to focus that energy
so it's not so unpredictable.

672
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,999
You know, if we had a ship
we could harness it...

673
00:45:31,124 --> 00:45:32,626
and use Stormbreaker as a power source.

674
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:34,419
-Oh, like an engine.
-Like an engine.

675
00:45:34,586 --> 00:45:35,921
You need a ship?

676
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:37,505
I've got a ship.

677
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:43,303
Get rid of all those seats.

678
00:45:43,428 --> 00:45:45,472
And you guys,
go tie those goats to the front.

679
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:46,890
We leave in 15 minutes.

680
00:45:47,057 --> 00:45:48,892
Essentials only, everyone.

681
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:50,602
That's essential.

682
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,187
Fifteen minutes to departure!

683
00:45:52,395 --> 00:45:53,939
Well, you moved on quick, didn't you?

684
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:57,275
You're some piece of work.

685
00:45:58,777 --> 00:46:00,570
-Oh, hey!
-Hey.

686
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,365
-Just catching up with an old friend.
-Yeah.

687
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,325
I've been meaning to apologize.

688
00:46:05,742 --> 00:46:08,703
Sorta acting a little weird before.
I just haven't really been myself lately.

689
00:46:08,912 --> 00:46:10,413
You know, kind of...

690
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:13,500
Trying to figure out who I am,
and just felt a little bit lost.

691
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:16,253
And then, all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me...

692
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:17,712
and it was kind of...

693
00:46:17,879 --> 00:46:19,339
It's a lot for me, too.

694
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,676
So, how did you guys get together?
How did this happen?

695
00:46:23,301 --> 00:46:26,346
I swear I heard Mjolnir call to me.

696
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:28,056
Ah, did it?

697
00:46:28,223 --> 00:46:29,808
And so I came here to investigate...

698
00:46:30,058 --> 00:46:32,686
and its pieces started
glowing and swirling, and then...

699
00:46:32,978 --> 00:46:33,979
Crazy.

700
00:46:34,312 --> 00:46:35,564
...Thor.

701
00:46:36,022 --> 00:46:39,151
Well, you know what,
it looks good on you, it works, so...

702
00:46:43,238 --> 00:46:44,239
Just checking.

703
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,286
See you later.

704
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:51,538
Five minutes to departure!

705
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,793
What?

706
00:46:57,335 --> 00:46:58,628
We were just talking.

707
00:47:09,848 --> 00:47:12,142
Mommy, don't leave me.

708
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:14,186
Don't be afraid.

709
00:47:15,687 --> 00:47:17,272
Even when I'm gone, honey...

710
00:47:19,065 --> 00:47:20,775
You won't be alone.

711
00:47:23,528 --> 00:47:25,530
And whatever happens...

712
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:29,117
never stop fighting.

713
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,536
Never stop fighting.

714
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,385
Hey. You all right?

715
00:47:47,636 --> 00:47:48,637
Great.

716
00:47:50,263 --> 00:47:51,640
The sink would say otherwise.

717
00:47:53,517 --> 00:47:55,060
You think I really should be coming?

718
00:47:55,268 --> 00:47:56,645
I'm not getting any better.

719
00:47:56,812 --> 00:47:58,563
You're a Thor. Of course, you should come.

720
00:47:58,939 --> 00:48:00,273
Besides, what else are you gonna do?

721
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,733
You're a Viking now.

722
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,069
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle...

723
00:48:04,236 --> 00:48:06,321
and it needs to be devastatingly painful.

724
00:48:06,446 --> 00:48:07,781
Otherwise, you don't get into Valhalla.

725
00:48:08,406 --> 00:48:09,491
That's my plan.

726
00:48:09,616 --> 00:48:11,868
What about, you know, kinging and stuff?

727
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,663
I love being king.
I love my people...

728
00:48:14,788 --> 00:48:16,206
but it's all meetings and raven-mail...

729
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:17,958
and meetings that could've been raven-mail.

730
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,334
I miss fighting.

731
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:20,585
I miss my sisters.

732
00:48:20,752 --> 00:48:22,671
Which is why you need to come,
'cause I need one.

733
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:24,798
Okay, we should go.

734
00:48:25,132 --> 00:48:26,174
You packed?

735
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:27,759
Are you packed?

736
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:30,470
Yes!

737
00:48:33,098 --> 00:48:34,141
A hand grenade?

738
00:48:34,307 --> 00:48:35,767
No. It's a portable speaker.

739
00:48:42,607 --> 00:48:43,608
Let's go.

740
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:48,071
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps?

741
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:49,531
I got you.

742
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:53,952
My fellow Asgardians...

743
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:58,498
Wish us well, for we shall travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

744
00:48:58,707 --> 00:49:01,376
We will return with children.

745
00:49:02,878 --> 00:49:04,463
Many children.

746
00:49:04,629 --> 00:49:05,922
And then we shall feast!

747
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:07,382
Not on the children.

748
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:09,843
We do not do that anymore.

749
00:49:09,968 --> 00:49:12,512
Those were dark times. Shameful times.

750
00:49:13,305 --> 00:49:14,598
Okay, we should go.

751
00:50:01,186 --> 00:50:02,813
So, you still rollerblading?

752
00:50:02,979 --> 00:50:04,731
No. No. You?

753
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:06,191
Oh, yeah. Every weekend.

754
00:50:06,316 --> 00:50:08,235
Once you blade, you never fade.
Right, Korg?

755
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,277
Skate mates for life!

756
00:50:09,444 --> 00:50:11,405
-Hey, can I run something by you?
-Yeah.

757
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,531
So, I was thinking...

758
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:15,951
when we get to the bad guy, what about
if I had, like, a cool catchphrase?

759
00:50:16,743 --> 00:50:18,036
Like, "Eat this hammer!"

760
00:50:18,704 --> 00:50:21,456
Or, like, "Check out my hammer."

761
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,709
Like, what about...

762
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,752
No...
I'm workshopping it.

763
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,255
No, they are all really good.
Mine is...

764
00:50:28,422 --> 00:50:30,215
"This ends here and now."

765
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,508
Oh, that's such a good one.

766
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:32,801
Took me a long time to perfect it.

767
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,303
You'll get there.
You just need to practice.

768
00:50:34,428 --> 00:50:35,804
Just my first bad guy.

769
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:37,347
You never forget your first.

770
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:41,727
Yeah.

771
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:43,645
So, you got a girlfriend?

772
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:47,774
No, no. Too busy, don't have time,
you know?

773
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:50,235
Just the work and everything.

774
00:50:50,402 --> 00:50:52,404
Cool. Gonna check this place out.

775
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:57,951
So cool.

776
00:50:58,118 --> 00:50:59,119
Who's so cool?

777
00:50:59,328 --> 00:51:00,704
The buildings are cool.

778
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:02,664
-What's happening there?
-Where?

779
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:05,334
Am I sensing feelings?

780
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:07,628
Feelings? What, for Jane?

781
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:09,212
No, don't be ridiculous. Feelings.

782
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:11,089
The last time we had feelings were...

783
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:12,883
long time ago. Long, long gone.
I think you...

784
00:51:13,008 --> 00:51:14,635
-Maybe you have feelings.
-Right.

785
00:51:15,761 --> 00:51:17,554
-Mate, relax. We're on the same team.
-I don't know.

786
00:51:17,763 --> 00:51:20,098
Know exactly what team we're on, okay?

787
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:21,642
Team Jane.

788
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:28,482
Thing about Thor
is that he always bounces back.

789
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,400
-Yeah.
-Like when Hela stole his hammer...

790
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:33,445
he went and built an axe which was forged
in the heart of a dying star.

791
00:51:36,698 --> 00:51:39,159
And the same axe was used
to cut off Thanos' head.

792
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,663
That's a good one.

793
00:51:45,707 --> 00:51:47,960
What a neat story!

794
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:53,048
With all this talk
about chopping off heads...

795
00:51:53,298 --> 00:51:54,633
I wanna have a go.

796
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:56,468
What's this?

797
00:52:01,807 --> 00:52:04,309
This is Octy.
Hello, Octy.

798
00:52:04,685 --> 00:52:06,144
How are you?

799
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:08,564
You know what Octy loves?

800
00:52:09,022 --> 00:52:11,024
Having his head ripped off!

801
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,656
What?
You liked it a second ago.

802
00:52:18,824 --> 00:52:20,158
All right, all right, all right.

803
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:21,535
Octy's gone.

804
00:52:25,497 --> 00:52:26,540
Come on.

805
00:52:27,332 --> 00:52:28,625
I'm scared.

806
00:52:29,126 --> 00:52:30,335
Look at you.

807
00:52:31,545 --> 00:52:34,506
I knew a little girl just like you.

808
00:52:35,048 --> 00:52:38,677
And she was brave,
and she was smart...

809
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,932
and funny and she liked to draw.

810
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:48,478
Let me ask you a question...

811
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,190
about gods.

812
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:53,859
They're meant to protect you, right?

813
00:52:54,484 --> 00:52:55,861
Well, where are they?

814
00:52:55,986 --> 00:52:58,697
-Thor is on his way.
-Yeah!

815
00:52:58,864 --> 00:53:01,533
Yes. I'm counting on that.

816
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:04,369
That's why you're here.

817
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:10,626
It's invitation only, so we're gonna have
to keep a low profile and blend in.

818
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:13,337
Luckily, disguises are my specialty.

819
00:53:14,046 --> 00:53:15,088
Greek philosopher?

820
00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:16,798
Got us these.

821
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:18,342
What are those?

822
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:19,510
Actual disguises.

823
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,387
They're the cloaks of the emotion gods.

824
00:53:22,763 --> 00:53:26,225
Every color signifies a different emotion.

825
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:28,143
Where are the emotion gods?

826
00:53:28,477 --> 00:53:29,728
Don't ask.

827
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:34,233
Holy shit.

828
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:45,244
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

829
00:53:45,452 --> 00:53:48,664
This is where the most powerful creator gods
in the universe hang out.

830
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:55,462
There's the god of magic,
the god of dreams...

831
00:53:55,629 --> 00:53:56,630
the god of carpentry.

832
00:53:56,922 --> 00:53:58,006
Look at that one.

833
00:53:58,173 --> 00:53:59,842
Oh, yes. That's Bao, god of dumplings.

834
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:01,927
-Hey, Bao!
-Bao.

835
00:54:02,094 --> 00:54:03,095
Look up there, guys!

836
00:54:03,262 --> 00:54:05,139
That's the Kronan god, Ninny of the Nonny.

837
00:54:05,806 --> 00:54:07,474
Hey, Ninny Nonny!

838
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:20,571
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

839
00:54:20,696 --> 00:54:23,240
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

840
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:51,059
Yes.

841
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:53,771
I am Zeus!

842
00:54:58,233 --> 00:54:59,485
There he is!

843
00:54:59,651 --> 00:55:01,612
The man, the myth, the legend.

844
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:02,988
I don't know if you know this...

845
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:05,199
but I base a lot of what I do
on this guy.

846
00:55:05,365 --> 00:55:06,950
He's the god of lightning,
I'm the god of thunder.

847
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:09,203
-Huge source of inspiration.
-That's really good.

848
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:11,955
You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

849
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:15,501
How do we get up there?
Do we just, like, fly?

850
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:17,002
No, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of an entrance.

851
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:18,796
He's famous for his entrances.

852
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:20,756
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt!

853
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:22,299
Yes!

854
00:55:25,052 --> 00:55:26,386
Zeus!

855
00:55:35,771 --> 00:55:37,856
Yes! Thunderbolt!

856
00:55:45,614 --> 00:55:46,490
Order.

857
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,283
Order!

858
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,579
Silence! Silence!

859
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:58,711
I hereby open...

860
00:55:59,336 --> 00:56:02,589
this holy council of the god.

861
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:07,511
Where we have many, many serious matter
to be talk about.

862
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:09,054
Such as...

863
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:12,182
where are we going to hold this year's orgy?

864
00:56:12,933 --> 00:56:14,184
Is this guy for real?

865
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:15,519
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

866
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:17,354
Yeah, I'm sure he has a point, okay?

867
00:56:17,855 --> 00:56:18,856
Sorry.

868
00:56:19,064 --> 00:56:20,190
So now we're going to announce the winner...

869
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:25,446
of the, "Most human souls sacrificed
in the name of a god."

870
00:56:25,821 --> 00:56:27,072
Okay, maybe he's not that great.

871
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:28,657
Oh, no, not good.

872
00:56:28,824 --> 00:56:30,451
No, I don't think it's gonna get
any better than this.

873
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:32,077
Look, these gods aren't gonna help.

874
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:34,747
But that thunderbolt,
I think that might be of use.

875
00:56:34,913 --> 00:56:36,832
Jane, you go right.
Thor, you go left.

876
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:39,376
We bum-rush him, take the bolt,
ding-dong.

877
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:41,628
-All right, let's go get it!
-No, no, no, wait!

878
00:56:41,795 --> 00:56:43,464
There's no ding-donging or bum-rushing.

879
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,049
Especially not Zeus' bum.

880
00:56:45,257 --> 00:56:46,759
When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

881
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:47,760
The time is right now.

882
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:48,844
Time is not right now.

883
00:56:49,011 --> 00:56:50,262
Who is talking?

884
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:51,513
Who is talking?

885
00:56:51,722 --> 00:56:52,973
-These guys.
-Korg, shut up.

886
00:56:53,098 --> 00:56:55,601
Do you have something to say to the group?

887
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:56,977
Sorry.

888
00:56:57,102 --> 00:56:59,855
I'm bashing heads in 60 seconds,
so speak fast.

889
00:57:00,022 --> 00:57:01,398
Literally, heads will roll.

890
00:57:02,232 --> 00:57:03,484
Who are you two?

891
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:05,402
Hello.

892
00:57:06,028 --> 00:57:08,489
Let me be the first to say it is an honor
and a privilege to be...

893
00:57:08,655 --> 00:57:09,823
No, I can't hear you.

894
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,325
Why don't you take the stage?

895
00:57:11,784 --> 00:57:13,369
The stage down there?

896
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:17,831
Well, yes. You see the area
that looks very much like a stage?

897
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:20,292
Got ya.

898
00:57:27,508 --> 00:57:28,467
Coming through.

899
00:57:29,718 --> 00:57:31,011
Oops. Sorry.

900
00:57:31,136 --> 00:57:32,137
Good luck, bro.

901
00:57:39,979 --> 00:57:41,230
Mighty Zeus!

902
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:42,982
Wow!

903
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:45,109
Gods of the universe...

904
00:57:45,651 --> 00:57:48,904
I come here to ask for your help,
to raise an army.

905
00:57:49,154 --> 00:57:52,157
There's a maniac called the God Butcher
who seeks to end us all.

906
00:57:52,324 --> 00:57:53,826
His destruction is everywhere.

907
00:57:54,034 --> 00:57:56,036
Entire planets, realms...

908
00:57:56,161 --> 00:57:57,621
have been left completely unprotected.

909
00:57:57,788 --> 00:57:59,915
He's left nothing but chaos in his wake.

910
00:58:00,332 --> 00:58:01,875
But I know where he is...

911
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:06,130
and with your help we can crush him
before he kills anyone else.

912
00:58:06,755 --> 00:58:08,007
That guy...

913
00:58:08,132 --> 00:58:11,093
he killed a couple of low-level god.

914
00:58:11,343 --> 00:58:12,344
Boo-hoo.

915
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:13,929
If that's all...

916
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:15,180
pretty boy...

917
00:58:15,306 --> 00:58:17,141
you go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

918
00:58:17,266 --> 00:58:20,269
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Did you not hear any of what I just said?

919
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:22,396
He's murdering en masse.

920
00:58:22,563 --> 00:58:24,690
I tell you one time...

921
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:25,816
now, you shut up.

922
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:26,984
You be quiet.

923
00:58:27,151 --> 00:58:29,820
Because you are this close
to being uninvited to the orgy.

924
00:58:29,945 --> 00:58:32,197
Zeus, we must do something.

925
00:58:32,364 --> 00:58:34,158
You cannot come to the orgy!

926
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:36,243
-You have to listen to us!
-That's it!

927
00:58:36,827 --> 00:58:37,870
Shackle!

928
00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:41,957
Your Highness, whenever you're ready,
you just tell me.

929
00:58:42,124 --> 00:58:43,250
-We go on my signal.
-Mm-hmm.

930
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:44,418
What is the signal?

931
00:58:44,543 --> 00:58:45,544
It'll be, "Go."

932
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:51,050
Let's see who you are.

933
00:58:51,175 --> 00:58:52,843
I take off your disguise.

934
00:58:52,968 --> 00:58:53,928
And flick!

935
00:59:02,102 --> 00:59:03,812
You flicked too hard, damn it!

936
00:59:06,315 --> 00:59:08,525
Should we help him?

937
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:10,110
I mean, eventually.

938
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:11,278
Grape?

939
00:59:11,445 --> 00:59:13,113
Looks like a shy courgette.

940
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,032
And what about the others?

941
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:16,325
We take off their disguise too.

942
00:59:16,492 --> 00:59:17,743
Oh, no. No. Don't flick us.

943
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:18,911
It's cool.

944
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:20,496
Disguise gone!

945
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:21,413
Disguise off. Cool?

946
00:59:21,622 --> 00:59:22,957
Asgardians.

947
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,918
I thought we'd seen the last of you
when Odin died.

948
00:59:27,336 --> 00:59:29,630
You are Thor...

949
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:31,632
the God of Thunder.

950
00:59:32,383 --> 00:59:35,594
But is not thunder
just the sound of lightning?

951
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:39,139
Good one, Dad.

952
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:40,516
Zeus, this is bigger than us.

953
00:59:40,683 --> 00:59:42,685
He's taken Asgardian children.

954
00:59:42,893 --> 00:59:46,105
Who do you think we are?
The god police?

955
00:59:47,022 --> 00:59:49,984
Every god watches over their own peoples.

956
00:59:50,401 --> 00:59:53,028
Nothing more, nothing less.

957
00:59:53,195 --> 00:59:54,822
Asgardian problems...

958
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:57,908
are Asgardian problems.

959
00:59:58,534 --> 01:00:00,536
How the mighty have fallen.

960
01:00:00,661 --> 01:00:02,872
My hero, Zeus...

961
01:00:03,038 --> 01:00:04,039
afraid.

962
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,553
Couple of thing.

963
01:00:18,304 --> 01:00:21,307
One, yes, I am scared.

964
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:24,185
Gorr has the Necrosword...

965
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,437
which means he could kill us.

966
01:00:26,979 --> 01:00:28,355
Not good. Two...

967
01:00:28,522 --> 01:00:30,441
I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

968
01:00:30,608 --> 01:00:31,817
I understand.

969
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:34,153
But all you do is cause a panic.

970
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,280
Panic is not good.

971
01:00:36,405 --> 01:00:37,990
We are safe here.

972
01:00:38,157 --> 01:00:40,451
You, my friend. You are safe here.

973
01:00:41,076 --> 01:00:42,661
So, chill, baby cake.

974
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:45,414
Have some wine, have some grape.

975
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:47,082
Anything goes here...

976
01:00:47,249 --> 01:00:49,460
in Omnipotence City.

977
01:00:50,252 --> 01:00:52,671
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

978
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:55,174
I flicked too hard.
I put your clothes back on.

979
01:00:56,926 --> 01:00:58,344
Now I put your clothes back on!

980
01:00:58,552 --> 01:00:59,386
Flick, flick.

981
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:02,264
For this is the Golden Temple of the god.

982
01:01:02,765 --> 01:01:04,934
It's not a rudie-nudie festival.

983
01:01:05,351 --> 01:01:08,020
If you're not gonna help us,
then at least let us use your weapon.

984
01:01:08,187 --> 01:01:09,563
We need your lightning bolt.

985
01:01:10,272 --> 01:01:12,483
My lightning bolt is called Thunderbolt.

986
01:01:12,608 --> 01:01:15,861
So, I think to use
somebody's secret weapon like this...

987
01:01:16,028 --> 01:01:18,572
that you should at least get the name right
when you ask.

988
01:01:19,198 --> 01:01:20,908
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

989
01:01:21,075 --> 01:01:22,076
Thunderbolt!

990
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:50,688
No!

991
01:01:54,316 --> 01:01:56,068
Do not worry.

992
01:01:56,652 --> 01:01:58,404
The God Butcher...

993
01:01:59,071 --> 01:02:00,990
he will not reach Eternity.

994
01:02:01,365 --> 01:02:02,408
Eternity?

995
01:02:02,533 --> 01:02:04,285
What does he mean, reach Eternity?

996
01:02:07,663 --> 01:02:09,457
Oh, shit.

997
01:02:12,001 --> 01:02:16,422
Eternity is a very powerful being
at the center of the universe.

998
01:02:17,256 --> 01:02:20,259
It will grant the desire
of the first person who reaches it.

999
01:02:20,384 --> 01:02:22,261
So, it's like a wishing well?

1000
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,475
What do you think a guy called
the God Butcher would wish for?

1001
01:02:27,641 --> 01:02:30,561
If he seeks the Altar of Eternity,
that means he could wipe us out at once.

1002
01:02:30,728 --> 01:02:32,354
Zeus, we must act now.

1003
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,231
He's not going to make it.

1004
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,691
He doesn't have the key.

1005
01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:38,069
Is this the purpose of the gods?

1006
01:02:38,194 --> 01:02:40,863
To hide away in a golden palace like cowards?

1007
01:02:41,072 --> 01:02:42,448
Maybe we have lost our way.

1008
01:02:43,115 --> 01:02:45,117
You know what?
We'll stop him ourselves.

1009
01:02:45,284 --> 01:02:47,453
I am afraid I cannot allow that.

1010
01:02:47,745 --> 01:02:50,164
This is a secret place...

1011
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:52,083
known only to the gods.

1012
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,168
You know where we are.

1013
01:02:54,376 --> 01:02:57,963
The God Butcher could use you
to find us.

1014
01:02:58,714 --> 01:03:00,049
This is no good.

1015
01:03:01,217 --> 01:03:02,218
So now...

1016
01:03:03,427 --> 01:03:05,012
you must stay.

1017
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:07,348
Guards!

1018
01:03:10,059 --> 01:03:11,060
Hey.

1019
01:03:11,227 --> 01:03:12,144
Can we do my plan now?

1020
01:03:12,311 --> 01:03:14,146
Yes. Rush his bum.

1021
01:03:14,313 --> 01:03:15,314
Hell, yeah!

1022
01:03:18,401 --> 01:03:19,693
You didn't say, "Go."

1023
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:25,700
Coming, guys!

1024
01:03:35,876 --> 01:03:36,877
Thor, catch!

1025
01:03:40,131 --> 01:03:41,090
Korg!

1026
01:04:00,526 --> 01:04:01,652
Val, duck!

1027
01:04:07,158 --> 01:04:08,159
Korg!

1028
01:04:10,411 --> 01:04:11,203
Thor.

1029
01:04:12,955 --> 01:04:14,957
Oh, no. No. Korg!

1030
01:04:15,624 --> 01:04:19,086
Thor, I'm perishing!

1031
01:04:23,841 --> 01:04:25,051
Zeus!

1032
01:04:27,136 --> 01:04:28,554
You're next, Odinson!

1033
01:04:36,354 --> 01:04:38,564
That's the sound of lightning.

1034
01:04:45,738 --> 01:04:46,947
No!

1035
01:04:47,657 --> 01:04:49,659
Korgi. Korgi!

1036
01:04:49,825 --> 01:04:50,826
Thor.

1037
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:52,411
-Korgi?
-I'm down here.

1038
01:04:52,578 --> 01:04:54,789
Where? Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out. It's okay.

1039
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,290
-Korg. Korgi!
-Here I am!

1040
01:04:56,457 --> 01:04:57,416
I didn't die!

1041
01:04:57,583 --> 01:04:59,627
Oh, my God.
Yes! You're alive!

1042
01:04:59,794 --> 01:05:02,296
Turns out the only part of a Kronan
that's alive is his mouth.

1043
01:05:02,797 --> 01:05:04,757
Korgi, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

1044
01:05:04,924 --> 01:05:05,841
I'll do my best.

1045
01:05:06,008 --> 01:05:07,343
Guard him with your life.

1046
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:08,344
I will.

1047
01:05:08,511 --> 01:05:09,428
Ready to go for a ride?

1048
01:05:13,808 --> 01:05:15,101
Now you've got my six.

1049
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:16,727
Eight o'clock, Val.

1050
01:05:17,687 --> 01:05:18,729
7:48.

1051
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:21,524
I can do this, damn it.

1052
01:05:22,316 --> 01:05:23,609
No, that's not it. No, that's not it.

1053
01:05:23,776 --> 01:05:24,819
Nope.

1054
01:05:24,944 --> 01:05:27,405
Come on, Korg, purse those lips.

1055
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:42,169
I did it!

1056
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,251
And then the goat boat came in,
rescued us...

1057
01:06:22,376 --> 01:06:24,795
and we flew out the window.
The end.

1058
01:06:25,004 --> 01:06:26,547
Another classic Thor adventure.

1059
01:06:27,214 --> 01:06:28,716
I can't believe you killed Zeus.

1060
01:06:28,883 --> 01:06:31,761
Well, you know what they say,
never meet your heroes.

1061
01:06:33,596 --> 01:06:35,806
But what's important is
we are on our way to you right now.

1062
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:37,892
How are you guys doing?
Are you okay?

1063
01:06:38,059 --> 01:06:39,685
We're all right. A little scared.

1064
01:06:39,852 --> 01:06:41,938
Well, listen, I know
what it's like to be scared.

1065
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:43,689
And I'll tell you,
when I was your age...

1066
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:45,483
I don't think I would have been
as brave as you.

1067
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:46,651
Really?

1068
01:06:46,817 --> 01:06:49,654
In fact, might just be
the bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.

1069
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:50,947
All of you.

1070
01:06:51,113 --> 01:06:53,032
So I need you to
keep being brave, all right?

1071
01:06:53,241 --> 01:06:55,409
And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

1072
01:06:55,576 --> 01:06:56,911
Team Kids in a Cage.

1073
01:06:58,621 --> 01:06:59,664
Can you do that?

1074
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:02,416
Yeah. I think we can do that.

1075
01:07:03,084 --> 01:07:04,085
I know you can.

1076
01:07:07,672 --> 01:07:08,714
Right?

1077
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,258
-Thor?
-Yeah.

1078
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:12,093
I'm glad I met my hero.

1079
01:07:12,301 --> 01:07:13,427
Oh, thanks, buddy.

1080
01:07:17,807 --> 01:07:19,559
How are the children?

1081
01:07:19,684 --> 01:07:21,352
As you can imagine, they're a little bit
scared because they're kids...

1082
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:23,062
but I told them that
everything is going to plan.

1083
01:07:23,312 --> 01:07:24,188
Oh, so you lied to them?

1084
01:07:24,397 --> 01:07:25,273
We still have a plan?

1085
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:26,482
-Yes, there's a plan.
-There's no plan.

1086
01:07:26,649 --> 01:07:28,734
-There is a plan.
-No. There's no plan.

1087
01:07:28,901 --> 01:07:30,945
We failed to raise a god army...

1088
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:32,113
Korg is dead.

1089
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,364
-He's not dead.
-I'm not dead.

1090
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:34,991
Well, he's a head. And you...

1091
01:07:35,157 --> 01:07:36,534
you got properly humiliated.

1092
01:07:36,701 --> 01:07:38,995
No, I got properly naked,
which I am okay with.

1093
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:40,705
-Jane?
-I was okay with it.

1094
01:07:40,872 --> 01:07:42,039
-Korg?
-I loved it.

1095
01:07:42,248 --> 01:07:43,958
The point is,
we are going into the Shadow Realm...

1096
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:45,501
weaker than we were before.

1097
01:07:45,668 --> 01:07:46,878
I mean, we're gonna die.

1098
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:48,588
-No one's gonna die, okay?
-Really?

1099
01:07:48,754 --> 01:07:50,923
Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

1100
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,009
-We killed Zeus!
-You killed Zeus.

1101
01:07:53,217 --> 01:07:56,095
I mean, that may or may not be catastrophic
for the whole universe...

1102
01:07:56,304 --> 01:07:58,181
and, sure, the entire god kingdom
is probably going...

1103
01:07:58,347 --> 01:07:59,765
to hunt us down
for the rest of our days...

1104
01:07:59,891 --> 01:08:02,393
but listen, you stole this beautiful weapon.

1105
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,437
All right? This is the army right here.

1106
01:08:04,604 --> 01:08:07,607
It's sleek, it's slender,
it's powerful, it's beautiful...

1107
01:08:09,692 --> 01:08:11,569
For you. I love it for you, Valkyrie.

1108
01:08:11,736 --> 01:08:13,154
I mean, it's not really what I'm into...

1109
01:08:13,404 --> 01:08:15,239
'cause I've got my weapon out there.

1110
01:08:15,448 --> 01:08:16,991
Can I borrow that for a second?

1111
01:08:20,036 --> 01:08:22,330
There you are, old friend.

1112
01:08:22,788 --> 01:08:25,124
That was quite an entrance back there.

1113
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,173
Listen...

1114
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:33,633
are we good?

1115
01:08:33,883 --> 01:08:34,884
Yeah?

1116
01:08:35,051 --> 01:08:37,512
I mean, I know it's a little weird
having my ex-weapon around...

1117
01:08:38,179 --> 01:08:40,097
but come on, Mjolnir, in the past.

1118
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:41,682
It's you and me now, buddy.

1119
01:08:41,974 --> 01:08:43,476
You know what?

1120
01:08:43,684 --> 01:08:45,978
I think it's time for your first beer.
What do you say?

1121
01:08:51,776 --> 01:08:53,194
Delicious.

1122
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:55,530
I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

1123
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:04,622
Hey.

1124
01:09:04,956 --> 01:09:05,957
Oh, hey.

1125
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:10,545
It's quite the view, huh?

1126
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,171
Yeah. Beautiful.

1127
01:09:12,338 --> 01:09:16,008
I just want to say that was very, very
impressive what you did back there.

1128
01:09:16,717 --> 01:09:18,553
You and Mjolnir, you know.

1129
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,181
Yeah.

1130
01:09:24,809 --> 01:09:26,644
-Space dolphins.
-What?

1131
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:28,938
You should see some space dolphins...

1132
01:09:29,105 --> 01:09:30,064
What?

1133
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:32,191
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1134
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,943
Beautiful.

1135
01:09:34,861 --> 01:09:36,237
So beautiful. So rare.

1136
01:09:36,446 --> 01:09:37,488
Very loyal creatures.

1137
01:09:37,655 --> 01:09:40,408
They mate for life, in packs of six.

1138
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:42,368
Just love.

1139
01:09:42,493 --> 01:09:45,413
With a hey ninny-nonny
and a fair finny-fonny

1140
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,833
Ooh, brother man, you look so hot

1141
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,836
I wanna get in your rocks

1142
01:09:52,628 --> 01:09:55,423
When we get together
We're gonna get it on

1143
01:09:55,631 --> 01:09:59,343
And we're all gonna make some babies

1144
01:10:00,136 --> 01:10:04,015
That is the song that my dad sang
to my other dad when they were courting.

1145
01:10:04,182 --> 01:10:07,101
When two Kronans wanna make a baby,
they get together inside a mountain...

1146
01:10:07,268 --> 01:10:10,730
and they go down to a little lava pool,
and they hold hands over the hot lava...

1147
01:10:10,855 --> 01:10:13,107
and then, after a month,
they pull their hands apart...

1148
01:10:13,316 --> 01:10:16,277
and they find they've created
a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1149
01:10:16,861 --> 01:10:18,696
Fascinating. And hot.

1150
01:10:18,946 --> 01:10:20,114
Did you ever have a special someone?

1151
01:10:20,281 --> 01:10:23,117
I've had so many special someones.

1152
01:10:23,242 --> 01:10:25,578
But I don't know...

1153
01:10:26,662 --> 01:10:27,830
I don't know if I want that again.

1154
01:10:27,955 --> 01:10:30,583
Is that because you lost your girlfriend
in battle and never forgave yourself?

1155
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,336
And now, you're just trying to find answers
in the bottom of a bottle...

1156
01:10:33,544 --> 01:10:36,339
or some meaningless dalliance,
which only serves to numb the pain...

1157
01:10:36,547 --> 01:10:39,092
instead of bringing you real happiness
or satisfaction?

1158
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,677
Yeah. Something like that.

1159
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:47,266
Beautiful. Beautiful things.

1160
01:10:51,604 --> 01:10:52,605
Jane.

1161
01:10:53,064 --> 01:10:54,065
Thor.

1162
01:10:54,232 --> 01:10:55,483
I wanna feel shitty about you.

1163
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:56,651
What?

1164
01:11:00,738 --> 01:11:04,367
I wanna feel shitty about something
and I think that's you.

1165
01:11:04,575 --> 01:11:05,618
Not really getting any better.

1166
01:11:05,827 --> 01:11:07,203
It's not, is it? Damn it.

1167
01:11:08,913 --> 01:11:11,541
My friend, he told me
that it's better to feel shitty...

1168
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:14,752
from losing love
than it is to never experience love...

1169
01:11:14,919 --> 01:11:16,295
and to feel nothing at all,
to feel empty...

1170
01:11:16,462 --> 01:11:17,505
and I think he was right...

1171
01:11:18,423 --> 01:11:20,842
which is how I've been feeling
for a long time.

1172
01:11:21,009 --> 01:11:23,302
I've pushed people away,
kept them at a distance...

1173
01:11:23,511 --> 01:11:24,762
because of the fear of that loss...

1174
01:11:24,929 --> 01:11:26,931
but I don't wanna do that anymore.
I don't wanna live like that.

1175
01:11:27,098 --> 01:11:28,766
Better to close off your heart
than feel the pain.

1176
01:11:28,933 --> 01:11:31,144
That's what I did, yes.
I closed off my heart...

1177
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,021
and I meditated.
Did you meditate?

1178
01:11:33,187 --> 01:11:34,355
No. It's so boring.

1179
01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:36,190
It actually made me more angry.

1180
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,777
But I'm tired of giving myself over
to the idea of fate...

1181
01:11:39,944 --> 01:11:42,196
and trying to figure out
what the universe wants from me.

1182
01:11:42,363 --> 01:11:44,824
I wanna live in the moment,
I wanna live like there's no tomorrow...

1183
01:11:44,991 --> 01:11:46,075
throw caution to the wind.

1184
01:11:46,242 --> 01:11:48,202
I wanna be with you, Jane.

1185
01:11:49,162 --> 01:11:50,330
What do you say?

1186
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,540
I have cancer.

1187
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:55,918
I'm sorry. What?

1188
01:11:56,586 --> 01:11:57,587
I'm sick.

1189
01:11:57,754 --> 01:11:59,297
-Wait. What's happening?
-Bye.

1190
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:02,342
No, no, no. Jane, Jane, Jane.
Wait, wait, wait. Jane.

1191
01:12:02,592 --> 01:12:05,094
What did I say? I didn't mean that.
Just kidding.

1192
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:08,264
I don't have cancer.

1193
01:12:08,431 --> 01:12:09,849
Let's go smash something.

1194
01:12:10,642 --> 01:12:11,643
Jane, I'm so sorry.

1195
01:12:11,809 --> 01:12:13,770
Don't be sorry for me.

1196
01:12:15,355 --> 01:12:16,856
When did you find out?

1197
01:12:19,025 --> 01:12:20,902
Like six months ago.

1198
01:12:20,985 --> 01:12:24,864
I was just feeling tired,
and then they told me I have Stage Four.

1199
01:12:25,031 --> 01:12:26,741
Get my affairs in order.

1200
01:12:27,533 --> 01:12:29,911
And then I heard Mjolnir calling me...

1201
01:12:30,662 --> 01:12:33,122
so I thought maybe,
if science isn't working...

1202
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,542
maybe Viking space magic.

1203
01:12:37,543 --> 01:12:39,003
That's why you came to New Asgard.

1204
01:12:39,128 --> 01:12:42,006
Yeah, I thought the hammer
maybe could cure me...

1205
01:12:42,131 --> 01:12:45,051
and I think it's getting better.

1206
01:12:45,802 --> 01:12:47,178
Maybe not.

1207
01:12:48,221 --> 01:12:50,431
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

1208
01:12:50,682 --> 01:12:52,934
We don't know what tomorrow holds.

1209
01:12:53,059 --> 01:12:54,060
And Mjolnir...

1210
01:12:54,394 --> 01:12:55,687
Mjolnir chose you.

1211
01:12:56,562 --> 01:12:58,481
And it chose you because you're worthy.

1212
01:12:58,648 --> 01:12:59,899
And that's something.

1213
01:13:00,066 --> 01:13:01,192
When I first met you...

1214
01:13:01,859 --> 01:13:04,487
I was unworthy.
I was unable to pick up that hammer.

1215
01:13:05,363 --> 01:13:06,572
But you taught me...

1216
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:09,701
there is no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

1217
01:13:10,368 --> 01:13:12,453
You made me worthy.

1218
01:13:13,997 --> 01:13:16,124
So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

1219
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,294
Okay.

1220
01:13:19,419 --> 01:13:21,212
Now what do you wanna do?

1221
01:13:22,338 --> 01:13:25,008
I wanna get those children
back to their families.

1222
01:13:25,174 --> 01:13:26,426
I wanna finish that mission.

1223
01:13:27,677 --> 01:13:29,053
Spoken like a true Thor.

1224
01:13:30,847 --> 01:13:32,140
How do you feel now?

1225
01:13:33,349 --> 01:13:34,517
So scared.

1226
01:13:35,852 --> 01:13:36,853
How are you feeling?

1227
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,146
Shitty.

1228
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:39,188
How shitty?

1229
01:13:39,355 --> 01:13:41,065
-Really shitty.
-Well, then...

1230
01:13:52,118 --> 01:13:54,120
I wonder what those two are talking about
out there.

1231
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:56,080
Yeah, they're not talking.

1232
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:03,129
Do you think those two will ever hold hands
over a hot lava pool and make a Thor baby?

1233
01:14:04,964 --> 01:14:07,133
It's unlikely, sadly.

1234
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:10,386
That's too bad.
I think Thor would make a great dad.

1235
01:14:13,598 --> 01:14:15,016
Hey. We're here.

1236
01:14:23,983 --> 01:14:25,568
Where did all the color go?

1237
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,270
They're not here.

1238
01:15:05,775 --> 01:15:06,818
Where are they?

1239
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:27,797
What the hell is this place?

1240
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:58,161
Bifrost is the key?

1241
01:16:07,504 --> 01:16:08,838
It's a trap!

1242
01:16:26,231 --> 01:16:28,650
You wanna tell me why you just threw
Stormbreaker out the window?

1243
01:16:28,858 --> 01:16:30,985
He needs it to open the Gates of Eternity.

1244
01:17:02,308 --> 01:17:03,685
We really have to stop meeting like this.

1245
01:17:03,893 --> 01:17:04,936
Call the axe.

1246
01:17:05,145 --> 01:17:06,604
I'll call the axe when you call the dentist.

1247
01:17:06,771 --> 01:17:09,399
Call the axe.

1248
01:17:09,566 --> 01:17:11,651
Tell me where the children are
or I'm gonna kill you.

1249
01:17:18,742 --> 01:17:20,201
Call the axe.

1250
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,252
Some god you are.

1251
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:33,465
You know nothing of being a god.

1252
01:17:36,009 --> 01:17:40,472
You went to the gods for help,
and they did nothing.

1253
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,308
We're alike in that sense.

1254
01:17:43,975 --> 01:17:45,226
He's nothing like you.

1255
01:17:45,351 --> 01:17:46,936
What was that?

1256
01:17:50,106 --> 01:17:51,858
I said he's nothing like you.

1257
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,401
That's right.

1258
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:57,947
I'm not a hypocrite.
I'm truly creating peace.

1259
01:17:58,114 --> 01:17:59,866
Peace? You're murdering innocent gods.

1260
01:18:00,033 --> 01:18:01,076
Innocent?

1261
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:03,244
Are you a Valkyrie?

1262
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:04,329
Yes.

1263
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,123
How exciting!

1264
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:11,211
Oh, the gods failed you, too...

1265
01:18:11,461 --> 01:18:15,256
when your sisterhood was led to slaughter.

1266
01:18:15,382 --> 01:18:16,466
Don't you dare speak...

1267
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,344
Did you pray to the gods...

1268
01:18:19,469 --> 01:18:23,723
when the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

1269
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,727
Did you beg them for help...

1270
01:18:28,353 --> 01:18:30,397
as your family was massacred?

1271
01:18:33,358 --> 01:18:34,359
Good chat.

1272
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:39,364
This one.

1273
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:41,533
You're interesting.

1274
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:44,285
You're different.

1275
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:46,162
Yes.

1276
01:18:54,462 --> 01:18:55,755
You're dying.

1277
01:18:57,549 --> 01:18:58,800
I'm sorry.

1278
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:01,761
We're on the same path.

1279
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:07,434
Just as the sword empowered me...

1280
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,270
the hammer empowered you.

1281
01:19:11,187 --> 01:19:13,898
But it did nothing
to change your fate.

1282
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:18,028
The gods will use you...

1283
01:19:18,945 --> 01:19:21,573
but they will not help you.

1284
01:19:22,115 --> 01:19:27,245
There is no eternal reward for us.

1285
01:19:33,793 --> 01:19:35,378
She'll be gone soon.

1286
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,840
And you know who won't help her?

1287
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,759
I'll give you one guess.

1288
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,396
I know your pain.

1289
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,523
Love is pain.

1290
01:20:00,153 --> 01:20:02,572
I had a daughter once.

1291
01:20:03,448 --> 01:20:05,367
I put my faith in a higher power...

1292
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:08,244
hoping it would save her...

1293
01:20:08,411 --> 01:20:10,121
and she...

1294
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:13,041
died.

1295
01:20:17,087 --> 01:20:19,172
Now I understand.

1296
01:20:19,339 --> 01:20:21,549
My daughter is the lucky one.

1297
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:27,430
She does not have to grow up
in a world of suffering...

1298
01:20:27,555 --> 01:20:29,057
and pain...

1299
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:33,478
run by wicked gods.

1300
01:20:35,188 --> 01:20:37,482
Choose love.

1301
01:20:38,608 --> 01:20:42,153
Call the axe.

1302
01:20:50,787 --> 01:20:52,831
Call...

1303
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,624
the axe.

1304
01:21:30,869 --> 01:21:32,204
You okay?

1305
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:33,455
Yeah.

1306
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:37,459
I wanna kill this guy.

1307
01:21:37,584 --> 01:21:40,045
So do I, but we have to take him alive.

1308
01:21:40,212 --> 01:21:42,214
He's our only link to finding those children.

1309
01:22:56,163 --> 01:22:57,956
Thank you, Mr. Goat.

1310
01:23:30,697 --> 01:23:31,698
Val!

1311
01:23:42,876 --> 01:23:44,252
We gotta get her out of here!

1312
01:23:54,054 --> 01:23:55,347
Hey. I got you.

1313
01:24:06,483 --> 01:24:08,318
Hey, guys, we're here.
Come on, let's go.

1314
01:24:08,568 --> 01:24:10,404
Stormbreaker, take us home.

1315
01:25:06,043 --> 01:25:08,336
...at a rate that
none of us have seen before.

1316
01:25:08,462 --> 01:25:11,631
Look, there are other more aggressive forms
of treatment we can try...

1317
01:25:11,757 --> 01:25:14,926
but something's affecting her body's ability
to fight the cancer.

1318
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:17,554
I'm sorry, Thor.

1319
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,153
There you are. Okay.

1320
01:25:33,362 --> 01:25:34,404
What's goin' on out there?

1321
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:37,449
Some moron made a fridge without a door.
Can you believe it?

1322
01:25:37,574 --> 01:25:40,660
Not to worry. Got it open
and got you all sorts of goodies.

1323
01:25:40,786 --> 01:25:41,787
How's Val?

1324
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:44,498
She's in a lot of pain,
but she is stable.

1325
01:25:44,665 --> 01:25:45,540
Okay, good.

1326
01:25:45,957 --> 01:25:48,377
Now you just gotta get this out of my...

1327
01:25:48,585 --> 01:25:50,003
No, no, no.
That's gotta stay in there.

1328
01:25:50,128 --> 01:25:53,423
That's all the magic potions
and elixirs doing their thing, so...

1329
01:25:54,007 --> 01:25:56,760
I'm just gonna pop out for a moment,
pick up the kids, kill the bad guy...

1330
01:25:56,927 --> 01:25:58,095
and then I'll come straight back.

1331
01:25:59,262 --> 01:26:00,806
You're going without me?

1332
01:26:01,598 --> 01:26:02,599
Yeah.

1333
01:26:02,766 --> 01:26:04,726
What happened to, like,
doing everything together?

1334
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:06,812
He's gonna use those kids to distract you.

1335
01:26:06,937 --> 01:26:08,021
You need me.

1336
01:26:08,188 --> 01:26:10,482
I do need you, Jane. I need you alive.

1337
01:26:10,649 --> 01:26:13,652
It'd be great to have you on the battlefield,
fighting Gorr side by side...

1338
01:26:13,819 --> 01:26:15,570
but that hammer is killing you.

1339
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:19,908
Every time you use it,
it's draining all of your mortal strength...

1340
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:22,244
leaving your body unable to fight the cancer.

1341
01:26:23,036 --> 01:26:24,913
What happened to,
"Live like there's no tomorrow"?

1342
01:26:25,122 --> 01:26:26,957
Well, that's before I knew
you might not have one.

1343
01:26:27,165 --> 01:26:28,583
Why not have one more adventure?

1344
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,836
Jane, if there's a chance to live,
you have to take it.

1345
01:26:31,003 --> 01:26:33,880
Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

1346
01:26:37,384 --> 01:26:41,346
I know I seem like some cool astrophysicist
from New Mexico...

1347
01:26:41,513 --> 01:26:44,099
just living the dream,
but look at me.

1348
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:47,894
I wanna keep fighting.
I'm the Mighty Thor.

1349
01:26:48,103 --> 01:26:49,313
And you want me not to do that?

1350
01:26:49,521 --> 01:26:52,024
What's the point of more time of this?

1351
01:26:53,066 --> 01:26:54,693
Because I love you.

1352
01:26:57,154 --> 01:26:58,905
I've always loved you.

1353
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:02,034
And this is a chance for us.

1354
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:06,246
But if you pick up that damn hammer again,
then that chance is gone.

1355
01:27:18,342 --> 01:27:19,760
It's your choice, Jane.

1356
01:27:20,886 --> 01:27:23,722
But I'd regret it every single day
if I didn't ask you to stay here...

1357
01:27:23,889 --> 01:27:25,766
so we could try and figure this out together.

1358
01:27:28,936 --> 01:27:30,938
You better come back to me.

1359
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:33,732
I'm coming back as soon as I can.

1360
01:27:36,276 --> 01:27:38,737
-Break a leg.
-I'll break all his legs.

1361
01:27:52,251 --> 01:27:54,419
Remember that the Gate to Eternity
is at the literal center...

1362
01:27:54,586 --> 01:27:55,629
-of the universe.
-Universe. Yes.

1363
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,047
If you go past the cluster of comets...

1364
01:27:57,214 --> 01:27:59,424
Yes, yes, I know. We've been over this.
I'm not gonna get lost.

1365
01:27:59,967 --> 01:28:02,386
So how you feeling with the old stab wound?

1366
01:28:02,553 --> 01:28:03,720
I think I lost my kidney.

1367
01:28:03,887 --> 01:28:05,138
Gone completely?

1368
01:28:05,305 --> 01:28:06,390
I wish I could join you...

1369
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:09,017
but I'd probably die,
and that won't help get the kids back...

1370
01:28:09,184 --> 01:28:10,686
so you'll have to go alone.

1371
01:28:11,228 --> 01:28:13,855
All you have to do is destroy that sword.

1372
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:16,650
It's his source of power.
He won't survive long without it.

1373
01:28:18,610 --> 01:28:20,571
Hey. Don't die.

1374
01:28:20,988 --> 01:28:22,114
Yeah, I know.

1375
01:29:15,876 --> 01:29:17,878
Eternity.

1376
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,632
Finally.

1377
01:29:36,355 --> 01:29:37,606
Come on.

1378
01:30:03,465 --> 01:30:04,466
Hey, kids.

1379
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:08,345
I knew he'd come.

1380
01:30:09,054 --> 01:30:10,055
Go!

1381
01:30:10,264 --> 01:30:11,223
Go, kids!

1382
01:30:20,315 --> 01:30:23,110
Everyone okay? All right, gather round.
Gather round.

1383
01:30:23,569 --> 01:30:26,321
Good to see you in person, buddy.
Good to see you.

1384
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:38,542
All right, listen up.
Here's the plan.

1385
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:40,878
We're gonna sneak our way
towards Stormbreaker...

1386
01:30:41,003 --> 01:30:44,965
being very careful not to bump into
any of those big shadow monsters.

1387
01:30:46,425 --> 01:30:47,885
They're behind me, aren't they?

1388
01:30:53,515 --> 01:30:55,142
Does anyone here have battle experience?

1389
01:30:55,267 --> 01:30:56,226
Battle experience?

1390
01:30:56,393 --> 01:30:58,353
Well, no time to learn
like the present.

1391
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,939
We're not strong like you. We're just kids.

1392
01:31:01,106 --> 01:31:03,066
Hey, don't forget you're Asgardian kids.

1393
01:31:03,525 --> 01:31:05,194
I'm not. I'm just a Lycan kid.

1394
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,487
And I'm a Midassian kid.

1395
01:31:06,737 --> 01:31:07,863
-I'm Falligarian.
-Okay, okay.

1396
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:10,407
But today you're Asgardians.

1397
01:31:10,616 --> 01:31:11,909
Now collect your weapons.

1398
01:31:12,076 --> 01:31:12,951
What?

1399
01:31:13,118 --> 01:31:15,120
Go and find anything you can pick up.

1400
01:31:15,245 --> 01:31:16,246
Bring it back here.

1401
01:31:16,663 --> 01:31:18,082
Hurry, hurry!

1402
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,708
Okay, cool. Come on!

1403
01:31:20,959 --> 01:31:22,586
They're getting closer.
Hurry up!

1404
01:31:22,753 --> 01:31:23,754
Come on!

1405
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:28,967
Today is a day that will go down in history.

1406
01:31:29,968 --> 01:31:33,138
Today is the day they will talk about
for generations to come.

1407
01:31:33,263 --> 01:31:35,682
Today we are Space Vikings!

1408
01:31:36,517 --> 01:31:38,352
Present arms!

1409
01:31:43,732 --> 01:31:46,443
Whosoever holds these weapons,
and believes in getting home...

1410
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:49,446
if they be true of heart
is therefore worthy...

1411
01:31:49,613 --> 01:31:51,073
and shall possess...

1412
01:31:52,074 --> 01:31:53,617
for limited time only...

1413
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:57,913
the power of Thor!

1414
01:32:07,172 --> 01:32:08,424
General Axl...

1415
01:32:10,092 --> 01:32:11,885
lead your army to that axe.

1416
01:32:12,594 --> 01:32:14,054
We shall do our worst.

1417
01:32:15,556 --> 01:32:16,890
For Asgard.

1418
01:34:13,132 --> 01:34:14,341
Yeah!

1419
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:17,761
No.

1420
01:34:32,151 --> 01:34:33,527
Jane.

1421
01:34:50,502 --> 01:34:52,171
We destroy that sword and he's dead.

1422
01:34:52,296 --> 01:34:54,381
The gateway's almost open.
You gotta stop Stormbreaker.

1423
01:34:55,174 --> 01:34:56,467
It's okay. I got him.

1424
01:35:04,516 --> 01:35:06,018
Stormbreaker, stop this!

1425
01:35:06,769 --> 01:35:08,354
Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing!

1426
01:35:08,562 --> 01:35:09,939
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1427
01:35:10,898 --> 01:35:13,275
Come on. Come on, buddy.

1428
01:35:18,364 --> 01:35:21,742
Let go of my friend.

1429
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:27,456
You've lost, Lady Thor.

1430
01:35:34,964 --> 01:35:35,923
First off...

1431
01:35:36,298 --> 01:35:38,968
the name is Mighty Thor.

1432
01:35:40,469 --> 01:35:41,762
And secondly...

1433
01:35:42,012 --> 01:35:44,014
if you can't say Mighty Thor...

1434
01:35:45,015 --> 01:35:48,602
I'll accept Doctor Jane Foster.

1435
01:35:52,565 --> 01:35:53,774
And thirdly...

1436
01:35:54,483 --> 01:35:57,361
Eat my hammer!

1437
01:36:05,619 --> 01:36:08,038
Stormbreaker!

1438
01:36:12,376 --> 01:36:13,586
I knew you could do it.

1439
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:16,672
Axl! Get them home!

1440
01:38:05,656 --> 01:38:06,824
Jane?

1441
01:38:07,324 --> 01:38:08,325
I'm okay.

1442
01:38:08,659 --> 01:38:09,994
You have to stop him.

1443
01:38:40,316 --> 01:38:41,650
Gorr! Stop!

1444
01:38:46,322 --> 01:38:48,491
What kind of father would I be...

1445
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:50,618
if I stopped?

1446
01:38:54,538 --> 01:38:57,708
I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

1447
01:38:59,668 --> 01:39:02,588
It's not death or revenge that you seek.

1448
01:39:05,424 --> 01:39:07,718
What do I seek?

1449
01:39:21,232 --> 01:39:22,441
You seek love.

1450
01:39:25,778 --> 01:39:27,154
Love?

1451
01:39:28,197 --> 01:39:30,199
Why should I seek love?

1452
01:39:30,825 --> 01:39:32,702
Because it's all any of us want.

1453
01:39:35,162 --> 01:39:36,330
How...

1454
01:39:36,539 --> 01:39:40,209
dare you turn your back on me?

1455
01:39:41,752 --> 01:39:43,546
You've won, Gorr.

1456
01:39:43,671 --> 01:39:45,548
Why would I spend
my last moments with you...

1457
01:39:45,673 --> 01:39:47,091
when I can be with her?

1458
01:39:48,467 --> 01:39:49,927
I choose love.

1459
01:39:50,219 --> 01:39:52,972
You can, too. You can bring her back.

1460
01:39:56,892 --> 01:39:58,686
Make your wish.

1461
01:40:29,842 --> 01:40:31,218
I'm dying.

1462
01:40:32,678 --> 01:40:34,305
She would have no one.

1463
01:40:35,556 --> 01:40:37,391
She would be alone.

1464
01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:46,692
She won't be alone.

1465
01:41:57,054 --> 01:41:58,306
My love.

1466
01:42:08,316 --> 01:42:10,234
I've missed you so much.

1467
01:42:13,112 --> 01:42:14,739
I missed you too.

1468
01:42:18,326 --> 01:42:19,577
I'm so sorry.

1469
01:42:19,702 --> 01:42:20,703
It's okay.

1470
01:42:22,788 --> 01:42:25,166
Ever since I picked up that hammer...

1471
01:42:27,001 --> 01:42:28,377
it's like...

1472
01:42:29,086 --> 01:42:30,630
I've gotten an extra life.

1473
01:42:32,048 --> 01:42:33,966
And it was...

1474
01:42:35,676 --> 01:42:37,178
magical.

1475
01:42:40,056 --> 01:42:42,099
Not too bad for a human.

1476
01:42:43,768 --> 01:42:45,353
Not too bad for a god.

1477
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:50,149
Hey. I think I figured out my catchphrase.

1478
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:52,151
-Oh, yeah? What is it?
-Come close...

1479
01:42:58,157 --> 01:42:59,325
It's perfect.

1480
01:42:59,492 --> 01:43:00,826
It's the best one yet.

1481
01:43:00,952 --> 01:43:02,161
Thanks.

1482
01:43:10,253 --> 01:43:12,547
Keep your heart open.

1483
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:19,428
I love you.

1484
01:43:20,721 --> 01:43:22,181
I love you, too.

1485
01:44:07,894 --> 01:44:09,312
Protect her.

1486
01:44:10,938 --> 01:44:12,231
Protect my love.

1487
01:44:46,224 --> 01:44:50,019
Let me tell you
the legend of the Space Viking...

1488
01:44:50,853 --> 01:44:56,025
AKA the Mighty Thor,
AKA Dr. Jane Foster.

1489
01:44:58,236 --> 01:45:00,780
Her sacrifice saved the universe...

1490
01:45:00,947 --> 01:45:04,534
and taught us all
what it means to be worthy.

1491
01:45:05,076 --> 01:45:06,994
She helped the children of the gods...

1492
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:09,497
who laser-beamed
their way back home...

1493
01:45:09,622 --> 01:45:13,584
to their dozy little fishing village
turned tourist destination.

1494
01:45:14,669 --> 01:45:15,753
Axl!

1495
01:45:15,878 --> 01:45:17,296
I missed you.

1496
01:45:17,755 --> 01:45:18,965
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm okay.

1497
01:45:19,090 --> 01:45:20,216
-Are you sure?
-I'm okay.

1498
01:45:20,383 --> 01:45:21,884
The kids were safe to be kids again.

1499
01:45:22,009 --> 01:45:23,344
Louder, three!

1500
01:45:25,012 --> 01:45:26,013
Widen your stance.

1501
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:29,600
Especially after their king made them
all go to self-defense classes.

1502
01:45:29,767 --> 01:45:31,561
Look at all those budding Space Vikings.

1503
01:45:31,727 --> 01:45:32,854
And the most important part.

1504
01:45:33,354 --> 01:45:34,689
The war cry!

1505
01:45:36,107 --> 01:45:37,400
Even Heimdall's son...

1506
01:45:37,608 --> 01:45:39,193
Axl Heimdallson...

1507
01:45:39,402 --> 01:45:41,654
who could now do
his dad's freaky eye magic...

1508
01:45:41,821 --> 01:45:43,656
was becoming quite the warrior.

1509
01:45:44,031 --> 01:45:46,242
The future of Asgard was secure.

1510
01:45:48,035 --> 01:45:51,038
Speaking of futures,
I was forging one of my own...

1511
01:45:51,164 --> 01:45:52,623
now that my body's grown back...

1512
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:55,710
with a dude I met called Dwayne.

1513
01:45:57,336 --> 01:45:58,963
And what about Thor, you ask?

1514
01:45:59,589 --> 01:46:01,716
He embarked on a new journey...

1515
01:46:01,841 --> 01:46:06,179
because he had found something to live for,
something to love for.

1516
01:46:06,345 --> 01:46:10,933
A little someone who turned him
from Sad God into Dad God.

1517
01:46:11,059 --> 01:46:12,185
Breakfast is served.

1518
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:15,688
Hello. There you go.

1519
01:46:15,897 --> 01:46:17,815
Hey. Breakfast.

1520
01:46:18,232 --> 01:46:20,735
Excuse me.
What is that?

1521
01:46:20,902 --> 01:46:22,737
They're pan-flaps. From Earth.

1522
01:46:22,904 --> 01:46:24,739
I don't think I like pan-flaps.

1523
01:46:24,906 --> 01:46:25,990
-You love them.
-No, I don't.

1524
01:46:26,115 --> 01:46:27,992
-Yes, you do.
-I've never had that in my life.

1525
01:46:28,117 --> 01:46:29,744
Come on. Eat up. We have to go.
We're gonna be late.

1526
01:46:29,869 --> 01:46:30,828
Now where are your boots?

1527
01:46:31,037 --> 01:46:32,997
I'm wearing them.

1528
01:46:33,289 --> 01:46:34,457
You're not wearing those.

1529
01:46:34,707 --> 01:46:36,209
-Yes, I am.
-No, you're not.

1530
01:46:36,376 --> 01:46:37,585
Yes, I am.

1531
01:46:37,794 --> 01:46:38,836
No. You're not.

1532
01:46:39,003 --> 01:46:40,129
Go to hell, demon!

1533
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:43,007
Wow!

1534
01:46:43,383 --> 01:46:46,094
Brand new, now destroyed.
Thank you very much.

1535
01:46:46,219 --> 01:46:48,054
You know what? You wear what you want.

1536
01:46:48,221 --> 01:46:50,056
Don't come complaining to me
when your feet get sore, all right?

1537
01:46:50,223 --> 01:46:51,974
You'll get no sympathy here from me.

1538
01:46:52,141 --> 01:46:54,394
Fine, I'll wear the boots.

1539
01:46:54,602 --> 01:46:55,436
Thank you.

1540
01:46:55,645 --> 01:46:57,313
Remember what my mother used to tell me.

1541
01:46:57,522 --> 01:46:58,481
Listen to the grown-ups...

1542
01:46:58,731 --> 01:47:00,775
and if you see anyone scared
or being picked on...

1543
01:47:00,942 --> 01:47:02,193
-you look after them, okay?
-Okay.

1544
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:03,820
And most of all, have fun.

1545
01:47:03,986 --> 01:47:05,446
-Gotcha.
-Gotcha.

1546
01:47:05,655 --> 01:47:07,657
Now where is Mjolnir?
Where did I put him?

1547
01:47:07,824 --> 01:47:09,033
Over there. Sleeping in the bed.

1548
01:47:09,158 --> 01:47:10,326
In the bed.

1549
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:12,912
Oh, wow.

1550
01:47:15,373 --> 01:47:17,125
That is not coming off.

1551
01:47:17,917 --> 01:47:19,293
What did you do?

1552
01:47:19,502 --> 01:47:21,379
She looked boring before.

1553
01:47:22,463 --> 01:47:24,048
Yeah. Suppose it did.

1554
01:47:24,132 --> 01:47:25,133
I love it.

1555
01:47:25,466 --> 01:47:26,759
Very creative.

1556
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:31,848
Okay.

1557
01:47:32,473 --> 01:47:33,725
Now, you see the aliens down there?

1558
01:47:33,891 --> 01:47:36,144
-The stripy ones?
-They look nice.

1559
01:47:36,269 --> 01:47:38,062
Yeah, they are nice.
That's why we have to look after them.

1560
01:47:38,229 --> 01:47:40,064
Got it. Protect the nice ones.

1561
01:47:41,149 --> 01:47:42,150
I love you, sweetie.

1562
01:47:42,358 --> 01:47:43,651
Love you, Uncle Thor.

1563
01:47:46,654 --> 01:47:48,114
They will always be there for us.

1564
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:51,409
The Space Viking
and his girl, born from Eternity.

1565
01:47:51,617 --> 01:47:53,995
With the powers of a god.

1566
01:47:56,414 --> 01:47:58,082
Two warriors...

1567
01:47:58,207 --> 01:48:01,336
fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.

1568
01:48:07,008 --> 01:48:10,678
They have traveled far,
and have been given many names.

1569
01:48:11,262 --> 01:48:13,765
But to those who know them best...

1570
01:48:13,931 --> 01:48:15,516
they are simply known...

1571
01:48:15,767 --> 01:48:17,727
as Love and Thunder.

1572
01:50:05,585 --> 01:50:09,589
It used to be that being a god,
it meant something.

1573
01:50:11,341 --> 01:50:13,384
People would whisper your name...

1574
01:50:14,052 --> 01:50:17,972
before sharing
their deepest hopes and dreams.

1575
01:50:19,057 --> 01:50:21,351
They begged you for mercy...

1576
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:24,771
without ever knowing if you were
actually listening.

1577
01:50:27,148 --> 01:50:28,149
Now...

1578
01:50:28,816 --> 01:50:30,735
you know, they look to the sky...

1579
01:50:31,528 --> 01:50:33,821
they don't ask us for lightning.

1580
01:50:34,447 --> 01:50:36,824
They don't ask us for rain.

1581
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:41,871
They just want to see
one of their so-called superheroes.

1582
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:47,460
When did we become the joke?

1583
01:50:50,547 --> 01:50:51,840
No.

1584
01:50:52,799 --> 01:50:54,300
No more.

1585
01:50:55,802 --> 01:50:58,388
They will fear us again...

1586
01:50:58,888 --> 01:51:01,891
when Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

1587
01:51:05,144 --> 01:51:08,022
Do you understand me, Hercules?

1588
01:51:08,439 --> 01:51:10,942
Do you understand me, my son?

1589
01:51:11,234 --> 01:51:12,569
Yes, Father.

1590
01:58:00,101 --> 01:58:01,019
What?

1591
01:58:02,687 --> 01:58:03,813
Hey.

1592
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:06,691
Jane Foster.

1593
01:58:07,567 --> 01:58:09,110
Heimdall.

1594
01:58:09,569 --> 01:58:10,904
I see you're dead now.

1595
01:58:11,696 --> 01:58:12,906
Yeah.

1596
01:58:13,615 --> 01:58:15,617
Thank you for looking after my son.

1597
01:58:16,368 --> 01:58:18,912
You are very welcome here,
to the land of the gods.

1598
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:25,460
Welcome to Valhalla.
