1
00:00:22,403 --> 00:00:25,860
I promise you.
I'll make this right.

2
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,402
<i>Dear Jonas,</i>

3
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,295
<i>you promised
to make everything right again.</i>

4
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:38,485
<i>I want you to know that you will do that.</i>

5
00:01:40,528 --> 00:01:42,337
<i>You must never lose hope</i>

6
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,694
<i>that there is a way out of this maze.</i>

7
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:47,944
<i>A way to save me...</i>

8
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,402
<i>and you.</i>

9
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,360
<i>But we will have to make sacrifices...</i>

10
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:07,110
<i>do unimaginable things...</i>

11
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:10,027
<i>to untie the knot at the end.</i>

12
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:19,235
<i>Each fate in this knot
is linked to the next.</i>

13
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:22,235
<i>A thread,</i>

14
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:23,944
<i>blood-red,</i>

15
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:27,319
<i>that connects all our actions.</i>

16
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:30,736
<i>In light...</i>

17
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,319
<i>And in shadow.</i>

18
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:45,777
Why is Adam doing this?

19
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:52,527
Why are you locking me up?

20
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:55,777
<i>But the apocalypse...</i>

21
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:58,235
<i>must take place.</i>

22
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,527
<i>You must let me die,</i>

23
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:03,652
<i>so I can live.</i>

24
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:08,652
<i>We have to let some things go
before they find their way back to us.</i>

25
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:13,444
<i>You and I are perfect for each other.</i>

26
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,819
<i>Never believe anything else.</i>

LIGHT AND SHADOW

44
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:47,837
DAY OF THE APOCALYPSE

45
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,110
Martha.

46
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:06,004
Man, where were you?

47
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:07,652
Mom cried all night long.

48
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:13,319
Are you okay?

49
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:22,735
Hey.

50
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,527
What happened?

51
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:32,777
What's wrong?

52
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,610
Bartosz was right.

53
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,444
Bartosz was right.

54
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,777
What he told us in the woods,

55
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:48,670
about the end of the world.

56
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,045
The nuclear power plant. Today.

57
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,587
Bartosz' father is trying
to cover up an accident.

58
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:58,754
The containers.
I know this sounds insane, but...

59
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,819
The world is going to end today.

60
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:05,235
What? Have you gone crazy?

61
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,110
When did you last sleep?

62
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:11,569
Are you hearing
what I'm saying? The...

63
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,819
I haven't got time for your psycho crap.

64
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,944
I don't know what's going on with you.

65
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,527
But Mom doesn't deserve any of this.

66
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,485
None of it.

67
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:04,444
He had to die.

68
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:09,444
You're all wrong.

69
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,444
In this world.

70
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:16,902
And in ours.

71
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:24,319
I know what you're feeling.

72
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,444
But you'll learn to let the feeling go.

73
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:34,277
Everything will run its course.

74
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:37,360
Just as fate determined.

75
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,152
For our world.

76
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:42,694
And his.

77
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:02,319
Why did you lock me up?

78
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:08,319
You promised me there would be a way
to change everything.

79
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:12,485
So the apocalypse won't happen.

80
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:16,860
You lied to me,
just like my older self lied to me.

81
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:27,944
Sic Mundus.

82
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:30,735
Old Tannhaus.

83
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:35,069
He firmly believed
he was creating a paradise

84
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:37,985
where we'd all be free of destiny,

85
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:40,985
and free of our pain.

86
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:47,819
A world outside your world and my world.

87
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:50,985
But I...

88
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:54,777
have finally realized
what this paradise really is.

89
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,319
Unending darkness,

90
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:00,985
in which nothing exists.

91
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:05,027
But for that...

92
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,944
the apocalypse must happen.

93
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:09,985
In my world...

94
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:12,235
and in yours.

95
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,152
Jonas!

96
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:17,462
Jonas!

97
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:19,569
Let me out! Jonas!

98
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:30,652
6 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

99
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:35,402
<i>Where are the containers?
I want you to wait.</i>

100
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:37,879
I don't care.

101
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:40,295
You do what I say, Obendorf.

102
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:41,319
Understand?

103
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:46,152
Dad. Is everything okay?

104
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:52,670
I know I... I said I'd stay home today.

105
00:11:52,694 --> 00:11:55,069
But something important came up.
I'm sorry.

106
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:58,319
That's all right.

107
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,194
I have to tell you something.

108
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:16,027
Someone is blackmailing me.

109
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,153
What?

110
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,110
Using this.

111
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:30,110
Something that happened long ago.

112
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:39,087
MURDER IN MARBURG
STILL UNSOLVED 33 YEARS LATER

113
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:42,402
Sometimes we make decisions
in our lives that we can never undo.

114
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:49,694
My name is not Aleksander.

115
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,319
It is Boris.

116
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:56,069
Boris Niewald.

117
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,735
But it was an accident.
You must believe me.

118
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:03,569
I'm not a murderer.

119
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:05,569
What about Mom?

120
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:09,277
Does Mom know about this?

121
00:13:18,903 --> 00:13:22,069
Your mother is the best thing
that ever happened in my life.

122
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,110
She saved me from all that.

123
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:28,735
And I never told her the truth.

124
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:34,110
Bartosz.

125
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:35,527
I'm sorry.

126
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:58,235
- Charlotte?
- May I come in for a moment?

127
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:01,277
Thank you.

128
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,360
I came to see Ulrich real quick.
Is he here?

129
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:11,152
No, he's taking a shower.

130
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:15,485
Could I wait here? It's important.

131
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,027
How are you?

132
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:30,485
Okay.

133
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:31,944
At home?

134
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:33,819
Everything fine?

135
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,360
Listen, I should tell you,

136
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,485
Ulrich belongs to me.

137
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:47,985
And that will never change.

138
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:55,152
Charlotte.

139
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:59,277
- What brings you here?
- I wanted to show you this file.

140
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:02,152
Come by with Peter sometime.

141
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,735
We could all go out together.
While I still can.

142
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,194
- Done in the bathroom?
- Of course.

143
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:27,129
- What are you doing here?
- Your cell was off.

144
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:30,652
Don't ever do that again.
Don't ever come here unannounced.

145
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:36,569
The forensic examination
of the two pennies is in.

146
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,235
And...

147
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:39,861
And?

148
00:15:41,194 --> 00:15:42,527
And what?

149
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:51,670
WINDEN POLICE EVIDENCE

150
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:54,444
This is the penny I found in the bunker.

151
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:57,777
And this is the penny Helge had on him.

152
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:00,920
I believed it was a mistake at first.

153
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:03,110
That the photos were labeled wrong.

154
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:05,652
But this here,

155
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:07,610
this indentation here...

156
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:10,485
They're exactly identical.

157
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:14,504
I don't know how,
but it's one and the same penny.

158
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:17,902
But this one here,
Helge's had it as long as I've known him.

159
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:23,485
I know it doesn't make any sense... but...

160
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:25,860
But?

161
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,902
It's as if the penny...

162
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:32,610
As if it traveled through time.

163
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:41,944
- Where's Helge now?
- Still in pre-trial custody.

164
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:44,319
Ulrich!

165
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:59,402
Gave me a scare.

166
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:05,319
Where were you?

167
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:10,610
Did you cut your hair?

168
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:17,069
What happened?

169
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:26,902
Do you believe in fate?

170
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,902
I don't know.

171
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:41,694
Um...

172
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:45,236
No.

173
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:49,610
I believe
that we take our lives into our own hands.

174
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:53,527
That we decide which road we take.

175
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:03,944
I know I...

176
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:08,402
I'm sure I'm the last person
you want to talk to, but...

177
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,319
If you do...

178
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,444
I'm here.

179
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,235
Your dad and I...

180
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:30,860
A lot of things might be different now.

181
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:38,652
But that's not necessarily all bad.

182
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,694
No, I'm sure it's not.

183
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,652
Are you going out?

184
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:21,360
I promised I'd do something.

185
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:39,652
WINDEN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

186
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:44,527
GOD PARTICLE

187
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,735
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

188
00:21:58,153 --> 00:21:59,569
Stop!

189
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:15,194
Jonas.

190
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:21,569
You're alive.

191
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,485
I murdered him.

192
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:38,569
Why is he still alive in his world?

193
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:50,485
There's a switch point...

194
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:54,860
in the loop of time.

195
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,152
<i>The moment...</i>

196
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:06,402
<i>that causes things
to run in one direction or the other.</i>

197
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:10,902
<i>You bring him to our world.</i>

198
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:13,110
Or you don't.

199
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:17,652
A line that starts at one point,

200
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,402
then loops into itself once more.

201
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,069
<i>Two possible ways.</i>

202
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:29,277
<i>On the outer edge of the line
or on the inner edge of the line.</i>

203
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:32,819
<i>And yet it is the same line.</i>

204
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:37,069
<i>Two overlapping realities.</i>

205
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:44,277
On one of these roads, he dies.

206
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,569
On the other, he doesn't.

207
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:52,819
Both realities continue here,

208
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:55,735
repeating endlessly in the loop.

209
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:59,319
One triggers the other.

210
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:05,485
Quantum entanglement.

211
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:11,194
Adam has tried

212
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:14,152
to sever it for 33 years.

213
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:18,944
So that the thing growing inside you
will never be born.

214
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,569
But it's impossible.

215
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:27,652
Our worlds

216
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:30,444
can never be disconnected.

217
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:35,235
Every step Jonas takes is guided by us.

218
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,504
He cannot escape his fate.

219
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:44,319
What is this?

220
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,319
This was left over.

221
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:52,152
After the catastrophe.

222
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:57,485
The God particle.

223
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:03,402
And this here?

224
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:05,069
What is this?

225
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,277
I've seen where all this goes.

226
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,027
In the future.

227
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:17,444
There's no way back now.
The cave was destroyed.

228
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:20,337
There's nothing anymore,
the passage is completely gone.

229
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:21,402
But this here...

230
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:25,087
If I find out how it works,
I'll be able to go back.

231
00:25:25,111 --> 00:25:27,569
Then I can save them. Martha and Mikkel.

232
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,902
I can save them all.

233
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,027
How was it you found me?

234
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:43,277
How did you know I would be here?

235
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:47,985
The apparatus.

236
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:52,069
- The matter it needs.
- The apparatus. You have it still?

237
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,194
Where is it?

238
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:10,944
It doesn't work.

239
00:26:13,361 --> 00:26:15,902
Maybe this is how it had to happen first.

240
00:26:16,903 --> 00:26:19,402
For things to change next time.

241
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:24,027
The substance in the device.

242
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:27,694
You and I brought it
into the passage again.

243
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:31,860
The variables
in the equation were changed.

244
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:36,527
- There's a chance it might work next try.
- I can't wait 33 years to try!

245
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:40,985
I'm supposed to just hope
this won't happen again?

246
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:44,277
Maybe next time
I'm on the other side of the bunker door?

247
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,985
She didn't say anything.

248
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:55,944
Your older self.

249
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,610
She knew Martha would die.

250
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:03,527
How she would die.

251
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,610
Why should I trust you now?

252
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:15,110
The material at the plant.

253
00:27:17,944 --> 00:27:19,527
I know what it is.

254
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:25,444
I can assist you.
I can help you to save Martha.

255
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,278
To save them all.

256
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:36,129
3 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

257
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:47,569
Bartosz!

258
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:58,110
Martha?

259
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:01,694
Can I come in?

260
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:04,110
Uh... Yeah.

261
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,170
33 years ago
there was an accident at the plant.

262
00:28:11,194 --> 00:28:12,485
Somehow...

263
00:28:12,903 --> 00:28:15,360
the accident caused
some strange matter to form.

264
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,485
And your father helped
to cover everything up.

265
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:25,902
All the things we heard in the caves.

266
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:28,735
It's all the same.

267
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:31,527
The substance...

268
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:34,277
It starts the end.

269
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,027
Today.

270
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,962
We have to talk to him.

271
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:39,402
Starts what end?

272
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,319
The apocalypse.

273
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:51,129
POLICE

274
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:53,027
IDENTITY UNKNOWN

275
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:58,319
Time of death must have been
immediately before the body was found.

276
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:14,569
Is it possible
that he'd been dead for a long time?

277
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:17,444
That his body had been preserved somehow?

278
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:19,527
Seriously?

279
00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:21,879
What do you mean "preserved"?

280
00:29:34,194 --> 00:29:35,444
Everything okay?

281
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:37,944
The scar on his chin...

282
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:45,194
Ulrich?

283
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:14,860
The kid in the bunker.

284
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:17,860
You said it was you who killed him.

285
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,194
But you didn't mean him.

286
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,110
You meant Mads.

287
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:27,360
The boy in the bunker
looks just like Mads.

288
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:30,527
How can that be?

289
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:34,444
She... She said that I must do it.

290
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:35,860
Who?

291
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:39,235
Do what?

292
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:41,902
Send him to the future.

293
00:30:42,403 --> 00:30:44,319
To fill the gaps.

294
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:01,819
The pennies...

295
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,819
What does this mean?

296
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:10,485
- I must stop him.
- Stop who?

297
00:31:13,903 --> 00:31:14,944
Who will you stop?

298
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:21,837
You.

299
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,110
You can go now.

300
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:13,944
<i>And this Jonas guy is dead now?</i>

301
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:18,569
And you killed him there.

302
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,819
Well, not you. It was...

303
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:24,944
another you?

304
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,902
I was there.

305
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:29,985
In the future.

306
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:35,319
There's nothing left.

307
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:38,235
Nothing.

308
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:41,860
It all has to do with your father.

309
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,485
He can't be allowed
to open the containers.

310
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:51,694
Bartosz.

311
00:32:53,653 --> 00:32:54,860
Please.

312
00:33:11,444 --> 00:33:16,462
INCOMING CALL BARTOSZ

313
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:18,212
CALL ENDED

314
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,235
Charlotte, Aleksander here.

315
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,528
I...

316
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,277
Can you get to the plant?

317
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:57,027
I want to show you something.

318
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:10,319
Come out.

319
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:12,527
Adam's waiting for you.

320
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,110
Stop.

321
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,360
Take it off!

322
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:45,319
- What?
- Your clothes.

323
00:35:46,236 --> 00:35:47,402
Get undressed.

324
00:35:57,194 --> 00:35:58,860
Why are you doing as he says?

325
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:02,819
We chosen few must fill the gaps.

326
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:06,194
So that you find your way here
and Adam his.

327
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:09,110
And we finally reach salvation.

328
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:20,319
We have waited
a long time for this moment.

329
00:36:26,194 --> 00:36:28,569
You know what to do.

330
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:54,254
1 HOUR UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

331
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,944
What do you think it means?

332
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:59,920
The birds? The light?

333
00:36:59,944 --> 00:37:01,902
The boy in the bunker?

334
00:37:02,736 --> 00:37:05,277
Martha is losing it.

335
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:10,152
She thinks
the apocalypse will happen today.

336
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:27,652
If we die today, then together.

337
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:32,485
Together.

338
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:55,569
What's going on?

339
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,110
It's better if you see for yourself.

340
00:38:05,694 --> 00:38:08,610
Tick... tock.

341
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:11,777
Tick... tock.

342
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:17,777
Tick... tock.

343
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:35,379
Charlotte, it's me.
Listen, the penny stuff...

344
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:37,379
I know it sounds crazy, but...

345
00:38:37,403 --> 00:38:40,087
It's the same thing
with the kid in the bunker, I think.

346
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,962
Test a DNA sample.

347
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,819
I don't know how, but...

348
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:46,985
The kid in the bunker, he's my brother.

349
00:38:47,403 --> 00:38:48,444
It's Mads.

350
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,402
Call me back ASAP please.

351
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:18,610
Who are you?

352
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:23,527
Can't you guess?

353
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:33,235
Magnus?

354
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:45,652
You're from the future.

355
00:39:45,903 --> 00:39:47,444
But not from yours.

356
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,610
What's going on?

357
00:39:51,403 --> 00:39:53,069
They lied to you.

358
00:39:53,236 --> 00:39:54,985
Your older selves.

359
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:57,735
They want the apocalypse to happen.

360
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:02,402
They're the ones who are responsible
for it happening in the first place.

361
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:05,277
But there is a way to change everything.

362
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,819
But you have to choose our world.

363
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:11,069
And trust in him.

364
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:13,403
Jonas.

365
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:16,944
Jonas is alive?

366
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:20,444
In our world.

367
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:24,402
And he knows where the origin is.

368
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:30,504
But before that, you must save Jonas
from the apocalypse in his world

369
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,485
and bring him into your world.

370
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:35,944
You're all crazy you know that!

371
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:39,235
You can't stop
what's happening now, but...

372
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:42,569
if you come with us,

373
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:44,527
you can prevent it.

374
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,527
Another time.

375
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:51,444
What is that?

376
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:08,569
Martha, what's going on here?

377
00:41:12,694 --> 00:41:13,777
Martha?

378
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:18,694
You've got to come with us.

379
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:21,860
- Come with you where?
- He's not one of us.

380
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:25,045
He's one of the others.

381
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,860
They will save him.

382
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:40,569
I'm sorry.

383
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:49,194
Martha, wait!

384
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:56,360
<i>It's time.</i>

385
00:41:57,069 --> 00:42:01,277
<i>Adam has moved
each of his tokens into position.</i>

386
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:04,527
It's time

387
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:06,902
we do the same.

388
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,170
This knot has given us all life.

389
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:16,819
And we are its keepers.

390
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:19,610
In both worlds.

391
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:27,152
He'll never be able to untie this knot.

392
00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:32,819
In all these years, he's never understood
how everything is connected.

393
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:36,402
How it all ends and begins.

394
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:39,569
Not only in our world,

395
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:42,277
but also in his.

396
00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:45,277
We are...

397
00:42:45,944 --> 00:42:46,985
destiny.

398
00:42:48,903 --> 00:42:50,985
We raise the walls

399
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,902
of this labyrinth.

400
00:42:53,444 --> 00:42:55,587
Each of us shapes the paths

401
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:57,319
and extends their hand.

402
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:05,194
Bartosz, you must save yourself
to save our lives.

403
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:11,420
Claudia, you must guide yourself
to be our eyes in the other world.

404
00:43:11,444 --> 00:43:14,944
Egon, you must create your past...

405
00:43:15,444 --> 00:43:17,735
to preserve the family tree.

406
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,485
Noah,

407
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:21,944
you bring love...

408
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:25,819
to make everything new.

409
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:31,194
Every darkness is followed by light.

410
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:34,985
With every death comes a life.

411
00:44:01,028 --> 00:44:03,527
You brought me into your world.

412
00:44:05,069 --> 00:44:07,754
You promised me I could change it.

413
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,110
Why are you doing this?

414
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:19,860
Where are the others?

415
00:44:21,153 --> 00:44:22,527
Where did you send them?

416
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:27,152
They are all fulfilling their destinies.

417
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:29,569
Magnus and Franziska.

418
00:44:29,944 --> 00:44:31,902
Charlotte and Elisabeth.

419
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:34,069
Silja and Agnes.

420
00:44:35,153 --> 00:44:37,610
They're sustaining the cycle's life.

421
00:44:38,153 --> 00:44:41,027
So that you and I exist here, now.

422
00:44:43,153 --> 00:44:44,694
What are you saying?

423
00:44:47,861 --> 00:44:49,962
This is the end we've reached.

424
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:53,985
What's growing inside you,

425
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:56,152
the origin,

426
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,735
must die.

427
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,610
But it can't be killed by normal means.

428
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,027
It's born of both worlds.

429
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:10,754
And the energy of both worlds is necessary

430
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:12,610
to destroy it.

431
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,819
The apocalypse in my world...

432
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:18,985
and the apocalypse in your world.

433
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:23,527
This here is the end.

434
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:29,194
A machine that crosses not only time,
but space as well.

435
00:45:30,111 --> 00:45:33,152
Which focuses
the energy of both apocalypses...

436
00:45:33,694 --> 00:45:37,027
on this one point, concentrated.

437
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,152
Your son only exists...

438
00:45:41,694 --> 00:45:43,819
because the matter exists.

439
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:47,795
Now, through it, he will die,
and all of us with him.

440
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:49,860
None of this...

441
00:45:50,444 --> 00:45:52,027
will exist anymore.

442
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:57,194
Both worlds will erase one another.

443
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:01,360
Absolute annihilation.

444
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,402
You've gone insane!

445
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,610
There is no hope.

446
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:21,944
No salvation.

447
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:24,402
No paradise.

448
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:35,110
We're wrong.

449
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:37,569
You and I.

450
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:42,527
In your world...

451
00:46:43,236 --> 00:46:44,735
and in mine.

452
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:52,485
Jonas.

453
00:46:52,736 --> 00:46:53,944
Jonas!

454
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,027
Jonas, please don't do it.

455
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:57,694
Jonas!

456
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:00,402
Jonas!

457
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:02,212
Jonas!

458
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,235
Don't. Jonas, please!

459
00:47:05,736 --> 00:47:06,902
Jonas!

460
00:47:09,736 --> 00:47:11,069
Jonas, please!

461
00:47:26,403 --> 00:47:28,110
Jonas!

462
00:47:34,444 --> 00:47:36,819
No! No!

464
