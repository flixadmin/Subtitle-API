Hello, Emiko.

23
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
We're talking tonight

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,317
with two former vigilantes
turned public servants...

25
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,598
Oliver Queen
and Laurel Lance.

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,956
Ms. Lance, you've had
an impressive start

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,110
as district attorney.

28
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,079
Tell me what these last few
months have meant to you.

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,277
Well, rich,
when I first got this job,

30
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,511
I didn't think
I could do it,

31
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,879
considering... the trauma
that I had endured.

32
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,871
But I wanted to honor
my father's legacy.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,036
And I think
you have.

34
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,759
Well, I know she has.

35
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,880
Rich: Mr. Queen,
you've talked before about how much

36
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,112
your own father's
sacrifice inspired you.

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,475
Yes.

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,916
Do you believe
that's his legacy?

Hello, Emiko.

41
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,479
I know everything.

42
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,673
You've wasted your time
coming here.

43
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,674
What our father did to
you, to your mother

44
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,399
was unforgivable.

45
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,114
I need to try and make
things right.

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,353
My father did sacrifice
himself for me, and...

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,310
I'll always be grateful.

48
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,632
Still, that experience
on the raft...

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,554
just the two of you...

50
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,111
watching your father commit
suicide right before your eyes,

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,554
that must have been
hArrowing.

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,798
What a true hero
your father was.

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,000
I can prove to you that
I'm nothing like him.

54
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,395
You're a Queen.

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,256
All you know how to do is
leverage your own privilege

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,396
to help yourself.

57
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,120
What happened to you
was wrong.

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,269

You should be a part
of my life now.

Why do you think

62
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,432
I want anything to
do with the Queens?

63

'Cause your family destroys
everything it touches.

64
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,550

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,189
You're my sister.

68
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,439
I have no family.

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,836
My goal has always been
to serve this city.

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,994
I understand that
there are people who...

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,720
they disagreed with my
methods before.

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,238
So I would like to assure
the people of Star City

73
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,199
I will no longer be hiding
in the shadows,

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,639
and I promise to always
be on the side of the law.

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,795
I believe that trust
can be built

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,475
through transparency.

77
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,393
And I'm gonna prove it.

78
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,798
Thank you.

[Whispers]
You were amazing.

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,616
You were genuine and
heartfelt and amazing,

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,633
and for a second there,
I almost believed that you liked Laurel.

82
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,200
I almost do.

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,440
If Dinah's goal is
to convince the city

84
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,630
to accept you
as SCPD,

85
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,279
I would say
mission accomplished.

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,039
We'll see.

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,520
Emiko will come
around, too.

88
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,720
Well, she has every right
to be angry.

89
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,231
My father abandoned her.
I just...

90
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,989
I need her to see

91
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,430
that he and I are not
the same person.

92
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,989
Well, she will, because
you're not the same person.

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,560
Look, that was
an excellent first step.

94
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,279
If you can prove
yourself to the city,

95
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,829
you can convince your sister
to give you a chance.

96
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,151
I hope you're right.

97
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,791
You're here because
A.R.G.U.S. is assembling

98
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,111
a unique task force,

99
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,669
and you've been identified
as a potential candidate.

100
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,552
For a bomb in my head?
No, thanks.

101
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,835

102
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,400
to the members
of your last squad.

103

to lessen your
prison sentence

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,671
by repaying your debt
to society.

106
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,752
And what about
your debt to society?

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,479
Arrow was a criminal,

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,994
and you fought
alongside him.

109
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,232
You've Demonstrated
a severe negative response

110
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,913
to male authority figures.

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,119
Yeah. Well, when you grow up
with a father like mine...

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,994
Daddy issues.

113

You're only alive right now
because of your friends.

115
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,197
"Ms. Cutter." So formal.

Tell us about
a challenge

that you've worked
to overcome.

is going on?

Lyla: Agent Holt, a word.

125
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,837
You're not my type.

126
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,999
The ghost initiative
is just

127
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,600
a cooler-sounding
name for suicide s...

128
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
look, I know you're angry,
but this is about Dante.

129
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,675
So I was right.

130
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,672
There's a hidden meaning
in that painting.

131
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,353
John: It turns out Dante's
a person...

132
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,550
a very dangerous one.

133
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,256
Lyla: Intel from our
overseas office indicates

134
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,555
that he is the financier

135
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,235
behind dozens of terrorist
attacks all over the world.

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,776
John: Apparently, there's
only a few people

137
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,632
who have
direct contact with Dante.

138
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,757
We tracked one back to
a compound in Egypt.

139
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,639
We get a hold of this guy,
we catch Dante,

140
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,736
and the ghost initiative is
our best shot at doing that.

141
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,353
How did you all
find all this out?

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,318
Why was I left
in the dark?

143
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,710
The lead came from
a source...

144
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,315

the ghost initiative.

[Curtis scoffs]

146
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,589
Have you all lost your mind?

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
Ricardo Diaz?!

148
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,157
The same Ricardo Diaz
we just put in prison,

149
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,390
the guy who stabbed me,

150
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,870
who tried to kill all of us
about 17 times? This...

151
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,599
Curtis, we know that
it's not ideal.

152
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,593
That is the definition
of an understatement.

153
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
Do Oliver and Felicity know?

154
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,595
No one knows, and it has
to stay that way.

155
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,856
A.R.G.U.S. knows that we
restarted the ghost initiative,

156
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,758
but they don't know that
we're using them

157
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,069
to go after Dante.

158
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,936
Lyla: And if they did,
they would kill the mission.

Remember Switzerland?

160
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,952
Now that you're looped in,
we need your help.

I'm not putting any bombs

a search trip planned

483
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,554
to the North China Sea.

484
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,190
I'm sorry. He was still
looking for his father?

Still holding out hope
he was alive? Why?

Because you survived.

Well, first, I overrode
the explosive program

515

from his notes,

a lot more

than just kidnapping
a reporter.

we don't know where he is.

No. I...

it off,

maybe the consequences are
finally catching up with me.

lunatic makes, you know?

No. I have to take
responsibility for this.

Me being on the force

I tracked him down,
and I killed him.

Or at least I
thought I had killed him,

587

but, apparently,
he's still alive

and... and stalking me
on another Earth. Here.

a problem talking about

that you have killed.

this one a secret?

had killed my dad,

I would want
revenge, too.

595

the accident

that killed my father,

but he wasn't the reason
my father died.

598

He never should've been
on the road that day.

599
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,875

which...

that we would be
able to celebrate,

604

only he...

605
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,117
He showed up
without my cake,

606
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,877
and I threw a tantrum.

607
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,997
So he went back out.

608
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,837
That's when Collins drove
him off the road.

609
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,920
And do you know
the last words

610
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,832
that I said to my father?

611
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,992
The last thing that I said
to him was "I hate you."

612

My dad died because of me.

said it out loud,

I've never told
anyone before.

Well, you should've
so that that someone

it's not your fault.

There's something strange
about these fragments.

There's a partial etching
on some of them.

Separately,
they don't mean much,

627

but you put them together,

in electrical engineering.

631

Do you think he was
moonlighting for this company?

632

I ran his soc.

633

There's no record of him
working there.

634

Maybe try Dave Hackett.

635

If he wanted to get a job,

638
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:30,696
he'd have to find a way

Beat cop picked him up
for public intoxication,

803
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,271
and it looks like he has
a history of stalking

804
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,192
and anti-vigilante violence.

805
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Well, that makes sense.

806
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,496
I mean, he would've seen
your interview,

807
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,352
and you are the former
Black Canary, so...

And the Karma gods must
really be on your side,

811
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,754
that Brett Collins
from your Earth

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,475
died 5 years ago
on his porch

813

from unknown causes.

814
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,957
So 5 minutes ago,
I had 2 Brett problems,

815
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,110
and now I have none.

816
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
None.

817
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,278
Well, thank you. Thank
you to the both of you.

818
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,239
It's not so bad having
other people back you up,

819
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,470
is it?

820
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,316
Hey.

821
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,236
Laurel has
a stalker?

822
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,312
Yeah, it's been a crazy
couple of days.

823
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,629
Yup.

824
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,632
Speaking of,
I saw your interview.

825
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,336
I'm so proud of you. That
couldn't have been easy.

826
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
It's a start.

827
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:00,670
It's gonna take a lot more
to convince this city

00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,830
I've changed.

829
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,792
Oh, I think you'd be
surprised.

830
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,593
I, um, I forgot...

831
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,433
I forgot something
over here.

832
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,599
I saw your interview.

833
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,433
Hmm.

834
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,634
That took guts.

835
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,359
It was the truth.

836
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,200
It took me too long
to say it.

837
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,914
But you did.

838
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,719
And that's a start.

839
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,636
When I was little,
I imagined

840
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,315
what it'd be like to live
in the Queen mansion.

841
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,158
Your lives seemed
so glamorous...

842
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,953
But even more than that,
I imagined

843
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,157
what it must have been like
to have a family.

844
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,870
Your father robbed me
of that,

845
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,872
something I swore I could
never forgive.

846
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,720
But I see now you
are different from him.

847
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,519
I'm trying to be.

848
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,918
Does all this mean
you're ready to talk?

849
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,199
It means I'm ready to
think about talking.

850
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,599
I'll take that.

851
