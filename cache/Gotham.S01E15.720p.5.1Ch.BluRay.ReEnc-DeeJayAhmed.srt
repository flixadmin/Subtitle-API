- Let me guess. Three weeks ago?

- That's when neighbors said he moved out.

Unis searched the place. Nothing.

166
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,004
- So, what can you tell us about Crane?
- He was a good teacher.

167
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,644
Focused. And a good father. He was
very protective of his son, Jonathan.

168
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,083
But he could be quiet too. Somber.

169
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,409
I think it had to do with his wife.
She died six or seven years ago.

170

- She died. How?
- Uh, car accident.

- Does this mean something to you?

175
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,371
These victims,
were they missing their adrenal glands?

176
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,806
How'd you know that?

177
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,726
This was an academic paper
Gerald wrote a few months ago.

178
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,251
He asked me to proof it.

179
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,209
See, Gerald had a theory that fear
was an evolutionary flaw in humans.

180
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,530
That war, rape, theft, murder,
it was all caused by fear.

181
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,767
He was obsessed with it.

182
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,209
So Crane killed these people
and took their glands to test a theory?

183
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,961
No. Gerald wasn't trying to prove
he was right about fear.

184
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,922
He was trying to cure himself of it.

185
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,169
Crane's idea of curing fear
was to inoculate himself against it.

186
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,566
- Like a disease?
- Exactly.

187
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,651
In order to do so, he needed a condensed
source of the hormones that cause fear.

188
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,446
- Phobics.
- Crane's preying on them?

189
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,204
Spiking their fear by scaring them and then
killing them in order to harvest hormones.

- How many more people is he gonna kill?
- Oh. Of course. Good question.

193
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,603
Depends on how scared he is, I guess.
What's he scared of?
