1
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:07,382
Who's hungry?

2
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:09,092
Hi.

3
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:12,233
I didn't think you'd be
out of bed already.

4
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:16,267
Yeah. There was a car fire
on Route 220

5
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:19,479
and I thought
I'd bring home some breakfast,

6
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,564
but this looks a lot better.

7
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:25,068
Is that blueberry compote?

8
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,670
Freshly mashed

9
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,822
and paired with a savory bacon
and baked egg Danish.

10
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:31,282
Ms. Speed Force.

11
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:33,701
Are you okay, Barry?

12
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,621
You're not still feeling
the effects of Psych's attack, are you?

13
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:37,788
No, I'm good.

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,291
I just... I had no idea
that you could cook.

15
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,961
Bobby Flay has got nothing on Nora.

16
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:44,546
You know, it's funny.

17
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:47,495
Cooking is the process
of combining ingredients with heat

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,092
to create molecular change.

19
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,177
But this feels like so much more.

20
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:52,887
- Huh.
- Mimosa?

21
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:55,681
Sure.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,489
Actually, I think I'm good.

23
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:33,511
So Chester has all the satellites
scanning for the new Forces.

24
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:36,556
There is the Sage Force,
the Strength Force,

25
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:37,640
and now the Still Force.

26
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,767
Yeah. So far, no hits

27
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:41,728
on any of their isotopic signatures.

28
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,985
Well, it's still good
that you're here with us.

29
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,307
The last time the Forces attacked you,
you almost died.

30
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:47,942
I don't want to burden anyone.

31
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,235
No. You're not.

32
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:50,445
You know, in a weird way,

33
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,089
it's like you've been
a part of this family all along.

34
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:56,451
Are you okay?

35
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,578
Yeah. I'm just

36
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,301
a little worried about the fact
that my powers are glitching again.

37
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,999
Especially since I just got 'em back.

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,252
Okay. Well, I can call Caitlin.
Have her run some more tests.

39
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,754
How do you feel now?

40
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:10,173
I feel fine. I just...
I don't know what happened.

41
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,050
Actually, I think I'm the reason.

42
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,427
Since I'm here now,

43
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,346
I'm increasing your abilities
as best I can.

44
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,640
It may take some getting used to,

45
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:21,184
but you'll need it
if the other Forces come back.

46
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,980
That's work.

47
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:27,606
I gotta go.

48
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,108
I should come with you.

49
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,444
- Oh.
- I'm like your battery now.

50
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,154
If Fuerza and Psych are back...

51
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,364
Yeah. No, I don't...

52
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,742
Having you at a crime scene
might not be a great idea.

53
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,243
You've already been hurt once.

54
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:40,787
I can help boost your speed.

55
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,870
I know. I know.

56
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,351
It's just... It might just be like
a traffic accident or something.

57
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:46,542
So, just... Let me find out.

58
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,586
Of course. But don't worry.

59
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,340
If you need me, I'll sense it
and I'll be there in a heartbeat.

60
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,342
Great.

61
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:56,802
Okay.

62
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:58,721
So I'm gonna go.

63
00:02:58,846 --> 00:02:59,846
- Okay.
- Okay.

64
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,518
I hope he's okay.

65
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,275
One count of aggravated assault...

66
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:15,822
one count of attempted murder...

67
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,118
two counts of kidnapping.

68
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,275
It's a good thing you never lived up
to your original name.

69
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,877
I thought once you started
helping people

70
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,380
CCPD dropped their investigation.

71
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,090
Yeah, they did. They did.

72
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,301
But the state never officially
dropped its charges.

73
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,929
Which means Kristen Kramer
has everything that she needs

74
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,139
to put you in Iron Heights.

75
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,783
I'm gonna find Kramer
and I'm gonna kick her ass.

76
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,350
No! No, you're not!

77
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,103
Kramer is former Army Intelligence.

78
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,272
Wherever she goes, heads roll. Just...

79
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,316
Look, I'm not some thug anymore, okay?
I've grown.

80
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,235
I know that, honey. I do.

81
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,529
Look, I'm one of the people
that you kidnapped.

82
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,574
My advice to you as your attorney

83
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,075
is to lay low.

84
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,704
Wait. So Frost can't do
superhero stuff anymore?

85
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,205
Nope. Not out in the field.

86
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,249
Look, Frost, you're an artist, okay?

87
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,792
Just take some time off.

88
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,836
Chase those canvases. Create.

89
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,255
Just do it all here at S.T.A.R. Labs
where you're safe.

90
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:17,267
I just got a life and now
you're telling me I can't live it.

91
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,093
For a little while, yeah.

92
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,888
Look, Kramer is appointed
by the Governor, right?

93
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,306
She doesn't get results,

94
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:24,807
she's gonna get reassigned.

95
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,103
Frost, I know this isn't fair,

96
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,481
but it's our best option right now.

97
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,109
Fine! I'll quarantine here.

98
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:38,112
Blazing Bessie Blount!

99
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,865
I just got my first
solo crime scene call.

100
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:45,411
Oh. Cisco and Kamilla are away and all.

101
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:47,872
I'm the only CCPD
tech consultant around.

102
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,999
I wonder what it is.

103
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,250
Maybe a 10-90.

104
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,127
Maybe it's a 10-11.

105
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:58,174
Oh, snap! It's a 10-35!

106
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,176
Frost, I am so sorry. But I...

107
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,302
It's fine.

108
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:02,720
Go have your fun, Peralta!

109
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,187
Thank you. Thank you.

110
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,730
Sorry. Thank you.

111
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,025
Holy baby Grogu!

112
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,152
What happened here?

113
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,905
This delivery van was full of tech

114
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,741
and was hit by a perp in an ice attack.

115
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,911
Apparently, some experimental microchip
was stolen.

116
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,080
Oh. Doesn't sound so bad.

117
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:30,914
What's all that?

118
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,041
The driver.

119
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:37,547
Officers.

120
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,551
Looks like Killer Frost
has been busy.

121
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,271
I know how this looks,

122
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:57,733
but there are other criminals
that use ice to commit crimes,

123
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:58,817
like Leonard Snart.

124
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,611
Snart was a man with a gun.

125
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,071
Mr. Runk...

126
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,701
you're our new technical consultant
on meta-human affairs,

127
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:07,952
what's your take on all this?

128
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,454
Well... ma'am...

129
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:12,999
Shoot!

130
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,253
Dark matter levels are...

131
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,132
Dark matter levels here are...

132
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,633
Well...

133
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,637
Well, they're off the charts.

134
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:29,765
That doesn't mean it's Frost.

135
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,185
Look, you see the pattern
in these ice crystals here.

136
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,689
They're dendritic, like tree branches.

137
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,483
Frost's ice crystals
are usually hexagonal.

138
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,570
It's Killer Frost, Officer Allen.

139
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,239
And you seem to know a lot
about her powers.

140
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,116
Yeah, I've worked her crime scenes,

141
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,743
and she's never killed anyone.

142
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,288
Until now, apparently.

143
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:58,127
Officer Allen is our department's
top forensics examiner, ma'am.

144
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,380
If there's any evidence here
that we can use, he will find it.

145
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,215
And Killer Frost is still out there.

146
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:04,842
Captain, I hate to pull rank,

147
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,803
but Governor Williamson
gave me special authority

148
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:11,182
in order to address the city's
long-standing meta-human problems.

149
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,434
We need to keep public safety in mind.

150
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,186
- Agreed.
- Good.

151
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,372
Because I'm going to ask the DA's office

152
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,231
to issue a warrant
for Killer Frost's arrest.

153
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,651
I'm gonna need you
and your officers for backup.

154
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,529
I'll alert the Meta-human Task Force.

155
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,741
Thank you.
I need to update the Governor's office.

156
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:29,824
Excuse me.

157
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:35,247
Joe, you can't be serious.

158
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:36,832
We all know Frost didn't do this.

159
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,250
What am I supposed to say, Barry?

160
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:41,170
Yes, Frost did spend
the evening with Caitlin?

161
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,005
You can't give Kramer her alibi

162
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:45,591
without admitting
that you've talked to a fugitive.

163
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:50,304
Dang. That's a real catch-22,
two, two...

164
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,393
I'm sorry.
My timing on that was terrible.

165
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,269
I'm just gonna go tell Frost
what's going on.

166
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,148
We can't let Kramer arrest Frost.

167
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:02,483
You don't think I know that?

168
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:03,859
But we gotta follow orders.

169
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,361
So what are we supposed to do?

170
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,030
Frost can't lay low forever.

171
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,740
The only thing we can do, Barr.

172
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,909
Find the real meta-human that did this.

173
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,035
All right.

174
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,508
Huh. That looks painful.

175
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,928
Chuck. You said you had
something important to tell Frost.

176
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,262
Right.

177
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,681
Okay, well...

178
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,475
there's a new ice-meta in town

179
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,061
who killed an IVO Labs employee.

180
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,313
But Kristen Kramer
thinks that it was you,

181
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,483
so she kind of ordered Joe
to put the Meta Task Force on alert

182
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,459
while she gets a warrant
for your arrest.

183
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,863
What? Why didn't Joe and Barry stop her?

184
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,991
Because, technically, she's their boss.

185
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,035
She's also a very intimidating person.

186
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,494
But don't worry.

187
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,264
We're doing everything we can
to get this cleared up.

188
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,915
Me and Caitlin are even trying
to fix one of HR's transmogifiers

189
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:00,999
to work for you.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Thanks, Runk.

191
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,338
Look... is there anything else
I can do?

192
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:08,049
I mean, you know, if you need to talk

193
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:11,135
or vent
or get the weight off your shoulders,

194
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,928
Chester P. is all ears. All right?

195
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,388
Go tech-out, Chuck.

196
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,555
We'll be fine.

197
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:16,891
She's starting cardio anyway.

198
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,518
Right. Right. Okay.

199
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,356
Okay, he's gone. What's the plan?

200
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:26,525
I'm gonna do 12 miles.

201
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,320
Five years in Iron Heights over here.

202
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,123
You think I can't tell
when someone's lying?

203
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,407
Plus, there's no way
you'd stay put here.

204
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,534
You're going after Kramer.

205
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,622
No, not that.

206
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,000
You're going after
this new ice-meta yourself.

207
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,920
Yeah. I'm coming with you.

208
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,254
No, you're not.

209
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:48,690
So you're gonna do this alone?

210
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,074
What about the rest of Team Flash?

211
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,467
I need to handle this myself.

212
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,928
There are places
that Team Flash can't go.

213
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,596
Hell, I used to work at some of them.

214
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,598
And you aren't gonna say a thing.

215
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,017
I used to be a freakin'
car thief, Frost.

216
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,602
I know how to talk to criminals.

217
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,270
I'm not looking for a criminal.

218
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,022
I am looking for a killer.

219
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,149
You wanna help me? Cover my ass.

220
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,569
If I need backup, I'll call. Promise.

221
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:23,082
You must see a lot of strange
crime scenes working in this city.

222
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,086
Yeah. Yeah, this case is another one.

223
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,089
Usually, I'd find dark matter

224
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,175
dispersed evenly
throughout meta-produced ice.

225
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,760
But from what I can tell,

226
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:37,054
this ice has dark matter, just...

227
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,849
only on the surface.

228
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,308
What would cause that?

229
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,938
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

230
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,108
I'll let you work.

231
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:50,692
Thanks.

232
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,353
Have you been here the whole time?

233
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:01,871
She admires you.

234
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,372
Who... What, Kramer?

235
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,797
Okay, well, look,
she could be back any second.

236
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,378
Not to mention,
a dozen other officers. So...

237
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,840
I thought you were
gonna spend the day with Iris.

238
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,849
Well, I told her I needed
to stretch my legs.

239
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,134
Okay.

240
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,495
You know, it's just like you said.

241
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,263
The ice is different.

242
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,308
The particles inside all this,
I can feel them. They're...

243
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,269
compacted, constrained.

244
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,354
Like on a molecular level.

245
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,445
You know what? I... Um...

246
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,031
I need to get this back to my lab.

247
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,532
If I can... No! Hey! Hey!

248
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,451
If I can figure out
why this ice is different,

249
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,911
it might lead to the real...

250
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:46,916
Right. On my way.

251
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,717
- Allen?
- Hey!

252
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:58,260
What are you doing?

253
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:03,098
I'm... tracking footprints
from our suspect.

254
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,558
They led me out here. So...

255
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,602
- Where?
- What?

256
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:10,105
The... No, they're hard to detect

257
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,233
without one of these...

258
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,400
...infrared...

259
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,198
Cutting-edge tech.

260
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,284
- Yeah.
- Impressive.

261
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,870
Keep up the good work.

262
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
I like her.

263
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,225
Yeah...

264
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,854
Look, I really appreciate your help,

265
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,022
but I got it from here.

266
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,233
So I'll see you back at the loft, okay?

267
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,194
Of course. I understand.

268
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,883
The place was a lot more lively
when I worked here.

269
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,094
Yeah. Here for the ambiance?

270
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,887
Looking for a meta who likes ice.

271
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,139
A missing relative?

272
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:26,807
Ha-ha, funny guy.

273
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,350
Look, I used to do your job.

274
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,727
I know a good bar slinger

275
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,229
keeps his ears open more
than any of these losers.

276
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,776
I might know a few things.

277
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,239
Because... you're a bartender

278
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,074
who tends bar.

279
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,245
I'm looking for intel.

280
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,874
Something was taken
from IVO Labs this morning.

281
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,876
- Do you know anything about that?
- No.

282
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,463
But I do know a bit about science.

283
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,132
If you take a hydrometer

284
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,675
to a bottle of Plymouth Gin,

285
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,346
you'll find that
it has a specific gravity of.94.

286
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,808
Which means, a liqueur like, say...

287
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,269
creme de noyaux here,

288
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,772
will sink right...

289
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,026
to the bottom.

290
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,611
Ergo...

291
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,198
the secret to the smoothest cocktail

292
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,949
is density.

293
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:32,956
That is...

294
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,083
not bad.

295
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,128
Famous Killer Frost likes my work.

296
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,505
I'll call the <i>Citizen.</i>

297
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,131
It's just Frost now.

298
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:42,841
Oh.

299
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,177
Turn that up.

300
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,185
<i>So in light of the violence
at IVO Labs this morning,</i>

301
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,020
<i>the Central City Police Department</i>

302
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,648
<i>is offering a $100,000 reward</i>

303
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,817
<i>for information leading to the arrest</i>

304
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,569
<i>of the meta-criminal
known as Killer Frost.</i>

305
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:06,573
<i>If you have any knowledge
on the whereabouts of Killer Frost</i>

306
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,867
<i>immediately call
the Meta-human Task Force.</i>

307
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:11,869
Crap.

308
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,617
I had him.

309
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,578
Great. Guess I wasted an IPA then.

310
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,254
<i>It's hot in</i>

311
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,631
<i>So hot in here</i>

312
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,758
<i>Oh</i>

313
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,639
<i>It's gettin' hot in here</i>

314
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,808
Take a picture, why don't you?

315
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,268
Whatever.

316
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,770
See you around... sometime.

317
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:22,649
Hey, Frost.

318
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,986
There's a new meta in town.

319
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,739
It's got a thing for experimental tech.

320
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,367
Keeps it all at the old Wieringo complex
off Route 119.

321
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,703
If he's the guy,
you're gonna find him there.

322
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,413
What's that gonna cost me?

323
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,167
How 'bout a second visit?

324
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,711
Just ask for Mark.

325
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:44,922
<i>- And a sprinkle of that
- Ah, ah</i>

326
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,215
<i>Let itjust fall out</i>

327
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,133
<i>- I like it when ya
- Ah, ah</i>

328
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,052
<i>- Girl, baby make it
- Ah, ah</i>

329
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,304
Dude!

330
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:54,515
The 24-hour news cycle
picked up on Kramer's

331
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,517
<i>John Wick: Parabellum</i> move.

332
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,185
It's a great movie.

333
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,562
"Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back."

334
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,106
And I'm thinking we need to focus.

335
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,651
Frost is safe at S.T.A.R. Labs for now

336
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,153
but Kramer's not gonna back down,
not until we find proof.

337
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:09,987
Check this out.

338
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,740
Look at these cryo-membranes.

339
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:12,950
Speed Force is right.

340
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,536
It's way past compacted.

341
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,163
Now if we can just figure out why.

342
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,834
Barry, these computers
are way slower than you are.

343
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,378
I mean, this much data,

344
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,963
it's gonna take all night.

345
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,674
Cool, but scary.

346
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,300
I can feel how frustrated you are.

347
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,342
How can I help?

348
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:32,427
Look, it's okay.

349
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,511
We've got this.

350
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,304
Totally!

351
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:40,102
I mean, we are like the Power Rangers
of forensic science, basically.

352
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:44,439
Speed... Nora here... is omnipotent,

353
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,775
omnipresent and omniscient.

354
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,402
She's like our Zordon.

355
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:53,282
Say, can white hole singularities
actually exist without mass?

356
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,699
Yes.

357
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,577
I knew it! I knew it!

358
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,745
Barry, we don't have
to crunch data all night.

359
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,330
Nora can do it right now.

360
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,710
It's our job to find answers.

361
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,587
Of course. But...

362
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,256
You know,
Nora is a literal Force of Nature.

363
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,342
- He's right. Just let me...
- No.

364
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,637
No. We need to do this ourselves.

365
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,308
Maybe just this once?

366
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,783
Anybody else taste pennies?

367
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,244
It takes like there's 78 cents
in my mouth.

368
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,662
Barry, what did you do?

369
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,247
You've lost everything.

370
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,582
What did I do?

371
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,668
I didn't lose the data
that was supposed to clear Frost.

372
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,128
You did. By being here.

373
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,671
I was only trying to help.

374
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:50,881
I didn't ask for any!

375
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,924
Guys, maybe we should take five.

376
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,593
Barry, you helped me be reborn.

377
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,778
And now you're keeping me safe.

378
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,887
Of course I wanna help you.

379
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,972
I keep telling you
I didn't ask for help.

380
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,600
Look, you chose me to be the hero,

381
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,477
so let me be the hero.

382
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,733
I'm sorry about that.

383
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,401
You know what I meant, right?

384
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,746
Korber. Hey. What's going on?

385
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,665
Kramer's got a location on Killer Frost.

386
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,208
They're gonna bring her in.

387
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,086
I'm calling Frost.

388
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,672
She's not picking up.

389
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,384
Hey, Allegra.

390
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,512
Yeah, is Frost with you?
This is an emergency.

391
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:39,971
Sorry, Chuck. She's here.

392
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,015
But she's going full Amazon
with her workout.

393
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,308
What's the message?

394
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,560
<i>Okay.
Tell her Kramer's making a move,</i>

395
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,145
<i>so Frost needs to stay put.</i>

396
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,229
Got it.

397
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,695
Come on. Pick up! Pick up! Pick up!

398
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,450
Seriously?

399
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,702
<i>CCPD.</i>

400
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,078
You're surrounded.

401
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,084
Caitlin Snow,
I have a warrant for your arrest.

402
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,168
What's the charge?

403
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:55,464
Kramer to Task Force Command,
hold your positions around the perimeter

404
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:56,923
and prepare for prisoner transfer.

405
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,300
Are you alone, Dr. Snow?

406
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,427
Yes, but I think there's been a mistake.

407
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,055
Joe, what is this?

408
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,015
Who are you?

409
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,686
I'm Rene Carpenter,
I'm a clinician with the MHE team.

410
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,479
A mental health evaluation?

411
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,774
Yes, ma'am, it's standard procedure.
I'm just here to help.

412
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,066
Joe, what is going on?

413
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,227
Would you turn around, please?

414
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,407
Killer Frost,

415
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,911
you're under arrest
for aggravated assault,

416
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,539
attempted murder,
and two counts of kidnapping.

417
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,355
You have the right to remain silent.

418
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:35,086
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

419
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,797
You have the right to an attorney.

420
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,768
Okay, so I just talked
to the DA's office.

421
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,211
Kramer didn't find anything
incriminating in your apartment.

422
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,565
So, once your blood tests come back
negative for the meta-gene,

423
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,668
they're gonna be forced
to release you from custody.

424
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,569
Great. This is the first
time I'm relieved

425
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,253
that Frost and I are
in different bodies.

426
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,197
Yeah.

427
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:04,866
- How did she know to come after me?
- Uh...

428
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,285
It was an anonymous tip.

429
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,540
Which means either
somebody got very lucky or...

430
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:15,961
Or somebody out there
knows that Frost used to be you.

431
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,380
I'm sorry, Caitlin,

432
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,591
but Kramer wouldn't tell me
where the task force was headed.

433
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,152
And by the time I knew it was too late.

434
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,220
It's okay, Joe. This is not on you.

435
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,599
This ain't how law enforcement
is supposed to work.

436
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,644
I'm gonna go talk to Kramer.

437
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,123
Look, I think the next step is...

438
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,774
Oh. Uh...

439
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,736
Frost? Where are you?

440
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,863
<i>Across the street.</i>

441
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,626
<i>You and Caity get away
from the north wall.</i>

442
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,996
North wall, okay. Uh...

443
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,558
I think that Frost
is about to try and bust you out.

444
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,083
- What?
- Yeah.

445
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,293
Put her on speakerphone.

446
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,501
Okay.

447
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,755
Frost, what the hell are you doing?

448
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:01,965
Getting you out of there.

449
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,509
<i>You promised me
you would stay put.</i>

450
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,928
Yeah, well, I lied. Now take cover.

451
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,431
- Oh.
- Don't you dare.

452
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,141
You're in there because of me.

453
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,227
I'm here because Kramer has
some sort of grudge against you, okay.

454
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,313
But you're innocent, and so am I.

455
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,274
<i>So we just need
to let this play out, okay?</i>

456
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,151
I'll be fine. Promise.

457
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,113
Yes, yes. Frost, she's right.

458
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,074
<i>Look, I know this system.
Just let me handle this.</i>

459
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,243
They have no case against Caitlin.

460
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,913
Honey, please stand down.

461
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,290
This isn't fair.
You shouldn't have to go through this.

462
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,726
<i>Neither should you, okay?</i>

463
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,959
When Kramer looks at you,

464
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,378
all she sees are the mistakes
you've made.

465
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:43,048
She doesn't see how much pain
you've gone through

466
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,258
or how much you've grown because of it.

467
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,554
<i>You're a good person, Frost,
and human or meta-human,</i>

468
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,181
<i>you deserve the chance to prove it.</i>

469
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,681
Human?

470
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,185
That's it. Thanks, Caity.

471
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,270
Thanks for what?

472
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,773
I figured out who framed us.
Now I'm gonna go find out why.

473
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,149
No. Frost!

474
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,233
Hey?

475
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,705
Sergeant Kramer! We need to talk.

476
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,540
I'm in a bit of a hurry, Captain.

477
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:18,917
Is there a problem?

478
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,418
Yes, there is.

479
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,213
You mobilized my task force
to harass someone

480
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,133
who, from all accounts, is innocent,
off of a phone call.

481
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,549
There's no way in hell
I would have authorized that.

482
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,388
- Captain...
- Sergeant,

483
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,598
we're not supposed to work that way.

484
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,018
That's your point of view,
and I respect that.

485
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:39,771
But I also respect the evidence.

486
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,440
Dr. Snow matches Killer Frost

487
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,693
in 80 nodal points
of facial recognition.

488
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,194
Their known whereabouts

489
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,697
over the last few months
line up perfectly.

490
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,783
And her prints
were all over that delivery van.

491
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,326
What's your conclusion?

492
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,287
I promise you, Caitlin Snow

493
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,582
and Killer Frost
are not the same person.

494
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:04,379
And even if they were, I doubt
that they wouldn't wear gloves

495
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,690
if they went on a killing spree.

496
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,632
This evidence,
this anonymous phone call,

497
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,427
it's like someone
is trying to frame Frost.

498
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,430
Okay, then who?

499
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:14,972
I don't know.

500
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,226
But Frost helps keep this city safe.

501
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,186
Hell, she saved my life more than once.

502
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,896
She's still a criminal.

503
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,025
Captain, you seem like a good cop.

504
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,028
And I know that Dr. Snow
is a friend of your family.

505
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,240
If you really want to honor your badge,

506
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,910
you need to think about
what is truly best for the public good.

507
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,495
If you'll excuse me.

508
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,972
Nora's still holed up
in the guest room.

509
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:01,311
I know she's a Force of Nature.
But as crazy as it sounds,

510
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,397
there is a person
forming inside of her too.

511
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:08,443
Iris, whatever she is, she's not human.

512
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,947
She's the Speed Force.
She powers my abilities.

513
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,620
You don't know what it's like, seeing...

514
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,543
someone like that
eating breakfast at our table.

515
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,922
That's why you don't want
to call her Nora.

516
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,348
Maybe I shouldn't have
invited her to stay here.

517
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,263
No, it was...

518
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,432
It was the right thing to do.

519
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,477
She needs us to keep her safe

520
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,854
and protecting her now
is the least I can do.

521
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,775
So what's wrong with me?

522
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,192
Nothing.

523
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:57,075
Nothing, Barry, it's just...
I think for you,

524
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:02,038
she's this all powerful cosmic entity,
but she's changed.

525
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,918
I don't know how or why,

526
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:10,922
but whatever she was before,
she's even more now.

527
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:20,515
Do you remember when I first came back
from college after freshman year?

528
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,435
Yeah, I was living in my own apartment,
and you moved back in with Joe.

529
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:28,481
Yeah, it was great for a while.

530
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:34,154
I was waitressing and making tips,
trying to write my dissertation.

531
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,781
But after about a week,

532
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:40,535
me and Dad started butting heads
over the stupidest things.

533
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,745
Me coming in late at night,

534
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,349
him watching sports all day Saturday
when I was trying to study.

535
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:46,749
I mean, all we did was argue.

536
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,461
I remember. Joe told me how bad
he felt through all that.

537
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:51,545
Yeah.

538
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,132
And do you want to know why?

539
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,594
Because when I left that fall,
I really was his baby girl.

540
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,139
But when I got back,
we were both adults.

541
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,435
Different habits, different schedules.

542
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:09,522
We weren't
just father and daughter anymore.

543
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:17,447
Finding a new normal between
the two of you is gonna take some time

544
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,617
and it may get pretty painful
along the way.

545
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,329
But that's how relationships grow.

546
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,667
It's Chester.

547
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,379
He's got a lead on the new ice meta.

548
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,716
- I gotta...
- Yeah.

549
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:45,974
What'd you find?

550
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:49,605
Okay, so I somehow managed to salvage
some of the ice data that we lost.

551
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,775
Remember how the dark matter at the
crime scene had compacted membranes?

552
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:54,816
Yeah.

553
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,457
It's because it wasn't
dark matter at all.

554
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,572
- It's a half-life variant.
- Artificial dark matter?

555
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,451
That means the killer
that we're after isn't a meta.

556
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:04,786
They're human.

557
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,549
Somebody's been fooling us
this whole time.

558
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:09,749
Somebody who's an expert in science

559
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:12,585
and knows that Frost and Caitlin
used to be one person.

560
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:15,713
We should ask Frost...

561
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,216
Wait, where is Frost, anyway?

562
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,140
Fine. I lied, okay?

563
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,476
She went looking for our baddie
by herself.

564
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,645
Frost went full <i>Fugitive?</i>

565
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,399
If this new killer is trying to frame
Frost, they might come after her next.

566
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:35,692
I know. It's my fault.

567
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,697
She made me promise not to tell anyone,
but I should have said something.

568
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:40,989
It's okay. Let's just...

569
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:43,616
Let's focus on finding her
before it's too late.

570
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:56,379
That was fast.

571
00:29:56,963 --> 00:30:01,050
So, Mark, give me one good reason
why I shouldn't live up to my name.

572
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,181
Because Caitlin wouldn't like it.

573
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,487
Thirsty?

574
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,120
All right. I know that you're angry

575
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,790
because I know all about you
and you know nothing about me.

576
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,458
So go ahead.

577
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,296
Ask away.

578
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:42,009
- How did you know...
- That you and Caitlin were related?

579
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,011
I'm an observant guy. Sue me.

580
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,930
In studying you,
I also traced your movements.

581
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:51,017
Every fight, every battle.

582
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,517
Stalk much?

583
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:53,912
Honestly, finding out
that you and Caitlin

584
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,563
seem to come and
go interchangeably was,

585
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,482
well, let's call it
more of a happy accident.

586
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,610
- Did come in handy, though.
- So you could frame us.

587
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,034
That's why you sent me
to that empty warehouse,

588
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:05,281
which wasn't really empty, was it?

589
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:06,865
Very good.

590
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,160
See, I already had the chip.

591
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,454
I just needed one final thing.

592
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,376
A neurogenic scan of you
to perfectly replicate your powers.

593
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,629
Neurogenic?
It's quite a fancy word for a thief.

594
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,923
Yeah, maybe because I'm not a thief.

595
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,926
I simply took back what was mine.

596
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,427
The microchip?

597
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,180
You built it. So you worked at IVO Labs.

598
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,350
I'm a cryo-geneticist. The best.

599
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:33,476
Let me guess.

600
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,436
Your former employers didn't agree.

601
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,148
They said that the experiments
I was conducting were...

602
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:41,566
inhuman.

603
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,861
So they got a warrant
to put me in a cozy

604
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,585
Iron Heights cell
for the rest of my life.

605
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,991
Unlike you, I've been smart enough
to avoid capture.

606
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,829
I'd rather die than end up
in some warm prison.

607
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,874
Have you even heard of hypothermia?

608
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,461
It doesn't matter.

609
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,715
When I was nine,
I went ice skating up on Central Lake.

610
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:10,471
It was Christmas, so the ice
should've been thick enough.

611
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:11,805
But I fell through.

612
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,813
I was submerged body and soul
for over 15 minutes.

613
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:23,484
Yeah, at first, the cold was terrifying.

614
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,447
But then after 20 seconds or so,
it got warm.

615
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,199
Hot, even.

616
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:33,578
And then I died.

617
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,371
And the paramedics saved you

618
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,165
and now you're obsessed
with refrigerators.

619
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:38,958
- I get it.
- No, you don't.

620
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:42,879
The ice, it holds the power
of life and death.

621
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:47,717
A power so clearly wasted
on you, Killer Frost.

622
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:54,974
I've watched you for years,
admiring your abilities,

623
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,810
wondering what I could do with them.

624
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,771
All I needed was for IVO to move
my microchip out of deep freeze

625
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,648
so that I could steal it back again

626
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:05,067
and then combine it
with that pesky scan of you.

627
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,113
And now, I'm as powerful as you are.

628
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,282
Bring it on, Mark.

629
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,409
If that even is your real name.

630
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:17,038
Oh, Mark Blaine. That was my name.

631
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:21,709
But you can call me Chillblaine.

632
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:01,332
Kind of like this.

633
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:23,729
You fight like a boy.

634
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,325
What the hell did you do?

635
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:38,953
Looks like somebody's snow blind.

636
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:42,623
Guys,

637
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:45,543
satellites just picked up
one hell of a cryokinetic spike

638
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,920
on the Southside of Keystone.

639
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,756
Frost said she might be going somewhere
she used to work.

640
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,593
O'Shaughnessy's. Let's go.

641
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,637
You still want me to come?
After I lied to you?

642
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,481
Someone's got to convince Frost
to come home.

643
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:09,025
To think you have so much strength,

644
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,819
so much power,

645
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,906
but so little imagination...

646
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,671
I guess that just means
I'm a better meta than you.

647
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,799
Actually, Chillblaine...

648
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:41,599
You're not a meta at all.

649
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,732
One thing your bracelets can't copy,

650
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:53,569
Ice healing.

651
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,367
Frost, are you okay?

652
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,370
Yeah, I'm okay. It's just a scratch.

653
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,598
I could use a little help
with this, though.

654
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:05,622
I got it.

655
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,879
Thanks.

656
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,549
- They broke you down?
- I tried.

657
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,009
- Honest.
- It's okay.

658
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,404
The only other person I trusted today
just tried to kill me.

659
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:22,056
So arriving with backup,
I'll let it slide.

660
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,182
So, who is he?

661
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,643
He calls himself "Chillblaine."

662
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,688
Wow, I'm glad Cisco is not around
to hear that one.

663
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:31,094
Chillblaine didn't just commit
a crime against good taste,

664
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,234
he also killed the IVO Labs driver.

665
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,111
And I've got his confession on tape.

666
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,487
That means you're in the clear.

667
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,282
Killer Frost.

668
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,078
Come out with your hands raised.

669
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,705
You have two minutes to comply.

670
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:12,148
Flash, there's a whole squad of CCPD
cars outside of your location.

671
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,066
Yeah, we're trying
to handle it, Chester.

672
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:17,445
Killer Frost,
there is nowhere to go.

673
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:19,280
We have you surrounded.

674
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,948
You have one minute.

675
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,284
So what?

676
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,911
Let 'em try...

677
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,413
Or we could try calming down.

678
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,957
Chillblaine here is the real killer.

679
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,084
So I'll go out, I'll hand him over,

680
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,669
I'll let 'em know you're innocent.

681
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:34,753
Guys...

682
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:39,049
I may not have killed that person today,
but I'm not innocent.

683
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:41,793
I have to go out there myself.

684
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,679
- What?
- Frost...

685
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:48,017
Kramer has a warrant for all the crimes
you committed before joining Team Flash.

686
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:49,268
You get arrested?

687
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,315
You're facing hard time
if there's a conviction.

688
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,855
Uh-uh. That ain't happening.

689
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,191
We can hide you somewhere
while we figure this out.

690
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,960
Right, and then
you're harboring a fugitive.

691
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,319
I can't let you do that.

692
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:02,656
Guys, before today, I never paid
for any of the bad things I did.

693
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:04,492
Because you were out saving the world.

694
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,160
And I thought that was enough too.

695
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:10,998
But if I'm going to prove
that I've really changed,

696
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:14,668
then I have to own up to it
as painful as that might be.

697
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,338
Frost, I've been to Iron Heights.

698
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,007
Jails do not make better people.

699
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:21,925
They're hell.

700
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:23,719
You cannot do this.

701
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,012
I think I have to.

702
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,649
You're not going to try
and stop me, are you?

703
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:29,975
Not unless you want me to.

704
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,602
- I don't.
- Frost...

705
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:35,815
Please. What if you don't come back?

706
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:37,441
Don't worry, I will.

707
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:39,610
No.

708
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:53,666
Time's up. Go!

709
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:54,875
I'm coming out.

710
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:56,793
Guys.

711
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,463
Is Frost really doing this?

712
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,049
It's her choice, Chester.

713
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:05,219
Something tells me it's the right one.

714
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,427
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

715
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,470
That was Cecile.

716
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,931
Caitlin is back home.

717
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:54,059
Now she's trying to get Frost out
on bail before the sentencing hearing.

718
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:55,978
What about a trial?

719
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,397
Frost is pleading guilty
to all her old crimes.

720
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,191
So whatever happens to her next
is up to the judge.

721
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:05,613
Well, at least Chillblaine will be
in Iron Heights for a very long time.

722
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:07,114
Yeah.

723
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,867
How does Caitlin feel about it all?

724
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,993
I'm not sure.

725
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:14,330
I think she was just getting used
to Frost having her own body.

726
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,083
And I know how hard it can be

727
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,586
when a relationship like that
changes in a snap.

728
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:27,635
Speaking of which,
I should get ready for work.

729
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,596
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

730
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,181
No, it's fine.

731
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:35,893
It's okay.

732
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,686
I could feel you listening.

733
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:43,609
And I'm glad. I wanted to say I'm sorry.

734
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,922
I shouldn't have gotten
so upset with you earlier.

735
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:47,946
No, it's okay.

736
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,991
I tried to fit in somewhere
I didn't belong.

737
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,203
Being here in your home
with you and Iris,

738
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:55,912
it's not my place.

739
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,038
Yes, it is.

740
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:02,795
Look, I know how much things
have changed between us.

741
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:07,883
You're not the same as the Speed Force
I'm used to interacting with.

742
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:12,262
I can't expect you
to be the way you were.

743
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:13,889
It's not fair to you.

744
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,474
To either of us.

745
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,019
You're something else now.
Something new.

746
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:23,013
And it's something I'd like
to get to know better, Nora.

747
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:26,276
And look, no more glitching.

748
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:29,238
I'm almost fully-healed.

749
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,826
So now we can take on
all three Forces. Together.
