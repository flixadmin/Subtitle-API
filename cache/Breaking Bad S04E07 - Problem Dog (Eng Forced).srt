This is my offer.

8
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:18,214

No further payments.
No further contact.

13
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:44,407
An absolute severance.

14
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,586
You have no response?

15
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,466

16
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,551
Yes or no?

17
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,180
You know what the Cartel wants.

18
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,225
Anything else would be a waste of time.

19
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,731
ls it to be yes...or no?

20
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,486
A hard way to begin a negotiation.

21
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,407
This is not a negotiation.
