Don't hit her again, please.</i>

00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,160
You fucking scare me!

<i>You should have seen her.</i>

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,520
<i>She used to tell me things.</i>

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,880
<i>Now she wants nothing to do with me.</i>

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,880
<i>I'm losing her.</i>

What are you doing?

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,120
We're meeting Sole to make some banners.

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,080
Want to come?

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
Dunno.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,880
Come on, get out of here for a bit,
and it's Saturday.

-Almost finished.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,240
Does it look okay?

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,880
Okay, and down here, "Feminism."

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,120
-In capitals?
-Yes.

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,760
Maybe something a bit wittier.
What do you think?

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,880
I had one. Wait, what was it?

39
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,520
"Manolito, tonight
you're having dinner solo."

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
That's a good one. Write it down.

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,840
"Manolito." It's brilliant.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,640
It's going to be a historic protest.

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,240
Are you coming?

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,440
I don't know. Maybe.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,160
You know, you and I were together
at another protest,

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
against the war in Iraq, in 2003.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't remember.

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,280
Sure, you were in a stroller.
You were very little.

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
It was amazing.

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,760
Do you know what two million people
shouting at once is like?

51
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
For the same cause.

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,360
I must have a photo somewhere.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,320
Shall we watch a movie later?

54
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Nata just wrote to see
if I can go to her place.

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
Can I go?

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,200
Sure.

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
She's cool, man.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,480
Who is she?

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,320
-This guy's cousin.
-What? She's not my cousin.

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,600
You! What about it?

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,760
Did you see that? Right, man.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,080
-Is she your cousin?
-No.

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,240
She is his cousin.

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,200
-Nata, does your TV have Bluetooth?
-Yeah, grab the remote.

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,280
There she is.

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,480
Guys, look at that.

67
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,720
Good God.

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,720
My God, what sluts, man.

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
-Where are the girls like this?
-Goddammit.

70
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,600
Here, you psycho. You guys are blind.

71
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,640
You're asking for it, right?

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,080
What have they got that we don't have?

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,600
First, the desire for dick.

74
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,320
There's more desire
around here than dicks.

75
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,880
Speaking for yourself, Nata?

76
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
Excuse me, kid, I'm super sexual.

77
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
Well...

78
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
You know it's not real, right?

79
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,080
Almita, what's the problem?

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,800
The problem is that guys like you
think these things happen.

81
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,640
That girl's not enjoying herself.

82
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
No girl likes this fucking shit.

83
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
You know what else we don't like?

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,520
Getting dick pics we didn't ask for.

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Like this one.

86
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,640
Someone sent it to me who gets horny
showing pics of his shitty dick.

87
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,440
-Ring a bell?
-Let's see.

88
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,960
-I have more.
-Let's see.

89
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
What a big dick.

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
Let's see.

91
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,720
Ask her. She's seen the most dicks here.

92
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
Not as many as you,

93
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,080
or you.

94
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,720
I mean, the locker rooms,
ten guys taking a shower after the games.

95
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,640
Or are you shy
and shower in your clothes, Christian?

96
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,200
I'm not into dicks.

97
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,080
Who knows whose it is?
They're all just as ugly.

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
-Especially this one.
-Not all of them.

99
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm outta here.

100
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,480
-Check out this video.
-Let me see.

101
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,520
MER: ARE YOU COMING TO MY PLACE
WITH SOMETHING?

102
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,760
IS 5 OKAY WITH YOU?

103
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Isn't it crazy that a carrot
comes out of here?

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,600
Sure, really crazy.

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,680
How long do they take?

106
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,640
A few months, I think.
It'll be up by summer.

107
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,640
That's a long time!

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,560
Right.

109
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,360
You took nine months,
and you came out as a chubby baby.

110
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
Hi, gorgeous.

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,960
Alma, listen. I need some weed urgently.

112
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,320
<i>Do you know anyone who could sell me some?</i>

113
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,080
I don't know. David?

114
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,440
Not an option.

115
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,640
What are you doing?

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,360
If you take another gram,
I swear I'll get rid of the plantation.

117
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,760
Fuck the house, the mortgage, all of it.

118
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,960
Okay.

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,880
Can you ask the guys from the park?

120
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,440
No.

121
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,640
Hey, it's not all mine.

122
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,640
Sure. Go on, get in the car.

123
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,160
What a son of a bitch.

124
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,360
The park guys

125
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
aren't available.

126
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,480
You don't know anyone else?

127
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,040
Pretty please.

128
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,360
Yes?

129
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,040
Okay.

130
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,480
<i>He's hiding something under his clothes.
It could be a bomb.</i>

131
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
Look who's here.

132
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,920
<i>-They all died.
-Stop!</i>

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,920
-Come in.
<i>-Not another step.</i>

134
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,440
<i>They died.</i>

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,040
Kevin, look who's here.

136
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,120
<i>Stop right there.</i>

137
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
What's up, Alma?

138
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,240
<i>They died.</i>

139
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
<i>They died.</i>

140
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,880
<i>Stop!</i>

141
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,160
It's been a while.

142
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,200
Last time I saw you, you took off.

143
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,080
Right, I was late.

144
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
What brings you here?

145
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,960
My friend, Greta, would like some weed.

146
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,920
Greta.

147
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,480
Great.

148
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,640
Sit down.

149
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,040
Would you like a beer?

150
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
We're in a hurry.

151
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,680
You're a bit nervous, Alma.
You're not wearing a wire, right?

152
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Pull up your T-shirt.

153
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,120
Take it easy.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Things are a bit tense
because of the cops.

155
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
Right.

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,200
Five grams. Are you selling or not?

157
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,360
Yeah.

158
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,880
-We're leaving.
-Hang on.

159
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,800
Hang on.

160
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,440
You can't leave without trying it out.

161
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,000
No, thanks. I have things to do.
I can't get high.

162
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,440
You won't have beer,

163
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,520
you won't sit down,
you won't take off your coats...

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,080
I don't sell to people who disrespect me.

165
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,800
Give it back.

166
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,480
Give it here.

167
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,800
Hey, this is bullshit weed.

168
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
Give me back my money,

169
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,520
and we're going elsewhere.

170
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,520
There are lots of dealers around here.

171
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,960
I'm kidding you.

172
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,640
The truth is, it's pretty good.
Do you grow it yourselves?

173
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,240
I have a friend who likes to smoke,
and I'm seeing her tonight.

174
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,400
She could get some every day.

175
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,600
Maybe not every day, but every week.

176
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,240
This chick?

177
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,560
I like Greta.

178
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
I don't want you to go back alone.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,080
Don't worry, they're idiots.
It's just an act.

180
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,000
No.

181
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
They're sketchy.

182
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,080
<i>You're</i> sketchy.

183
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,280
I mean it.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,040
-Okay.
-Don't go back there alone.

185
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,400
Okay.

186
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,520
Come on, don't worry.

187
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

188
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,280
{\an8}<i>Hiya. What are you up to?</i>

189
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,920
{\an8}<i>I've called you tons of times,
but you won't pick up.</i>

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,960
{\an8}<i>I don't know what's wrong. Where are you?</i>

191
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,920
{\an8}<i>Show some sign of life, goddammit.</i>

192
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,120
I like those little statues there.

193
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
My ex bought them on a trip.

194
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,800
Were you together long?

195
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,080
Yes, a long time.

196
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,600
But things happened,
and I realized it wasn't what I wanted.

197
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,600
Honestly, almost nothing in my life
was what I wanted.

198
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,320
And it's important
to allow ourselves to do what we want.

199
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,600
You're right. Look...

200
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,360
To doing what we want.

201
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,200
Exactly. When you least expect it,
it all goes to shit.

202
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,400
Right.

203
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,880
Actually, sometimes life is a bit...

204
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,600
It's really fucked.

205
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Drama queen.

206
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,880
Look,

207
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,720
both my parents lost their jobs
in the crisis.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
We were doing fucking great, and suddenly...

209
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,680
Damn, I'm sorry.

210
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,960
What do they do now?

211
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
Not much.

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,120
My...

213
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,600
My father does some courses.

214
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,440
My mom looks for European subsidies
for councils or something.

215
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,120
Brothers and sisters?

216
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,160
David.

217
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,000
He was studying biology, and now...

218
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
I don't know what he does, to be honest.

219
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,360
-I love the color of your nails.
-Right?

220
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,280
Very cool.

221
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,800
Jeez! I'll do yours! I've got it.

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,280
-Look.
-You've got nail polish here?

223
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,440
Of course. You never know
whose nails you'll have to do.

224
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
-Really.
-I like this color for you.

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,360
-But I don't know if it suits me.
-Why not? It's beautiful.

226
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
Come on.

227
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,360
Your toenails, less obvious. Here.

228
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,080
Come on.

229
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,120
All right.

230
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,600
Though I may screw it up a bit.

231
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,600
Let's see.

232
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Come on, please.

233
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,760
-Sorry.
-What a disaster, girl!

234
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,480
Damn, I haven't laughed like this in ages.

235
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,160
The other one.

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,840
Well...

237
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,120
I'll see if I have some remover.

238
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,040
Okay.

239
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,400
Listen, I need to talk to you.

240
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,360
Forget it.

241
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,760
Alma, please!

242
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,560
-Who did you tell?
-Nobody.

243
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,800
-What about those other friends?
-Who?

244
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,240
The ones who sell weed. Kevin and Jota.

245
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,440
They're not my friends.

246
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,160
And I didn't tell them anything.

247
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,800
Why?

248
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,040
Because I got sent another dick pic.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,560
I can't imagine them doing that.

250
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,920
They're not very bright, you know?

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,840
Okay.

252
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,680
Hey, Alma,

253
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
I don't know what Greta's said to you,

254
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,480
but I didn't force you.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,240
You wanted us to do it.

256
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,000
How did you find me at the party?

257
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,960
I saw you leave with Greta.

258
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,200
Greta had gone for the coats
when you appeared.

259
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Why didn't we wait for her?

260
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,120
Come on, don't shit me.

261
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,280
You asked me to get you out of there.
I did you a favor.

262
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,520
Thanks so much, Hernán.
You didn't do me a fucking favor!

263
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,400
It was shit. All of it.

264
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,480
-It shouldn't have happened.
-Okay, but we both fucked up.

265
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,040
No, man, <i>you</i> fucked up.

266
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,000
Okay?

267
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,800
Look, I want to forget all this.

268
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,280
Just pretend you don't know me, okay?

269
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,280
Bye, Hernán.

270
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,640
What's really crazy is how many times
she cheated on the guy...

271
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,280
All right, ready!

272
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,440
Sit down.

273
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,280
Pay attention.

274
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,960
Whoever's going to strike on the 8th,

275
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,560
I need a letter from your parents, okay?

276
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,960
Andrea, are you going on strike?

277
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,360
Yes, I will be joining the strike.

278
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,640
I'll leave school work
for those who come to class.

279
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,240
I don't really get this strike.

280
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,480
It doesn't make sense.
I don't know what you want.

281
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,000
Equality, idiot.

282
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,440
If you don't specify what you want,
it's no use.

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,360
-Goddammit.
-There's something interesting here.

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,400
Can we ask for something to improve
without specifying how?

285
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,360
-Are we sure of what we want?
-The same as them.

286
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,960
-Why are you against us?
-Forget it. They're dykes.

287
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,000
Christian, let's cut out
the sexist slurs, okay?

288
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What are we against?

289
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,640
The heteropatriarchy.

290
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,840
Don't you know?
Parents are the heteropatriarchy.

291
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,760
The heteropatriarchy lets you get away
with that crap without shame,

292
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,600
or fear.

293
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,520
You're real assholes.

294
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,440
-Such a pain.
-Shut the fuck up.

295
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,160
Let's open our books to page 57.

296
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,080
Hey, stop!

297
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,920
Alma! Tell us more
about the heteropatriarchy, won't you?

298
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,920
Stop! We just want you
to explain it better.

299
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
-Teach us, please.
-Why don't the three of you go to hell?

300
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,800
You can't keep your mouth shut, right?

301
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,520
What are you doing, asshole?
Fucking clowns!

302
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,280
What the hell, you idiot?

303
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,000
We're sick of you.

304
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,200
You think you're better than us,

305
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,520
you fucking squirt.

306
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,840
So until school ends
and you're finally out of our sight,

307
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,440
shut it.

308
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,800
Or what?

309
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,320
You don't want to know.

310
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,800
Wouldn't a bigger sign be better?
To see it better.

311
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,320
It looks a bit small.

312
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,680
I don't know.

313
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,040
-I'm going to the library.
-Hold on a second.

314
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,840
Sure you don't want me to take you?

315
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,000
The way things are, I'm worried.

316
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,360
Any news about the break-in?

317
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,480
The police say
they've had several similar cases.

318
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,120
They think they're from the juvenile home.

319
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,560
Savages, Nata.

320
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,880
They wrecked the house.

321
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,720
Fuck!

322
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,360
They broke plates, glassware,

323
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
slashed the sofas...

324
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,440
played with her underwear.

325
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,680
I can't think of anything
more unpleasant for a woman.

326
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,960
You know what I mean.

327
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,360
ALBERTO: I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU COME
LIKE THE OTHER DAY.

328
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,080
ALBERTO: I LOVE IT
WHEN YOU'RE SUCH A SLUT.

329
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,440
YOUR SLUT.

330
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,920
I could report them.

331
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,880
Alma, really. Don't be so intense.

332
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,080
Seriously? It's a crime. It's harassment.

333
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,320
But they didn't hit you, right?

334
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
Is it not enough they followed me,

335
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,240
threatened me,
and threw me against the fence?

336
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,640
Does it take blood
for them to listen to us?

337
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm going for a coffee.

338
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,800
Thanks.

339
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,000
-Hi there.
-Hi.

340
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,560
Coffee with milk and a glass of water.

341
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,480
Thanks.

342
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,200
Alma?

343
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,120
What are you doing here?

344
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,960
I'm at the library.

345
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,320
-How do you want the milk?
-Hot.

346
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,120
I'm sitting there. Do you want to join me?

347
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,280
My idea is to start here,

348
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,400
in north Vietnam.

349
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,160
From there, over to Cambodia.

350
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,880
Then Cambodia to Thailand,

351
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,200
and end up in Bali.

352
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,200
Stay where I like, leave when I get bored...

353
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,160
Go with the flow.

354
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,080
Cool.

355
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,920
And

356
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,040
when do you leave?

357
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,840
When my parents find permanent jobs, and...

358
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,600
and I can give up the weed.

359
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,160
Before you go, you should find out
what that tattoo means.

360
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,080
Yes, I will.

361
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,680
Listen.

362
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,000
I wanted to talk about
what happened on the night of the party.

363
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,240
I'm really sorry. I was <i>very</i> drunk.

364
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,320
I'll always remember it as one
of the most pathetic nights of my life.

365
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
But maybe in a few years,

366
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,480
we'll laugh about it
because nothing happened.

367
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,760
So let's forget it, okay?

368
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,920
Right.

369
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,240
The problem is that I can't forget it.

370
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,600
I can't get it out of my head.

371
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,520
I like you a lot, Alma.

372
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,240
I really like you.

373
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,800
And...

374
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
I've told you my plan,

375
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,960
and I'm scared

376
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,840
you'll make me change my mind.

377
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,600
Well,

378
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,160
you have to go.

379
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,280
Otherwise, you'll regret it
your whole life.

380
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,080
But first,

381
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
I'd like to fuck you,

382
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,360
because doing it with my best friend's
big brother gets me hot.

383
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,880
I should get back. I have a chapter
on the Generation of '98 waiting for me.

384
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,760
Hey.

385
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,480
We...

386
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,120
We could meet on the weekend.

387
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,320
Do you want to?

388
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,680
I'll check my diary.

389
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,720
-Okay.
-That's a yes.

390
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,520
Yes!

391
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
-Tell me again.
-No.

392
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,480
-Forget it. I've told you loads of times.
-Yeah, but I want to hear all about it.

393
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,360
The cups were blue.

394
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,720
Turquoise.

395
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,200
Do you think it's a good idea?

396
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,160
Sure.

397
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,840
You're going to fulfill a sexual fantasy
with a guy who's really cute,

398
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
and nice.

399
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,560
Plus, I know him,
and he'll treat you right.

400
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,400
Otherwise, he'll have to deal with me,
you know?

401
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,080
And...

402
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
You and I are okay, right?

403
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,400
I mean, if it changes anything
between us, I'll forget it.

404
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,240
No, it's all good.

405
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,240
I don't want you to hurt him
or him to hurt you.

406
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,600
Try not to get too hooked,
and it's all good.

407
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,160
Me? No way.

408
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,720
It's just a fuck.

409
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,120
He doesn't want anything serious,
and neither do I.

410
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,560
But if it doesn't work,

411
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,760
you can keep trying
with other members of the family.

412
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm going.

413
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,520
Ciao, babe.

414
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,720
Stay for dinner?

415
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,960
I'd love to, but no.

416
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,560
Come on, Alma. It's late.

417
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,480
Hey, seriously, what do I wear?

418
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,600
I don't know,
something that's easy to take off.

419
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,360
You're an asshole.

420
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,840
Hi there.

421
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,640
Need help?

422
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,440
You look happy, huh?

423
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,680
Well, it's...

424
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,440
I had something pending
that seems to be going ahead.

425
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,880
Really?

426
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,880
Can't you give me more details?

427
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,080
For now, it's a bit soon,
but I'll keep you informed.

428
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,640
Set the table. Go on.

429
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,080
Okay.

430
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,280
Mom.

431
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,480
Do you remember the night I ran off?

432
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,160
Yes.

433
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,480
Well,

434
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,160
I slept with a guy.

435
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,720
And it was shitty.

436
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,440
Why was it shitty?

437
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,680
Did something happen?

438
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,480
No.

439
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,720
Yes.

440
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
I don't know.

441
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,560
I'd drunk a lot, and...

442
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,240
I was mad because a guy had blown me off.

443
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,680
Maybe I wanted revenge
by sleeping with another guy.

444
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,600
I don't know.

445
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,800
Right.

446
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,240
Alcohol, sex, and frustration don't mix.

447
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,800
I regretted it as soon as I got into bed.

448
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,080
Why didn't you stop it?

449
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,720
I don't know.

450
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,920
I didn't know how.

451
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,200
I was embarrassed about what he'd think.

452
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
I thought it was easier.

453
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,880
Alma.

454
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,280
Don't be shy the next time.

455
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,240
Say, "I don't want to go on with this."

456
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,480
If anyone feels bad or disappointed,
it's their problem.

457
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,680
Do you understand?

458
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
It's their problem.

459
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
YOU ARE HERE

460
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,720
{\an8}FIGHT LIKE A GIRL

461
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,760
Is it obvious
that I ran out of space in the end?

462
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,360
No way. It's perfect.

463
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
-Really?
-Yes.

464
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,840
I like it.

465
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
It's clever.

466
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,800
You've got a talent for slogans.

467
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,120
You used to say that when I'd get upset.

468
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,400
<i>Cities worldwide are preparing
for what will be a historic day.</i>

469
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,680
<i>Millions of women are called
to mobilize against discrimination</i>...

470
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,080
Exciting, isn't it?

471
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,840
Yes, very.

472
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,120
Look what they gave me.

473
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,080
Manolito, tonight
you're having dinner solo!

474
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,520
Cool.

475
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,680
-Try it.
-Let's see.

476
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,360
We're sick to damn death
of your sexist waste of breath!

477
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,800
And for pure pleasure, we have a painter,

478
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,680
a court painter, who in his final years

479
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,400
{\an8}won't work for the court.

480
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,320
{\an8}He'll work when he wants to
and because he wants to.

481
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,840
{\an8}I'M COMING JUST THINKING ABOUT IT!

482
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,160
{\an8}So here is when Goya

483
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,560
{\an8}no longer needs to use irony
or double meanings.

484
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,080
{\an8}He has no need to paint
to be a renowned painter,

485
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,480
{\an8}to demonstrate that he didn't like Godoy,

486
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,680
but loved the Countess of Chinchon.

487
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,240
He's just painting to paint.

488
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,000
And as a painter, we'll see techniques,

489
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,400
and we'll see with those techniques...

490
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,240
{\an8}THEY WANT US AS ENEMIES
THEY'LL HAVE US AS SISTERS

491
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,080
MER

00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,040
YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT OFF!

493
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,080
THEY BRING GOOD MEMORIES.
WILL YOU FINISH THEM?

494
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
-I'm off.
-Where are you going?

495
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,640
To Greta's.

496
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,920
She was going to come with us,
but she's ill.

497
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,360
The bus leaves at 7:00.

498
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,920
-I'll be there, I promise.
-Okay.

499
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,800
-Ciao.
-Bye.

500
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,600
-Don't be late.
-I won't.

501
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,720
We'll probably stay for dinner
and be back late.

502
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
-No parties.
-No, don't worry.

503
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,760
-Besides, I have some work to finish.
-Well...

504
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,160
Kids, sit still and put on your belts.

505
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,680
-See anything?
-No.

506
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,200
-Let's go.
-Come on, up.

507
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,120
Come on.

508
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,920
Up you go.

509
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
You'll go crazy.

510
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,680
Go for it.

511
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,320
Let's go.

512
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,280
Light the fireplace
and find something to drink.

513
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,160
-I'll see what I can find.
-Okay.

514
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,120
Hungry, boy?

515
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,800
You're so good, you know?

516
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,680
Take care of them, okay?

517
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,600
We want five more grams.

518
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,080
-Sit down. Want a beer?
-No, we're in a hurry.

519
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,800
Right now I've got nothing on me.

520
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,640
-Let me call Kevin.
-No way we're waiting for Kevin.

521
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,520
No way you're leaving
until Kevin gets here, okay?

522
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Fuck.

523
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
What's he doing?

524
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,080
Nacho?

525
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,600
Bro, what are you doing?

526
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,920
He looks scared, buddy.

527
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,520
From the party the other day.

528
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,200
What the fuck are they doing here?

529
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,080
Merry Christmas.

530
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,640
Here.

531
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,440
They're Danish. The fridge is off,
but they're cold anyway.

532
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,640
-Tell them to go right now.
-Why? Relax. One for the road.

533
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,160
No. They leave now!

534
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,960
Either they go or I will.

535
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,200
The other day you were more fun.

536
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,640
Alberto, you're an idiot.

537
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,080
I told you it was a bad idea.

538
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,240
No, we turned up too early.

539
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,720
-What the fuck is going on?
-Shut up! This isn't about you.

540
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,560
CIVIL GUARD
JUDICIAL POLICE

541
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,040
She's your friend, right?

542
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,880
What the fuck is that?

543
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,120
You know what, Greta? I trust no one.

544
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,360
So I followed you.

545
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,760
I saw you go
to your buddy's house, the cop.

546
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,200
Your buddy is a fucking narcotics cop!

547
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,760
That's impossible.

548
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,840
So it's a fucking hoax
that we set up, right?

549
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,440
It makes no... It doesn't make sense.

550
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Look, hon.

551
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,480
I asked around.

552
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,240
Turns out you're David's kid sister,

553
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,160
who happens to move a ton of weed.

554
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,160
Did he send you here?

555
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,480
No.

556
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,000
-He wouldn't do that.
-Don't lie!

557
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,120
He wouldn't do that.

558
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,760
I think your big brother

559
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,600
sent you here so we'd be buddies,

560
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,160
and when we had a big shipment,
he'd call the cops and we'd get stung.

561
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,040
Crazy.

562
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,600
Wait, what if it was a trap?

563
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,000
What if she wanted to get close
so you'd talk about these guys?

564
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,480
Do you have a lot of clients?

565
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,280
Or about David?

566
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,440
Brothers and sisters?

567
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,000
Fuck, that's fucking gross!

568
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,760
-Look, let's go.
-Not until we clear this up.

569
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,200
Think about it, Kevin.

570
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,120
What if the cop followed us here?

571
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,160
What if she's outside now waiting for us?

572
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,080
How much of a stash have you got in here?

573
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,360
That's right. Let's go.

574
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,080
Are you okay?

575
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,880
I'm sorry.

576
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,120
I shouldn't have told them.

577
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,800
Forgive me?

578
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,960
You look gorgeous in those pajamas.

579
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,680
{\an8}Fucking hell.

580
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,600
{\an8}-What the hell are you doing there?
-Fuck, it was looking so good.

581
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,320
-I told you to go.
-Wipe that shit right now.

582
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,240
Nata,

583
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,000
you could be a porn star.

584
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,040
Christian, stop. This wasn't the plan.

585
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,160
-What?
-Alberto, are you an idiot?

586
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,160
She's going to love it.

587
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,880
What?

588
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,280
Yeah.

589
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,120
He wants to too.

590
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,080
Alberto?

591
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,360
Nata.

592
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,760
Nata, look at me.

593
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,840
Do you want us to bring you
a bottle of white wine? You like that.

594
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,080
Want a joint? It's this weed
that gets girls horny.

595
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,760
Come on, Nata.

596
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,280
We're not savages, goddammit.

597
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,560
We just want you to enjoy yourself.

598
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,920
Fuck. The police!

599
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,080
-Shit.
-Let's go.

600
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,280
Alberto, snap out of it.

601
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,920
Please, Nata. I'm so sorry, okay?

602
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,720
Get your things. We have to go.

603
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,160
Hey, I'm sorry.

604
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,120
We have to go. Nata, get your things!

605
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,640
Nata, move!

606
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,680
Let's go!

607
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,720
Move!

608
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,240
Let's go!

609
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,400
Let's go, Nata.

610
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,400
Move!

611
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,280
Come on, Nata! Let's go!

612
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,240
You have to tell your brother.

613
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,600
You need to tell him now.

614
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,280
Shit!

615
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,080
Greta, the bus!

616
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,520
Come on, Greta!

617
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
No!

618
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,880
Please, sir, open up!

619
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,240
Hang on.

620
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,800
Greta, everything's all right, okay?

621
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,800
It's okay, all right? Don't worry.

622
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Get on.

623
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,240
There.

624
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,080
I love you.

625
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,920
Shit!

626
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,680
Pick up.

627
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,200
MOM - INCOMING CALL

628
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,880
MOM - MISSED CALL

629
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,080
Do you want to wait for her?

630
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,120
No, she's not coming.

631
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,280
WE WANT TO BE FREE

632
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,280
{\an8}AMBULANCE
