around in broad daylight

the scatter pattern

167

in Gotham.

168
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:36,858
I'll take two dozen.

169
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:38,051
Excellent.

170
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:40,385
You can pay out front.

171
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:44,231
Right this way, sir.

172
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,075
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

173
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:48,553
Tabitha planning on coming to work?

174
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:50,505
I am paying her half the profits.

175
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,388
Don't you mean a third?

176
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:54,117
That depends.

177
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:55,991
Where's my crate?

178
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:58,639
I ran into some trouble.

179
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:00,700
- Did Penguin's men see you?
- No.

180
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,739
I wore a mask like you said.

181
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,244
I know you're pissed.

182
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:05,656
I'm not mad.

183
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:07,612
I misjudged you.

184
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:11,064
I was wrong to cut you in
on my new business.

185
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,479
You're clearly not ready.

186
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,390
You're serious?

187
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:18,099
I can get the damn thing.

188
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:20,133
I'll do it myself.

189
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,139
But if you do want to redeem yourself,

190
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:25,307
you can do the floors.

191
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,739
Mop's in the closet.

192
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:28,458
Oh.

193
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,544
You can mop your own damn floors.

194
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:37,239
Another excellent night
of business, Victor.

195
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:39,153
Except for the part
where a couple of thieves

196
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:41,538
- tried to rob your shipment.
- What?!

197
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,114
Relax, boss.

198
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:44,343
My men stopped them

199
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:46,828
before they could get
their hands on anything.

200
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:49,036
You see what I'm dealing with, Ed?

201
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:52,525
That shipment is full

202
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,716
of black market items
I am auctioning off tonight

203
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:56,145
to Gotham's elite.

204
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,306
I stand to make a killing.

205
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,165
I cannot do that without the items.

206
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:02,349
Where are they?

207
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,177
At the warehouse.

208
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,052
Take me.

209
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,143
I want to be sure it is all
accounted for, and once I do,

210
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,669
bring everything back here
for safekeeping.

211
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:30,122
Okay.

I don't know.

00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:04,107
Kind of opens up the room.

Whoever did this, I want them found.

219

Mrs. Macher's class?

I was
third row closest to the window.

Um, I followed your rise
to becoming the Riddler.

237
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,017
I've read every article,
all the police reports.

238
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:13,988
I guess you could say
I'm your number one fan.

239
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,776
Okay.

You're not.

244
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,400
Your muscles have atrophied
from being on ice.

245
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,691
Okay? But don't worry.

246
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,290
These warming lamps
should help thaw you out.

247

Ice?

00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:40,069
Yeah.

- Yeah.

Was being frozen by the river.

251
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,082
How long was I on ice?

252
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:51,187
Five months.

253
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:53,992
I know.

254
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:59,142
Since then, Penguin opened a
club called the Iceberg Lounge.

255
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:01,885
You were its centerpiece.

256
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,823
That little freak.

257
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,411
He put me on display
like some caged animal.

258
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:08,594
Yes.

259
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,756
And I will nurse you
back to health

260
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:12,225
so you can reclaim your throne

261
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:15,232
as Gotham's greatest villain!

262
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:18,215
Oop, ah, caveat.

263
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:19,713
With me as your sidekick, of course.

264
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,733
Doesn't that sound wonderful, my love?

265
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:37,781
You lost, kid?

266
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:40,324
My Uncle Al works on your ship.

267
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:43,533
My aunt hasn't heard from him
in a few days and she's worried.

268
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:45,424
There are a few men below deck.

269
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,248
I'm pretty damn sure
none of their old ladies

270
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,853
are looking for them.

271
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:51,299
Listen, I told my aunt I'd find him.

272
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:53,135
Can I just take a quick look?

273
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:55,293
I'll be in and out
in a few minutes, I promise.

274
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,580
Sure. Go ahead.

275
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:01,789
Thank you.

276
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,932
You think you're real smart
giving us the slip.

277
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,542
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Ah, save it.

278
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,972
Somebody tried to steal
from this ship last night.

279
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:00,045
Did this to my face.

280
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,116
Tell me who you are working for.

281
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,559
I assure you,

282
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:05,152
I'm just here looking for my uncle.

283
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:06,636
I took a wrong turn.

284
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:09,479
Sure. Here's a little advice.

285
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,614
If you're gonna play the part
of a street kid,

286
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:13,151
learn how to talk like one.

287
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:15,057
Hey, Andy!

288
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:16,966
Get over here.

289
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:19,542
What did I tell you about
bothering me at work?

290
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:22,139
Sorry, fellas.

291
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,970
You're right, though.

292
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,651
The boy's acting does need
some work, doesn't it?

293
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,057
You see, improvisation,

294
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:39,276
Master Bruce, is a very important weapon

295
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,276
in any actor's tool kit.

296
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,620
Should we go?

297
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:49,598
There's a knife

298
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,675
being sold at your auction tonight.

299
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,563
I was thinking you might be kind enough

300
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:55,780
to sell it to me ahead of time.

301
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,451
Hmm.

302
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,512
And why is this knife
so important to you?

303
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:03,191
It's not.

304
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,120
I have a client who's interested.

305
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,601
Gave me a ton of cash,
so I was hoping to get it

306
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:10,176
for a lower price and make a profit.

307
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:14,293
That start with the attempted
five-finger discount last night?

308
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:16,457
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

309
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:18,258
Of course you don't.

310
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,786
I'll triple the opening price.

311
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:22,387
It'll probably go for less at auction.

312
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:24,590
My dear,

313
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:27,524
wherever you disappeared
to these last few months

314
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:30,184
has not made you a better liar.

315
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,223
It's clear that this

316
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:37,432
isn't about profit, but about
your mysterious benefactor.

317
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:40,805
He is your client, is-is he not?

318
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,117
Reveal his identity to me

319
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:49,556
and you have a deal.

320
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,644
Wow.

321
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,722
He's really got his hooks into you.

322
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,860
See you tonight, I guess.

323
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,104
Don't forget to bring your checkbook.

324
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,394
Always a pleasure, Oswald.

325
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:42,258
The knife was used
to embalm King Balahsi.

326
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:44,439
According to this, he ruled
ancient Mesopotamia

327
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:45,718
for the first century.

328
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:49,249
And what thief in Gotham
would want a knife like that?

329
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,996
That's a good question.

330
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:53,805
According to the manifest,
the shipment was full of jewels

331
00:20:53,863 --> 00:20:55,184
and expensive art, yet our thief

332
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:57,275
went for the item with
the least intrinsic value.

333
00:20:57,397 --> 00:20:59,512
Well, that tells me
she was a gun for hire.

334
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:02,663
But who hired her?

335
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,652
I think I just found the answer.

336
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:12,418
Alfred, look. This drawing

337
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:16,488
depicts a man being healed by water.

338
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:18,418
Look at his eyes.

339
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,666
His face.

340
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,053
Who does that remind you of?

341
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:30,082
That's impossible.

342
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,893
I mean, this-this drawing
is 2,000 years old, Master...

343
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,361
I know.

344
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,030
That's him.

345
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:44,941
That's Ra's al Ghul.

346
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:50,410
He wants the knife.

347
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,947
I struck out with Falcone.

348
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:00,990
<i>That right?</i>

349
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:04,161
Try not to sound too happy
about it.

350
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:06,064
<i>Look, if you brought back
Falcone,</i>

351
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:08,344
<i>that would mean gang wars
and blood in the streets.</i>

352
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:10,548
<i>And I don't like it when
the streets are bloody, Jim.</i>

353
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,328
Yeah. Well, see how
you like it with Penguin.

354
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:15,397
See you tomorrow, Harvey.

355
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:20,645
Mind if I join you?

356
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,312
What are you doing here?

357
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:30,147
I figured you didn't
know anyone in town.

358
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:31,689
I thought I'd keep you company.

359
00:22:31,993 --> 00:22:35,422
Or maybe I just didn't
want to drink alone.

360
00:22:39,582 --> 00:22:41,109
To my dad.

361
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:51,031
I am sorry about your father.

362
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:53,797
We may have had our
differences over the years,

363
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:55,780
but I always respected him.

364
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:58,147
Hmm.

365
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:00,710
When I was a little girl,

366
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:02,673
if I wanted to spend
time with my father,

367
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,859
he'd have me schedule an appointment.

368
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:07,643
Save the respect, I know
who my father is.

369
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:09,832
Took him getting sick for us

370
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,765
to finally have a real relationship.

371
00:23:18,704 --> 00:23:20,563
How long have you lived down here?

372
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:23,094
Since I was 13.

373
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,256
My father thought sending
me away from Gotham

374
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,082
would keep me safe.

375
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:30,191
I mean, there are worse
places to grow up.

376
00:23:30,449 --> 00:23:31,874
People are happy here,

377
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:33,695
you see the sun every day.

378
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:36,508
But I wasn't alone. I had Mario.

379
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:39,268
We took care of each other.

380
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,740
I know there's nothing I can say.

381
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:51,101
I am sorry for what happened to him.

382
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:58,575
You're right,
there's nothing you can say.

383
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:03,039
He was infected with the virus.

384
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:05,128
You did what you had to do.

385
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,358
♪♪ Dance music playing...

386
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:18,604
There's no sign of Nygma
anywhere in Gotham.

387
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:23,252
Word on the street is,
it was an inside job.

388
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:25,828
Find whoever is in charge of hiring.

389
00:24:26,002 --> 00:24:27,185
Kill them.

390
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,992
I want everyone here interrogated.

391
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:31,504
There's a traitor amongst us.

392
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,453
Those needles should
help stimulate your muscles.

393
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,623
You'll have feeling back in no time.

394
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:50,617
Just call me the Riddlette.

395
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:52,179
I know.

396
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:53,297
What do you think?

397
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:54,934
I think that rehashing

398
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:57,437
someone else's idea
isn't very original.

399
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,890
Well, it's an homage,

400
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,914
and I thought you'd like it.

401
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,396
It's very nice.

402
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:15,812
Ah... this is so much fun.

403
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:18,155
If only I were the criminal
mastermind you are,

404
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:20,273
we would have been together sooner.

405
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,826
I'm sorry, I don't really follow that.

406
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:25,028
Well, it took me months
to plan your escape.

407
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:26,797
I had to learn Penguin's schedule,

408
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:28,367
when he came and went,

409
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:30,538
devise an exit strategy.

410
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:32,263
I'm sure it would have
taken you two seconds

411
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,374
to think something up.

412
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:36,730
It is slightly impressive

413
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:38,671
you were able to outwit Oswald.

414
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,684
Though, as you said, my plan would have

415
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:41,828
taken much less time.

416
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,461
Oh, wait, that is a great idea.

417
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,616
You should tell me what
your plan would have been,

418
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,742
because a window
into your master villainy

419
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,658
would mean so much to me.

420
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:04,142
I...

421
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,736
Um...

422
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:14,457
Oh, here I am bombarding you
with silly questions.

423
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:15,995
After everything you've been through,

424
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:17,383
you must be exhausted.

425
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:18,946
Yes.

426
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,844
Yes, I must be exhausted.

427
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:24,239
Ooh, soup's ready.
Do you like tomato?

428
00:26:24,297 --> 00:26:26,703
I put little question marks in it,
too.

429
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:48,949
Last one.

430
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,292
One, two, three.

431
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,663
Anything, my love?

432
00:27:03,277 --> 00:27:04,753
No!

433
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:08,597
Acupuncture... is therapeutic snake oil.

434
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,360
I've been focused on
repairing the wrong muscle.

435
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,580
What?

436
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,386
Your brain.

437
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,445
It fires synapses that carry neurons

438
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:18,635
to the rest of your body.

439
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:20,199
And if we can stimulate it,

440
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,316
perhaps your other muscles will follow.

441
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,364
- Logical.
- Yeah.

442
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:26,175
- What do you suggest?
- Well...

443
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,047
in anticipation of our partnership,

444
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,222
I have been working on a few
riddles.

445
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,969
Yes. Riddles.

446
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:35,332
Yeah.

447
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,231
That's exactly what I need.

448
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:39,926
It's gonna make me feel
like myself again.

449
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,964
- Fire away.
- Okay, here goes.

450
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:45,745
What's black and white and red all over?

451
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:48,503
Easy. Zebra, with a gaping hole.

452
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:50,082
- Next.
- Um,

453
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,643
no, it's actually a newspaper.

454
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,347
That's ridiculous.

455
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:55,410
There's nothing red
on a newspaper. Next.

456
00:27:55,468 --> 00:27:57,227
- Well, it makes sense if you know...
- Next!

457
00:27:57,284 --> 00:27:58,913
Oh, um...

458
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,980
I have a face and two hands,

459
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:02,480
but no arms or legs.

460
00:28:02,652 --> 00:28:04,719
- What am I?
- Deformed baby.

461
00:28:04,878 --> 00:28:07,433
Come on. Surely you can
do better than this.

462
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:10,238
Uh, the answer is a clock. Hands...

463
00:28:10,327 --> 00:28:12,769
Oh, my.

464
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,074
I think something is wrong
with your brain, Ed.

465
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:20,480
There... is... nothing...

466
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:22,347
wrong with my brain.

467
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:25,081
The problem is your riddles.

468
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,425
Bring me a riddle

469
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:29,706
that is worthy of my name!

470
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,645
Next time I'll know
to pack a swimsuit.

471
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:42,755
You actually own one?

472
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:45,253
Yeah, I got a nice two-piece.

473
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:48,656
He comes with a sense of humor.

474
00:28:52,973 --> 00:28:55,273
Do you ever think about
walking away from it all?

475
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,614
Gotham?

476
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:01,007
Sometimes.

477
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,437
But I can't.

478
00:29:03,963 --> 00:29:05,133
Why not?

479
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:07,755
It's in my blood.

480
00:29:08,432 --> 00:29:09,856
My father spent his entire life

481
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:11,198
fighting for the city.

482
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:13,302
Never took the easy way out.

483
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:15,221
Neither can I.

484
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,465
What?

485
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:25,340
Give 'em to me.

486
00:29:27,668 --> 00:29:30,018
I don't really think they're your size.

487
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:31,706
Come on.

488
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,494
- That, too?
- Mm-hmm.

489
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:37,385
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

490
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:41,128
You can't be serious.

491
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:44,745
Just a little water, Jim.

492
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,590
I can't remember the last time
I just stood still.

493
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,111
All right, Master Bruce,

494
00:30:43,846 --> 00:30:45,775
let's go over the plan again.

495
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:47,517
It's simple.

496
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,893
I show up at the auction
and buy the knife.

497
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:52,088
Should be easy enough;
I am a billionaire.

498
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:54,252
And a very public one at that.

499
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,961
Turning up at the Penguin's
black market auction's

500
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:59,781
certainly going to raise
a few eyebrows, isn't it?

501
00:31:00,877 --> 00:31:02,615
You're the one that said
that bidding on it

502
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:04,020
was the smarter play.

503
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:07,379
That I did, but I didn't mean
as going as yourself, did I?

504
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:09,123
What do think the idea was

505
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:10,187
of going down to the docks,

506
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:11,541
pretending to be someone else?

507
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:14,752
I was trying to teach you a lesson.

508
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,830
Now, if you're going to continue
down this vigilante path,

509
00:31:17,937 --> 00:31:19,469
Master Bruce,

510
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:22,468
you've got to learn how to assume...

511
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:24,847
other roles.

512
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,485
Play the role

513
00:31:35,836 --> 00:31:37,846
that you were born to play.

514
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:44,133
That of a privileged, somewhat...

515
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:46,992
pedantic teenager with deeper pockets

516
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:49,165
than anybody else in this city.

517
00:31:50,438 --> 00:31:52,296
You mean behave like a spoiled brat.

518
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:54,992
It goes against everything
that your beautiful parents

519
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,044
tried to ingrain in you.

520
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,105
But yes...

521
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:00,696
sir.

522
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:07,016
Bruce Wayne...

523
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:11,438
billionaire brat.

524
00:32:11,689 --> 00:32:13,516
$250,000!

525
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:16,233
$250,000 going once,

526
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:18,079
twice... sold

527
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:19,321
to Mr. Bruce Wayne.

528
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:21,677
Ha-ha!
That's what I'm talkin' about.

529
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:23,305
I love art.

530
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,313
I love it, yeah!

531
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:27,922
I'm gonna put it in my,
uh, in my bathroom.

532
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:30,989
Steady on, Master Bruce.

533
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:32,571
Let's not overplay our hand,
shall we?

534
00:32:32,629 --> 00:32:34,016
I must admit, this is fun.

535
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,295
And try to exercise a modicum
of financial restraint.

536
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,662
Technically, you are the richest man

537
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,115
in the room, but let's not try and buy

538
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:41,594
absolutely everything, shall we?

539
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:43,226
True, but if I only bid on the knife

540
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:44,490
everyone's been trying
to steal from Penguin,

541
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,282
it might draw his suspicion.

542
00:32:46,574 --> 00:32:48,044
If I go on a spending spree,

543
00:32:48,102 --> 00:32:49,544
recklessly throwing my money around,

544
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:50,657
he won't think twice.

545
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:53,125
Nice. When'd you think of that?

546
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,069
Improvisation, Alfred.

547
00:32:55,336 --> 00:32:57,329
It's a weapon in any actor's tool kit.

548
00:32:57,547 --> 00:32:58,731
Oh, heads up.

549
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:00,453
Here we go.

550
00:33:03,235 --> 00:33:05,638
Oswald, my friend!

551
00:33:05,795 --> 00:33:08,232
Bruce Wayne, what a lovely surprise.

552
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:09,842
You certainly are getting out

553
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,493
quite a lot these days,
aren't you?

554
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:14,438
The way I see it, everyone else
in this town is having fun.

555
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:16,456
- Why shouldn't I?
- I agree!

556
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:19,075
You and your insanely
large bank account

557
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:20,262
are more than welcome here.

558
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,071
Barbara Kean.

559
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,646
I thought she died.

560
00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:29,796
Unfortunately, nobody
stays dead in this town.

561
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,094
Excuse me.

562
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:35,146
You do realize, don't you, Master Bruce,

563
00:33:35,204 --> 00:33:36,646
that if you actually win,

564
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,242
Ra's al Ghul will come after the knife.

565
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,743
Let him.

566
00:33:42,985 --> 00:33:45,211
The next item up for auction

567
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:46,990
is an embalming knife

568
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:51,014
from the tomb of King
Balahsi of Sumeria.

569
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:53,927
Opening bid will begin at $50,000.

570
00:33:54,216 --> 00:33:55,678
A hundred...

571
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:57,500
thousand dollars.

572
00:33:57,774 --> 00:33:59,139
What does she want with it?

573
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,532
I have no idea.

574
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:01,844
Stay focused.

575
00:34:01,977 --> 00:34:03,946
$100,000 to Ms. Kean.

576
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:06,321
- Do I hear one...
- One hundred thousand

577
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:07,899
and one dollar.

578
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:10,777
Actually, Mr. Wayne, the bidding
amounts are in $50,000...

579
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,657
- $200,000.
- Fine.

580
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:14,149
We have $200,000.

581
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,727
Two hundred thousand

582
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:17,343
and one dollar.

583
00:34:21,464 --> 00:34:23,097
Mr. Wayne.

584
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,850
How about you let someone
else have some fun?

585
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:28,065
Oh! Sure.

586
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:30,517
No problem. I'm sorry about that.

587
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:37,763
- $300,000.
- Very well. Three hundred...

588
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,117
$300,000 and one cent.

589
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:46,155
$500,000.

590
00:34:47,006 --> 00:34:49,072
Now back off, you little brat.

591
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,726
Wow, Ms. Kean.

592
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:52,544
That's a lot of money.

593
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:54,280
For someone like you.

594
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:57,388
$2 million!

595
00:34:57,518 --> 00:34:58,584
Two...

596
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:01,412
Sold to Mr. Bruce Wayne.

597
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:12,923
Congratulations, Bruce.

598
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,046
Thank you.

599
00:35:17,713 --> 00:35:19,845
I do love
seeing that woman lose.

600
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:22,087
But a little piece of friendly advice.

601
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:24,076
Barbara Kean does not give up easily.

602
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:25,837
She'll be coming for that knife.

603
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:29,595
I would just, uh, keep a
close eye on it if I were you.

604
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,560
Well, there's a new wrinkle, isn't it?

605
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:42,728
What's green and red
and goes round and round?

606
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:49,790
Someone's obsessed
with the color red.

607
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,561
The answer, obviously,
isn't "newspaper."

608
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:54,915
You're stalling.

609
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:57,378
No.

610
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:00,767
- You don't know the answer.
- Of course I do.

611
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:02,881
No, you don't, Ed.

612
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,928
- Mm-hmm.
- Your brilliant mind is as damaged

613
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:10,322
as the rest of your body.

614
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:13,592
Actually,

615
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:15,627
my body is feeling fine.

616
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,771
Frog in a blender.

617
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:36,737
Selina?

618
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:42,865
Why are you sitting
in the dark by yourself?

619
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:44,925
I was expecting someone else.

620
00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:47,199
- Like who?
- Doesn't matter.

621
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,287
What are you doing here?

622
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:51,925
Heard about Penguin's auction.

623
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:55,095
So Barbara sent you for the knife.

624
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:58,418
Figured, what, because we're
friends, I'd just hand it over?

625
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:00,131
Something like that.

626
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,293
- Why is it so important to her?
- How should I know?

627
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:05,527
She was supposed to get it
for some client.

628
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,972
Said he was a pretty dangerous guy.

629
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,963
And that if you were smart,

630
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,526
you'd hand it over
and save yourself the trouble.

631
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:16,895
So you're here to protect me,
is that it?

632
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:19,043
The knife can't possibly mean
that much to you, Bruce.

633
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,149
I don't know.

634
00:37:20,226 --> 00:37:23,174
Like you said, I spent $2 million on it,
I think I'll keep it.

635
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:24,825
Why are you acting like this?

636
00:37:24,891 --> 00:37:27,533
Me? What about you?

637
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,378
Are you really Barbara Kean's
errand girl now?

638
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:31,166
I'm her partner.

639
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:34,269
But if I don't give her this knife back,

640
00:37:34,346 --> 00:37:36,902
she won't ever see me as an equal.

641
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:42,277
So I'm asking you to do me a solid.

642
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:45,291
I'm sorry, Selina.

643
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:47,277
You should go.

644
00:38:12,854 --> 00:38:14,295
Morning, Harv.

645
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:16,012
Jim, hey.

646
00:38:16,776 --> 00:38:18,057
This is Detective Harper.

647
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:20,471
She just transferred over from the 3-5.

648
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:22,479
- Jim Gordon.
- Nice to meet you, Detective.

649
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:24,401
- Heard a lot of good things.
- From who?

650
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:27,159
It's good to have you
in the fold, Harper.

651
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:28,323
Thanks.

652
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,768
Gordon.

653
00:38:33,955 --> 00:38:35,573
You got a visitor.

654
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:38,144
Hot damn.

655
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:40,182
Fox in the henhouse.

656
00:38:40,629 --> 00:38:41,862
No offense, Harper.

657
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,553
None taken.

658
00:38:45,118 --> 00:38:46,533
But you got the wrong idiom, Captain.

659
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,736
No, I don't.

660
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,435
Be right back.

661
00:38:52,482 --> 00:38:54,282
Sofia.

662
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:55,949
What are you doing here?

663
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,666
I came to help you.

664
00:38:58,056 --> 00:38:59,488
Oh, yeah? How's that?

665
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:00,980
Penguin.

666
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:03,151
Oh, I know you didn't directly ask me,

667
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,163
but
I find men tend to have trouble

668
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:07,744
seeing the simple solution even
when it's presented to them.

669
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,502
You shouldn't have come back here.

670
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:12,784
Oh, Jim.

671
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,117
I don't need your permission.

672
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,901
Or my father's.

673
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:18,462
I'm a Falcone.

674
00:39:18,698 --> 00:39:20,218
This city is my birthright.

675
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:24,126
My father might not think
I'm ready, but I am.

676
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:26,048
Is that so?

677
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:29,110
What do you think
I've been doing down south

678
00:39:29,187 --> 00:39:31,286
the past ten years?

679
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,017
You knew you were coming back

680
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:39,041
from the moment
I left your father's house.

681
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,651
Everything that's happened was what?

682
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:43,288
You sizing me up?

683
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:44,659
No.

684
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:47,101
Not everything.

685
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:51,080
But I had to get to know you
if we're gonna work together.

686
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,330
We're not.

687
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,104
Don't be sore, Jim.

688
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:57,574
You came looking for a gangster,
that's exactly what you found.

689
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,888
We can do great things
together, you and I.

690
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,618
I'll be in touch.

691
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:12,525
You?

692
00:40:12,862 --> 00:40:14,597
You were the one
who stole from me?

693
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:17,006
Some good it did.

694
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,862
The ice broke his brain.

695
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,688
What are you talking about?

696
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:23,499
What's green and red
and goes round and round?

697
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,690
Frog in a blender.

698
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:26,885
Exactly.

699
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,932
Ed couldn't even get that.

700
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:30,252
Hmm.

701
00:40:30,314 --> 00:40:34,416
It does seem unlike Ed to keep this
rube alive.

702
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:37,760
Sound the word: I want him found.

703
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:39,948
And her?

704
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:42,739
A lot of people have been
trying to steal from me lately.

705
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,053
An example needs to be made.

706
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:48,062
Have fun, Victor.

707
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,147
Love your dress.

708
00:40:58,346 --> 00:40:59,573
Thank you.

709
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:01,411
I made it.

710
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:02,868
Hmm.

711
00:41:51,249 --> 00:41:53,717
Excellent technique, Barbara.

712
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:55,678
I'm impressed.

713
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:58,126
I had a good teacher.

714
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:00,401
I wish you'd have called ahead.

715
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,978
Does that mean you don't have the knife?

716
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,142
No, Bruce Wayne has it.

717
00:42:10,584 --> 00:42:12,142
Bruce.

718
00:42:12,853 --> 00:42:14,569
Really?

719
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:17,845
How interesting.

720
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,743
You're not angry?

721
00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:20,934
No, not at all.

722
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:22,358
You see, Barbara,

723
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:24,862
when I bathed you in the Lazarus Pit,

724
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:27,577
I did it in the knowledge
that you would become

725
00:42:27,773 --> 00:42:29,573
a competent ally of mine.

726
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,439
And so far,

727
00:42:31,584 --> 00:42:33,674
you've done an admirable job.

728
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,818
I'm glad you feel that way.

729
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:42,856
And I wouldn't worry about that knife.

730
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:45,964
Didn't seem all that special to me.

731
00:42:46,124 --> 00:42:49,098
Oh, but you couldn't be more wrong.

732
00:42:49,827 --> 00:42:51,105
You see,

733
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:57,045
that knife... is the key
to everything.

734
00:43:00,236 --> 00:43:01,749
Well, not everything.
