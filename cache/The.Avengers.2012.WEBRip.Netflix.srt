1
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,572
The Tesseract has awakened.

2
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:36,745
It is on a little world,
a human world.

3
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,540
They would wield its power,

4
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:46,588
but our ally knows its workings
as they never will.

5
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,134
He is ready to lead

6
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:57,432
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,352
A world will be his.

8
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,272
The universe, yours.

9
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:10,695
And the humans,
what can they do but burn?

10
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,127
All personnel,

11
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,546
the evacuation order has been confirmed.

12
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,383
Proceed to your designated vehicles
for our assisted evacuation.

13
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,344
This is not a drill.

14
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,179
Emergency, personnel.

15
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,014
Proceed to your designated vehicles...

16
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,538
How bad is it?

17
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,791
That's the problem, sir.
We don't know.

18
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,006
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

19
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,050
NASA didn't authorize Selvig
to go to test phase.

20
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,219
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

21
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,637
Spontaneous event.

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,181
-It just turned itself on?
-Where are the energy levels now?

23
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,684
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

24
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,977
How long to get everyone out?

25
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,728
Campus should be clear in a half-hour.

26
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,729
Do better.

27
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,899
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

28
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,609
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

29
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,945
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

30
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,447
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

31
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,615
I need you to make sure

32
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,409
the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

33
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,619
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

34
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,538
Until such time as the world ends,

35
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,707
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

36
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,042
Clear out the tech below.

37
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,753
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,088
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,339
With me.

40
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,635
Talk to me, Doctor.

41
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,430
Director.

42
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,724
Is there anything we know for certain?

43
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,642
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

44
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,896
-Is that supposed to be funny?
-No, it's not funny at all.

45
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,983
The Tesseract is not only active,
she's behaving.

46
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,234
I assume you pulled the plug.

47
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,611
She's an energy source.

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,614
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

49
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,657
If she reaches peak level--

50
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,328
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

51
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,871
But we don't have the harness.

52
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,539
My calculations are far from complete.

53
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,083
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

54
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,127
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

55
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,421
That can be harmful.

56
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,256
Where's Agent Barton?

57
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,091
The Hawk?

58
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,011
Up in his nest,
as usual.

59
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,514
Agent Barton, report.

60
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,725
I gave you this detail

61
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,477
so you could keep a close eye on things.

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,978
Well, I see better from a distance.

63
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,314
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

64
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,358
Doctor, it's spiking again.

65
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,360
No one's come or gone.

66
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,861
And Selvig's clean.

67
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,988
No contacts,
no IMs.

68
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,908
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

69
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,161
"At this end"?

70
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,706
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway
to the other end of space, right?

71
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,418
Doors open from both sides.

72
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,379
Not yet.

73
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,575
Sir, please put down the spear.

74
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,115
You have heart.

75
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,605
Please don't.

76
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,025
I still need that.

77
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,985
This doesn't have to get any messier.

78
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,153
Of course it does.

79
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,072
I've come too far for anything else.

80
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,952
I am Loki, of Asgard

81
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,205
and I am burdened with glorious purpose.

82
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,456
Loki,

83
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,458
brother of Thor.

84
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,002
We have no quarrel with your people.

85
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,172
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

86
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,550
Are you planning to step on us?

87
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,344
I come with glad tidings

88
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,848
of a world made free.

89
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,641
Free from what?

90
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,851
Freedom.

91
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,854
Freedom is life's great lie.

92
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,816
Once you accept that,
in your heart,

93
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,822
you will know peace.

94
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,199
Yeah, you say "peace,"

95
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,244
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

96
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,204
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

97
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,415
This place is about to blow

98
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,459
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

99
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,919
He means to bury us.

100
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,212
Like the pharaohs of old.

101
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,590
He's right.
The portal is collapsing in on itself.

102
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,800
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

103
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,260
Well, then.

104
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,319
I need these vehicles.

105
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,949
-Who's that?
-They didn't tell me.

106
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,037
Hill!

107
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,997
Do you copy?

108
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,208
Barton has turned.

109
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,598
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

110
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,096
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

111
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,239
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

112
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,374
Director?

113
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
Director Fury, do you copy?

114
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,920
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

115
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,297
I have men down. Hill?

116
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,466
A lot of men still under.

117
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,676
I don't know how many survivors.

118
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,345
Sound a general call.

119
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,180
I want every living soul
not working rescue

120
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,348
looking for that briefcase.

121
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,641
Roger that.

122
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,892
Coulson, get back to base.

123
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,727
This is a Level Seven.

124
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,271
As of right now,

125
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,107
we are at war.

126
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,068
What do we do?

127
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,858
This is not how I wanted
this evening to go.

128
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,819
I know how you wanted this evening to go.

129
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,071
Believe me,
this is better.

130
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,824
Who are you working for?

131
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,909
Lermentov, yes?

132
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,121
Does he think

133
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,540
we have to go through him

134
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,500
to move our cargo?

135
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:37,465
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

136
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,008
Solohob

137
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,094
a bagman, a front.

138
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,267
Your outdated information betrays you.

139
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,646
The famous Black Widow

140
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:59,028
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

141
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,239
You really think I'm pretty?

142
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,912
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

143
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,207
to move the tanks.

144
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,127
Tell him he is out.

145
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,545
Well...

146
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,759
you may have to write it down.

147
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,682
Yes?

148
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,894
It's for her.

149
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,899
You listen carefully--

150
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,610
You're at 1-14 Silensky Plaza,
3rd floor.

151
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,363
We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.

152
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,157
Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block

153
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,492
before you can make the lobby.

154
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,085
-We need you to come in.
-Are you kidding? I'm working.

155
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,545
This takes precedence.

156
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,338
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

157
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,090
This moron is giving me everything.

158
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,051
I don't give everything.

159
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,555
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

160
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,639
Natasha...

161
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,016
Barton's been compromised.

162
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,729
Let me put you on hold.

163
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,148
Where is Barton now?

164
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,816
-We don't know.
-But he's alive?

165
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,942
We think so.

166
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,944
I'll brief you on everything
when you get back.

167
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,905
But first, we need you
to talk to the big guy.

168
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,408
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

169
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,786
Oh, I've got Stark.
You get the big guy.

170
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,750
Oh, my God.

171
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,685
You can't come inside.

172
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,479
Who are you?

173
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,649
Go away! Go from here!

174
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,150
There is sickness here, child!

175
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,109
You're a doctor.

176
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,110
I have to see the doctor.

177
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,987
My father's not waking up!

178
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,989
He has a fever and he's moaning

179
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,366
but his eyes won't open.

180
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,450
Speak slowly.

181
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,827
My father...

182
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,206
Like them?

183
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,378
Please.

184
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,573
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

185
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,077
You know, for a man
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

186
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,204
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

187
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,042
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

188
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,378
Then what is it? Yoga?

189
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,549
You brought me to the edge
of the city. Smart.

190
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,845
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

191
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,806
Just you and me.

192
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,767
And your actress buddy?

193
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,228
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

194
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,604
I did.

195
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,189
Who are you?

196
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,607
Natasha Romanoff.

197
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,571
Are you here to kill me, Ms. Romanoff?

198
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,073
Because that's not going
to work out for everyone.

199
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,701
No, of course not.
I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

200
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,704
S.H.I.E.L.D.

201
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,957
How did they find me?

202
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,584
We never lost you, Doctor.

203
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,793
We've kept our distance.

204
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,837
Even helped keep some other
interested parties

205
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,047
off your scent.

206
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,590
Why?

207
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,425
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

208
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,844
But now we need you to come in.

209
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,263
What if I say no?

210
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,390
I'll persuade you.

211
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,688
And what if the other guy says no?

212
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,108
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

213
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,985
I don't think you want
to break that streak.

214
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,115
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

215
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,911
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

216
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,915
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

217
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,083
This...

218
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,627
is the Tesseract.

219
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,005
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

220
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,594
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

221
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,430
He wants you to find it.
It's been taken.

222
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,768
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

223
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,146
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

224
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,316
If there was,
that's where I'd be.

225
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,069
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

226
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,821
Not that he's told me.

227
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,322
And he tells you everything?

228
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,492
Talk to Fury.
He needs you on this.

229
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,660
He needs me in a cage?

230
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,829
-No one's going to put you in a...
-Stop lying to me!

231
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,459
I'm sorry.
That was mean.

232
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,004
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

233
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,009
Why don't we do this the easy way

234
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,386
where you don't use that

235
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,223
and the other guy doesn't make a mess.

236
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:02,975
Okay?

237
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,269
Natasha?

238
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,526
Stand down.

239
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,278
We're good here.

240
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,948
"Just you and me."

241
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,703
This is out of line, Director.

242
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,581
You're dealing with forces
you can't control.

243
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,293
You ever been in a war, Councilman?
In a firefight?

244
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,212
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

245
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,300
You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?

246
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,427
Not Asgard. Loki.

247
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,388
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?

248
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,307
His brother.

249
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,434
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

250
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,643
but he's worlds away.

251
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,604
We can't depend on him to help, either.

252
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,688
It's up to us.

253
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,524
Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.

254
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,067
It was designed for exactly this--

255
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,904
Phase 2 isn't ready.
Our enemy is.

256
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,239
We need a response team.

257
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,700
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

258
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,660
This isn't about the Avengers.

259
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,912
We've seen the list.

260
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,331
You're running the world's greatest
covert security network

261
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,208
and you're going to leave
the fate of our race

262
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,711
-to a handful of freaks.
-I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

263
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,713
We need a response team.

264
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,925
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even,

265
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,845
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

266
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,680
You believe?

267
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,267
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

268
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,230
No, it's won by soldiers.

269
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,251
There's not enough time.

270
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,336
I got to put her in the water!

271
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,260
You won't be alone.

272
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,011
Oh, my God.

273
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,930
This guy is still alive!

274
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,872
Trouble sleeping?

275
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,502
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

276
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,799
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

277
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,099
When I went under,
the world was at war.

278
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,560
I wake up,
they say we won.

279
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,812
They didn't say what we lost.

280
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,690
We've made some mistakes along the way.

281
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,817
Some, very recently.

282
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,820
Are you here with a mission, sir?

283
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:02,946
I am.

284
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,448
Trying to get me back in the world?

285
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,325
Trying to save it.

286
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,873
HYDRA's secret weapon.

287
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,915
S.H.I.E.L.D. LEVEL 7
TESSERACT

288
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,834
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean

289
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,294
when he was looking for you.

290
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,421
He thought what we think.

291
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,508
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

292
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,720
That's something the world sorely needs.

293
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,640
Who took it from you?

294
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,933
He's called Loki.

295
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,519
He's not from around here.

296
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,647
There's a lot we'll have
to bring you up to speed on

297
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,732
if you're in.

298
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,027
The world has gotten even stranger

299
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,445
than you already know.

300
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,697
At this point,
I doubt anything would surprise me.

301
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,200
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

302
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,745
There's a debriefing packet

303
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,455
waiting for you back at your apartment.

304
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,335
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

305
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,628
that we ought to know now?

306
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,671
You should have left it in the ocean.

307
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,541
Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.

308
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,751
You disconnected the transmission lines?

309
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,752
Are we off the grid?

310
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,671
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon

311
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,464
of self-sustaining clean energy.

312
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,800
Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over

313
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,135
and it actually works.

314
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,386
I assume.

315
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,096
Light her up.

316
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,393
STARK

317
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:57,978
How does it look?

318
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,647
Like Christmas,
but with more me.

319
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,649
We go wider
on the public awareness campaign.

320
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,817
You need to do some press.

321
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,443
I'm in DC tomorrow,

322
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,529
I'm working on the zoning
for the other buildings.

323
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,531
Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?

324
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,740
Enjoy the moment.

325
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,867
Get in here and I will.

326
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,540
Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D.
is on the line.

327
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,791
I'm not in.

328
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,877
I'm actually out.

329
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,178
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

330
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,264
Grow a spine, Jarvis.
I got a date.

331
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,314
Levels are holding steady,
I think.

332
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,356
Of course they are.

333
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,816
I was directly involved.

334
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,069
Which brings me to my next question.
How does it feel to be a genius?

335
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,614
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

336
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:54,492
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

337
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,079
No, all this came from that.

338
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,333
Give yourself some credit. Please.

339
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,752
Stark Tower is your baby.

340
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,129
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

341
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,090
-Twelve percent?
-An argument can be made for 15.

342
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,134
Twelve percent?
My baby?

343
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,802
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

344
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,804
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

345
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,057
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

346
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,892
-That was on you.
-Oh.

347
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,852
-My private elevator...
-You mean our elevator?

348
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,230
it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

349
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,608
I'm going to pay for that comment
about percentages

350
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,360
in some subtle way later,
aren't I?

351
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,320
It's not going to be that subtle.

352
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,529
I'll tell you what.

353
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,366
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

354
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,575
On the lease.

355
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,328
Call your mom.
Can you bunk over?

356
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,538
Sir, the telephone.

357
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,999
I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.

358
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,542
Mr. Stark, we need to talk.

359
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,046
You have reached the life model
decoy of Tony Stark.

360
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,131
-Please leave a message.
-This is urgent.

361
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,216
Then leave it urgently.

362
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,011
Security breach.
It's on you.

363
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,514
-Mr. Stark.
-Phil! Come in.

364
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,682
"Phil"?

365
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,808
I can't stay.

366
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,476
His first name is "Agent."

367
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,019
Come on in.
We're celebrating.

368
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,604
Which is why he can't stay.

369
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,732
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

370
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,150
I don't like being handed things.

371
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,695
That's fine, I love to be handed things.
So, let's trade.

372
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,781
Thank you.

373
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,159
Official consulting hours
are between 8:00 and 5:00

374
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,244
every other Thursday.

375
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,370
This isn't a consultation.

376
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,663
Is this about the Avengers?

377
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,707
Which I know nothing about.

378
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,043
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped,
I thought.

379
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,461
And I didn't even qualify.

380
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,838
I didn't know that either.

381
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,841
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile,
self-obsessed,

382
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,259
don't play well with others.

383
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,343
That I did know.

384
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,262
This isn't about personality
profiles anymore.

385
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,764
Whatever. Ms. Potts, got a second?

386
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,849
Half a mo.

387
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,606
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

388
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,233
I was having 12% of a moment.

389
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,070
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

390
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,156
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

391
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,407
What is all this?

392
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,616
This is...

393
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,619
this.

394
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,712
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

395
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,629
Tomorrow.

396
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,174
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

397
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,550
Well, what if I didn't?

398
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,927
-If you didn't?
-Yeah.

399
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,262
You mean when you've finished?

400
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,184
Well, then...

401
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,024
Square deal. Fly safe.

402
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,237
Work hard.

403
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,117
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

404
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,161
-I can drop you.
-Fantastic.

405
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,998
I want to hear about the cellist.
Is that still a thing?

406
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,710
-She moved back to Portland.
-What? Boo!

407
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,513
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

408
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,020
So, this Dr. Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

409
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,605
A lot of people were.

410
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,774
You were the world's first superhero.

411
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,361
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

412
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,779
Erskine's original formula.

413
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,156
Didn't really go his way,
did it?

414
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,449
Not so much.

415
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,078
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

416
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,457
He's like a smart person.

417
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,961
I gotta say,

418
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,630
it's an honor to meet you officially.

419
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,216
I've sort of met you. I mean,

420
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,801
I watched you while you were sleeping.

421
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,264
I mean,
I was present

422
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,559
while you were unconscious from the ice.

423
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,103
You know,
it's really just a huge honor

424
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,688
to have you on board this...

425
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,023
I hope I'm the man for the job.

426
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,609
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

427
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,946
We made some modifications to the uniform.

428
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,365
I had a little design input.

429
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,742
The uniform?

430
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,535
Aren't the stars and stripes a little...

431
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,788
old-fashioned?

432
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,957
With everything that's happening

433
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,626
and the things that are about
to come to light,

434
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,547
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

435
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,750
The Chitauri grow restless.

436
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,126
Let them gird themselves.

437
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,545
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

438
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,671
Battle?

439
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,717
Against the meager might of Earth?

440
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,178
Glorious, not lengthy.

441
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,641
If your force
is as formidable as you claim.

442
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,726
You question us?

443
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,020
You question him,

444
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,940
he who put the scepter in your hand?

445
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,527
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

446
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,863
when you were cast out, defeated?

447
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,031
I was a king!

448
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,283
The rightful king of Asgard,

449
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,786
betrayed.

450
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,831
Your ambition is little

451
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,208
and born of childish need.

452
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,253
We look beyond the Earth

453
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,673
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

454
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,258
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

455
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,886
I don't threaten.

456
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,306
But until I open the doors,

457
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,060
until your force is mine to command,

458
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,105
you are but words.

459
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:01,109
You will have your war, Asgardian.

460
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,154
If you fail,

461
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:10,410
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

462
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,206
there will be no realm,
no barren moon,

463
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,334
no crevice where he cannot find you.

464
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,839
You think you know pain?

465
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:29,178
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

466
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,876
-Stow the captain's gear.
-Yes, sir.

467
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,006
Agent Romanoff,
Captain Rogers.

468
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,549
-Ma'am.
-Hi.

469
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,302
They need you on the bridge.
They're starting the face-trace.

470
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,511
See you there.

471
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,683
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

472
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,770
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

473
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,440
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

474
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,108
Trading cards?

475
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,319
They're vintage. He's very proud.

476
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,030
Dr. Banner.

477
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,700
Yeah, hi.

478
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,327
They told me you would be coming.

479
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,954
Word is,
you can find the Cube.

480
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,790
Is that the only word on me?

481
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,375
Only word I care about.

482
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,630
It must be strange for you,
all of this.

483
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,800
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

484
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,511
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

485
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,846
It's going to get
a little hard to breathe.

486
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,475
Flight crew,
secure the deck.

487
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,314
Is this a submarine?

488
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,358
Really?

489
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,486
They want me in a submerged,
pressurized, metal container?

490
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,306
No, no, this is much worse.

491
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,131
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

492
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,967
Increase collective to 8.0%.

493
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,307
Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.

494
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,976
Increase output to capacity.

495
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,978
Power plant performing at capacity.

496
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,813
We are clear.

497
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,523
All engines operating.

498
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:32,070
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

499
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,781
-We are at level, sir.
-Good.

500
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,866
Let's vanish.

501
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,951
Engage retro-reflection panels.

502
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,219
Reflection panels engaged.

503
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,762
Gentlemen.

504
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,692
Doctor, thank you for coming.

505
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,279
Thanks for asking nicely.

506
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,324
So, how long am I staying?

507
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,494
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,
you're in the wind.

508
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,870
Where are you with that?

509
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,749
We're sweeping every wirelessly
accessible camera on the planet.

510
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,043
Cell phones, laptops...

511
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,797
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

512
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,758
Still not gonna find them in time.
You have to narrow your field.

513
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,885
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

514
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,804
-How many are there?
-Call every lab you know.

515
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,806
Tell them to put the spectrometers
on the roof

516
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,349
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

517
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,561
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

518
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,855
At least we could rule out a few places.

519
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,566
Do you have somewhere for me to work?

520
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:52,942
Agent Romanoff,

521
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,069
could you show Dr. Banner
to his laboratory, please?

522
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,489
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

523
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,366
Put it over there.

524
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,787
Where did you find all these people?

525
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,832
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

526
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,959
Is this the stuff you need?

527
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,169
Yeah, iridium.

528
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,921
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

529
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,548
It's very hard to get hold of.

530
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,633
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
knows you need it.

531
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,843
Well, I didn't know.

532
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,136
Hey!

533
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,513
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

534
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,600
It's more than knowledge.
It's truth.

535
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,517
I know.

536
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,728
What did it show you,
Agent Barton?

537
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,314
My next target.

538
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,648
Tell me what you need.

539
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,528
I need a distraction.

540
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:39,947
And an eyeball.

541
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,332
I mean,
if it's not too much trouble.

542
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,917
No, no. It's fine.

543
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,213
It's a vintage set.

544
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,757
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

545
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,761
Near mint.

546
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,512
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

547
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,015
We got a hit.
A 67% match.

548
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,392
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

549
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,436
Location?

550
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,314
Stuttgart, Germany.
28 Königstrasse.

551
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,982
He's not exactly hiding.

552
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,025
Captain,

553
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,777
you're up.

554
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,183
Kneel before me.

555
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,939
I said...

556
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,110
kneel!

557
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,122
Is not this simpler?

558
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,751
Is this not your natural state?

559
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,507
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

560
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,427
that you crave subjugation.

561
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,265
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

562
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,059
in a mad scramble for power,

563
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,187
for identity.

564
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,900
You were made to be ruled.

565
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,902
In the end,

566
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,196
you will always kneel.

567
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,956
Not to men like you.

568
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,917
There are no men like me.

569
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,337
There are always men like you.

570
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,799
Look to your elder, people.

571
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,720
Let him be an example.

572
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,645
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

573
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,940
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

574
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,318
we ended up disagreeing.

575
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,527
The soldier.

576
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,615
The man out of time.

577
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,742
I'm not the one who's out of time.

578
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,623
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

579
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,602
Kneel.

580
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,479
Not today!

581
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,358
The guy's all over the place.

582
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,113
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

583
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,406
PA SYSTEM
OVERRIDE

584
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,590
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

585
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:40,933
Good move.

586
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:43,978
Mr. Stark.

587
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,813
Captain.

588
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,738
Is he saying anything?

589
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,365
Not a word.

590
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,784
Just get him here.
We're low on time.

591
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,080
I don't like it.

592
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,082
What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

593
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,667
I don't remember it being that easy.

594
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,627
This guy packs a wallop.

595
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,505
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

596
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,633
What's your thing, Pilates?

597
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,093
What?

598
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,219
It's like calisthenics.

599
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,929
You might have missed a couple of things

600
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,181
doing time as a Capsicle.

601
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,893
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

602
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,146
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

603
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,481
Where's this coming from?

604
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,363
What's the matter?
Scared of a little lightning?

605
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,074
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

606
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,135
What are you doing?

607
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,608
And now there's that guy.

608
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,942
Another Asgardian?

609
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,528
-That guy's a friendly?
-Doesn't matter.

610
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,448
If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.

611
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,533
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

612
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,702
I have a plan. Attack.

613
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,377
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

614
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,045
I don't see how I can.

615
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,798
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

616
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,675
There's only one God, ma'am.

617
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,593
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

618
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,610
Where is the Tesseract?

619
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,695
I missed you, too.

620
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,322
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

621
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,157
You should thank me.

622
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,035
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

623
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,496
did the Allfather have to muster
to conjure you here,

624
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,331
your precious Earth?

625
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,503
I thought you dead.

626
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,214
Did you mourn?

627
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,342
We all did. Our father...

628
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,761
Your father.

629
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,474
He did tell you my true parentage,
did he not?

630
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,312
We were raised together.

631
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,649
We played together,
we fought together.

632
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,734
Do you remember none of that?

633
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,069
I remember a shadow.

634
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,365
Living in the shade of your greatness.

635
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,619
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

636
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,872
I, who was, and should be, king!

637
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,166
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

638
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,459
for your imagined slights?

639
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,254
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

640
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,925
And you're doing
a marvelous job with that.

641
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,720
The humans slaughter each other in droves

642
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,263
while you idly fret.

643
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,016
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

644
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,476
You think yourself above them?

645
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,769
Well, yes.

646
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,022
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

647
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,858
A throne would suit you ill.

648
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,032
I've seen worlds you've never known about!

649
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:29,661
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

650
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,414
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

651
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,874
and when I wield it...

652
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,042
Who showed you this power?

653
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,003
Who controls the would-be king?

654
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,671
-I am a king!
-Not here!

655
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,548
You give up the Tesseract!

656
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,133
You give up this poisonous dream!

657
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:47,971
You come home.

658
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,228
I don't have it.

659
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,315
You need the Cube to bring me home.

660
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,192
But I've sent it off,
I know not where.

661
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,195
You listen well, brother...

662
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,698
I'm listening.

663
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,376
Do not touch me again.

664
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,211
Then don't take my stuff.

665
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,713
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

666
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,675
Shakespeare in the Park?

667
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,096
Doth Mother know you weareth her drapes?

668
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,557
This is beyond you, metal man.

669
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,601
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

670
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,520
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours.

671
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:37,688
Until then...

672
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,398
stay out of the way.

673
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,192
Tourist.

674
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,157
Okay.

675
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,523
Power at 400% capacity.

676
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,150
How about that?

677
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:24,920
Hey!

678
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,674
That's enough.

679
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,554
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

680
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,057
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

681
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,768
Then prove it.
Put that hammer down.

682
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,061
Yeah... No.

683
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,646
Bad call.
He loves his hammer.

684
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,982
You want me to put the hammer down?

685
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:14,886
Are we done here?

686
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,228
In case it's unclear,

687
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,440
if you try to escape,

688
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,068
if you so much as scratch that glass,

689
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,999
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

690
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,751
You get how that works?

691
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,714
Ant, boot.

692
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,220
It's an impressive cage.

693
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,306
Not built, I think, for me.

694
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,684
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

695
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,102
Oh, I've heard.

696
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,897
A mindless beast.

697
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,650
Makes play he's still a man.

698
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,528
How desperate are you,

699
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:58,073
that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?

700
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,950
How desperate am I?

701
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,869
You threaten my world with war.

702
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,163
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

703
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:08,291
You talk about peace,
and you kill 'cause it's fun.

704
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,045
You have made me very desperate.

705
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,381
You might not be glad that you did.

706
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:15,966
Ooh.

707
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,136
It burns you to have come so close.

708
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,058
To have the Tesseract,
to have power,

709
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,394
unlimited power.

710
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,479
And for what?

711
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,150
A warm light for all mankind to share.

712
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,822
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

713
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:47,205
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

714
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,632
He really grows on you,
doesn't he?

715
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,925
Loki's gonna drag this out.

716
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:03,096
So, Thor, what's his play?

717
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,640
He has an army called the Chitauri.

718
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,268
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

719
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,521
He means to lead them against your people.

720
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,315
They will win him the Earth,

721
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,400
in return, I suspect,
for the Tesseract.

722
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,401
An army

723
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,653
from outer space.

724
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,906
So, he's building another portal.

725
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,700
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

726
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,826
Selvig?

727
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,953
-He's an astrophysicist.
-He's a friend.

728
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,997
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

729
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,333
along with one of ours.

730
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,043
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

731
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,628
He's not leading an army from here.

732
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,463
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

733
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,423
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

734
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,674
You could smell crazy on him.

735
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,176
Have care how you speak.

736
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,179
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

737
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,680
And he is my brother.

738
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,766
He killed 80 people in two days.

739
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,643
He's adopted.

740
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,478
I think it's about the mechanics.

741
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,522
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

742
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,607
It's a stabilizing agent.

743
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,192
I'm just saying,
pick a weekend.

744
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,526
I'll fly you to Portland.

745
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,653
Keep love alive.

746
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,656
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

747
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,823
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

748
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,327
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

749
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,622
Also, it means the portal can open as wide

750
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,916
and stay open as long as Loki wants.

751
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,961
Raise the mizzenmast.
Jib the topsails.

752
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,964
That man is playing Galaga.

753
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,842
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

754
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,721
How does Fury even see these?

755
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,764
He turns.

756
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:28,974
Sounds exhausting.

757
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,310
The rest of the raw materials,

758
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,479
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

759
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,856
The only major component he still needs

760
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,985
is a power source of high-energy density.

761
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,405
Something to kick-start the Cube.

762
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,783
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

763
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:47,951
Last night.

764
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,871
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

765
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,540
Am I the only one who did the reading?

766
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,750
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

767
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,045
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

768
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,839
just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

769
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,383
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilize

770
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,676
the quantum tunneling effect.

771
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:05,802
Well, if he could do that,

772
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,430
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

773
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,306
Finally, someone who speaks English.

774
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,225
Is that what just happened?

775
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,686
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

776
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,440
Your work on anti-electron collisions
is unparalleled.

777
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,650
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

778
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,527
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

779
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,238
Thanks.

780
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,033
Dr. Banner is only here to track the Cube.

781
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,617
I was hoping you might join him.

782
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,077
I'd start with that stick of his.

783
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,663
It may be magical
but it works a lot like a HYDRA weapon.

784
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,541
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

785
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,002
And I'd like to know how Loki used it

786
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,795
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

787
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,422
into his personal flying monkeys.

788
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,966
Monkeys? I do not understand.

789
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:45,925
I do.

790
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,096
I understood that reference.

791
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,348
Shall we play, Doctor?

792
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:53,933
This way, sir.

793
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,366
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

794
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,160
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

795
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,245
But it's going to take weeks to process.

796
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,207
If we bypass their mainframe and direct
route to the H.O.M.E.R. cluster,

797
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,251
we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.

798
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,254
All I packed was a toothbrush.

799
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,382
You should come by Stark Tower sometime.

800
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,593
Top ten floors,
all R&amp;D.

801
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,345
You'd love it.
It's Candy Land.

802
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,597
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

803
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,475
I kind of broke Harlem.

804
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,852
Well, I promise a stress-free environment.

805
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,771
No tension, no surprises.

806
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,982
-Hey!
-Nothing?

807
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,109
Are you nuts?

808
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,193
Jury's out.

809
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,362
You really have got a lid on it.
What's your secret?

810
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,155
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

811
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,406
Is everything a joke to you?

812
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,699
Funny things are.

813
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,369
Threatening the safety of everyone
on this ship isn't funny.

814
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,246
No offense, Doc.

815
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,872
It's okay,
I wouldn't have come aboard

816
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,874
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

817
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,336
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

818
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,213
You need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

819
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,464
Do you think I'm not?

820
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,509
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

821
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,052
What isn't he telling us?

822
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,388
I can't do the equation
unless I have all the variables.

823
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,265
You think Fury's hiding something?

824
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,143
He's a spy.
Captain, he's "the" spy.

825
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,145
His secrets have secrets.

826
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,230
It's bugging him, too.
Isn't it?

827
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,314
Uh...

828
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,985
I just want to finish my work here, and...

829
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:27,902
Doctor?

830
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,118
"A warm light for all mankind."

831
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,912
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

832
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:38,913
I heard it.

833
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,457
I think that was meant for you.

834
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,503
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

835
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,838
it was still all over the news.

836
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,048
The Stark Tower?
That big, ugly...

837
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,217
building in New York?

838
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,179
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

839
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,348
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

840
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,683
It's just the prototype.

841
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,644
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

842
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,146
That's what he's getting at.

843
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:06,316
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

844
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,401
What are they doing in the energy business

845
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,319
in the first place?

846
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,780
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program

847
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,200
finishes breaking into
all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

848
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,284
I'm sorry. Did you say...

849
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,161
Jarvis has been on it
since I hit the bridge.

850
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,205
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

851
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,165
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.
Blueberry?

852
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,375
Yet you wonder why
they didn't want you around.

853
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,545
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence?

854
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,255
Historically, not awesome.

855
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,924
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

856
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,426
This is a man who means to start a war

857
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,261
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

858
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,598
We have orders.
We should follow them.

859
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,475
Following's not really my style.

860
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,895
And you're all about style,
aren't you?

861
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,064
Of the people in this room,

862
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,815
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

863
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,108
and, B, not of use?

864
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,238
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

865
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,367
Just find the Cube.

866
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,006
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?

867
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,467
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

868
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,887
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

869
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,514
He does have the jump on us.

870
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,475
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

871
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,310
It's gonna blow up in his face.

872
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,396
And I'm going to be there when it does.

873
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,107
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

874
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,819
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

875
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,240
You see, I don't get a suit of armor.

876
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:41,286
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

877
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,870
It's a nightmare.

878
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,541
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

879
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:47,959
to crawl its way into my heart.

880
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,919
This stops it.

881
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,964
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

882
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,341
not just armor.

883
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,636
It's a terrible privilege.

884
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,889
-But you can control it.
-Because I learned how.

885
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:02,974
It's different.

886
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:06,060
Hey, I read all about your accident.

887
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:09,397
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

888
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,025
So you're saying that the Hulk...

889
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,195
The other guy saved my life?

890
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,864
That's nice.

891
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:22,285
It's a nice sentiment.
Saved it for what?

892
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,288
I guess we'll find out.

893
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,000
You may not enjoy that.

894
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,877
And you just might.

895
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,174
SECURE STORAGE 10-C

896
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,105
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

897
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,398
we moved Jane Foster.

898
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,567
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

899
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,237
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

900
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,157
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

901
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:45,827
She'll be safe.

902
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,744
Thank you.

903
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,249
It's no accident,
Loki taking Erik Selvig.

904
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,043
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

905
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,254
Erik is a good man.

906
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,380
He talks about you a lot.

907
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,341
You changed his life.

908
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,345
You changed everything around here.

909
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,097
They were better as they were.

910
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,809
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

911
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:13,229
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

912
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,356
-Like what?
-Bilge snipe.

913
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,234
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

914
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,028
-You don't have those?
-I don't think so.

915
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,697
Well, they are repulsive.

916
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,367
And they trample everything in their path.

917
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:38,004
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

918
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,505
and your people paid the price.

919
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,591
And now, again.

920
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,387
In my youth,
I courted war.

921
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,308
War hasn't started yet.

922
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,979
You think you could make Loki tell us
where the Tesseract is?

923
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,775
I do not know.
Loki's mind is far afield.

924
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,195
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

925
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,573
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

926
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,159
A lot of guys think that

927
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,495
until the pain starts.

928
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,332
What are you asking me to do?

929
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,169
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

930
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,420
Loki is a prisoner.

931
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,881
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

932
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,257
that wants to be here?

933
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,481
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

934
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,775
But you figured I'd come.

935
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:42,610
After.

936
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,864
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

937
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,660
you would appear as a friend,
as a balm.

938
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,746
And I would cooperate.

939
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,998
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

940
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,084
I would say I've expanded his mind.

941
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,171
And once you've won,

942
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,174
once you're king of the mountain,

943
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,803
what happens to his mind?

944
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,515
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

945
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,268
Love is for children.
I owe him a debt.

946
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:19,981
Tell me.

947
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,698
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D. I, uh...

948
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:34,203
Well, I made a name for myself.

949
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,498
I have a very specific skill set.

950
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:41,752
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

951
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,339
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

952
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:49,677
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

953
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:52,930
He made a different call.

954
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,768
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

955
01:04:58,811 --> 01:04:59,770
Not let you out.

956
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,397
No, but I like this.

957
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:06,068
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

958
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,029
Regimes fall every day.

959
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,698
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

960
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,116
Or I was.

961
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:14,869
And what are you now?

962
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,622
It's really not that complicated.

963
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:22,168
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

964
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:24,921
Can you?

965
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,342
Can you wipe out that much red?

966
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,179
Dreykov's daughter,

967
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,223
São Paulo,

968
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,352
the hospital fire?

969
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,647
Barton told me everything.

970
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,859
Your ledger is dripping.
It's gushing red

971
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,654
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

972
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:50,863
will change anything?

973
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,366
This is the basest sentimentality.

974
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,910
This is a child at prayer.

975
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,328
Pathetic!

976
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,164
You lie and kill

977
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,960
in the service of liars and killers.

978
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:10,049
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,

979
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,593
something that makes up for the horrors.

980
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,638
But they are part of you.

981
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:19,850
And they will never go away.

982
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:24,522
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

983
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,941
Slowly, intimately,

984
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,318
in every way he knows you fear.

985
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,738
And then he'll wake just long enough
to see his good work

986
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,783
and when he screams,
I'll split his skull.

987
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,995
This is my bargain,
you mewling quim.

988
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,623
You're a monster.

989
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,085
Oh, no.

990
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,963
You brought the monster.

991
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,426
So, Banner.

992
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,803
That's your play.

993
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,887
What?

994
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,390
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

995
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,017
Keep Banner in the lab.
I'm on my way.

996
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,351
Send Thor as well.

997
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:04,979
Thank you

998
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:06,897
for your cooperation.

999
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,699
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

1000
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,368
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1001
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,662
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1002
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,623
The model's locked
and we're sweeping for the signature now.

1003
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,541
When we get a hit,

1004
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,418
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1005
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:30,838
Yeah, then you get your Cube back.
No muss, no fuss.

1006
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,215
What is "Phase 2"?

1007
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,387
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1008
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,431
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1009
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:43,184
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1010
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,561
-This does not mean that we're making...
-I'm sorry, Nick.

1011
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:46,812
What were you lying?

1012
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,398
I was wrong, Director.

1013
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,858
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1014
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:51,984
Did you know about this?

1015
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:54,987
You want to think about removing yourself
from this environment, Doctor?

1016
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,031
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1017
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,491
Loki is manipulating you.

1018
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,034
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1019
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,411
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1020
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,164
Yes, and I'm not leaving
because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

1021
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,792
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.
is using the Tesseract

1022
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,835
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1023
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:11,879
Because of him.

1024
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,340
Me?

1025
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,510
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1026
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,513
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

1027
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:23,099
We learned that not only are we not alone

1028
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:26,894
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1029
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,146
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1030
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,232
But you're not the only people out there,
are you?

1031
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,359
And you're not the only threat.

1032
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:36,445
The world's filling up with people
who can't be matched,

1033
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,531
that can't be controlled.

1034
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:39,907
Like you controlled the Cube?

1035
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,660
Your work with the Tesseract
is what drew Loki to it,

1036
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:43,953
and his allies.

1037
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,621
It is a signal to all the realms

1038
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:48,207
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1039
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,709
A higher form?
You forced our hand.

1040
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,087
-We had to come up with something.
-A nuclear deterrent.

1041
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:55,131
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1042
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,591
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1043
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,094
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1044
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:01,720
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1045
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:02,972
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1046
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:05,141
I thought humans
were more evolved than this.

1047
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:08,185
Excuse me, did we come to your planet
and blow stuff up?

1048
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,062
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1049
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,564
Are you boys really that naive?

1050
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,941
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1051
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:16,110
-Captain America's on threat watch?
-We all are.

1052
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:17,611
Wait, you're on that list?

1053
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,405
Are you above or below angry bees?

1054
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,907
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

1055
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,576
Threat! Verbal threat.
I feel threatened.

1056
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,035
-Show some respect.
-Respect what?

1057
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,880
Transport 66 Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.

1058
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,257
I've got you on the computer
but not on the day log.

1059
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,717
What is your haul? Over.

1060
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,344
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1061
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,939
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1062
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,232
That's his M.O.,
isn't it?

1063
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,817
I mean, what are we,
a team?

1064
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,653
No, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

1065
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,947
We're a time bomb.

1066
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,033
You need to step away.

1067
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,993
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

1068
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:07,953
You know damn well why.
Back off!

1069
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,914
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1070
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,042
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armor.

1071
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,086
Take that off,
what are you?

1072
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,339
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

1073
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,508
I know guys with none of that
worth ten of you.

1074
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:23,636
I've seen the footage.

1075
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,804
The only thing
you really fight for is yourself.

1076
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,141
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

1077
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,852
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1078
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,395
I think I would just cut the wire.

1079
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:37,775
Always a way out.

1080
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,361
You may not be a threat

1081
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,279
but you better stop
pretending to be a hero.

1082
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,406
A hero? Like you?

1083
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,076
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1084
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:49,954
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

1085
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,898
Put on the suit.
Let's go a few rounds.

1086
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,612
You people are so petty and tiny.

1087
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:24,822
Yeah, this is a team.

1088
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:27,157
Agent Romanoff, would you escort
Dr. Banner back to his...

1089
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,285
Where? You rented my room.

1090
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,911
The cell was just in case...

1091
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,329
In case you needed to kill me.

1092
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,581
But you can't.
I know, I tried.

1093
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,963
I got low.
I didn't see an end.

1094
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:44,383
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1095
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:47,386
So I moved on.

1096
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,222
I focused on helping other people.
I was good.

1097
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,558
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1098
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,018
and put everyone here at risk.

1099
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:56,395
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

1100
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,938
You want to know how I stay calm?

1101
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,234
Dr. Banner,

1102
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,279
put down the scepter.

1103
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:15,080
Got it.

1104
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:19,168
Sorry, kids, you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1105
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:21,337
-You located the Tesseract?
-I can get there fastest.

1106
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,505
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard,
not with humans.

1107
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,965
-Not alone.
-You're gonna stop me?

1108
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,383
Put on the suit,
let's find out.

1109
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,801
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1110
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:28,886
Put on the suit.

1111
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,180
ENERGY SIGNATURE MATCH 100%

1112
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,556
Oh, my God.

1113
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,948
-Put on the suit.
-Yeah.

1114
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,204
All hands to stations.

1115
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,377
-Hill!
-External detonation.

1116
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,545
Number three engine is down.

1117
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,297
-We've been hit.
-Can they get it running?

1118
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,799
-Fire in engine three!
-Talk to me.

1119
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,342
Turbine looks mostly intact

1120
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:11,428
but it's impossible to get out there
to make repairs while we're in the air.

1121
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,847
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1122
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,642
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1123
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,352
-Stark, you copy that?
-I'm on it.

1124
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:22,022
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section

1125
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,190
then get to the armory.

1126
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:24,108
Romanoff?

1127
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:28,612
We're okay.

1128
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,075
We're okay, right?

1129
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:47,172
-Keep that engine down!
-Yes, sir.

1130
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,924
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1131
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:49,883
-Got it.
-Stay close.

1132
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:53,971
Let's go, Level 4.

1133
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,557
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1134
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:06,859
Doctor?

1135
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,195
Bruce?

1136
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:13,407
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

1137
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,702
We're gonna be okay.
Listen to me.

1138
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,454
Are you hurt?

1139
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,375
We're going to be okay.
All right?

1140
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,462
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

1141
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,088
You will walk away and never ever...

1142
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,006
Your life?

1143
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,524
Bruce.

1144
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,980
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0,
heading south!

1145
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,566
-Take us to the water!
-We're flying blind.

1146
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,568
Navigation's recalibrating
post engine failure.

1147
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,445
Is the sun coming up?

1148
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,323
-Yes, sir.
-Then put it on the left.

1149
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,283
Get us over water.

1150
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,369
One more turbine goes down and we drop.

1151
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:43,288
Thanks.

1152
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:48,293
Stark!

1153
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:52,464
Stark, I'm here!

1154
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:53,966
Good.

1155
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:56,843
Let's see what we've got.

1156
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:00,806
I got to get this superconducting
coolant system back online

1157
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,349
before I can access the rotors,

1158
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:03,892
work on dislodging the debris.

1159
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,480
I need you to get to that
engine control panel

1160
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,566
and tell me which relays
are in overload position.

1161
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,831
What does it look like in there?

1162
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,875
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

1163
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,586
Well, you're not wrong.

1164
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:37,527
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1165
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,154
Try to think!

1166
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:50,582
Okay, the relays are intact.

1167
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,417
What's our next move?

1168
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,752
Even if I clear the rotors,

1169
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,629
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.

1170
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:57,339
I'm gonna have to get in and push.

1171
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,257
If that thing speeds up,
you'll get shredded.

1172
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:01,551
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1173
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,387
long enough to disengage maglev,
and that...

1174
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,554
Speak English!

1175
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,848
You see that red lever?

1176
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,352
It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.

1177
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:12,312
Stand by it.
Wait for my word.

1178
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,658
We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.

1179
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,413
Grenade!

1180
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:27,220
We've got a perimeter breach!

1181
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,556
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

1182
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:30,849
Call-outs at every junction.

1183
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,485
We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.

1184
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,028
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1185
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,988
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1186
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,324
Get his attention.

1187
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:51,369
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone
and engage hostile.

1188
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,205
Don't get too close.

1189
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:54,539
Copy.

1190
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:07,761
Target acquired.

1191
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:13,141
Target engaged.

1192
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,363
Target angry, target angry!

1193
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,100
They're not getting through here,
so what the hell...

1194
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,781
MALFUNCTION

1195
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:57,120
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1196
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:08,131
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1197
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,216
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.

1198
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,677
It's Barton.
He took out our systems.

1199
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,471
He's headed for the detention level.

1200
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:16,806
Does anybody copy?

1201
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:19,935
This is Agent Romanoff.

1202
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:22,020
I copy.

1203
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,151
Stark, we're losing altitude.

1204
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:29,277
Yeah, I noticed.

1205
01:22:58,348 --> 01:22:59,307
No!

1206
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:09,150
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1207
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,571
The humans think us immortal.

1208
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,282
Should we test that?

1209
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:01,536
Move away, please.

1210
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:07,167
You like this?

1211
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:11,379
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1212
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:14,424
Even I don't know what it does.

1213
01:24:16,259 --> 01:24:17,218
Do you want to find out?

1214
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:20,847
No!

1215
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:31,251
Natasha?

1216
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,534
You're going to lose.

1217
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:07,996
Am I?

1218
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:12,250
-It's in your nature.
-Hmm.

1219
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,920
Your heroes are scattered.

1220
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,549
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1221
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:22,260
Where is my disadvantage?

1222
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:24,512
You lack conviction.

1223
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:26,598
I don't think I'm...

1224
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,023
So, that's what it does.

1225
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:40,195
All hands to crash stations immediately.

1226
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:09,098
Cap, hit the lever.

1227
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,892
I need a minute here!

1228
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:13,561
Lever

1229
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:14,520
now!

1230
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,198
Uh-oh.

1231
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:27,825
Help!

1232
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:04,153
Sorry, boss.

1233
01:28:04,862 --> 01:28:06,072
The god rabbited.

1234
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:07,991
Just stay awake.

1235
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:09,784
Eyes on me.

1236
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,536
No, I'm clocking out here.

1237
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:12,829
Not an option.

1238
01:28:14,163 --> 01:28:15,456
It's okay, boss.

1239
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:19,544
This was never gonna work

1240
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:21,671
if they didn't have something

1241
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:23,589
to...

1242
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:55,079
Agent Coulson is down.

1243
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:58,624
A medical team is on its way
to your location.

1244
01:28:58,708 --> 01:28:59,625
They're here.

1245
01:29:03,254 --> 01:29:04,088
They called it.

1246
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:22,982
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1247
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:28,112
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

1248
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:33,409
We're dead in the air up here.

1249
01:29:33,826 --> 01:29:36,371
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1250
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:39,082
Banner, Thor...

1251
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:41,876
I got nothing for you.

1252
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:44,670
I lost my one good eye.

1253
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:49,967
Maybe I had that coming.

1254
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:56,682
Yes,

1255
01:29:58,309 --> 01:30:01,521
we were going to build an arsenal
with the Tesseract.

1256
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:05,358
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1257
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:07,568
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1258
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,952
There was an idea,
Stark knows this,

1259
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:20,665
called the Avengers Initiative.

1260
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:26,921
The idea was to bring together a group
of remarkable people

1261
01:30:28,422 --> 01:30:30,216
to see if they could become
something more.

1262
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:35,596
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1263
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,891
to fight the battles that we never could.

1264
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:47,150
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1265
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:51,279
In heroes.

1266
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:00,830
Well,

1267
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,292
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1268
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:27,023
You fell out of the sky.

1269
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:42,997
Did I hurt anybody?

1270
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:45,625
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1271
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:49,170
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1272
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,714
Lucky.

1273
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:53,591
Or just good aim.

1274
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,134
You were awake when you fell.

1275
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,138
-You saw?
-The whole thing.

1276
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,681
Right through the ceiling.

1277
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:04,310
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1278
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,270
Here.

1279
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:10,107
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1280
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,692
to a regular-size feller.

1281
01:32:14,987 --> 01:32:15,863
Thank you.

1282
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:18,449
Are you an alien?

1283
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:19,867
What?

1284
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:21,827
From outer space,
an alien.

1285
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:23,329
No.

1286
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:26,916
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1287
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:40,012
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1288
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:44,684
You know that?

1289
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:47,645
Is that what you know?

1290
01:32:52,441 --> 01:32:53,317
I've got no window.

1291
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:55,569
I have to flush him out.

1292
01:32:56,862 --> 01:32:58,739
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1293
01:32:58,823 --> 01:32:59,907
You don't understand.

1294
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:04,870
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1295
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:09,375
Pull you out and stuff something else in?

1296
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:15,381
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

1297
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:18,718
You know that I do.

1298
01:33:27,601 --> 01:33:28,602
Why am I back?

1299
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:30,730
How did you get him out?

1300
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:32,815
Cognitive recalibration.

1301
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:35,484
I hit you really hard on the head.

1302
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,154
Thanks.

1303
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:43,367
Natasha...

1304
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,537
-How many agents did I...
-Don't.

1305
01:33:47,621 --> 01:33:49,165
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1306
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:51,500
This is Loki.

1307
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,795
This is monsters and magic,

1308
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,547
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1309
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:59,175
-Loki, did he get away?
-Yeah.

1310
01:33:59,633 --> 01:34:01,010
I don't suppose you know where.

1311
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:03,137
I didn't need to know.

1312
01:34:03,846 --> 01:34:04,764
I didn't ask.

1313
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,728
He's going to make his play soon, though.

1314
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:12,897
Today.

1315
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,106
We got to stop him.

1316
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:16,275
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1317
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:18,027
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1318
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:20,196
Well,

1319
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,825
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1320
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:26,702
I would sleep better,
I suppose.

1321
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:31,540
Now you sound like you.

1322
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:33,542
But you don't.

1323
01:34:36,128 --> 01:34:38,214
You're a spy,
not a soldier.

1324
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:42,968
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1325
01:34:45,429 --> 01:34:46,847
What did Loki do to you?

1326
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:49,809
He didn't. I just...

1327
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:55,356
Natasha.

1328
01:34:58,067 --> 01:34:59,485
I've been compromised.

1329
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,532
I got red in my ledger.

1330
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:08,494
I would like to wipe it out.

1331
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:26,470
Was he married?

1332
01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:27,763
No.

1333
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:32,685
There was a cellist,
I think.

1334
01:35:34,186 --> 01:35:35,062
I'm sorry.

1335
01:35:36,355 --> 01:35:37,815
He seemed like a good man.

1336
01:35:39,608 --> 01:35:40,651
He was an idiot.

1337
01:35:40,734 --> 01:35:42,528
Why? For believing?

1338
01:35:42,778 --> 01:35:44,029
For taking on Loki alone.

1339
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:45,865
He was doing his job.

1340
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:48,826
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1341
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:50,119
He should have...

1342
01:35:50,536 --> 01:35:52,079
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1343
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:53,831
Right, I've heard that before.

1344
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:55,791
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1345
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,460
We are not soldiers.

1346
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,799
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1347
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:05,259
Neither am I.

1348
01:36:05,342 --> 01:36:07,386
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1349
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:09,263
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1350
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:10,431
and get this done.

1351
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:13,684
Loki needs a power source.
If we can put together a list...

1352
01:36:13,767 --> 01:36:15,769
-He made it personal.
-That's not the point.

1353
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:18,272
That is the point.
That's Loki's point.

1354
01:36:18,397 --> 01:36:20,357
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1355
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:21,525
To tear us apart.

1356
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,611
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1357
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:26,197
but he knows he has
to take us out to win, right?

1358
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,573
That's what he wants.

1359
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:30,117
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1360
01:36:30,701 --> 01:36:31,869
He wants an audience.

1361
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,996
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1362
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:37,333
Yeah, that's just previews.
This is opening night.

1363
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:39,960
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1364
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:41,545
He wants flowers,
he wants parades.

1365
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:44,673
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

1366
01:36:47,259 --> 01:36:48,219
Son of a bitch.

1367
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,648
Time to go.

1368
01:37:01,106 --> 01:37:02,733
-Go where?
-I'll tell you on the way.

1369
01:37:02,816 --> 01:37:04,818
Can you fly one of those jets?

1370
01:37:05,444 --> 01:37:06,529
I can.

1371
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,701
-You got a suit?
-Yeah.

1372
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:13,786
Then suit up.

1373
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:43,691
Hey, you guys aren't
authorized to be in here.

1374
01:37:43,816 --> 01:37:45,609
Son, just don't.

1375
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,863
-Sir.
-Agent Hill.

1376
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:51,907
Those cards,

1377
01:37:54,326 --> 01:37:57,830
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

1378
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:04,587
They needed the push.

1379
01:38:07,923 --> 01:38:10,134
We have an unauthorized departure
from Bay 6.

1380
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:12,261
They found him.

1381
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,848
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1382
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:19,143
-I want eyes on everything.
-Yes, sir.

1383
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:34,783
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

1384
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,037
but the device is already self-sustaining.

1385
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,247
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

1386
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:42,750
It's too late!

1387
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,295
She can't stop now.

1388
01:38:47,379 --> 01:38:49,131
She wants to show us something!

1389
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,550
A new universe.

1390
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:52,926
Okay.

1391
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:02,478
The barrier is pure energy.

1392
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:04,480
It's unbreachable.

1393
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:05,856
Yeah, I got that.

1394
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:08,734
Plan B.

1395
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:12,112
Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready
for deployment.

1396
01:39:12,237 --> 01:39:14,198
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1397
01:39:34,176 --> 01:39:36,637
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1398
01:39:38,347 --> 01:39:40,015
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1399
01:39:40,724 --> 01:39:42,226
You should've left your armor on.

1400
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:43,310
Yeah.

1401
01:39:43,977 --> 01:39:45,104
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1402
01:39:45,187 --> 01:39:47,648
and you've got the glow stick of destiny.

1403
01:39:48,607 --> 01:39:49,608
Would you like a drink?

1404
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:52,069
Stalling me won't change anything.

1405
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:53,529
No, no. Threatening.

1406
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:55,698
No drink?
Are you sure?

1407
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:57,157
I'm having one.

1408
01:39:58,617 --> 01:40:02,121
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1409
01:40:03,455 --> 01:40:04,665
What have I to fear?

1410
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:06,083
The Avengers.

1411
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:10,963
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1412
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,756
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

1413
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,675
Yes, I've met them.

1414
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:15,801
Yeah.

1415
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:18,470
It takes us a while to get any traction,
I'll give you that one.

1416
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:20,305
But let's do a head count, here.

1417
01:40:20,889 --> 01:40:22,725
Your brother,
the demigod,

1418
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:28,480
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1419
01:40:28,814 --> 01:40:31,900
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1420
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:35,028
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1421
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:38,490
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1422
01:40:38,782 --> 01:40:39,783
That was the plan.

1423
01:40:40,242 --> 01:40:41,243
Not a great plan.

1424
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:43,162
When they come,

1425
01:40:44,329 --> 01:40:45,372
and they will,

1426
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:46,331
they'll come for you.

1427
01:40:47,249 --> 01:40:48,167
I have an army.

1428
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,334
We have a Hulk.

1429
01:40:50,002 --> 01:40:51,503
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1430
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:53,547
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1431
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:56,633
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1432
01:40:57,634 --> 01:40:59,970
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

1433
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:01,305
but it's all on you.

1434
01:41:03,098 --> 01:41:06,351
Because if we can't protect the Earth,
you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.

1435
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,273
How will your friends have time for me

1436
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:14,276
when they are so busy fighting you?

1437
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:22,785
This usually works.

1438
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:25,662
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

1439
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:26,997
One out of five...

1440
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,376
Jarvis, anytime now.

1441
01:41:34,087 --> 01:41:36,548
You will all fall before me.

1442
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,841
Deploy!

1443
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:39,384
Deploy!

1444
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:08,789
And there's one other
person you pissed off.

1445
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:12,084
His name was Phil.

1446
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:37,109
Right.

1447
01:42:37,734 --> 01:42:38,610
Army.

1448
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:05,888
STARK

1449
01:43:50,849 --> 01:43:51,683
Loki!

1450
01:43:53,101 --> 01:43:54,770
Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it.

1451
01:43:54,853 --> 01:43:55,854
You can't.

1452
01:43:56,021 --> 01:43:57,272
There is no stopping it.

1453
01:43:57,981 --> 01:43:59,274
There is only

1454
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,068
the war.

1455
01:44:01,151 --> 01:44:02,194
So be it.

1456
01:44:24,341 --> 01:44:26,134
Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.

1457
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:28,178
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1458
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:30,222
Swing up Park.
I'm going to lay them out for you.

1459
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:49,908
Sir, we have more incoming.

1460
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,326
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1461
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:00,127
-Nat?
-I see him.

1462
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,089
We got to get back up there.

1463
01:46:38,266 --> 01:46:39,726
Stark, are you seeing this?

1464
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:42,854
Seeing. Still working on believing.

1465
01:46:43,146 --> 01:46:44,564
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

1466
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:45,690
Banner?

1467
01:46:45,857 --> 01:46:46,942
Just keep me posted.

1468
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:49,027
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1469
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:53,365
Look at this!

1470
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:54,908
Look around you!

1471
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:58,829
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1472
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:01,164
It's too late.

1473
01:47:03,166 --> 01:47:04,459
It's too late to stop it.

1474
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:07,629
No. We can, together.

1475
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:15,720
Sentiment.

1476
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:46,668
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

1477
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:49,129
Loki.

1478
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:02,017
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1479
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:09,941
We got this. It's good. Go.

1480
01:48:10,025 --> 01:48:11,443
Do you think you can hold them off?

1481
01:48:11,902 --> 01:48:12,736
Captain,

1482
01:48:14,487 --> 01:48:16,156
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1483
01:48:44,517 --> 01:48:46,102
Just like Budapest all over again.

1484
01:48:46,895 --> 01:48:49,147
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1485
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:08,375
It's going to be an hour before they can
scramble the National Guard.

1486
01:49:08,458 --> 01:49:09,292
National Guard?

1487
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:12,337
Does the army know what's happening here?

1488
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:13,421
Do we?

1489
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:16,049
You need men in these buildings.

1490
01:49:16,132 --> 01:49:19,052
There are people inside who'll be running
right into the line of fire.

1491
01:49:19,135 --> 01:49:21,221
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1492
01:49:21,304 --> 01:49:22,973
You keep them off the streets.

1493
01:49:23,056 --> 01:49:25,267
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1494
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:27,143
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

1495
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:42,617
I need men in those buildings.

1496
01:49:42,701 --> 01:49:44,577
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

1497
01:49:44,703 --> 01:49:47,289
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1498
01:49:57,716 --> 01:49:59,259
Well, we got its attention.

1499
01:49:59,759 --> 01:50:00,885
What the hell was step two?

1500
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:32,042
What's the story upstairs?

1501
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,085
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1502
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:36,129
Thor's right.
We got to deal with these guys.

1503
01:50:36,379 --> 01:50:38,423
-How do we do this?
-As a team.

1504
01:50:38,506 --> 01:50:40,300
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1505
01:50:40,383 --> 01:50:42,260
-Yeah? Well, get in line.
-Save it.

1506
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:44,304
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

1507
01:50:44,387 --> 01:50:45,347
and that's what we need.

1508
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:47,140
Without him,
these things could run wild.

1509
01:50:47,223 --> 01:50:49,434
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

1510
01:50:57,567 --> 01:51:00,737
So, this all seems horrible.

1511
01:51:01,696 --> 01:51:02,572
I've seen worse.

1512
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:04,366
Sorry.

1513
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:07,035
No, we could use a little worse.

1514
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:09,746
-Stark, we got him.
-Banner?

1515
01:51:09,871 --> 01:51:10,830
Just like you said.

1516
01:51:10,997 --> 01:51:14,000
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

1517
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:22,258
I don't see how that's a party.

1518
01:51:30,183 --> 01:51:31,142
Dr. Banner.

1519
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:34,771
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1520
01:51:35,814 --> 01:51:37,440
That's my secret, Captain.

1521
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:41,069
I'm always angry.

1522
01:51:52,705 --> 01:51:53,665
Hold on!

1523
01:52:24,446 --> 01:52:25,697
Send the rest.

1524
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:33,788
Guys.

1525
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,081
Call it, Captain.

1526
01:52:35,331 --> 01:52:36,291
All right, listen up.

1527
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:39,043
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1528
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:40,837
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1529
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,922
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1530
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:44,382
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1531
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:47,218
Anything gets over three blocks out,
turn it back or turn it to ash.

1532
01:52:47,302 --> 01:52:48,595
-Can you give me a lift?
-Right.

1533
01:52:48,678 --> 01:52:49,804
Better clench up, Legolas.

1534
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:55,852
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

1535
01:52:56,227 --> 01:52:57,187
Slow 'em down.

1536
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:59,230
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1537
01:53:01,816 --> 01:53:03,318
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1538
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:04,486
We keep the fighting here.

1539
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:05,487
And Hulk...

1540
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:09,240
Smash.

1541
01:54:03,127 --> 01:54:03,962
Sir.

1542
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:06,256
The Council is on.

1543
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:13,972
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

1544
01:54:15,807 --> 01:54:18,059
I'm just trying to keep them
off the streets.

1545
01:54:18,268 --> 01:54:19,727
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1546
01:54:20,645 --> 01:54:21,771
So find a tight corner.

1547
01:54:22,063 --> 01:54:23,273
I will roger that.

1548
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,297
Oh, boy.

1549
01:54:54,721 --> 01:54:55,805
Nice call.

1550
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:57,390
What else you got?

1551
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:59,559
Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.

1552
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,270
And he didn't invite me.

1553
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:44,145
Captain, none of this
is going to mean a damn thing

1554
01:55:44,312 --> 01:55:46,981
-if we don't close that portal.
-Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1555
01:55:47,065 --> 01:55:48,483
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1556
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:53,196
If you want to get up there,
you're gonna need a ride.

1557
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:55,448
I got a ride.

1558
01:55:56,658 --> 01:55:57,825
I could use a boost, though.

1559
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:01,079
Are you sure about this?

1560
01:56:01,663 --> 01:56:03,498
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1561
01:56:31,275 --> 01:56:32,819
Okay, turn, turn.

1562
01:56:33,069 --> 01:56:34,237
Less! Less!

1563
01:57:50,438 --> 01:57:51,314
This way!

1564
01:57:51,397 --> 01:57:52,774
Grand Central-
42 Street Station

1565
01:57:57,612 --> 01:58:00,198
Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.

1566
01:58:00,698 --> 01:58:02,492
They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.

1567
01:58:02,658 --> 01:58:03,618
I'm on it.

1568
01:58:24,555 --> 01:58:25,807
Everyone! Clear out!

1569
01:58:56,462 --> 01:58:57,505
Director Fury,

1570
01:58:58,089 --> 01:58:59,757
the Council has made a decision.

1571
01:58:59,841 --> 01:59:02,760
I recognize the Council
has made a decision.

1572
01:59:02,885 --> 01:59:04,804
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,

1573
01:59:04,887 --> 01:59:06,264
I have elected to ignore it.

1574
01:59:06,347 --> 01:59:09,767
Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.

1575
01:59:09,851 --> 01:59:10,935
You scramble that jet...

1576
01:59:11,018 --> 01:59:13,688
That is the island
of Manhattan, Councilman.

1577
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,815
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1578
01:59:15,898 --> 01:59:17,900
I will not order a nuclear strike

1579
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:19,485
against a civilian population.

1580
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:21,654
If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.

1581
01:59:21,946 --> 01:59:23,948
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1582
01:59:28,411 --> 01:59:29,704
Oh, you.

1583
01:59:32,582 --> 01:59:33,541
Hawkeye!

1584
01:59:35,001 --> 01:59:36,002
Nat, what are you doing?

1585
01:59:37,253 --> 01:59:38,087
A little help?

1586
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:44,260
I got him.

1587
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:11,746
Enough!

1588
02:00:12,246 --> 02:00:14,248
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1589
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:17,043
I am a god,
you dull creature.

1590
02:00:17,627 --> 02:00:19,378
And I will not be bullied by...

1591
02:00:28,971 --> 02:00:30,223
Puny God.

1592
02:00:39,106 --> 02:00:40,358
The scepter...

1593
02:00:41,275 --> 02:00:42,109
Doctor.

1594
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:46,697
Loki's scepter.
The energy.

1595
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:49,450
The Tesseract can't fight,

1596
02:00:49,533 --> 02:00:51,369
but you can't protect against yourself.

1597
02:00:51,535 --> 02:00:53,829
It's not your fault.
You didn't know what you were doing.

1598
02:00:57,541 --> 02:00:58,668
Actually, I think I did.

1599
02:00:59,335 --> 02:01:01,837
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1600
02:01:03,464 --> 02:01:04,715
Loki's scepter.

1601
02:01:05,007 --> 02:01:07,218
It may be able to close the portal.

1602
02:01:09,637 --> 02:01:11,389
And I'm looking right at it.

1603
02:01:23,859 --> 02:01:26,904
Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.

1604
02:01:34,328 --> 02:01:37,873
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1605
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:40,084
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

1606
02:02:49,695 --> 02:02:51,572
Director Fury is no longer in command.

1607
02:02:51,655 --> 02:02:53,699
Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.

1608
02:02:53,783 --> 02:02:56,369
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.

1609
02:02:57,411 --> 02:02:59,372
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1610
02:02:59,955 --> 02:03:02,041
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1611
02:03:02,124 --> 02:03:03,459
We need to shut it down!

1612
02:03:03,542 --> 02:03:05,628
Repeat, takeoff is not authorized.

1613
02:03:36,242 --> 02:03:37,785
Stark, do you hear me?

1614
02:03:38,619 --> 02:03:40,579
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1615
02:03:41,247 --> 02:03:42,164
How long?

1616
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:44,542
Three minutes, max.

1617
02:03:44,875 --> 02:03:46,502
The payload will wipe out Midtown.

1618
02:03:46,627 --> 02:03:48,587
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1619
02:03:48,671 --> 02:03:49,505
I just did.

1620
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:04,603
Package is sent.

1621
02:04:05,229 --> 02:04:07,940
Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

1622
02:04:31,046 --> 02:04:32,298
Are you ready for another bout?

1623
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:35,176
What, are you getting sleepy?

1624
02:04:40,389 --> 02:04:41,640
Right at the crown!

1625
02:04:48,272 --> 02:04:49,523
I can close it.

1626
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:51,233
Can anybody copy?

1627
02:04:52,276 --> 02:04:53,402
I can shut the portal down.

1628
02:04:53,986 --> 02:04:55,488
-Do it!
-No, wait.

1629
02:04:55,571 --> 02:04:56,906
These things are still coming.

1630
02:04:56,989 --> 02:04:57,990
I got a nuke coming in.

1631
02:04:58,073 --> 02:04:59,742
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1632
02:05:09,919 --> 02:05:11,545
And I know just where to put it.

1633
02:05:18,761 --> 02:05:21,222
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

1634
02:05:21,388 --> 02:05:22,848
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1635
02:05:22,932 --> 02:05:25,684
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1636
02:05:27,019 --> 02:05:27,853
Might as well.

1637
02:05:30,981 --> 02:05:33,400
The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.

1638
02:05:33,526 --> 02:05:36,237
The Army is here trying
to contain the violence

1639
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:38,197
but clearly,
it is outmatched.

1640
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:40,616
And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,

1641
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:42,576
I have never seen anything like this.

1642
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:44,787
We have limited information on the team

1643
02:05:45,371 --> 02:05:48,582
but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

1644
02:06:25,202 --> 02:06:26,161
CALL FAILED

1645
02:07:02,364 --> 02:07:03,532
Come on, Stark.

1646
02:07:10,581 --> 02:07:11,624
Close it.

1647
02:07:31,644 --> 02:07:32,645
Son of a gun.

1648
02:07:37,566 --> 02:07:38,776
He's not slowing down.

1649
02:07:57,336 --> 02:07:58,504
Is he breathing?

1650
02:08:26,573 --> 02:08:27,700
What the hell?

1651
02:08:30,744 --> 02:08:31,662
What just happened?

1652
02:08:33,205 --> 02:08:34,498
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1653
02:08:39,545 --> 02:08:40,504
We won.

1654
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:44,967
All right, yay!

1655
02:08:45,092 --> 02:08:46,468
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1656
02:08:47,094 --> 02:08:50,139
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1657
02:08:51,306 --> 02:08:52,599
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1658
02:08:53,267 --> 02:08:55,310
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1659
02:08:55,394 --> 02:08:57,229
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1660
02:08:57,855 --> 02:08:59,022
We're not finished yet.

1661
02:09:04,153 --> 02:09:05,487
And then shawarma after.

1662
02:09:27,801 --> 02:09:29,303
If it's all the same to you,

1663
02:09:33,307 --> 02:09:34,808
I'll have that drink now.

1664
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:45,277
Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed

1665
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:46,945
as an extraterrestrial attack,

1666
02:09:47,029 --> 02:09:48,530
the extraordinary heroics

1667
02:09:48,614 --> 02:09:51,575
of the group known as the Avengers
has been to many

1668
02:09:51,658 --> 02:09:53,911
a cause not only for comfort,
but for celebration.

1669
02:09:53,994 --> 02:09:55,954
It's just really great knowing
they're out there.

1670
02:09:56,038 --> 02:09:57,456
That someone is watching over us.

1671
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:59,249
I love you, Thor!

1672
02:09:59,374 --> 02:10:01,919
And then these guys were like...
And then the air goes...

1673
02:10:02,461 --> 02:10:04,213
And this green guy walks up and he goes...

1674
02:10:04,296 --> 02:10:05,172
I don't know.

1675
02:10:05,255 --> 02:10:07,633
I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.

1676
02:10:07,716 --> 02:10:10,260
It just seems that there's a lot
they're not telling us.

1677
02:10:11,011 --> 02:10:14,306
Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.

1678
02:10:14,515 --> 02:10:15,641
These so-called "heroes"...

1679
02:10:15,724 --> 02:10:16,558
THANK YOU AVENGERS

1680
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:18,018
...have to be held responsible

1681
02:10:18,101 --> 02:10:19,728
for the destruction done to this city.

1682
02:10:20,521 --> 02:10:22,689
This was their fight.
Where are they now?

1683
02:10:22,981 --> 02:10:25,651
Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.

1684
02:10:25,734 --> 02:10:28,237
Their sudden appearance
and equally sudden disappearance...

1685
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,447
What, this is all somehow their fault?

1686
02:10:32,908 --> 02:10:35,327
Captain America saved my life.

1687
02:10:38,413 --> 02:10:41,917
Wherever he is,
and wherever any of them are,

1688
02:10:42,042 --> 02:10:42,960
I would just...

1689
02:10:44,419 --> 02:10:45,838
I would want to say thank you.

1690
02:10:49,132 --> 02:10:50,509
Where are the Avengers?

1691
02:10:50,717 --> 02:10:52,719
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

1692
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:55,430
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

1693
02:10:55,514 --> 02:10:56,598
And the Tesseract?

1694
02:10:57,266 --> 02:10:59,142
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

1695
02:11:00,143 --> 02:11:01,603
Out of our reach.

1696
02:11:02,604 --> 02:11:03,730
That's not your call.

1697
02:11:04,106 --> 02:11:05,023
I didn't make it.

1698
02:11:05,315 --> 02:11:07,276
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1699
02:11:07,693 --> 02:11:09,278
So, you let him take it

1700
02:11:09,528 --> 02:11:11,154
and the war criminal, Loki,

1701
02:11:11,238 --> 02:11:12,906
who should be answering for his crime.

1702
02:11:12,990 --> 02:11:15,117
Oh, I think he will be.

1703
02:11:29,089 --> 02:11:31,633
I don't think you understand
what you've started,

1704
02:11:32,092 --> 02:11:33,969
letting the Avengers loose on this world.

1705
02:11:34,761 --> 02:11:35,804
They're dangerous.

1706
02:11:36,138 --> 02:11:39,433
They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.

1707
02:11:40,183 --> 02:11:42,394
Every world knows it.

1708
02:11:43,145 --> 02:11:44,980
Was that the point of all this?

1709
02:11:45,689 --> 02:11:46,899
A statement?

1710
02:11:49,860 --> 02:11:50,944
A promise.

1711
02:11:59,995 --> 02:12:01,538
Sir, how does it work now?

1712
02:12:02,831 --> 02:12:04,166
They've gone their separate ways.

1713
02:12:04,917 --> 02:12:07,169
Some, pretty extremely far.

1714
02:12:08,378 --> 02:12:10,672
If we get into a situation
like this again,

1715
02:12:10,756 --> 02:12:11,798
what happens then?

1716
02:12:12,132 --> 02:12:13,175
They'll come back.

1717
02:12:14,801 --> 02:12:16,053
Are you really sure about that?

1718
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:17,471
I am.

1719
02:12:18,847 --> 02:12:19,681
Why?

1720
02:12:21,391 --> 02:12:23,101
Because we'll need them to.

1721
02:13:03,725 --> 02:13:05,060
A

1722
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:17,734
Humans.

1723
02:15:18,944 --> 02:15:23,365
They are not the cowering wretches
we were promised.

1724
02:15:24,282 --> 02:15:26,284
They stand.

1725
02:15:27,619 --> 02:15:32,916
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

1726
02:15:40,799 --> 02:15:43,051
To challenge them

1727
02:15:43,802 --> 02:15:47,347
is to court death.
