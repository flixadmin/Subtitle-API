1
00:00:01,242 --> 00:00:03,439
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've reached our destination.

2
00:00:03,464 --> 00:00:05,442
Welcome to New York City.

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:08,067
Taxi!

4
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:16,796
Legends, we made it!

5
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:35,138
Legends, we made it!

6
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:36,706
Thanks, we heard you the first time.

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,941
And every other time.

8
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,643
I appreciated all your updates.

9
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:40,776
Thanks.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,679
Uh, Nate and Zari aren't coming?

11
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:45,448
What are they doing?
Did they say something?

12
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:47,216
Hoover-Bot's still stonewalling us,

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,221
so they're tinkering, trying
to figure out who sent him.

14
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:51,076
- Why are you so concerned?
- I'm not concerned.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,379
I'm just, you know, emotionally
invested in their love story.

16
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:56,892
I can't believe we're finally
in New York.

17
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,128
We're so close to getting
a time machine and going home.

18
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:00,929
Okay, first, we got to find
Dr. Gwyn Davies.

19
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:02,465
So let's get a city map, yeah?

20
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,667
Can we also please find
some pizza or something

21
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:05,701
that's not John's whiskey?

22
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:08,659
Ooh! I saw an ice-cream
stand near the park.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,312
Oh, I miss classic New York pizza.

24
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:18,447
It's all squash blossoms
and cauliflower crust

25
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:19,815
- in 2044.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:21,250
Why couldn't John's manor dimension

27
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:24,052
have had unlimited Pizza Shack?

28
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:27,755
Manor dimension? 2044?

29
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:29,391
Pizza Shack?

30
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:31,359
Where... where are you kids from?

31
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,162
Oh, um, we're just tourists from...

32
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,564
Uh, Canada, eh?

33
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:39,234
Sorry, how much do we owe you?

34
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:43,471
You're not Canadians.
Canadians are good people.

35
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,640
You're outlaws.

36
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,764
And I'm gonna stop you.

37
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:01,956
Come here, come here.

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,525
Careful, careful.

39
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:05,681
Okay.

40
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:09,162
Okay, I'm fine. I got the map.

41
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:10,950
Let's just get to the manor.

42
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:21,975
Whatever you're doing
back there, you can't hurt me.

43
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:25,067
- I'm impervious to pain.
- Oh, I believe it.

44
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:29,282
Wow, You mastered
that Hoover tech real quick.

45
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:31,418
Yeah, well, the code is
the same as the Waverider's.

46
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,487
In fact, you see this blue chip?

47
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:35,723
We have chips like this
all over the Waverider.

48
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:38,091
So, we can confirm that the Waverider

49
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:41,261
who shot our Waverider
is making the Hoover-Bots.

50
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,163
But the question is still who and why.

51
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:44,832
Yeah. Well, if this computer

52
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:46,999
I stole from John's attic
wasn't so retro,

53
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:48,501
I would have the answer to that.

54
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:50,236
I was sent by the
United States Government

55
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,071
- to uphold the law.
- Hmm.

56
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:53,773
He still thinks he's the real Hoover?

57
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:56,743
Yeah, I even put up a mirror
to show him his tech.

58
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,944
He accused me of subversion.

59
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:02,348
- You deserve a break.
- Doughnuts?

60
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:04,083
Where'd you get doughnuts?

61
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:05,752
John's attic. Kidding.

62
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,019
Gary stole them off the train.

63
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:09,642
Ah, genius!

64
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:12,792
- Oh, my God, Sara!
- I'm fine.

65
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:14,794
We got too casual,
forgot the Bullet Blondes

66
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:15,928
are still front-page news.

67
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:17,129
Not gonna happen again.

68
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,197
Yes, you might be fine,

69
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,532
but I'm finding it very hard

70
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:20,867
to erase the image of my wife

71
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,635
being shot by a trigger-happy local.

72
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:24,336
Sounds more like a patriot to me.

73
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,538
Can we mute him?

74
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,539
I can't deal with his
negative energy right now.

75
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,593
Yeah, gladly.

76
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:33,512
Sounds like an American hero.
Sounds like some...

77
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,380
Okay, so...

78
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:37,582
Have you
and Zari talked next steps?

79
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:39,150
No.
I don't know what to say.

80
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:40,585
And I don't want to ruin the vibe.

81
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,154
You're ruining the vibe
by not saying anything.

82
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,757
This is last time
I sneak you train doughnuts.

83
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:45,693
The hell you will.
You're my doughnut dealer.

84
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,328
Hey.

85
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,995
What are you two whispering about?

86
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,732
The mission.

87
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:52,101
The Bullet Blondes
are still front-page news,

88
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,570
and we got to find this
Dr. Davies as fast as we can.

89
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,605
He's right.

90
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:59,037
And we located Edison Labs,
which is where Davies worked

91
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,039
when he came up with
the foundation for time travel.

92
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:02,407
Great. Just get us his research,

93
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:03,742
and we'll use our future knowledge

94
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:04,843
to build what he's come up with.

95
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:07,078
Then we can time travel out of 1925.

96
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:08,314
Wonderful.

97
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:11,050
While you regain your strength,
I'll go get Davies' research.

98
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:13,384
Actually, I'm going. You're staying.

99
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:15,653
What? No way. You just got shot.

100
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:17,255
Babe, our faces are literally

101
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,323
on the front of every single newspaper.

102
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:22,159
If someone recognizes us again
and decides to take a shot,

103
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:24,195
I'm the only one who's gonna
be able to survive that.

104
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,797
Fine. But no footprints.

105
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:28,632
Davies is the father of time travel.

106
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,801
If you mess up his timeline,
no amount of IOUs

107
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:31,970
in the world can fix it.

108
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:34,072
You got it.

109
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:36,975
Which one's Davies?

110
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:37,980
No clue.

111
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:40,530
Time Bureau Manual didn't have
a picture of him.

112
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,483
But if I had to guess, I'd say that guy.

113
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:46,551
Looks familiar.

114
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:50,088
Kind of like Mick but with hair?

115
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:52,090
I was thinking more of a young Stein.

116
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:54,558
But regardless, he's clutching
his briefcase to his chest

117
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:56,160
like it has something important in it.

118
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:58,062
- Basis of time travel?
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:04:58,086 --> 00:04:59,949
Wait here.

120
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:02,600
Um, excuse me, Dr. Gwyn Davies?

121
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:05,035
That's Dr. Gwyn Davis.
What is it you want?

122
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:08,071
I am a huge fan of your work,
and I would just love

123
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:09,540
to pick your brain over a cup of...

124
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:11,635
Yes, yes, yes, I'm not here
to socialize, young lady.

125
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,572
I'm here to make some
very important discoveries

126
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:14,639
for Mr. Edison.

127
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:16,441
- Now excuse me. Thank you.
- Of course.

128
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:19,977
Ooh! Oh, I am so sorry.

129
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:22,880
Oh, by the way, was that
an accent that I detected?

130
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:24,683
- Good day to you.
- Oh, um...

131
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:26,272
keep up the good work.

132
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:33,063
Did you get it?

133
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,151
Couldn't have been easier.

134
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:49,902
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

135
00:05:56,376 --> 00:05:58,054
We've been trying to hitchhike for days,

136
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:00,089
and literally nobody has stopped.

137
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:01,724
We must get to Dr. Gwyn Davies

138
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:04,326
by 7:00 p.m. tomorrow,
or the Legends will die.

139
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,499
At our current pace,
we'll get to him in two weeks.

140
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:09,218
- _
- Sí.

141
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,658
Spooner.

142
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,048
_

143
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:29,918
Why can't you just bring us
some good luck, man?

144
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:31,653
Who are you conversing with?

145
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:33,155
Is there someone up there?

146
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:35,757
Hello! I'm Gideon.

147
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,126
Fine. I didn't want to do this.

148
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,649
But you leave me no choice.

149
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,338
I just performed a luck spell.

150
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:52,207
Now this rock will bring us good luck.

151
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,441
No way! You can do that?

152
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:55,043
Obviously. I'm a witch.

153
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,345
Isn't luck just an interpretation

154
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:57,880
of random occurrences?

155
00:06:57,904 --> 00:06:59,215
How can a spell generate that?

156
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,749
How can a spell generate anything?

157
00:07:00,773 --> 00:07:04,342
All I know is it works. Spooner.

158
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:14,095
It works!

159
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,097
These blueprints are incredible.

160
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:18,299
It's like Da Vinci's helicopter sketch.

161
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:20,668
Okay, how long to build the time ship?

162
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,670
Davies' instructions
are really thorough.

163
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:25,340
I'd say four... no, five.

164
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:27,542
Weeks? Months?

165
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:30,577
- Uh, years.
- Five years?

166
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:32,847
You're asking us to build a time machine

167
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,982
from scratch in 1925.

168
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,951
We're never gonna get back to 2021.

169
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:39,253
Look, it's not impossible.

170
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:41,155
It's just gonna take a little while.

171
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,824
Well, you're right.

172
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,192
And at least we have
an unlimited supply of booze

173
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,494
'cause I need to get liquored up.

174
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:49,296
I totally support that
after you ninja Davies' files

175
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,397
back into his apartment.

176
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,999
You want me to do this now?

177
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:53,634
Yes. Small footprints, babe.

178
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:55,770
We can't risk altering
time travel history.

179
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:58,539
It could jeopardize
our entire existence.

180
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,307
Okay. Fine.

181
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,309
And then I'm getting liquored up.

182
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,233
Bye.

183
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:33,673
Now go about your life,

184
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,364
and we'll build
your time machine for you.

185
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,012
Or you'll build it for us.

186
00:08:57,228 --> 00:09:00,073
You guys, his time machine
is literally sitting there

187
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:02,209
just begging to be used.

188
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:04,478
Hold on. We can't use it yet.

189
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,347
According to Davies' notes,
we're still missing one part.

190
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:09,116
Who's game for a scavenger hunt?

191
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,018
Oh, I love scavenger hunts,

192
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,753
because I love giving myself
to all things...

193
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:16,778
games, people.

194
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:20,493
Did you and Gary hook up?
I won't be mad.

195
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,417
I will be confused.

196
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,098
Just checking.

197
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:28,034
Davies' notes also say
he got all his parts

198
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,268
from Edison Labs.

199
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:30,737
I bet that's where we find
the missing one.

200
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:33,070
Scavenger hunt just got way easier.

201
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:35,789
Wait, wait. I am also
dying to get to 2021,

202
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:37,023
but no footprints, remember?

203
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:39,073
Babe, I respect
your "no footprints" plan.

204
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,208
And, yes, we could wait five years

205
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,744
for the Tarazis to build a time machine

206
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:44,612
that may or may not work... no offense.

207
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:45,980
- None taken.
- Slightly offended.

208
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:48,983
Or we could leave a tiny footprint

209
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,718
and get out of here way earlier.

210
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:52,386
It's not gonna be tiny.
Can you slow down?

211
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,821
We're just trying to get
all the information.

212
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,489
For instance, this is very interesting.

213
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,025
The Manual says that Davies
laid the foundation

214
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:59,030
for time travel.

215
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,398
If he built a time machine,

216
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:02,629
why doesn't it say that
he invented time travel?

217
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:04,798
All right, maybe
he time-traveled somewhere,

218
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:06,467
couldn't recharge, and got stuck there.

219
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:07,601
Oh, that makes sense.

220
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,606
That's why he never got credit,

221
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,141
because no one ever knew he succeeded.

222
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:12,739
But if we time-travel to the
future, we can recharge it.

223
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:15,509
Plus, we'll pick up some time
couriers, and we'll get back,

224
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,712
and we'll return the machine,
and he'll be none the wiser.

225
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:22,583
Babe, we would have time travel again.

226
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:24,685
And I know it's a footprint,
but it's a tiny footprint.

227
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,554
It's like a baby footprint.

228
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:28,677
And everyone loves baby footprints.

229
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,595
The clutch is slipping.

230
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:36,162
I have no idea what that means.

231
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:37,898
But I assume it's bad. Can you fix it?

232
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:39,633
No, there's no time,
and we won't be able

233
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:40,638
to get out of first gear.

234
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:43,107
So, like, the max we can go
is, like, 20 miles per hour.

235
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:45,205
How fast do we need to drive
to get to New York?

236
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,741
Well, to prevent the Legends
from blowing up

237
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,976
in Davies' time machine
due to electrical overload,

238
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,544
we should maintain a conservative pace

239
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,379
of no less than 55 miles per hour.

240
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,037
Maybe we can, I don't know,
find a mechanic.

241
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:57,918
There's no need.

242
00:10:57,942 --> 00:10:59,586
We got our lucky rock. Remember?

243
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,855
I'm still not convinced
there's any such thing as luck,

244
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,324
only the ability to cope
with the statistical universe.

245
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:07,449
Ah, you'll see. Watch.

246
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:13,788
Come on, rock, bring us some more luck.

247
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,583
Good afternoon, ladies.

248
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,285
Name's Erwin George Baker,

249
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,120
but you can call me Cannon Ball.

250
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:35,488
Cannon Ball?

251
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,824
As in the cross-country race-car driver?

252
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:39,091
You've heard of me?

253
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,479
I'm a big NASCAR... I mean racing fan.

254
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,697
Well, y'all wouldn't happen
to know the fastest route

255
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,199
through Cleveland, now, would you?

256
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,169
I'm actually in the middle of
trying to break my own record

257
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,438
driving from L.A. to New York.

258
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:54,507
And, well, I think I made a wrong turn.

259
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:56,331
New York, did you say?

260
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,144
We're actually on our way there, too.

261
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:00,445
Well, the fastest route to New York

262
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,814
is south on Highway 15
till it merges with Highway 40,

263
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:06,003
then cut through Columbus,
not Cleveland, on the 90.

264
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,955
You sure know your directions, miss.

265
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,824
I'll tell you what...

266
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:15,060
if y'all help me get to the highway,

267
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:18,764
I'll let you race with me
all the way to New York.

268
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,899
- Shotgun.
- All right!

269
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,701
Let's go.

270
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:25,236
Oh, I love scavenger hunts.

271
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,138
Are we playing teams or head-to-head?

272
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,307
Neither. You're on your own
finding that part.

273
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,542
Well, what are you gonna do?

274
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,510
Make sure that the doc
stays here all night.

275
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:33,845
We can't have him walking in

276
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:35,546
on us building his time machine, right?

277
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,400
How you gonna keep him here?

278
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:49,660
I told you,

279
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:52,096
I am not here to socialize, young lady.

280
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,964
Thank you.

281
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:55,666
I beg your pardon.

282
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,734
What do you think you are doing?

283
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:57,835
You see, this is my desk.

284
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,604
It is not a rubbish tip.

285
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,572
Oh, you didn't hear?

286
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:02,907
They want your opinion

287
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:06,777
on which of these projects
is best by tomorrow?

288
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:09,480
Yes. Who wants it?

289
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,115
Not Edison.

290
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:12,650
Oh, this...

291
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,740
came straight from Edison himself.

292
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,122
Oh, and these.

293
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:19,842
Tomorrow.

294
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,719
What do we have here?

295
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:37,629
I truly am the world's
greatest scavenger hunter.

296
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:42,945
- I should be out there.
- Sara's gonna be fine.

297
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,047
She's a half-alien ninja

298
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:45,649
in a building full of scientists.

299
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:47,317
An illegal alien?

300
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:49,118
You degenerates are
worse than I thought.

301
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:50,487
Would you just shut up?

302
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:51,788
You're not even the real Hoover.

303
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:52,822
You are a robot.

304
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:54,191
If you would just tell us who sent you

305
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,194
and who blew up our Waverider,
we could be rid of you.

306
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:57,560
You can't get rid of me.

307
00:13:57,584 --> 00:13:59,615
I'll hunt you until my dying breath.

308
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,666
I still don't know who sent him
or who blew up the Waverider.

309
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,968
But I did find a to-do list
in his programming.

310
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:09,938
- Tax convention at 3:00 p.m.?
- I'm missing that?

311
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:12,041
You'll pay for this.

312
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:16,334
Uh, there's an item that
supersedes everything else.

313
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:19,735
_

314
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:26,054
Wait, so, if he's here to kill us

315
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:27,956
but he's also here
to replace the old Hoover

316
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,493
and do everything
that the old Hoover did,

317
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:31,794
does that mean that the person
that wants us dead

318
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:33,362
is trying to protect the timeline?

319
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,263
Why would someone
who's trying to protect

320
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,797
the timeline want us dead?

321
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:39,066
Protecting the timeline
is literally our job.

322
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,469
I don't know,
but any noticeable footprints,

323
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:42,903
and they'll know that it's us

324
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:45,362
and they'll come back to finish the job.

325
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,886
- Have you seen Dr. Parker?
- Um, no?

326
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,056
You must be new. I'm Mr. Edison.

327
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,592
Edison? T-Thomas Edison?

328
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:01,856
- What's your name?
- Gary Green.

329
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,826
Dr. Gary Green.

330
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,128
Well, Dr. Green, at Edison Labs,

331
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:11,785
we log out parts from
the Parts Department.

332
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,036
Let me show you.

333
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,938
- Who's your supervisor?
- Uh, Dr. Gwyn Davies.

334
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,639
- Davies?
- Mm-hmm.

335
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:20,841
What project is this for?

336
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:23,933
Oh, his time-travel project, of course.

337
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:29,649
Have security meet me at Davies' office.

338
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:31,774
Yes, sir. Right away.

339
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,994
What Edison's asking me to do,

340
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:41,662
it will keep me here all night.

341
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:45,399
I suggest you get started, then.

342
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:46,933
Out of the night that covers me,

343
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:49,668
black as the pit from pole to pole...

344
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:52,025
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

345
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,675
Hey. Are you all right?

346
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,945
Yeah, please. Just don't touch me.

347
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:01,314
Confiscate everything.

348
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:03,216
No, no, no. No, not my work.

349
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,372
No, you...

350
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:10,123
I've told you,

351
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:13,659
this time travel is a fool's errand.

352
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,929
But you've been drafting
blueprints at work

353
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:17,663
and stealing company parts.

354
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,632
Just let me complete it,
Mr. Edison, please.

355
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:23,835
- I beg of you.
- You're terminated, Davies.

356
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,103
These men will escort you
off the premises.

357
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:28,606
And I am personally burning this.

358
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,141
You couldn't possibly understand!

359
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,578
Time travel is my divine mission.

360
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:35,246
You can't take that away from me!

361
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,567
Take him to Bellevue.

362
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:39,884
It's apparent he's lost his damn mind.

363
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,285
I'm perfectly sane.

364
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,954
You get your hands off me, you brutes!

365
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:45,745
Get your hands off me!

366
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:04,007
Put your hand down.

367
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,811
We received calls from
the last ten towns over

368
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:10,581
about a speed demon headed this way.

369
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,217
License and registration.

370
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,953
Now, Officer, allow me
to introduce myself.

371
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:16,654
Name is Erwin George...

372
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:19,757
I don't care if you're
the pope of Pennsylvania.

373
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:22,115
License and registration.

374
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,263
We need to get back on the road.

375
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:27,487
We'll be fine. We got our lucky rock.

376
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:31,802
You all need to step out of the vehicle.

377
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:34,438
I'm taking you in
and impounding your car.

378
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:38,708
Uh, wait, wait. You are
making a huge mistake.

379
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:42,011
Erwin's cross-country races
are all over the newspapers.

380
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:45,948
In fact, he is in the process
of breaking the current record.

381
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:48,518
Article after article
is being written about it.

382
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:52,728
Now, you could arrest him
and be forever known as the cop

383
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,264
who arrested a legend,

384
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:57,133
or you could let us go

385
00:17:57,157 --> 00:18:00,970
and be hailed as the cop
who gave Cannon Ball

386
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:03,261
a police escort to the county line.

387
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:09,107
You'll mention my name in the paper?

388
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,976
Oh. Absolutely.

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,578
Then let's get youse
to that county line.

390
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:16,481
- Oh, yes!
- That lucky rock sure is something.

391
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:19,136
It is gonna help me beat my record.

392
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,996
You thinking about Gary again?

393
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,566
- Oddly enough, I am.
- Please say more.

394
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,701
Actually, Gary and I had

395
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,836
a surprisingly enlightening conversation

396
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,004
prior to your arrival.

397
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:42,774
That is surprising.
What did you talk about?

398
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,610
He made me realize that
I've been using your totem

399
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:48,132
as an excuse not to take the next step.

400
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,485
I see. We are having that talk.

401
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:58,714
All right, listen, no,
we don't have to have it.

402
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,991
We've had a really good few days,

403
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,327
and I don't want to ruin it.

404
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,930
No, we... we're always great together.

405
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:09,066
It's being apart that makes it hard.

406
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,723
I know.

407
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:16,640
I know a way for us to be together.

408
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:19,343
And it's... it's this place.

409
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,045
Like, here?

410
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:24,680
Like, John's...
John's pocket manor dimension?

411
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:26,115
Uh-huh. Our problem

412
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:27,984
is that you and other Zari can't coexist

413
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:30,519
without Behrad's head exploding, okay?

414
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:33,656
But in this dimension,
time and space doesn't exist.

415
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,559
We don't have to worry about that.

416
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,027
What do you think?

417
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,231
- I think it's a great idea.
- You seem stunned.

418
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:43,166
I am. Uh...

419
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,168
- We can finally live together.
- Right?

420
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:47,470
- It's a win.
- It's a win.

421
00:19:47,494 --> 00:19:49,806
Really, a fist bump?
It's bigger than a...

422
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,031
- Nah, I got jokes.
- You got jokes.

423
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:57,247
But on a serious note,
I got a surprise for you.

424
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:58,547
- Another one?
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:02,084
- Okay.
- I saved you a bear claw.

426
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:03,518
Who loves you?

427
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,840
You.

428
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,794
I'm trained to read people.

429
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:14,096
And that was a fine acting performance.

430
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,854
Shut up, Hoover. I wasn't acting.

431
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:20,235
There you go again.

432
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:23,157
You might get your lies
past him but not me.

433
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:35,717
Uh, what day is today?

434
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,952
It's November 7th. Why?

435
00:20:37,976 --> 00:20:40,388
He was planning to use it tonight.

436
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:42,023
No wonder he was so upset.

437
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,525
Okay, but this is fine,

438
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:46,361
because if we use the time
machine tonight instead,

439
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:48,896
then history will stay on track.

440
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,699
Co-captains...

441
00:20:50,723 --> 00:20:55,228
Necrian, I present the world's
very first time machine.

442
00:21:07,873 --> 00:21:10,385
Wait, Sara, that means...

443
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:12,619
No!

444
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:13,954
Where did she...

445
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:16,557
No, no, no, no!

446
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:19,660
Wait, they disappeared
when I put this in.

447
00:21:19,684 --> 00:21:22,829
So, if I take it out...

448
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,431
Why aren't they back?

449
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:25,934
Because we caused too many footprints.

450
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,187
God, this is all my fault.

451
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:31,104
- Okay, why are we still here?
- I don't know.

452
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:34,140
But look, if Ava and... if they're gone,

453
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:36,876
then that means that
the Time Bureau never existed.

454
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,211
That means that...

455
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:41,770
Which means that I never meet Ava.

456
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:44,751
We need to fix this.

457
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:46,252
We need to cover all of our footsteps

458
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:47,420
and make sure that history

459
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:49,155
happens exactly how it's supposed to.

460
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:51,424
Stay here and uninstall that last part.

461
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:53,158
We're not gonna use the time machine?

462
00:21:53,182 --> 00:21:55,395
No, we will, but we need
Davies to install it

463
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:58,398
and take his maiden voyage
like history intended.

464
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:00,800
Wait, you're gonna break him
out of a mental institution?

465
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:01,834
Yeah, I guess so.

466
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:04,303
Oh, wait. Edison took all of his files.

467
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:05,605
It's all good. We made a copy.

468
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:06,773
No, no, no. It's not all good.

469
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:08,775
It was the originals that were
passed down from history,

470
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,375
and it's the originals that inspired

471
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:11,676
the invention of time travel.

472
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,211
We have to get those back from Edison.

473
00:22:13,235 --> 00:22:15,346
Okay, it's a lot to do,
but it's not impossible.

474
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,715
We have until 7:00 p.m.

475
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:18,517
That's a little more impossible.

476
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:22,087
Then it's time
for all hands on deck...

477
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:25,178
human and robot.

478
00:22:26,982 --> 00:22:28,993
Hey, you guys muted him.

479
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:31,162
Can you get him to do or say things?

480
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:32,597
I mean, he has a to-do list.

481
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:34,399
In theory, I could replace what's on it.

482
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:37,168
Replace it. We need him to
get Davies' plans from Edison.

483
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:39,604
And Edison's gonna be
more likely to give the plans

484
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:42,441
- to Hoover than he would to us.
- Okay.

485
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:44,475
Bye-bye, eliminate legends.

486
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:46,176
Bye-bye, tax Convention.

487
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,046
Don't you dare. I will ruin your...

488
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,315
You know, I don't know
why I keep unmuting you.

489
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,317
All right, I'm gonna grab some clothes

490
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:54,852
so we can accompany Hoover.

491
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:56,954
It's shocking how much stuff
John has in that attic.

492
00:22:56,978 --> 00:22:58,756
Hey.

493
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,080
You think he has a lab coat?

494
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:17,040
Oh, I'm fine...

495
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,375
No, no, no, no, no, no.

496
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:19,709
What the devil are you doing in here?

497
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:20,744
Getting you out of here.

498
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,479
The fangirl stuff was just an act.

499
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,781
I'm actually a time traveler.

500
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,216
"Time traveler"?

501
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,151
Is this some kind of sick joke?

502
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:29,452
Edison put you up to it, didn't he?

503
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,655
- The blasphemer!
- This isn't a joke, all right?

504
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,123
I'm from 2021.

505
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:35,025
And I know that you invented time travel

506
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,627
and your maiden voyage
is tonight at 7:00.

507
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,463
So I'm gonna get you back
to your apartment

508
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,398
so you can use
your time machine... let's go.

509
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:43,233
Do you honestly expect me to believe

510
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,767
a word that's coming out of your mouth?

511
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,037
You lied to me!
This is all just more lies!

512
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:48,871
Shh! Come on.
You'll see when you get there.

513
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,507
I'm not going anywhere with you.

514
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:51,974
No. Listen, you don't understand.

515
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,310
I don't think you understand.

516
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:56,579
I built my time machine
for a sacred purpose.

517
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:59,414
And I'll be damned if I'm
letting a two-bit liar use it.

518
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,817
We do not have time for this, all right?

519
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,719
If you don't come with me,
then history is...

520
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:05,254
What are you not getting?

521
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,258
You see, I am not going
anywhere with you.

522
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,260
As a matter of fact... Guard!

523
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,195
Help! Intruder!

524
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,650
- Help!
- Hey.

525
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,490
Be quiet.

526
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:25,142
Okay.

527
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:29,246
Now, I will let you go
if you stop screaming.

528
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,748
Do you understand?

529
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:34,306
I promise.

530
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:37,888
Okay. All right, hey, hey.

531
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:39,656
It's all right. Hey, look...

532
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,226
Calm down, you're having
a panic attack, okay?

533
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,094
You just need to focus
on your breathing.

534
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:46,586
Okay, okay.

535
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,203
Okay, look.

536
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:56,372
Hey, hey. I'm sorry, okay?

537
00:24:56,396 --> 00:25:00,310
I've been treating you like
a pawn instead of a person,

538
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,778
and it's not fair.

539
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:04,981
You... you are a really
big deal, all right?

540
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,717
Hey, you invented freakin' time travel,

541
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:10,954
and it's because of you that
so many things become possible,

542
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:13,511
including me meeting my wife.

543
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,926
You married a woman?

544
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,895
Yeah.

545
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:21,197
Still getting used to saying that.

546
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:22,818
We just got married.

547
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:28,103
Look, I messed up, and...

548
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,439
and she disappeared from the timeline.

549
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:32,708
And so now I have a sacred
purpose, too...

550
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,143
to bring her back.

551
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:36,445
And the only way that that could happen

552
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,381
is if you come with me,

553
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:41,910
or otherwise she could be gone forever.

554
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,153
So, please,
believe me when I say

555
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,211
that I am done lying to you.

556
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,462
I can understand doing anything

557
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:56,031
to save the person you love.

558
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,824
It's actually why I was trying
to invent time travel.

559
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:06,074
So let's do it. What do you say?

560
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,832
Help me save my person?

561
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,249
If I help you save your person,

562
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,118
you'll help me save mine?

563
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:19,054
Uh, you're only gonna come
with me if I say yes, right?

564
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,508
Uh-huh. We have a deal, then.

565
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,494
Let's get the hell out of here.

566
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,486
- Yes, indeed.
- I'm gonna wash my hands.

567
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,001
I don't know, Zari.

568
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,937
He's still giving me "Terminator" vibes.

569
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,906
Listen, I hear that,
but he's on our side now.

570
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,242
I reprogrammed him

571
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,132
to get Edison's plans,
among other tweaks.

572
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:46,981
Yikes.

573
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,017
Is there any way
to make that less toothy?

574
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,207
Watch this.

575
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,314
- After you.
- Aw!

576
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:06,833
I don't understand why you
would be interested

577
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:10,271
in Dr. Davies' plans, Mr. Hoover.

578
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,407
Believe me, they're just
the ravings of a madman.

579
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,409
I was just about to destroy them.

580
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,944
Thank you very much, Mr. Edison.

581
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,036
I'm sure you're probably right.

582
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:24,478
Yeah.

583
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:28,988
I'm just a little confused, Mr. Hoover.

584
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:32,593
Why would someone of your stature...

585
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,295
bother to come here?

586
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,663
Unless you have something more important

587
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,266
on your agenda nearby?

588
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,356
I came here for a...

589
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,871
Sir, sir.

590
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:48,609
T-t-t-t-tax convention at 3:00 p.m.

591
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,811
Mr. Hoover, are you okay?

592
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,779
Yeah. Sir, he's... he's fine.

593
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:55,415
You know, he suffers
from low blood sugar.

594
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,018
I'm here for a tax convention.

595
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,585
I'm here to retrieve the plans.

596
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:00,721
I'm here to r-r-r-retrieve the plans.

597
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,056
I'm here for a tax convention.
I'm here for a tax convention.

598
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,444
I'm here to retrieve the plans.

599
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:22,909
I can explain everything, Mr. Edison.

600
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:25,564
Great Scott!

601
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:30,483
Mr. Edison! Oh, my God.

602
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:32,585
He's dead.

603
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:34,487
Oh, my God.

604
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:36,408
It's imperative that we find him.

605
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:40,545
There.

606
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:46,365
Come on.

607
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:50,269
I am a scientist, not an athlete.

608
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:53,506
We need to take as much
Hoover-Bot tech as we can.

609
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,042
We can still use it to try to
figure out who sent him here.

610
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:59,311
Why do you think
the Hoover-Bot short-circuited?

611
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:01,080
I don't know-he was being pulled

612
00:29:01,104 --> 00:29:05,109
in two different directions
that he couldn't reconcile...

613
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:08,174
Like our relationship.

614
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:11,591
Nate, I-I know

615
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:15,595
I'm... I'm not super great
at expressing my feelings,

616
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,162
but I...

617
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:19,465
I have to tell you something.

618
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:21,633
You're getting cold feet
about living together?

619
00:29:21,657 --> 00:29:23,568
No, what? No, no, no.

620
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:26,938
No, dude, that's...
that's literally all I want.

621
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:29,674
But in the totem,

622
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:31,343
not the manor.

623
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:35,214
No one is more surprised
about this than me.

624
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:37,816
I found a real community there.

625
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,114
I feel like I'm part of a family.

626
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:46,024
Somehow over the last
two years, it feels like home.

627
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:47,992
Okay, um...

628
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:51,330
Can I get
a little bit of time to digest

629
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:53,398
what it would be like
living out of a totem?

630
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:54,733
Yeah. Completely.

631
00:29:54,757 --> 00:29:57,801
This... this reality we're
navigating, it's insane.

632
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:59,270
- It's insane.
- Yeah.

633
00:29:59,294 --> 00:30:02,062
Just take... take as much
time as you need.

634
00:30:04,198 --> 00:30:07,211
And while there's no rush
on your decision,

635
00:30:07,235 --> 00:30:08,679
we should probably get out of here.

636
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:10,014
- Yeah.
- Right.

637
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:12,869
Okay.

638
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:18,078
Too late.

639
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:22,459
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We're trapped. We're trapped.

640
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:24,361
Okay, you're supposed
to be a genius, right?

641
00:30:24,385 --> 00:30:25,563
You can think of a way out of here.

642
00:30:25,587 --> 00:30:28,666
A genius, genius?
They think I'm a lunatic.

643
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,067
They think I'm a lunatic.

644
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:33,103
He went this way!

645
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:34,471
Aah! Oh, my God.

646
00:30:34,495 --> 00:30:36,739
Get back! I'm as mad as a hatter.

647
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:38,575
I will cut her. Back, get back.

648
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,645
- Listen to him, he's crazy.
- I swear with all my might.

649
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:42,979
Get back. Get back.

650
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:44,914
- He's going to...
- Get back.

651
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:47,517
- I'll do it. I will. I will.
- He's gonna do it.

652
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:49,219
Stay, stay, stay.

653
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:51,176
- He's gonna do it!
- Stay!

654
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,466
We must clean up my body.

655
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,121
First, we must remove my human body.

656
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:18,970
I've got to answer the call of nature.

657
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:30,749
Hey, nice car, mister.

658
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:37,198
You know, we might make it
in time to get to the city

659
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:38,900
with time for a bite to eat.

660
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:42,270
Ah, thanks to our lucky rock.

661
00:31:42,294 --> 00:31:44,859
Oh, I must have left it inside the car.

662
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,577
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

663
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:52,648
- Gideon!
- No! No!

664
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:55,005
No!

665
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:59,521
Godspeed, ladies!

666
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:01,574
Still got time to beat my record.

667
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:05,693
Great, we lost our ride,

668
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:09,285
our lucky rock, and now Gideon.

669
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,434
Unless you can swim faster
than a blue marlin,

670
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:17,626
we're gonna lose the rest
of our friends, too.

671
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:24,292
Ooh, there are a lot more

672
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,562
of you than I thought there would be.

673
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:28,198
This is only half the crew.
Wait till you meet the rest.

674
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:29,666
Hey, everybody.

675
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,403
I'd like to introduce you
to Dr. Gwyn Davis.

676
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:35,372
Nice to meet your acquaintance.

677
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:38,861
- Ah, there she is.
- Ah, yes.

678
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:43,652
My divine mission is finally
coming to "fruititions".

679
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:45,187
Hey, man. I'm Behrad.

680
00:32:45,211 --> 00:32:48,056
Oh, sorry. I just feel like I know you.

681
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,151
I mean, I've been studying
your life's work

682
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,821
and chilling in your apartment
and using your glassware.

683
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:56,157
I borrowed a glass, by the way.
Hope that's cool.

684
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:58,794
Uh, hey, is that...

685
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:00,729
Oh, yeah.

686
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:03,031
Also, uh, Edison's dead.

687
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:04,066
What?

688
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,496
So there's another Hoover-Bot
and now an Edison-Bot deployed.

689
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,765
But headline... there's a rogue
Waverider after us.

690
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,287
But we did get the plans.

691
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:15,843
Oh, my files. Thank you so much.

692
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:18,713
You know, you really do look familiar.

693
00:33:18,737 --> 00:33:21,816
Oh, maybe I just have
one of those faces.

694
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,384
Ray. He looks like Ray.

695
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:24,852
- My Ray?
- I said a young Stein.

696
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:27,088
But whatever, we got the plans,
we got the doc.

697
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:28,645
B!

698
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:31,292
You got to assemble the last part

699
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:32,960
to get the timeline back on track.

700
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:34,429
Ah, yes.

701
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:37,687
The final piece of the puzzle.

702
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,204
You ready?

703
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:45,359
Oh, come on, come on.

704
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:55,382
- Ava. Oh!
- Wha...

705
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:56,884
what happened?

706
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:59,220
Did I disappear?

707
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:01,755
- It worked!
- I am so sorry.

708
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:04,225
I never should have rushed.
I should have listened to you.

709
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:05,960
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

710
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:08,614
What matters is that
we're back together again.

711
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,098
No, no. No.

712
00:34:11,122 --> 00:34:12,632
Is this not a group-hug situation?

713
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:14,068
Right, well, uh,

714
00:34:14,092 --> 00:34:17,404
it'll be a bit of a squeeze,
but I'm sure we all can fit.

715
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:20,741
Oh, all right. What do you say, guys?

716
00:34:20,765 --> 00:34:22,330
Ready to go home?

717
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:27,647
Here, do another luck spell.
Maybe we can still make it.

718
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,516
I can't.

719
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,618
The spell was fake.

720
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:32,819
Come again.

721
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:34,955
There is no luck spell. I made it up.

722
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:36,890
I pretended to do it
to make you feel better

723
00:34:36,914 --> 00:34:38,091
and give you back some hope.

724
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,559
You were at a pretty low point.

725
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,694
Okay, well, then how do you explain

726
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:44,063
- where all the luck came from?
- It came from us.

727
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:45,599
Hey, no. Think about it.

728
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:48,167
You felt better after
I did the spell, right?

729
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:50,203
Gideon convinced Erwin
to give us a ride.

730
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:52,372
I sweet-talked the cop
into letting us go.

731
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:55,542
We made our own luck,
and we can keep making it.

732
00:34:55,566 --> 00:34:57,010
But we have to do it fast

733
00:34:57,034 --> 00:35:01,080
because we only have
five minutes to stop them.

734
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:04,017
Or do we stop everything?

735
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,807
Let's go.

736
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:21,267
Oh, hello.

737
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:24,203
- Who the heck are you?
- I'm Gideon.

738
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:26,439
Well, Gideon, you got
till the count of three

739
00:35:26,463 --> 00:35:29,042
to get out of my new car,
or I'm gonna make you.

740
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:31,495
One, two...

741
00:35:34,003 --> 00:35:36,982
By my calculations,
there's still enough time

742
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:40,537
to save my friends... with luck.

743
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:46,925
Right, then, where to?

744
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,593
We need to go somewhere we can get back

745
00:35:48,617 --> 00:35:50,829
to our time machine
and find the rest of our crew.

746
00:35:50,853 --> 00:35:52,431
Tahiti, 2021.

747
00:35:52,455 --> 00:35:53,898
There's a Time Bureau safehouse there.

748
00:35:53,922 --> 00:35:55,900
We can go pick up some time couriers.

749
00:35:55,924 --> 00:35:59,738
And sounds like a great honeymoon. Hmm?

750
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:02,007
Tahiti would be an amazing honeymoon.

751
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:03,976
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
ladies, but...

752
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,677
After you have
got the rest of your friends,

753
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,879
you will hold up your end of the deal.

754
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:11,282
- I always keep my word.
- Deal? What are you...

755
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:13,884
What... you know what?
Nope, I don't even care.

756
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:15,786
It's been a crazy day. I disappeared.

757
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,755
I don't want to know anything.
Don't tell me anything.

758
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:20,892
Um, you should know one thing.

759
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:24,081
- Um, we also killed Edison.
- You what?

760
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:33,256
Come on, lucky rock.

761
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,376
If you do a lightning spell
to zap this tower

762
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,945
with as much juice as you can,

763
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,515
it should overwhelm the grid
and cause a citywide blackout,

764
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:45,949
- therefore...
- Preventing the Legends

765
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:47,885
from ever turning on that time machine.

766
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:50,020
I am the master of my fate.

767
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:53,142
I am the captain of my soul.

768
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:27,976
Let's do this.

769
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:48,529
No!

770
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,452
Oh, Astra! I got you.

771
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:58,643
You're okay.

772
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,376
Hurry up! Move it! We're almost there!

773
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,201
Go, go, go, go! Did we make it?

774
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:22,783
And that's how I arrived here.

775
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:26,420
Oh, hello, Astra. Hello, Spooner.

776
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:29,345
Hey!

777
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:39,099
Guys.

778
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:42,558
How many bloody
time travelers are there?

779
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,166
And then Astra did a lightning spell.

780
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,701
Mm, here we are.

781
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,960
Huh. How did you know
the blackout was gonna work?

782
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,431
I guess we got lucky.

783
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:59,156
Thought you could use a drink.

784
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,725
Heard you had quite the journey.

785
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:02,527
Oh, thank you! Mm.

786
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,595
Mm, save some for me.

787
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,130
Just kidding. I don't drink.

788
00:39:06,154 --> 00:39:08,455
We also have an infinite amount.

789
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:15,535
Oh, I had my foot on the gas
that whole time,

790
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,570
and we almost blew up.

791
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:21,340
And now because we didn't,
the timeline might be off.

792
00:39:21,364 --> 00:39:24,210
Oh, my God, hey,
what if you fritz out again?

793
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:26,745
Babe, it's okay. I'm here now.

794
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:30,950
Man, seeing you vanish
like that, it was...

795
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:34,319
it's like I saw my entire
future just disappear...

796
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:37,622
our whole lives together,
and it's just gone.

797
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:41,648
And it wasn't... it wasn't the
time travel or the high jinks.

798
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:45,619
It was like I lost my safe place.

799
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:49,134
And I lost the cuddles on the couch

800
00:39:49,158 --> 00:39:53,572
and bourbon sunsets on our porch.

801
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:55,674
I know we don't have a porch, but...

802
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:57,108
It's okay.

803
00:39:57,132 --> 00:40:00,044
I love bourbon sunsets
on our nonexistent porch.

804
00:40:00,068 --> 00:40:02,335
And I love you.

805
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:09,120
Hey. Power's back on.

806
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:12,390
So, Gideon, what was gonna
cause the machine to explode?

807
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:15,259
The machine requires
a class CR-055 superconductor

808
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:16,527
that doesn't need recharging.

809
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:18,196
It can power the machine safely,

810
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,731
unlike alternating current.

811
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:22,700
Unfortunately, it won't be
invented for another 300 years.

812
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:24,768
300 years?

813
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:28,191
Well, guys, looks like
we're stuck in 1925 forever.

814
00:40:29,431 --> 00:40:30,908
I was supposed to die today,

815
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:32,742
but by God's will, I didn't.

816
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,666
There has to be another way.

817
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,015
Did... did you say CR-055?

818
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,318
A little blue chip
the size of an eyeball?

819
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:43,887
Precisely. How did you know?

820
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:47,357
That chip was in Hoover-Bot's head.

821
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,611
Come on...

822
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:53,182
Ba-hoom.

823
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,433
- Do you have enough room?
- Oh, plenty.

824
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:58,668
I'm used to really tight spaces.

825
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:00,556
Me too.

826
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,476
The other Waverider... it's here.

827
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,546
- All right, punch it.
- Okay.

828
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,467
Tahiti, 2021, here we come.

829
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:45,814
Uh, guys...

830
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,269
I don't think this is Tahiti.
