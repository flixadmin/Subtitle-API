1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,410
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:03,908
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:05,044
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:07,206
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,508
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:10,087
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,052
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,380
like me.

9
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:15,115
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:16,883
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:18,918
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,302
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:23,823
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:26,459
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:28,795
Previously, on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:31,865
I'm not a ghost. I'm
Leo Snart, from Earth-X.

17
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:33,166
I didn't do anything!

18
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:34,200
I understand, but your

19
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,668
radioactivity is dangerous.

20
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,006
You are part of this team.

21
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:41,307
And I'm the only one with a body

22
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:42,931
that DeVoe is trying to snatch.

23
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:46,713
Now you will die, for me.

24
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:49,282
Melt.

25
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:51,751
- Killer Frost...
- Is gone.

26
00:00:51,753 --> 00:00:55,522
My new host body holds
an ancillary benefit.

27
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:57,357
Dark matter, siphoned from the room

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,593
where Dr. Wells was
charging his counterfeit cap.

29
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:02,362
Maximum capacity, now!

30
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:08,268
Again.

31
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,370
Dr. Wells, the odds of
a different conclusion

32
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:11,938
- are extremely low.
- Run it again.

33
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,673
Yes, Dr. Wells.

34
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:19,179
Same results, Dr. Wells.

35
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:21,181
The excessive infusion of dark matter

36
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,736
into your neural system
has disrupted the area

37
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:25,377
of the brain where general intelligence

38
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,970
and executive function occur.

39
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:29,338
My ability to integrate new information

40
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,757
is declining.

41
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:34,928
I'm losing my intelligence.

42
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,863
At some point soon you need to relearn

43
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:39,732
everything you've ever known.

44
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,735
Is there a way to use the thinking cap

45
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:43,931
to reverse this process?

46
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:45,405
Unlikely, Dr. Wells.

47
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:47,373
Your thinking cap and the dark matter

48
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,575
is what caused this.

49
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:49,931
I tried to caution restraint...

50
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:51,377
I know!

51
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:57,450
Gideon, how long before
everything I know...

52
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,637
is gone?

53
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,706
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

54
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:05,725
You know, it's only been a couple days

55
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:09,529
since he died, but...

56
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:11,664
it still doesn't feel real.

57
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,083
How close were you with Ralph?

58
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:16,853
We were becoming close.

59
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:20,874
Yeah, it took me a while to see past

60
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:23,345
the things that I didn't
like when we first met,

61
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:24,777
but after a while,

62
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:27,347
I started to see what a good guy he was.

63
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:31,084
Started to see the hero that he became.

64
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:32,519
You consider him a hero?

65
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:35,688
Yeah. Yeah I do.

66
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,424
What about you, Barry?

67
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:39,926
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

68
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:41,694
I mean, you know,

69
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,196
I'm working through it.

70
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:45,819
So you weren't as close
to him as Iris was?

71
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:49,056
No, I mean, we were
about the same, I'd say.

72
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:51,471
They used to work together.

73
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:53,640
- Oh?
- Yeah.

74
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:55,658
And you're fine already?

75
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:57,076
With his death?

76
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:59,846
I've dealt with a lot
of death in my life.

77
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,814
Yes, you have.

78
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:06,861
Your mother, father,
Eddie, Ronnie, H.R..

79
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:11,257
Has Ralph's death had
any impact on you at all?

80
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,762
I think I just know

81
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:18,361
how to deal with death now,

82
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,934
so it doesn't affect me
as much as it once did.

83
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,370
Uh, all right,

84
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,103
I guess we'll pick this up later.

85
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,541
Yeah.

86
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,213
Same time next week?

87
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,879
Or before if you need.

88
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:36,516
Barry... Grief is a complex emotion

89
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:39,719
that, as you know,
deals on its own terms.

90
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,088
There is no "practice
makes perfect."

91
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,597
Thirsty, my love?

92
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,970
You're happy.

93
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:04,811
More than I've been in
a long time, my love.

94
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,347
To your return.

95
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,849
I never left you, Marlize.

96
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,150
It felt like you had.

97
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:12,585
Those days are past us now.

98
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,454
All our sacrifice, our commitment,

99
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:17,423
our planning, everything is as it was.

100
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,425
And more.

101
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:22,061
There's been no decline
in your metabolic processes

102
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,731
since your last transference.

103
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:26,392
My mind, my abilities...

104
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:29,213
These elasticized cells

105
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:32,238
can hold another bus
full of meta-human powers

106
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,955
and I still wouldn't be affected.

107
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,309
That gives me peace, Clifford.

108
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:40,613
I need your mind focused
for what happens next.

109
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:45,785
- We start today?
- Yes.

110
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:48,988
But we have time, my love.

111
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:51,524
Could we not spend time together?

112
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:54,560
As husband and wife? I think...

113
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:59,465
Mm, that is... That
is your first mistake.

114
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,667
Leave the thinking to me.

115
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:29,495
Whoa! Stop, don't bother.

116
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:30,880
It doesn't work.

117
00:05:30,883 --> 00:05:32,831
- I don't know about that.
- Yeah, well I know about it.

118
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,739
I'm guy who wore it on his head.

119
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:36,836
And it helped you gain
ground on DeVoe, didn't it?

120
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,505
Mapping the pocket dimensions,
building the Scepter.

121
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:40,857
We stopped you from using it

122
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,142
right when we needed it
most, when Ralph got...

123
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,149
We thought you were addicted.

124
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:51,775
We shouldn't have stopped you.

125
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:52,952
We were wrong.

126
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,955
Actually, no... you know
what, you weren't wrong.

127
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:58,224
No, I was... I was addicted.

128
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:00,526
Yeah, which is stupid
when you think about it.

129
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,195
Because I'm a pretty smart guy.

130
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,530
How much smarter was this
Intelligence Booster making me?

131
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:05,692
10%?

132
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:08,034
I think we both agree
that DeVoe is at least

133
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:10,271
twice as smart as that.

134
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,471
Then maybe I should get to wear it too.

135
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,743
Okay, no.

136
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,424
No, this thing would never work on you,

137
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,849
because I specifically designed this

138
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:24,116
to stimulate my brain waves.

139
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,509
My brain waves, not yours, okay?

140
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:26,886
My cerebral firings, 'kay?

141
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,121
Harry, Harry, I'm saying we should build

142
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:30,990
a second thinking cap.

143
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:32,624
- "Intelligence Booster."
- For me.

144
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:34,627
For you?

145
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,708
Yes, for me. Think about it.

146
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:38,097
Two heads are better than one.

147
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,166
Your ideas, my ideas.

148
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:41,868
Put 'em together. We combine them.

149
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,270
We build upon each other's ideas.

150
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:46,304
Harry, with two caps... With two caps

151
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:49,575
we could get DeVoe.

152
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,511
Okay. Get on it.

153
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:58,802
Melt.

154
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,856
- Anything new?
- No sign of DeVoe.

155
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,359
I meant with you.

156
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:07,894
No.

157
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:10,830
No cold signatures anywhere in the city.

158
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,900
Killer Frost is nowhere to be found.

159
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:15,401
That doesn't make sense, I mean,

160
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,603
DeVoe created every
bus meta for a reason.

161
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,439
I mean, he had no
interest in Barry's powers

162
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,642
or Cisco's, or any of
the metas in Iron Heights,

163
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:24,610
so I don't know why he
would suddenly want yours.

164
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,178
We all saw what happened.

165
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,282
When DeVoe touched me,
my powers disappeared.

166
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:30,383
Had to be him.

167
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:34,671
DeVoe?

168
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:36,121
Uh, satellite's picking up

169
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:37,474
three different pocket dimensions

170
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:38,710
opening in Key Stone.

171
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:40,387
Let's each...

172
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,067
All right, you and me, Ray, let's go.

173
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,303
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

174
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:44,596
They all just closed.

175
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:46,165
What?

176
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,900
Huh. Wrong coordinates?

177
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,635
Maybe he made a mistake.

178
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,348
He doesn't make mistakes.

179
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,672
He must want something in Keystone.

180
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,830
- Tracy Brand's lab.
- He's going after Fal Fut.

181
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,911
All right, call Tracy.

182
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:58,362
Tell her we're coming for Borman, okay?

183
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:00,313
Wait, and gonna do what?

184
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,036
Just to take him somewhere else.

185
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,415
Well, we can't take him here.

186
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:05,184
We can't even contain his fallout.

187
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:07,553
Tracy's barely been able
to contain his powers as is.

188
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,889
Yeah, the guy's a nuclear
explosion waiting to go off.

189
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,978
And I don't know about you,
but I... I've had my fill

190
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:13,192
of nuclear bombs this year.

191
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,727
But if we can cool him down,

192
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,095
we can get him somewhere safe.

193
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:17,263
What about Snart's cold gun?

194
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,650
I mean, I have a prototype,

195
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:19,719
but to modify it to our needs,

196
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:21,021
that would take at least a day.

197
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:22,057
We don't have that kind of time.

198
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,069
DeVoe's coming for him.

199
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:24,437
DeVoe has known our every move.

200
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,638
I mean, we've gotta do something

201
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,872
that he hasn't accounted for.

202
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,135
How are we supposed to find a way

203
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:29,508
to cool down Borman

204
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,559
and take him somewhere
DeVoe won't know about

205
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:34,007
with a plan he won't see coming?

206
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,876
Call Lyla.

207
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,383
See if A.R.G.U.S. has
anything off the grid.

208
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:40,453
Okay, but even if they do, I
mean, what are we going to do

209
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:42,221
about the other two problems?

210
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:51,931
War's over!

211
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:55,880
Bad guys and girls lost.

212
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,604
Nazi regime's been dismantled.

213
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,078
And the rebellion's in charge now.

214
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,514
Why don't you turn yourself in?

215
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:11,098
Save us the Tom and Jerry.

216
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,054
Find some other misguided cause

217
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,156
to get all aggro about.

218
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:24,208
Not this knight.

219
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:26,398
I will fight until every last one of you

220
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:29,802
finds the same fate as
my brothers and sisters.

221
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:34,814
Your timing is impeccable.

222
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,843
Your timing is impeccable.

223
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,412
We need your help on our Earth.

224
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:41,560
Right now? I'm kinda busy.

225
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:43,095
Doing what? Dying?

226
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:45,939
Touché!

227
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:05,201
So, you're trying to stop a guy

228
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,727
who thinks he's smarter than everyone

229
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,258
and his true-believer lover,

230
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:11,064
who are hell-bent on achieving
their evil machinations

231
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,300
at any cost.

232
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,302
Well, it's right up my alley.

233
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:17,571
Except DeVoe actually
is smarter than everyone.

234
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:19,406
He created 12 meta-humans

235
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:21,241
just so he could steal their powers.

236
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:22,958
And he left everybody
dead in the process.

237
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:26,724
Including Ralph Dibny, who
was a team member of ours.

238
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,782
I'm sorry. That's rough.

239
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:30,784
All these deaths have been rough.

240
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:33,123
We can't dwell on it right
now. You know, we have to focus

241
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:34,337
so DeVoe doesn't know what we're doing

242
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:35,857
and we have a shot at saving Borman.

243
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,958
Which is why we came to you.

244
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,466
Oh, I see, and I'm just
outside the box enough

245
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,196
to catch DeVoe off-guard.

246
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:46,600
That, and we need your cold gun.

247
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,368
Oh? For what?

248
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:49,737
We've been working on modifying

249
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,439
a radiation hazmat suit

250
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,109
to regulate his internal temperature

251
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:56,008
to keep his core from raising
to the point of detonation

252
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:57,244
during transport.

253
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,196
Your cold gun would be our backup.

254
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,552
It must be happy hour,
and I'm the two-for-one.

255
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:03,350
What about your chilly friend?

256
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:04,818
She doesn't want in on the fun?

257
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,654
- She's gone.
- That's too bad.

258
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:10,090
All right, you get me for 24 hours.

259
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:12,092
- Not a minute more.
- Wait, why not?

260
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,895
Because I thought I'd
make Ray an honest man.

261
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,852
Tomorrow.

262
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:19,433
- You're getting married?
- That's so exciting!

263
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:20,968
I figured if you two could make it,

264
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,498
- so could we.
- What?

265
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:24,404
- No, we...
- I tease.

266
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:26,306
So, where are we moving this guy to?

267
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:28,909
A.R.G.U.S. has a
facility in New Brighton.

268
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:32,008
High tech, high security...
He should be safe there.

269
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:33,663
And how long till you're
done with the suit?

270
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:34,852
- Few more tweaks.
- Okay.

271
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,983
I'm gonna go call my dad
and let him know the plan.

272
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,755
- Hey!
- Hey.

273
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:43,190
Is that it? Are you done?

274
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:44,669
Yeah, well, the truth is,

275
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:46,024
the first one was the hard part.

276
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,593
This one is simply, basically

277
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:49,296
- following the plan's...
- Precisely!

278
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:51,001
Let's take this for a spin, shall we?

279
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,066
Oh, all right, go ahead.

280
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:55,836
Here. Have a seat.

281
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,441
Okay.

282
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:03,010
All right, then I guess...

283
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:04,444
Hey.

284
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:05,979
I trust you.

285
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,260
No, I know that.

286
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,185
Okay, here we go.

287
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:16,690
- Connection established.
- Hmm, tingles.

288
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:18,192
Yeah.

289
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:20,060
Kinda feels like my conditioner!

290
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:21,662
Ooh!

291
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:24,363
That's your synaptic activity enhancing.

292
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:27,534
Whoa! Boy, is it ever.

293
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:29,203
It's like a party in my brain.

294
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:31,605
I can see why you like
this thing so much.

295
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:33,407
I can feel my neurons firing.

296
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,343
Okay! Ooh-hoo!

297
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:38,111
Pikachu!

298
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:39,846
Whoo! Harry!

299
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:42,172
- Harry!
- Yeah, yeah, yup, yup, yup.

300
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:44,218
- Oh, oh, ha-ha.
- Whoo!

301
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,919
Yeah, you know what, I think

302
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:49,146
what happened, probably a
hyper-limiter valve, that, uh...

303
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,133
Promethium ion diodes.

304
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,375
- Promethium ion diode, yep.
- They overloaded the cap.

305
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:55,695
Overloaded. Real bummer.
Oh, well. We tried.

306
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:57,564
How the hell'd you get
promethium ion diodes?

307
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:00,567
Oh, I got 'em. I... in my lab

308
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:04,506
on my Earth, had 'em there,
but I'm all out, unfortunately.

309
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:05,775
We don't have any here.

310
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:07,778
It would take us weeks to get some.

311
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:09,243
Oh, well. Well, you know what,

312
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,945
we'll put in a back order.

313
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:14,514
I'll see if I can come
up with something else.

314
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:15,983
Right.

315
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:19,019
I see our scare tactics worked.

316
00:13:19,021 --> 00:13:22,456
They're going to move the
asset as you anticipated.

317
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,360
Yes, but unfortunately not
to a location I predicted.

318
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,472
What is this?

319
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,542
Your favorite dress.

320
00:13:48,217 --> 00:13:51,018
And you chose to wear that now?

321
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,520
To please you, my love.

322
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:57,691
What would please me
is your understanding

323
00:13:57,693 --> 00:14:00,961
of the gravity of our undertaking.

324
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:05,098
To right the misguided
course of all humanity.

325
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,200
- I just thought...
- Shh, shh, shh.

326
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:11,571
You see, again, you thought.

327
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:16,543
Which led you to this trivial emotion.

328
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,912
Now, change into something

329
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:20,981
a bit more appropriate.

330
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:25,185
Your role, from now
until the enlightenment

331
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:28,121
has occurred, is as my technician.

332
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:34,186
Now leave me be so that I can figure out

333
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:36,989
a way to motivate Team Flash

334
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:41,801
to deliver our quarry to
where initially intended.

335
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,810
All right, look, I think
we take Highway 14.

336
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,287
It's as rural as we're going to get.

337
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,045
It's a straight shot to New Brighten.

338
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:55,015
Best chance to get Fallout to safety.

339
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:56,783
Sounds like a plan, Barry.

340
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,518
You know how I feel about plans.

341
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,786
Yep.

342
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:01,675
This was your team member, right?

343
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:04,624
Ralph Dibny?

344
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,960
Yeah, Elongated Man.

345
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:09,162
"Elongated Man"?

346
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:10,764
Don't remember someone with that name

347
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:13,495
being a part of the
fight against the Nazis.

348
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:16,370
No, no, he, um... he wasn't ready yet.

349
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:19,072
Ah, a rookie hero.

350
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,241
So you trained him?

351
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:23,443
As much as I could, yeah.

352
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:26,480
Even harder death to take,
someone you've mentored.

353
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:30,751
And yet somehow you seem okay,
considering this happened,

354
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:32,855
what, just a few days ago?

355
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:35,122
I am okay. I'm just...

356
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:36,826
trying to do what I have to do.

357
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,162
I'm trying to stay on task.

358
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:41,394
Oh, is that what you're doing?

359
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:44,264
Do you know how many rebels
we lost over the years, Barry,

360
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:47,868
trying to defeat those Nazi bastards?

361
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,237
- Countless, I'm sure.
- Not countless.

362
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,571
Counted.

363
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:54,074
18,322.

364
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:57,691
3,769 were under my watch.

365
00:15:57,694 --> 00:16:00,247
And I felt the weight
of each of their deaths.

366
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:04,050
I still do, some years after they die.

367
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:06,401
- Yeah, look...
- The thing I realized

368
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:09,723
is that to continue to
lead, to be clear-headed,

369
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:12,292
I had to grieve for those
men and women I lost.

370
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:15,662
So I did. Each and every one.

371
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,733
Look, Barry.

372
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:21,134
You want me to help you move

373
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:22,969
a meta-human nuclear bomb

374
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:26,173
that some genius with nearly
every meta-power on this board

375
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:28,241
is after, I will do what I can,

376
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:30,477
as long as your head is on straight.

377
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:33,134
Because if I die before
Ray and I get married,

378
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:34,870
Ray will kill me.

379
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,684
Suits ready.

380
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:40,917
And Fallout is ready at Tracy's lab.

381
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,656
So let's get to Keystone.

382
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:44,958
- You good?
- I'm good.

383
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,793
Then let's go get our guy.

384
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,737
Meta-human nuclear bomb...

385
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,803
Nuclear bomb...

386
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,746
And Fallout is ready at Tracy's lab...

387
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,183
Fallout is ready at Tracy's lab...

388
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:58,615
Let's get to Keystone...

389
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,309
Let's get to Keystone...

390
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:04,109
Let's go get our guy...

391
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,480
Yes, let's.

392
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,998
After all, a nuke is a
terrible thing to waste.

393
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,237
You're telling me I have to
wear this thing the whole time?

394
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,481
Yeah, look, that suit
protects us from you

395
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:19,398
so that we can protect you from the guy

396
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:20,734
that's trying to hunt you down.

397
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:21,995
Why is he after me?

398
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:23,847
Honestly, Neil, we don't
know, but we want to find out

399
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,159
as much as you do.

400
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:26,984
And we will. Trust me.

401
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:31,355
Saved me once, Flash, I
trust you to do it again.

402
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:33,457
What's that?

403
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,720
I whipped up this cocktail

404
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:37,794
of atomized DTPA and potassium iodide.

405
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:39,763
It should flood our thyroids

406
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:41,398
with enough non-radioactive iodine

407
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,467
so that if our containment
suit doesn't work,

408
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:46,670
it should offer us some
protection from radiation.

409
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:51,209
Some protection, how vaguely reassuring.

410
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:54,912
- How long will this last?
- Two, three hours max.

411
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,820
- You'd better get going.
- All right.

412
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:58,838
Let's just go over the
plan one more time, okay?

413
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:00,308
I'm going to be running
ahead of the truck,

414
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,151
scouting the route for
any signs of trouble.

415
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:03,833
Right, I will be at S.T.A.R. Labs

416
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,488
tracking any pocket dimension en route.

417
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,955
And I'll be in the truck with Neil

418
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,758
monitoring his vitals and RADS.

419
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,339
With me at the ready, in case

420
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:13,765
our meta of mass destruction
here goes all mushroom cloud.

421
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:15,865
- No offense.
- And I'll be driving.

422
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:18,635
And reciting every prayer
that Cecile's ever taught me.

423
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:20,470
I might join you.

424
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:22,840
Look, guys, I know
DeVoe's hit us pretty hard,

425
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:24,377
but right now let's just...

426
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,176
Let's try to forget
what he's taken from us,

427
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:28,011
and stay focused on
taking something from him

428
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:30,280
by getting Neil safely to A.R.G.U.S.

429
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:32,850
We do that, whatever DeVoe
has planned falls apart.

430
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:34,757
Winning this battle may
just win us this war.

431
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,963
Hear, hear!

432
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:39,121
Let's all make sure we
keep our heads in the game.

433
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:41,758
So we can stay safe out there.

434
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,930
I know what that was about.

435
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:48,999
It was a good speech, Barry.

436
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,902
Just making sure you heard
it, didn't just give it.

437
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:53,337
What is that supposed to mean?

438
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,867
If you don't confront your feelings,

439
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,008
they will confront you.

440
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:05,082
All clear on my end.

441
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:07,384
There's no pocket dimension
activity in the area.

442
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:09,920
Roads are looking good too. Joe?

443
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:12,656
Yeah, the rig is secure.

444
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:15,259
- Caitlyn?
- RADS are good.

445
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:16,960
Heartbeat regular.

446
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:24,434
On Earth-X, we have a saying.

447
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:27,371
"If you laugh out loud,
you got to share the joke."

448
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,039
Byproduct of living on an Earth

449
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,609
where joy is a scarce commodity.

450
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:35,379
It's a Post-it note from Killer Frost.

451
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:38,682
It's how we talk. Talked.

452
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:42,119
"Broke the thermostat
again. I think it hates me."

453
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:43,787
Aw, it's cute.

454
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,522
Do you miss her?

455
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:48,792
It's not that... it's just that...

456
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:51,795
we were starting to become close lately.

457
00:19:51,797 --> 00:19:54,737
And I know how crazy that sounds

458
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,082
considering we're talking about someone

459
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:57,934
who actually lived inside of me.

460
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:01,288
I'm on an alt-Earth
transporting a human bomb

461
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,873
with an escort that can literally

462
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,641
run back to the future.

463
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:07,744
Your story is the least crazy
thing I've heard all day.

464
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:09,713
One thing's for sure.

465
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:11,682
I will miss those little notes.

466
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:13,317
Alter-ego or not,

467
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:17,087
it's okay to miss someone we've lost.

468
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:18,956
How's he doing?

469
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,457
Good. His RADS are low,

470
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:21,549
vitals seem stable.

471
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,687
I gave him a sedative,
and it seems to be working.

472
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,095
Okay, good, we're almost there...

473
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:26,828
Guys, there's pocket dimension activity.

474
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:42,346
- Dad!
- I'm trapped in here.

475
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:43,747
The door's unlocked, but...

476
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:46,583
But it's just like... It weighs a ton.

477
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,318
Iris?

478
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,087
- Iris?
- Dad?

479
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,245
The comms are out. It's DeVoe.

480
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:55,115
He's here?

481
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:08,205
Mr. Allen.

482
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:10,838
As usual, you're a step behind me.

483
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:12,942
Yay, puns.

484
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:15,946
You Earth-1 villains sure are a hoot.

485
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:18,448
You have no idea, Mr. Snart.

486
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,217
You're not taking Fallout.

487
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:22,719
I can, and I will, if not here and now,

488
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:26,690
then after your top-secret
transfer to A.R.G.U.S.

489
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:28,892
Yes, I know.

490
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:31,094
Remember?

491
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:33,296
Good, I won't have to feel guilty

492
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:35,165
about doing this.

493
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:49,212
Well, that de-escalated quickly.

494
00:21:49,214 --> 00:21:50,947
The miniscule sound waves

495
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:53,016
produced by that toy trinket of yours

496
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:57,026
are far too weak for
this new body of mine.

497
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:00,156
What a gift Mr. Dibny provided.

498
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,626
Well, it was a gift in
a manner of speaking.

499
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:04,895
Right, rookie?

500
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:14,871
Barry.

501
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:16,315
Why such turmoil

502
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,808
in your mind, Mr. Allen?

503
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:21,178
Allow me to ease your pain.

504
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:34,591
That's it! I'm leaving!

505
00:22:34,593 --> 00:22:36,026
No, no, no, I need you to stay here

506
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:38,929
and calm down. Neil, wait!

507
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,999
I want you all to listen
to me very carefully,

508
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:45,453
and hopefully I won't
have to raise my voice.

509
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:48,117
This truck is now mine.

510
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:53,889
We really have no way of
finding Joe and Caitlyn?

511
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:55,418
Not even by tracking Fallout?

512
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,828
That hazmat suit is hiding

513
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:58,187
his radiation signature.

514
00:22:58,189 --> 00:23:00,089
So the satellite can't even find him

515
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:01,524
unless he heats up.

516
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:02,892
Okay, well, what do you know

517
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:04,260
about Laurel Lance's doppelganger?

518
00:23:04,262 --> 00:23:05,962
And why was she hunting you?

519
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,497
That was Siren-X,

520
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:08,998
all that's left of the Reichsmen.

521
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,100
An elite assassin gone mad,

522
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:13,369
and she is relentless.

523
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:16,372
Carried a torch for
Dark Arrow, unrequited,

524
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:18,574
so she's none too pleased
with those responsible

525
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:21,811
for his death, present company included.

526
00:23:21,813 --> 00:23:24,676
So she has the same
powers as Black Siren?

527
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,350
The Laurel Lance of Earth-2.

528
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:29,254
And Earth-1's Laurel Lance...

529
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:30,820
She died.

530
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:33,289
She was the second Black
Canary after her sister,

531
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,957
who also died and came back,

532
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,492
but as White Canary, cause...

533
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:38,094
- Cisco.
- It's complicated.

534
00:23:38,096 --> 00:23:40,730
Right. Doppelganger confusion aside,

535
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:43,533
Siren-X has my cold-gun and a nuke,

536
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:45,568
and her thirst for
vengeance won't prevent her

537
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,705
from using either one
on me or all of you now.

538
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:54,176
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

539
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:56,078
- I'm fine.
- I'm just a little worried.

540
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,947
It seemed like she got
the jump on you out there.

541
00:23:57,949 --> 00:23:59,315
She didn't. She just
caught me off-guard.

542
00:23:59,317 --> 00:24:00,716
And why does it matter right now?

543
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:02,404
We don't even know where
Joe and Caitlyn are.

544
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:04,253
- I...
- Cisco, will you just

545
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:06,188
- see if Harry has any ideas?
- I'm on it.

546
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,891
Just watch the satellites like a hawk.

547
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:12,903
Leo, what exactly happened out there?

548
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:15,164
Oh, just your typical deadly combat

549
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,733
between two metas from multiple earths.

550
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:19,602
Leonard.

551
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:21,992
- I'll go talk to him.
- Thank you.

552
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:26,342
Where is it?

553
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:28,311
Hey, Ramon, wh... what are you doing?

554
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:30,980
A Nazi Laurel Lance just
kidnapped Caitlyn and Joe.

555
00:24:30,982 --> 00:24:32,219
We're going to make this thing work,

556
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,616
and we're going to make it work now.

557
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:35,474
Okay, well, we can't. We can't,

558
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:37,054
I still haven't found a replacement

559
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:40,322
for that... Where did you get that?

560
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,758
I found this in one of
the cubes Gypsy sent me.

561
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,593
How clever of you. You know what, Ramon?

562
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:46,128
It's still not going to
work. It's not gonna work.

563
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,445
- Why?
- Because it's not gonna work.

564
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:48,897
Okay? Because it's a waste of time.

565
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,299
Because I said so! That's why!

566
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:51,968
- Well, in that case...
- Listen, Ramon...

567
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,554
Our friends' lives are at stake.

568
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:54,923
- You don't...
- Look!

569
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,204
I don't know what's going on with you,

570
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:58,450
but if you're not going to
help me with this thing, I...

571
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,543
What...

572
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,164
Why would you do that?

573
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:07,750
To protect you.

574
00:25:10,388 --> 00:25:12,521
The cap did this?

575
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:18,127
And dark matter.

576
00:25:18,129 --> 00:25:19,862
You used dark matter?

577
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:21,430
I used dark matter. It... look, Ramon.

578
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,565
It was the only way.

579
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:23,866
The only way to do what?

580
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:25,601
Fry your synapses?

581
00:25:25,603 --> 00:25:27,984
Harry, you promised me.

582
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:29,805
I know I promised you, I promised you.

583
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:33,009
Oh, my god.

584
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:35,411
Harry, how could you be so stupid?

585
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:38,570
- 'Cause I felt so stupid!
- We all feel stupid right now!

586
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:41,117
Yes, but you're Vibe, Allen's the Flash.

587
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,251
Who am I?

588
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:44,787
My only job

589
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:46,515
is to be smarter

590
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:48,591
than all the villains who
want to hurt this team,

591
00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:50,893
and without that, I'm nothing.

592
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:53,596
I'm about to lose the only part of me

593
00:25:53,598 --> 00:25:55,031
that has any value to this team,

594
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:57,199
the only part of me that matters.

595
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,535
And so, yeah, I destroyed the cap.

596
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:02,204
So that you wouldn't make
the same mistake I did.

597
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:10,546
This should not be happening.

598
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:13,082
Perhaps you miscalculated.

599
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:15,851
I calculated everything.

600
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:18,688
The Flash's involvement
with the bus meta,

601
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,724
the recruitment of Snart's doppelganger,

602
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:24,727
even the arrival of the Earth-X banshee.

603
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:29,498
Every event occurred
exactly as I predicted.

604
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,233
Except the outcome!

605
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:33,836
You were supposed to defeat Siren-X?

606
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:35,671
No.

607
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:37,807
The Flash was, but...

608
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:41,711
Barry Allen just stood there, frozen.

609
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:44,680
And now I've lost my only nuclear meta

610
00:26:44,682 --> 00:26:46,682
because The Flash failed!

611
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:50,786
Why? Why did he fail?

612
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:54,256
Perhaps there were variables
that we just did not consider.

613
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:58,194
As I already explained,
there is no variable

614
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:00,996
beyond my examination.

615
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:03,232
Even less apparent.

616
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:05,401
The last time Barry Allen saw you,

617
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:07,503
you took the life of his close friend,

618
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:10,172
and now he sees you and he pauses.

619
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:11,543
You really don't see it?

620
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,110
You can calculate near-infinite outcomes

621
00:27:14,112 --> 00:27:16,712
across multiple Earths,
but you cannot account

622
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:20,116
for how someone is feeling.

623
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:36,065
What'd you see out there, Barry?

624
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:37,767
When you froze up?

625
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:39,268
Nothing.

626
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,270
You just got two of
your teammates captured

627
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:43,139
and almost got me killed.

628
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:48,210
So either you explain
what happened or I leave.

629
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:50,497
- I saw Ralph.
- Mm, I warned you.

630
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,265
He is messing with your head.

631
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:53,834
No, it's not like that.

632
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:55,231
Do I miss him? Yes.

633
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:57,082
Do I regret what happened? Of course.

634
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:59,054
But I don't need lessons in loss.

635
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:01,014
What I need to do right
now is lead my team.

636
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:02,646
Well, you're gonna lead
them to their deaths

637
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:03,785
if you don't deal with this.

638
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:04,914
Back off, Leo.

639
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,362
You need to grieve him, Barry.

640
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:08,164
Grief is a luxury I don't have time for.

641
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,232
- Make time!
- I can't!

642
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:13,769
Not...

643
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:16,071
Ralph, not right now.

644
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:17,673
Ahh.

645
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:20,709
So we've finally reached the core.

646
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:25,815
You don't want to grieve this wound.

647
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:28,884
So Ralph's death must be different

648
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:32,321
from all the other losses
you've experienced, but why?

649
00:28:32,323 --> 00:28:34,117
Why?

650
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,586
Barry, trust me.

651
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:39,227
There is no outrunning grief.

652
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:42,565
If that was a pun, I'm sorry.

653
00:28:54,212 --> 00:28:55,277
Run, run!

654
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:05,487
CCPD, home of the brave

655
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:07,117
land of the dead.

656
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,243
Killing all these people

657
00:29:11,246 --> 00:29:12,542
won't bring back your regime.

658
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:13,944
No, it won't.

659
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:16,139
But decimating your so-called officers

660
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:17,840
will make it a hell of a lot more even.

661
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:19,842
I'll make sure of it.

662
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:22,812
Remove your helmet. What?

663
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,380
Take it off!

664
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,533
CCPD. Why would she take him there?

665
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:40,499
We destroyed her protectors.

666
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:42,031
Maybe she wants to do the same to us.

667
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:43,199
Harry, we need eyes.

668
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:44,471
You know what? Why don't you

669
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:45,493
let me take care of it, all right?

670
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:47,068
You keep an eye on the RADS.

671
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:49,108
Leo, we're on.

672
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:51,177
Barry, I'm always on.

673
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,975
- Oh wait, I need a...
- Oh, got you.

674
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:55,933
- Thank you, Iris.
- Mm.

675
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:01,984
How much time do we have
left on the injection?

676
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:03,152
Not enough.

677
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:23,172
Barry!

678
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:25,537
This is for destroying my world!

679
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:32,148
- 7,000 RADS.
- And climbing.

680
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,516
Guys, you gotta cool him down.

681
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:52,147
8,000 RADS and climbing.

682
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,764
Flash, get up. Get up!

683
00:30:56,962 --> 00:31:00,263
Flash, people are going to die, Flash.

684
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:01,843
I'm not ready to die.

685
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:04,146
Rise up. Let me train you.

686
00:31:04,148 --> 00:31:06,081
- Train me?
- Fight it, all right?

687
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,873
Fight it! I'll save you.

688
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:09,264
Flash, Flash!

689
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,433
You have to deal with the pain!

690
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:14,651
No!

691
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:16,491
Can't get away from what's inside you,

692
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:19,128
so stop trying!

693
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,162
Flash!

694
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,702
9,000 RADS.

695
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:25,805
The whole place is gonna blow.

696
00:31:25,808 --> 00:31:27,541
Flash!

697
00:31:27,544 --> 00:31:28,904
Wasn't your fault!

698
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:30,959
Ralph, I'll save you!

699
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:33,262
You already did, Barry.

700
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,393
He's burning up!

701
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,398
Time to get cold-blooded.

702
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:01,737
8,000 RADS.

703
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:08,936
7,000 RADS.

704
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:10,778
Keep icing him, it's working.

705
00:32:14,252 --> 00:32:15,784
And dropping.

706
00:32:23,494 --> 00:32:25,261
He's contained.

707
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:26,962
They did it.

708
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:35,571
Where's The Flash?

709
00:32:43,225 --> 00:32:45,781
Bar. What's going on, Bar?

710
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:50,040
He trusted me, Joe.

711
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:51,920
I let him down.

712
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:53,923
Ralph,

713
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:55,891
I'm the reason he's dead.

714
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,613
- No.
- No.

715
00:32:57,616 --> 00:33:00,195
- No.
- I failed him, I...

716
00:33:00,197 --> 00:33:01,997
He was my responsibility.

717
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:03,365
Now he's gone.

718
00:33:05,595 --> 00:33:06,735
It's all right.

719
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:16,455
So we're sure that Fallout is secure?

720
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:18,123
Well, Lyla said she had some people

721
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,458
who would be very interested

722
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,041
in helping Borman control his powers.

723
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:23,194
She took him to a different
A.R.G.U.S. black-ops site

724
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:24,892
- way off the grid.
- How far off the grid?

725
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:26,698
Like, it would take Jack Ryan

726
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,700
two Tom Clancy novels to find him.

727
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:31,103
I got to say, on any Earth,

728
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:34,165
Snarts have style. Perfect fit.

729
00:33:34,168 --> 00:33:35,635
Thought you could do something with it.

730
00:33:35,637 --> 00:33:37,443
- You wear it well.
- Thank you.

731
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:39,009
You sure you can't come to the wedding?

732
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:40,145
I could put all of you

733
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:41,547
at a table with Ray's uncle Skip.

734
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:43,415
He murders the "Macarena."

735
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:45,517
Yeah, DeVoe's still out there.

736
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,747
Suit yourselves.

737
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,020
But if you're looking
for a place to honeymoon,

738
00:33:49,023 --> 00:33:51,723
our Earth has some
pretty spectacular spots.

739
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:52,822
What is this?

740
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:55,460
That is an inter-dimensional
extrapolator.

741
00:33:55,463 --> 00:33:56,929
It makes small-scale breaches.

742
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:59,364
You know, in case Ray's uncle Skip

743
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:00,947
wants to see how the other half lives.

744
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,137
Oh, well, look at that.

745
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,486
Something old, something new,

746
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:06,839
something borrowed, something navy.

747
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:08,106
We're gonna miss you, Leo.

748
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:10,108
Gonna miss you, too, Caitlyn.

749
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,277
You're quite the badass, you know.

750
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,613
Enough to make your alter-ego proud.

751
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:15,714
Thank you.

752
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:16,942
Detective West,

753
00:34:16,945 --> 00:34:18,549
I know my Earth-1 counterpart

754
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:19,856
gave you a lot of headaches.

755
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,086
Hopefully I've begun
to make up for that.

756
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:26,278
Man, you prevented a nuke
from leveling the city.

757
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:29,361
We're good.

758
00:34:29,363 --> 00:34:32,231
Cisco, I'm really gonna miss that hair.

759
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:35,868
Okay.

760
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,336
Iris West-Allen,

761
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:38,804
thank you for helping me

762
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:41,306
take down Nazi scum, again.

763
00:34:41,308 --> 00:34:44,576
You're welcome, again.

764
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:49,180
And then there was one.

765
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,849
I could see why the other Snart

766
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:54,286
turned over a new leaf
and joined the good guys.

767
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:56,556
You treat everyone
around you with kindness

768
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,057
and respect.

769
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:01,326
Just remember to do
the same for yourself,

770
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:03,829
every once in a while.

771
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:05,898
Thanks for helping me push through.

772
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,622
Anytime, Barry.

773
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:11,096
Don't be a stranger.

774
00:35:14,141 --> 00:35:16,475
Oh, you never know.

775
00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:27,753
How you doing?

776
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:29,321
I know last night was pretty rough.

777
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:32,524
I'll tell you about it
when we see Dr. Finkle.

778
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:34,159
We're seeing Dr. Finkle?

779
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:37,529
Yeah, I gave her a call.

780
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,342
How's it going?

781
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:50,075
I don't know.

782
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:52,744
Hauling a nuclear meta across the state,

783
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:54,813
getting kidnapped by a
screeching psychopath,

784
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,033
and helping to save the city.

785
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:57,981
I'd say that's pretty impressive

786
00:35:57,984 --> 00:36:00,319
for someone without a
meta other half to lean on.

787
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:01,954
Thanks.

788
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:03,589
You know, the thing I realized yesterday

789
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:07,326
is even though I can
live without Killer Frost,

790
00:36:07,328 --> 00:36:08,927
I don't think I want to.

791
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:10,829
Run some more tests, find out for sure.

792
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:13,231
- I already did.
- And?

793
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:14,866
I've been too afraid to find out.

794
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:16,802
Let's find out together.

795
00:36:20,774 --> 00:36:21,892
What does it say?

796
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:24,867
It says the reason dark matter

797
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,377
isn't registering in my body

798
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,313
is because there is none.

799
00:36:28,315 --> 00:36:30,716
So she's gone?

800
00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:33,352
It says there's still
another cryogenic anomaly

801
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:34,753
in my DNA.

802
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:36,922
Killer Frost is still a part of you.

803
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:39,891
I just have to figure out
how to get her to appear.

804
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,903
You going somewhere?

805
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:52,004
Yeah, matter of fact I'm
gonna go visit my daughter

806
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:55,307
while I'm still of somewhat sound mind.

807
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:57,476
It's not like I can help
you guys around here anyway.

808
00:36:57,478 --> 00:37:00,078
Cause that is the only
part of you that matters,

809
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,414
- that mind of yours.
- Exactly.

810
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,645
Is that why Jesse turned out so great?

811
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:07,686
Yep. No, I don't know.

812
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:09,788
What's your point?

813
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,657
Jesse Quick, superhero, scientist...

814
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:12,758
Yeah, I know who she is.

815
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,122
All around wonderful person,

816
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:16,927
she turned out that way because...

817
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,231
I don't know.

818
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:20,832
I think you do.

819
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,968
You told me you were about to lose

820
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,603
the only part of you that has value.

821
00:37:24,605 --> 00:37:26,198
Yeah. Yeah.

822
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:28,535
Raising Jesse?

823
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:32,010
Raising a kid that turns out like that.

824
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:35,013
That takes a lot more than intelligence.

825
00:37:35,015 --> 00:37:37,215
If you asked her, I'm
pretty sure she'd tell you

826
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:39,839
learning quadratic equations at age five

827
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,375
from her math-obsessed father

828
00:37:41,378 --> 00:37:43,988
wasn't nearly as important
to her as having a dad

829
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:46,892
who was there for her
and who gave a damn.

830
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:49,361
So, my point is...

831
00:37:49,363 --> 00:37:50,529
Well-taken.

832
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,966
So now what?

833
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:57,903
Sit around and wait until
I regress to a simpleton?

834
00:37:57,905 --> 00:37:59,504
Now we figure out a way to fix you.

835
00:37:59,506 --> 00:38:01,473
Just like you did when
Barry lost his speed.

836
00:38:01,475 --> 00:38:03,519
We find a way to...

837
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:05,105
jump start your brain.

838
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,474
But this is the hard part,

839
00:38:06,477 --> 00:38:08,646
'cause it's gonna take
all of us to do it,

840
00:38:08,649 --> 00:38:11,416
which means... you
have to tell the team.

841
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:13,487
I gotta tell the team.

842
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:20,158
Yeah, I know you're right, but...

843
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,127
maybe not today.

844
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:29,468
When you're ready.

845
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,644
- Ramon.
- Yeah?

846
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:39,577
Thank you.

847
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:48,753
I knew Ralph since...

848
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:52,457
I was a rookie on the force.

849
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:55,227
And all that time, I thought I knew

850
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:58,396
exactly what kind of person he was.

851
00:38:58,398 --> 00:38:59,831
Why is that?

852
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,500
We just never saw things

853
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:04,336
the same way, you know?

854
00:39:04,338 --> 00:39:08,774
I was raised to believe
that people are good.

855
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:10,208
And Ralph?

856
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,712
He always saw the worst in people,

857
00:39:13,714 --> 00:39:16,314
and he knew how to take advantage of it.

858
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:19,818
But, um... he changed.

859
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:25,980
He did. He changed, and...

860
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:28,493
I couldn't see that

861
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:30,996
for a long time.

862
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:33,465
And now that I can...

863
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:35,909
I think that's what's so hard is,

864
00:39:35,912 --> 00:39:37,412
you know, of course, I miss Ralph,

865
00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:40,055
but it just took me so long

866
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:43,141
to see what he'd become.

867
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:46,244
I just... I never had
a chance to tell him

868
00:39:46,246 --> 00:39:49,247
just how proud I am

869
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:51,149
to be his friend.

870
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:53,151
And I always will be.

871
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:56,702
I'm sure he knew that, Barry.

872
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:58,605
Yeah.

873
00:39:58,608 --> 00:40:00,525
What else would you tell him,

874
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:03,061
if you could right now?

875
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,167
That I feel responsible.

876
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:11,670
I feel responsible for what happened.

877
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:19,978
And he taught me more than
I could have ever taught him.

878
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,380
And for that, I'll always be grateful.

879
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:55,313
Allowing events to unfold naturally

880
00:40:55,315 --> 00:40:56,781
turned out in our favor.

881
00:40:56,783 --> 00:40:58,950
Just as you said it would.

882
00:40:58,952 --> 00:41:01,653
And success came our
way without the hindrance

883
00:41:01,655 --> 00:41:05,824
of that most aberrant
of human follies...

884
00:41:05,826 --> 00:41:09,120
Emotion.

885
00:41:09,123 --> 00:41:10,440
It did, indeed.

886
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:12,009
And to think, for a moment there,

887
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:15,080
I experienced doubt.

888
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:17,535
So perhaps now you can accept

889
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:20,011
that the primitive
cognitive entanglements

890
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:22,741
that derailed Mr. Allen today

891
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:25,310
can only serve to hold us back

892
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:28,079
from completing our work.

893
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:29,681
Yes.

894
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:33,141
I see that now.

895
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:39,624
More clear than ever before.

896
00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:43,835
