It still haunts me.

326
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:06,088
That day...

327
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:10,213
You were working at the plant that day.

328
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:14,588
You said you took the country lane home,

329
00:30:14,671 --> 00:30:16,588
but that's the long way.

330
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:21,630
Tell me why you wouldn't take
the forest road?

331
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,046
[faltering] He said...

332
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,796
he could change it.

333
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:33,421
That he could change everything,
the future and past.

334
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:35,588
Who told you that?

335

[shuddering] The man with the stone.

336
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,005
But that was 30 years ago.

337
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,755
What's this to do with Mads at all?

338
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:46,338
Nobody can change it. Nobody!

339
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,296
Not even the white devil!

340
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:51,921
The white devil?

341
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:56,380
You've talked about all this before.
You were just a child.

[weeping] Tick, tock.

[old Claudia]<i> I want you to believe
in an idea that is bigger than you,</i>

346
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,171
bigger than any of us.

347
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,713
What is that?

348
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:27,005
This is mankind's greatest discovery,

349
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:29,213
and also its doom.

350
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,338
It lets you travel through time.

351
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:35,796
Thirty-three years backwards.

352
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:39,213
Thirty-three years forwards.

353
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:44,380
And it will take exactly 33 years
till the cycle is complete again.

354
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:47,630
You will stand here
where I am standing.

355
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:50,963
And you will accept your part
in all of this,

356
00:31:52,046 --> 00:31:54,463
and what it means you'll be losing.

357
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,255
In five days everything starts over.

358
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:00,171
You must stop Adam.

359
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,421
Who is Adam?

360
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,921
You don't understand it yet.

361
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:12,755
But you will soon.

362
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:21,755
But until then everything will happen
the way it always has.

[high-pitched whir]

366
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,838
In the end, life is just
a collection of missed opportunities.

367
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:39,255
You don't have much time with Regina.

Are you okay?

381
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,046
Last year, when the kids went missing...

382
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:23,671
a man was at Regina's hotel.

383

They're from the book.

<i>But he knew that it was all true.</i>

00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:45,130
Why did he have that photo?

390
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,171
And why didn't he ever say
who my parents really were?

MISSING PERSON REPORT:
MADS NIELSEN

Listen, back in 1953, we arrested a man.

MADS NIELSEN CASE:
POLICE IN DARK

412
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:53,671
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AFTER 1953?

413
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:56,171
He killed two children
and kidnapped Helge Doppler.

414
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,088
NO RESULT

415

I was wondering,
what ever happened to the guy?

Yes, I'll wait.

IS THIS MAN A CHILD KILLER?

Okay, you have the file.

I'm here to speak with a patient.

That's what we call him here.
