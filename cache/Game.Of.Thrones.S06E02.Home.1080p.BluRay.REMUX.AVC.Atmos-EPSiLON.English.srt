They obviously had help.

332

killed them all by herself.

Her brother's at Castle Black.

Ned Stark's last surviving son?

Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

341

Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

342
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,068
And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

343
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:41,030
With a small force, we could storm the castle,
kill Jon Snow...

Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

345
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,577
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

346
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,539
We don't need every house in the North.

347

The Umbers, the Manderlys and the Karstarks

348
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:56,128
command more soldiers
than all the other houses combined.

349
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,341
With their support, none could challenge us.

(CHUCKLES)

491
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,750
You're old, brother.

492
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,919
You've had your time.

493
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,088
Now let another rule.

494
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,633
I heard you lost your mind

495
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,761
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

496
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:57,516
They tied you to the mast
to keep you from jumping overboard.

497
00:41:58,767 --> 00:41:59,935
They did.

498
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,271
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

499
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:06,400
I needed silence.

500
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,195
What kind of an ironborn

501
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,198
loses his senses during a storm?

502
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,119
I am the storm, brother.

503
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,247
The first storm and the last.

504
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:23,875
And you're in my way.

(PANTING)

508
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,751
Lord, take your servant Balon back
beneath the waves.

509
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,171
Feed the creatures of your kingdom
on his flesh.

510
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:14,843
Pull his bones down to your depths
to rest beside his ancestors and his children.

511

ALL: What is dead may never die.

512
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,356
YARA: I'm going to find out who did this.

513
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,444
I'm going to feed them to the sharks
while they live.

514
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,656
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

515
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,659
The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon,

516
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,953
not unless the Kingsmoot chooses you.

517
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,872
My father would have wanted me to rule.

518
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:47,000
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

519
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,463
Perhaps you'll win.

520
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:55,383
Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history
to rule the ironborn.

521
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,761
And perhaps not.

- Come in.
- (DOOR OPENS)

524
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,580
I'm sorry, my lady. Didn't mean to interrupt.

525
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,375
You interrupt nothing.

526
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:43,223
I assume you know why I'm here.

527
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:46,142
I will after you tell me.

528
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:48,478
It's about the Lord Commander.

529
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,605
The former Lord Commander.

530
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:53,733
Does he have to be?

531
00:44:57,696 --> 00:44:59,155
What are you asking?

532
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:07,247
Do you know of any magic

533
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,166
that could help him?

534
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:12,127
Bring him back?

535
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,713
If you want to help him, leave him be.

536
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,131
Can it be done?

537
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,718
There are some with this power.

538
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:20,844
How?

539
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,345
(SOFTLY) I don't know.

540
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,430
Have you seen it done?

541
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,269
I met a man who came back from the dead,

542
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,146
but the priest who did it...

543
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,399
It shouldn't have been possible.

544
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,652
But it was. It could be now.

545
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:40,030
Not for me.

546
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:45,994
Not for you?

547
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,710
I saw you drink poison
that should have killed you.

548
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,922
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

549
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:58,924
Everything I believed,

550
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:03,094
the great victory I saw in the flames...

551
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,846
(SHAKILY) All of it was a lie.

552
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,144
You were right all along.

553
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,813
The Lord never spoke to me.

554
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,941
Fuck him, then.

555
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:17,359
Fuck all of them.

556
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:22,614
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

557
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:26,868
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

558
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,624
I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.

559
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,253
I'm asking the woman
who showed me that miracles exist.

560
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:41,508
I never had this gift.

561
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,301
Have you ever tried?
