00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:21,147
(David in Spanish)
Careful. You already lost one.

2
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,527
Good.

3
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,989
- Faster, gentlemen, please.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,036
How's it coming?

5
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,704
This is fucking cool.

6
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,123
- What did I tell you, motherfucker?
- (Laughs)

7
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,502
Stop fucking around.

8
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,671
I don't want to be here all night.
Understood?

9
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:46,881
Yes, it's all good.

10
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,632
Let's go.

11
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,303
Fucking idiot.

12
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,683
My dad had 20 years in this shit.
I only have six months.

13
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,145
Pedal to the metal then, bitch.

14
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,443
How many of these things
do we have to empty?

15
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,154
(David) How much fucking money
do you want to make?

16
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,614
(Dario) A fucking lot.

17
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,366

'In its prime, the Cali cartel

20
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,427
'was moving 30 tons of coke
a month into America...

21

'...most of it
through their New York operation

'and an alliance with Mexican traffickers
out of Juárez

23

'that brought tons of product

'That means that
in an average six-month period,

25
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,524

there were no loose ends.'

- (Knock on door)

31
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,505
Mrs. Salazar, housekeeping.

32
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,549
- Come back later, please.
- As you wish.

33
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,029
If you want something done right...

34
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,866
...you have to do it yourself.

35
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,202
Just like in life, Don Gilberto.

36
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,163
If you don't play,
you're going to watch others score.

37
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,879
My organisation has four partners,
but only one leader.

38
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,924
I wanted to meet with you

39
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,928
to make sure there are
no misunderstandings in the North Valley

40
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,891
regarding the restructuring
and the necessary house cleaning.

41
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:14,523
No, we were simply curious
about Claudio Salazar's absence.

42
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,819
I will be honest with you.
Salazar never contributed a thing.

43
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,948
He never gave anyone work.
He made more noise than money.

44
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,743
Better said, too much noise.

45
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,792
We are moving forward with the plan,

46
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,963
and we would like to know
if our friends are in agreement.

47
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,384
Your message about the surrender
was very clear

48
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,888
and was very well received
by all of us in the North Valley.

49
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,058
Have a safe trip home.

50
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,853
Henao... thank you for your friendship.

51
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,522
Excuse me.

52
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,276
Pacho.

53
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,908
Pacho.

54
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,411
Let's take advantage of this window
to maximise our profits.

55
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,164
I'd like to double our output
through Mexico.

56
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,586
Why don't you go there?
Meet with Carrillo Fuentes. He likes you.

57
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,297
Make one last deal.

58
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:26,095
We both know that isn't the only reason
you're sending me there.

59
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,806
Pacho.

60
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,475
Look, Pacho...

61
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,021
I think it would be best
if you left Cali for a bit,

62
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,941
while things cool off.

63
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:46,240
Remember, Pacho, we're going
to walk away from this happy and rich.

64
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,577
(Peña) 'Like I said,
they were going for it.

65

'Jack shit.'

68
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,715
(Vargas) I don't want
to rub your noses in that, gentlemen.

69
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,136
My concern is that your men in Cali

70
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:11,682
didn't so much as contact
my senior officer there.

71
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:17,563
We've agreed that we can't have
those kinds of unilateral operations.

72
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:22,192
Our laws, our rules, will be respected.

73
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,610
Of course, General.

74
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,780
We apologise for the misunderstanding.

75
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,907
Won't happen again.

76
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:34,163
Well, I'm sorry, but I will need more
than your assurances.

77
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,798
Colonel.

78
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,386
Agent Peña.

79
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,306
- How's your son?
- Oh, he's fine.

80
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,809
He got transferred to technical services.
Better fit for him.

81
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,565
Maybe I should join him.
Not a lot of police work these days.

82
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,194
Yeah.
What did you expect?

83
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,573
When you sell your soul to the devil,
you're not allowed to ask for it back.

84
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,831
The men who let loose Los Pepes
on Colombia should have been arrested.

85
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,459
Instead, they got promoted.

86
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,794
(Lift beeps)

87
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,049
Excuse me.

88
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,104
There he is.
Javi Peña,<i>el jefe.</i>

89
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,400
Never thought I'd see the day,
but I'm sure as shit glad to see you now.

90
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,778
- Duff, it's been a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,531
- Lopez.
- Hey.

92
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,324
I still can't believe
you two were in the same class.

93
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,201
It's a miracle this place
is still standing, huh?

94
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,911
(All chuckle)

95
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,208
Some bullshit, huh, Javi?

96
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,339
Come on. Is this where you go
all "Bad Lieutenant" on us?

97
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,715
Like you and Murphy were never made?

98
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,427
Yeah. You guys are famous.

99
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,562
Sometimes you get them,
sometimes they get you, huh?

100
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,772
Next time, we get them.

101
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,985
There isn't gonna be a next time.
They're rotating you home.

102
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,446
The Colombians are pulling your visa.
You're outta here tonight.

103
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,118
Come on.
Who's running things here, man?

104
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,330
They are.

105
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,628
Well, thanks for getting our back, sir.

106
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,687
(In Spanish) Wouldn't you have liked
to be born in this era? Take a look.

107
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,690
- Just like the Cauca River, right?
- Identical.

108
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,403
Dad, where are we
with the government?

109
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,035
They won't let us use the drug stores
as collateral for the Centenario property

110
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,329
until they're cleared through surrender.

111
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,581
I know, but eventually they will be.

112
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,837
And that's all you can tell me?

113
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,883
You know the rule.

114
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,510
You can't be a part of this.

115
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,430
I didn't send you to law school
so you could worry about our surrender.

116
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,474
That's already been planned.

117
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,560
I sent you to take advantage
of what happens after it's done,

118
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,897
when our family is a leader
in the business community.

119
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,652
- You're reading it again?
- (Phone rings)

120
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,155
You should read it once in a while.
Wise words.

121
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,449
Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt.

122
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,118
You have a call
from our friend in the capital.

123
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,462
Hello?

124
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,799
(Reporter) 'Four people,
including three children,

131
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,830
Silvio! Can I bum a smoke?

132
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,839
Isn't it dangerous?

133
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,800
No more than it ever was.

134
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,972
If it was a natural gas leak,
I want to know before lighting up.

135
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,851
Unless it's not.

136
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,688
I think you should talk
to the captain, Carolina.

137
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,898
He doesn't have the balls to talk to me.

138
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:18,405
Silvio, help me out. You have kids.
Off the record.

139
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,658
I don't know, Carolina.

140
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,494
Why don't you talk to him?

141
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,788
He is the district safety inspector.

142
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,875
He'll issue the report.
Why don't you ask him for a comment?

143
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,298
- (Man) Silvio!
- Excuse me.

144
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,720
(Man) Careful picking it up.
Lift it up. Careful. Grab the other side.

145
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,727
That's good. A little bit more.

146
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,610
If they connect us to this, our friend
doubts the government will honour our deal.

147
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:01,531
We'll be seen as no different from
Escobar, killing women and children.

148
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,494
Months of negotiations and money
down the drain.

149
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,205
Just like the poison
you monkeys dumped.

150
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,417
There's a reporter asking questions
in Yumbo.

151
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,295
And there's this safety inspector
in charge of the investigation.

152
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,341
I wouldn't worry about the reporter.
We have lots of reporters.

153
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,135
But a government investigator!
If the motherfucker goes...

154
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,679
Dad, let me take care of it.
I said I would handle it.

155
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,849
You've demonstrated very clearly
that you can't handle it.

156
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,686
Take care of it. Discreetly.

157
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,648
Without any violence.
That's the last thing we need.

158
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,318
What? You have another bright idea?

159
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,288
That's why I didn't want our children
in the business.

160
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,292
We made a mistake, Gilberto.

161
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,756
(Woman) Let go. Turn. Run.

162
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,385
You need to let out some string.
Careful with Grandma.

163
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,928
You see?

164
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,430
Mm-hmm.

165
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,683
- This is the bedroom.
- Uh-huh.

166
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:10,892
No, sorry, Dad.

167
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,187
- No, this is the living room.
- The living room.

168
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,273
It's big, Jorge.

169
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,609
And the pool will go here.

170
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,654
- And there, the kitchen.
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,990
And look...

172
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,286
Right in front there,
I'm putting in a jacuzzi.

173
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,620
A jacuzzi?

174
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,746
(Chuckles)

175
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,168
I always thought
your brother would have...

176
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,046
...the house on the hill.

177
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,802
You were just always lost
in your engineering ideas.

178
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,015
What was the last one?

179
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,558
Bio-diesel.

180
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,603
Bio-diesel.

181
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,064
Vegetable gas?

182
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,317
Yes, that's right. Well, conversion.

183
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,319
Well...

184
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,864
Very good.

185
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,326
Better late than never.

186
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,871
I'm glad you like it, Dad.

187
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,707
- Thank you.
- Jorge, the girls are calling you.

188
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,959
Yes, I'm coming.
Paola.

189
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,464
You'll be very happy
when you build the house here.

190
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,675
- It's all very nice.
- (Paola) Affirmative, General.

191
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,061
You impressed him.

192
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,397
I don't care what he thinks.

193
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,401
That's why you haven't told him
who you work for?

194
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,030
It was always temporary.

195
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,573
Temporary?

196
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,617
Right.

197
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,412
You know this lot is bigger
than we need.

198
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,331
Yes, but it's the one we want.

199
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,418
It's the one you deserve.

200
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,256
Six more months.

201
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,011
Okay? I promise.

202
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,681
(Beeping)

203
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,772
Go.

204
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,067
- I'll go with your parents.
- I'm sorry, honey.

205
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,567
- (Gilberto) 'Hello?'
- It's me.

206
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,693
'Chepe!'

207
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,280
- How's everything going, brother?
- 'All right.'

208
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,867
We're about to beat
our profit record, brother.

209
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,037
Good. Keep me posted.

210
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,373
'You should be happy, Gilberto.'

211
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,834
'Chepe, do me a favour.'

212
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,088
Keep a low profile. At least for now.

213
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,634
I got a lot of stuff going on up here
at the moment.

214
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,597
I just need more ether
to reach the numbers we talked about.

215
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,099
'Why? Is everything all right?
You sound weird.'

216
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,977
I'm dealing with a problem
that is stressing me out.

217
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,229
It's our fault.

218
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,482
Actually, it's David's, the dumbass.

219
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,485
- 'Is it bad?'
- I hope not.

220
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,237
'But it could complicate our surrender.'

221
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,908
Okay. I'll be careful.

222
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,411
So good you're coming back, brother.

223
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,539
You'll leave behind the hustle
and shit of that city.

224
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,957
'It's not so bad.'

225
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,419
I love the trees in fall.

226
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,297
The park looks gorgeous.

227
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,884
'I love you, brother. Talk soon.'

228
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,010
Okay.

229
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,939
Miss, the valet says
the car hasn't returned.

230
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,441
- I see. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

231
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,152
- María.
- Luisa.

232
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,072
What's happening?
Claudio hasn't returned?

233
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,116
No. And Diego?

234
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,078
Diego dragged his drunk ass in
at six in the morning.

235
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,746
Okay.

236
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,997
- Bye.
- Bye.

237
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,632
Spell that for me.

238
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,387
What the fuck are you doing?

239
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,140
- Prime real estate opened up.
- You vulture.

240
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,183
You know, Lopez is probably
still at the airport.

241
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,476
Yeah.

242
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,437
Got it.

243
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,233
Thanks. We'll run these down.
And Eddie, hey, congrats again.

244
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,654
- Eddie?
- Yeah, Kacerosky.

245
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,948
Cornerstone's his.
Good haul on Cali.

246
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,076
He's got addresses, numbers,
a couple of names.

247
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,538
Now you and your badass sunglasses
and hockey hair

248
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,832
want to go ring some doorbells?

249
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,294
Cali's the front line, Dan.

250
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,963
More like the express lane home.

251
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,508
I got a soon-to-be ex waiting
to serve me the second I get back.

252
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,595
Well, I didn't transfer to Colombia
to file wire reports

253
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,972
and drink stale Bud at Mr. Ribs.

254
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,852
I'm moving you to Duffy's desk
while you're gone. I feel alone up here.

255
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,604
Okay, knock yourself out.

256
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,193
- You got a minute, sir?
- Yeah.

257
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,531
Wanted to talk to you about all this intel
coming out of Miami with Cornerstone.

258
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,744
Paper trail from the warehouse
they busted threw up some flags.

259
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,372
- What's this?
- It's a shitty diagram.

260
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,500
But there's five or six companies
that show repeatedly.

261
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,711
Now, my buddy in Customs
did some digging.

262
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,131
They're all owned by Cali or are
the address of record for shell companies.

263
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,508
They're moving Swiss francs
from Liechtenstein,

264
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,386
bearer bonds from Luxembourg,
but even they leave tracks.

265
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,430
- What's your name?
- Feistl.

266
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,932
Chris Feistl.

267
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,559
Feistl, what are you asking me?

268
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,478
Send me to Cali, sir.

269
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,814
You know, I want it, sir.

270
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:37,362
I mean, these companies,
this is the cartel's financial brainstem.

271
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,448
It's overstating it a little bit,
wouldn't you say?

272
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,952
It's a start.

273
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,829
We're not sending any personnel
to Cali at the moment.

274
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,832
I don't understand.
Who's the new Cali team?

275
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,253
- For now, there isn't one.
- There... Sir?

276
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,674
We have arrest warrants for Gilberto
and Miguel Rodríguez, Pacho Herrera...

277
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,009
I'm aware who runs the Cali cartel.

278
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,512
Is there anything else, Agent Feistl?

279
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,474
No, sir. That's... I'm good.

280
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,017
Good.

281
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,855
Nice office, by the way.

282
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,236
Thanks.

283
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,293
(In Spanish) I got your message.
What's going on?

284
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,921
We have a problem
with the fucking safety inspector.

285
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,715
He won't accept the money?

286
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,260
He has three crucifixes in his office.
Three.

287
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,763
- Reasoning with him is impossible.
- I see.

288
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,978
Tell me, what the hell was David doing
with the chlorine gas?

289
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,272
Do you really want to know?

290
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,902
About a year ago, Don Miguel and
Don Gilberto bought a fungicide lab.

291
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:06,326
The idea was to replace the gas
with cocaine and send it to the U.S.

292
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,664
They don't check it at Customs
because it's a poisonous gas.

293
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:18,463
So that's why David spilled
the gas in Yumbo?

294
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,012
We should let him clean up
his own mess.

295
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,432
That's not going to happen, Jorge.

296
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:35,063
If the fucking inspector doesn't say
what we need him to say, we're all fucked.

297
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,106
Do you think they're going
to honour the pact?

298
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,192
Do you think there's really
going to be a surrender

299
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:43,279
between the cartel and the government
if what happened in Yumbo goes public?

300
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,822
Never.

301
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,285
What do we know
about the safety inspector?

302
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:55,083
Here's everything. We have phone numbers,
his home and office addresses,

303
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,170
bank accounts, income tax, properties.

304
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,173
And the only thing we're sure about?

305
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,343
This motherfucker is clean.

306
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,851
There's no one clean in this world,
Córdova. No one.

307
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,398
Find something on him, then. Quickly.

308
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,859
(Salcedo) Gentlemen!

309
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:26,239
We're going to put all our assets
on this man.

310
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:33,246
'We have to watch his wife, his kids,
even his fucking dog.'

311
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,333
We need to watch his house,
from the inside and out,

312
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,711
every single corner, 24/7.

313
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:47,051
I want to know what he does at work,
who he meets and where.

314
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,429
'I want to know his agenda.'

315
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,891
Whatever he does,
we're going to find out.

316
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,478
'We will be in charge of his fucking life!'

317
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,066
And, of course,
we have to tap all his phones.

318
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,570
At home, at the office,
and his cell phone.

319
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,530
- Do you understand?
- (All) Yes, sir!

320
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:15,371
Come to my house this Saturday
after soccer.

321
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,498
My dad gave me permission.

322
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,335
- 'Awesome, I'll see you there.'
- 'Cool, bye.'

323
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,464
(Woman) 'End of call.

324
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,389
'Recording number two. 2:16pm.'

325
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,267
Yes, the company is registered

326
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,353
under one of the Rodríguez's
fake companies.

327
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:43,941
(Woman)
'Recording number three. 4:32pm.'

328
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,696
I want to suck your dick.
Tomorrow.

329
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,698
At the same place.

330
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:54,744
(Phone rings)

331
00:24:58,748 --> 00:24:59,874
Hello?

332
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,251
(María) 'Ma'am,
I'm so sorry to bother you.'

333
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,213
It's María. Is Claudio there?

334
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,966
No. Isn't he with you?

335
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,552
No. He didn't come home last night.

336
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,471
'I'm worried.'

337
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,350
Hmm... You're fighting again.

338
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,186
'You're the reason
he seeks pleasure elsewhere.'

339
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,729
Nobody's seen him.

340
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:28,861
No one's seen him?
What did you do, María?

341
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,738
- No...
- I'm sending the boys.

342
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,617
No, that's not necessary.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

343
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,380
(Clerk) Mrs. Salazar,
will you be checking out today?

344
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,076
Hello, sir.

345
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,454
They're always in room 105.

346
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,206
Very good, thank you.

347
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,449
(Woman laughs)

348
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,414
(Woman moaning)

349
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,091
What a woman.

350
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:01,555
- This was well done.
- (Salcedo) Thank you, sir.

351
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,351
The inspector has a press conference
scheduled this afternoon.

352
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:12,316
Someone needs to talk to him.
Finish the job.

353
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:16,112
Don Gilberto, he knows me.
They won't let me in.

354
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,698
Jorge...

355
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,785
Jorge... you should handle it.

356
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,288
You've done such great work.
Great work so far.

357
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,959
And no one knows who he is.

358
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:37,299
I appreciate that.
But I only gather information.

359
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,971
Sir, the truth is,
I'm a man of... few words.

360
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:50,062
Look, Jorge, sometimes even the largest
companies depend on a small outcome

361
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,772
to determine their future.

362
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:59,029
Like the success of one operation
or an employee who is discreet and loyal.

363
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,533
This is the final stretch.

364
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:06,871
We all have to do our part.
Understood?

365
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,205
Yes, sir.

366
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:18,674
(Peña) 'The Cali cartel came
to New York for the cocaine market.

367
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,801
'It's the largest in the world.

368
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,347
'But they stayed for the ether.
You can't make coke without ether.

369
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:29,101
'And while export restrictions had made it
hard to come by in Colombia,

370
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,812
'it flowed freely in the States.

371
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,232
'But maybe not as freely
as the godfathers would've liked.'

372
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,570
(In Spanish) Was there a problem
with your last order?

373
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,322
No. No problems.

374
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,700
I need to add another 300 barrels
to my next order.

375
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:49,455
300 barrels?
Mr. Crespo, that's nearly double.

376
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,665
I can't do it.

377
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,751
How come?

378
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:57,588
There's a new buyer. Their orders
are getting bigger and bigger.

379
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,258
We're already stretched very thin.

380
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,428
I've been your most important client
for years.

381
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,723
I understand, but you told me
you were leaving the business.

382
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,060
- However, this other organisation...
- Isn't.

383
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,562
I'm sorry.

384
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,273
So who are they?

385
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:21,278
- They're kids.
- Hmm.

386
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,572
Dominicans.

387
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,951
Running out of some beauty parlour
in Queens.

388
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,703
I see.

389
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,957
They'll probably end up dead
or locked up.

390
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,794
You know, it's a young man's world.

391
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:41,131
We all have to make way
for the next generation.

392
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:47,638
This beauty parlour in Queens,
give me the address.

393
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,642
- But...
- (Chuckles)

394
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,749
Can I get one of those?

395
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,091
Quit four months ago.

396
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,511
Looks like it's going well.

397
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,981
Carolina Alvarez, "El Tiempo".

398
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:50,451
So... what conclusions
should be drawn from the fact

399
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:55,247
that the new DEA attaché has
this intimate history with Los Pepes?

400
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:59,710
And does the fact that the Los Pepes death
squad being financed by the Cali cartel

401
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,546
explain why no one seems
to be interested

402
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,674
in going after Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela
and his partners?

403
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,802
You can call the press office
if you want a comment, Miss Alvarez.

404
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,971
Carolina, please.

405
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,808
Have a nice day.

406
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,394
Have you heard much
about the Cali accident?

407
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,396
Four more people dead.

408
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,650
Children.
Dozens more sick.

409
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,906
An empty chlorine gas canister
was found nearby.

410
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,534
And there's a rumour its manufacturer
is linked to a front company

411
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,703
operated by the Cali cartel.

412
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,749
Looks like you said, it was an accident.

413
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,210
By the end of the day, it will be.

414
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,545
No matter what the truth is.

415
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,842
(In Spanish) Thanks for the cigarette.

416
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,559
Transportation came out
to $5 million each.

417
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,105
You can see here that
the product loss was very little.

418
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,607
And the bribes?

419
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,235
Well, the payoffs...

420
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,988
...they went up this week.

421
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,450
Went up this week to six million, sir.

422
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,288
- Guillermo.
- Yes, sir?

423
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:24,503
What happens in six months
when these people stop receiving money?

424
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,344
No more friends.

425
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:35,764
This is everything, right?

426
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,934
This is everything
down to the last penny, sir.

427
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:43,313
And we have here coded pages
for all the politicians,

428
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,358
the senators, congressmen,
all the cops.

429
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:50,529
- I want an exact copy of this book.
- Yes, sir.

430
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,699
It's our insurance
if they try to fuck us afterward.

431
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,037
You think someone would dare
do something to you?

432
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:02,708
(Scoffs) Anything can happen.
If you're a pussy, they fuck you.

433
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,215
Any news about Salazar's wife?

434
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,510
Yes, Don Miguel.

435
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,263
The bitch has been asking
about Claudio everywhere.

436
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,561
You want me to handle it?

437
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:06,063
(Inspector) 'I understand you have
information on the Yumbo incident.'

438
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,274
- Yes, I do.
- Good. Tell me.

439
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,803
Your wife.
At the Palace Motel at 3:45pm.

440
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:42,015
After she dropped the kids off
at soccer practice.

441
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,731
So?

442
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,611
At your press conference
this afternoon,

443
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:59,116
you will announce that the gas leak
was a municipal accident.

444
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,578
We have video and audio as well.

445
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:07,624
Look, you bought-off monkey,

446
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,794
take these pictures
and go fuck yourself.

447
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,214
At the press conference this afternoon,
I'm going to tell the truth,

448
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,758
so that the world will know
what you people do.

449
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,262
And don't worry about my wife.
I already knew.

450
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:24,141
Sometimes we make compromises
to keep a happy home.

451
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,856
I can appreciate you wanting
to take the high road.

452
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,985
However, you're not understanding me.

453
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,740
The men that I work for don't care
about your relationship with your wife.

454
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,784
They care what your children
might think,

455
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,621
what their classmates might think.

456
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:49,041
And your distinguished family.

457
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,212
Think of what they would say
at your church.

458
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,965
If you don't do what I tell you,

459
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:01,428
the men I work for will make sure

460
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,849
that the whole world
will have a copy of this tape.

461
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,274
(María) Thank you.

462
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,739
(Navegante) Mrs. Salazar.

463
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,907
So you've never had
a relaxation treatment before?

464
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,159
I've never heard of it.

465
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,246
Relaxation treatment?

466
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,540
That sounds nice.

467
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,377
You have a funny accent.

468
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,005
- Where are you from?
- Colombia.

469
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,050
- Colombian.
- This guy is Colombian, too.

00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,929
- Check it out. Both.
- Really?

471
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,864
And I suppose that guy at the door
is also Colombian?

472
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,743
What a small world, right?

473
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,374
All right. What do you want?

474
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,546
I want you to go through that door.

475
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,674
The one with the English writing
I don't understand.

476
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,511
Tell the men back there
that Chepe Santacruz-Londoño

477
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:11,767
is getting a relaxation treatment
and would like to speak with them.

478
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,020
Go.

479
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,443
You stay.

480
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,246
Cool.

(♪ "Diez años" playing)

482
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,864
- Please, take a seat.
- It's better if I stand.

483
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:55,120
- A drink?
- No. Thank you.

484
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,624
I'm sorry for the way
you were brought here.

485
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,255
I understand you have a question.

486
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:09,259
I've spent all day
asking about my husband.

487
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,637
- And you think I know the truth?
- Yes.

488
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,474
And I don't think
you are afraid to tell me.

489
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:20,770
- And if I don't tell you?
- Then I was wrong. And you are a coward.

490
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,782
Your husband is dead.
He was killed by an associate of mine.

491
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,203
For a personal injury he caused.

492
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,837
This market, we made it ourselves.

493
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:13,174
It's ours.
We can't just give it up to you.

494
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,344
You haven't heard my proposal yet.

495
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:18,930
Say what you got to say.

496
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:24,436
The first thing you're going to do
is vacate this place immediately,

497
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,396
and never come back.

498
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,191
Oh, yeah?
And the second? What?

499
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,776
Second...

500
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,323
There is no second.
Just the first thing.

501
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,951
(Laughing)

502
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:44,080
- So you think this is a joke?
- Gentlemen.

503
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:49,878
Part of being an adult is accepting things
that you wish weren't true.

504
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,924
Recently, I have had to accept
some things that I don't like.

505
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,304
I advise you to do the same.

506
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:07,812
Look, you and your fucking hair
have ten seconds to get out of here.

507
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,691
- Ten.
- Nine.

508
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:14,944
- Nine.
- Eight.

509

You think this is funny,

Seven.

511
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,997
- Seven.
- Six.

512
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,711
- Six.
- Five.

513
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,588
- Four.
- Four.

514

as high as he could,

You too.

524
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:02,927
Very good.

525
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,308
- Did the girls go to sleep?
- Yes.

526
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,809
How's the book?
