500
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:35,499
I isolated a sample
of Black's blood from your suit...

501
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:38,336
...to see if I could trigger
the in vitro cultivation process...

502
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:40,046
...and learn how Black multiplies.

503
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:45,217
So I exposed the target cells to a protein gel
and they began replicating into that.

functions are active. Little else.

-We think it's acting as a receiver.
-The clones are an empty shell without Black.

Shut down the real Black
and you might shut them all down.

How do we know which one's Black?

509

That occurred to me
given your passing out.

510
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:08,406
Black has limits, just like you.
Controlling all of those clones must require...

...a tremendous amount of physical strength.

512

of weakness or fatigue. He's the prime.
