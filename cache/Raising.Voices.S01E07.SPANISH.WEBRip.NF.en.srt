<i>How to hunt down a sexual predator.</i>

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,760
APRIL

9
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,160
At 5:00 a.m., Galán attacks the city
with a group of soldiers,

10
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,600
and in under three hours,
Jaca is under his control,

11
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,080
and they head for the next city.

12
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Whoever can name the city,

13
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,320
I'll raise you half a point in the exam.

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,520
Huesca.

15
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,640
Exactly.

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,000
The insurgents head for Huesca,

17
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,320
starving, with a handful of old trucks
and freezing cold, because...

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,120
I don't know if you've ever been
in Huesca in December.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
It's goddamn freezing.

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,040
So it wasn't easy for them.

21
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,480
In fact, that morning at dawn,

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,600
government troops
stopped the insurrection,

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
arrested Galán and his right hand...

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,480
García Hernández.

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,680
Can you imagine what happened to them?

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,960
-They killed them.
-That's right. A firing squad.

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,160
So, in the end, it was all for nothing.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Well,

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,960
I don't know if we can be so categorical.

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,080
I don't know.

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,400
What do you think?

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,800
It led to something.

33
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,040
A few months later, the king had to leave.

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
Someone's done their homework.

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,680
In short, history is what it is
because things happened.

36
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,800
I mean, it all serves a purpose.

37
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,640
Right?

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,520
One person can achieve many things.

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,680
And history is full of examples.

40
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,840
WHO WERE THE GIRLS
WHO REPORTED THEIR RAPISTS?

WHY???

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,560
FOR A SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT.
GOTTA GO. UP TO MY EYES

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,720
{\an8}<i>Daisy Coleman went to a party
organized by a schoolmate.</i>

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
<i>She was raped there.</i>

50
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,120
<i>Daisy reported her attacker,</i>

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,520
<i>but in a matter of days,
she went from victim to whore.</i>

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,080
<i>They threatened her on social media
and spread details of her private life.</i>

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,520
<i>They set fire to her home.</i>

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,360
<i>She had to leave her hometown.</i>

55
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,680
<i>Daisy fought all her life
against rape culture,</i>

56
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,880
<i>against a depression
she couldn't overcome.</i>

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,720
<i>She committed suicide at 23.</i>

HOW TO HUNT DOWN
A SEXUAL PREDATOR

59
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,280
I'm sure that pig is abusing other girls.

60
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,440
And he'll go on.

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,120
No, Alma, I said no.

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,440
I want to die just thinking about it.

63
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,400
Don't worry, I wasn't thinking about that.

64
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
I can do it for you.

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,120
What?

66
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,320
I can set up a fake profile on Instagram

67
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,760
of a junior high school student
abused by her history teacher.

68
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,800
What for?

69
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,080
Some girl may identify with your story.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,080
And with a bit of luck,
someone will recognize and report him.

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
I know it's a long shot,
but we have to try, right?

72
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,640
And the photos?

73
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,200
Of me.

74
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,160
Right, like that.

75
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,320
<i>It'll be me,
but unrecognizable, obviously.</i>

76
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,720
-This one, right?
-Yeah.

77
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,440
What name do we put?

78
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,120
Iam_colemanmiller.

79
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,280
The names of two rape survivors
who reported it,

80
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,560
but they were ignored.

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,920
Why are you getting mixed up in this?

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,480
Because I owe you.

83
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,200
And I don't want any girl
to feel the way I made you feel.

84
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Alone.

85
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,000
How long
have you been thinking about this?

86
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,080
I'll post something.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
<i>This is me</i>

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
<i>before I was raped.</i>

89
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,200
Perfect.

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,080
Nata, concentrate.

91
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,760
You'll regret it later.

92
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,360
{\an8}YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT
UNTIL YOU LOSE IT

93
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,560
{\an8}WHEN LOVE IS GONE, ONLY TEARS REMAIN

94
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,960
NATA: WHAT ARE YOU UP TO???

95
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,640
NOTHING, GIRL... BLACK HOLE... SHIT...

96
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,120
NATA: ME TOO... SEE YOU IN BABEL???

97
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,080
YOU'RE NOT GROUNDED ANYMORE???

98
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,560
NATA: NOT AS MUCH...
COME ON, PRETTY PLEASE!

99
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll call you later, okay?

100
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
Maybe I won't pick up.

101
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,240
You know I get lost easily.

102
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,720
And you know I'll always find you.

103
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,240
Ciao.

104
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,280
Be careful, okay?

105
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
You too.

106
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,760
-What's up?
-How are you?

107
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,760
-That was David, right?
-Yes.

108
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,640
You're so lucky, bitch.

109
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,280
-What are you doing here?
-Celebrating. It's payday.

110
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,280
We've sold it all, guys.

111
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,160
Look at this cool scar. I want one.

112
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,520
Throw yourself under the bus,
see if you get one.

113
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,160
-You idiot!
-Come on.

114
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,840
Do you want a bit of magic?

115
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,840
No.

116
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,800
My parents are being a drag
about the tests,

117
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
and I don't want to screw up.

118
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,400
-What happened with your thing?
-Not much. Personal use.

119
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,560
Small fine and out.

120
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,480
Exactly.

121
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,360
-Know anything about Kevin and Jota?
-Sure do, girl.

122
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,480
We know you needn't worry
about them anymore.

123
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,920
Someone anonymous called the cops
when they had a huge shipment at home.

124
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,440
Sure, "someone anonymous."

125
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,360
And with their priors,
they weren't let out.

126
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
So, no bail, no nothing.

127
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,600
-Fuck them.
-In the slammer.

128
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,720
Fuck them. They're assholes.

129
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,880
-Yeah, they were.
-I'm going in. It's chilly.

130
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,680
-Okay, sorry. Catch you later.
-Go on.

131
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,160
-See you.
-Hey, pass it.

132
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,480
-I rolled it.
-It's my turn.

133
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,720
Look at her! Look at that smile.
Now she has a boyfriend.

134
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,280
No, David isn't my boyfriend.

135
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,880
-Really?
-We've been out three times, that's it.

136
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,400
But have you fucked him yet?

137
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,200
No, we've just kissed and that.

138
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,560
She's waiting

139
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,120
for the northern lights...

140
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,560
and violins in the background.

141
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,720
-You two are hilarious.
-Totally.

142
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,960
Dammit, for once I get it on
instead of you two.

143
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,040
-Don't push it.
-Fuck you.

144
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,760
By the way,

145
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,480
I saw Alberto and his buddies
messing around

146
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,360
because they'd won some shit.

147
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,240
Yes, I saw it too.

148
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,920
-Where?
-Excuse me?

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,960
On Instagram.

150
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,160
-Dammit, Nata.
-You still follow him on Instagram?

151
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,760
-Get off my case.
-Unbelievable.

152
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,720
Shut up. I bet you still follow
that old bat.

153
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,800
No. No way.

154
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,160
She doesn't know what Instagram is.

155
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,720
Jeez, you're hilarious too, huh?

156
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,840
Yeah.

157
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,720
Alberto's history, okay?

158
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
I believe you, sister.

159
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,680
Hi, Mom.

160
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,600
Honey, what are you doing home so soon?

161
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,560
-Is something wrong?
-No.

162
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,480
You had a fight with Alberto.

163
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,280
Alberto and I broke up.

164
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,880
-I broke it off.
-I thought so.

165
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,400
You seemed down lately,
and not about being grounded.

166
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,360
What did he do? Tell me.

167
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,960
-Mom, don't be a drag.
-What? Tell me about the drama.

168
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,880
Go on, come here.

169
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can tell me anything.

170
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,040
I won't judge you.

171
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,760
-He got mixed up with another girl, right?
-No, Mom, that's not it.

172
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,080
We just haven't been right for some time.

173
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,560
Nata, honey, men are a bit simple.

174
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,440
Sometimes it's better
to ignore some nonsense

175
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,840
to keep the whole package.

176
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,840
-Nata, will you listen to me, dammit?
-Hey!

177
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know what you're getting at.

178
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,880
You seem so glum lately.

179
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,520
If it's another girl,
use it in your favor.

180
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,800
You can get things you didn't have before.

181
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,600
Alberto looks like the kind of boy
who'd give you those things.

182
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Do you understand me?

183
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,720
A girl shouldn't give up
what took her so much to get

184
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,360
because of her partner's mistake.

185
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
Mistakes are forgotten.

186
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,800
Even cheating.

187
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,880
Did Dad cheat on you?

188
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,320
What? No.

189
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,840
-It's as if you were talking about Dad.
-Nata.

190
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,400
Why would I talk about Dad?

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,280
What I'm trying to say is

192
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,000
that as a woman,
you'll have to give in to certain things.

193
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,160
Life's like that, and men are like that.

194
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,000
And it's much smarter
to chalk it up and forget

195
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,520
than throw it all overboard.

196
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,520
Listen to me.

197
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,600
Learn it.

198
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,080
POSTING

201

207
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,760
Hey.

208
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,440
We have almost 4,000 followers.

209
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,600
It's not enough.

210
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,760
We need more.

211
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,480
Take it easy.

212
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,880
It sickens me to see him so chill.

213
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,280
We need more hardcore posts.

214
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,960
Talking about this isn't easy.

215
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,680
I know what I'm talking about.

216
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,520
Let's keep going, see what happens.

217
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,520
And just with the posts,
we're helping lots of people.

218
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,640
Have you read the comments?

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,960
I'm glad you convinced me to do it,

220
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,880
Coleman Miller.

221
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,160
You should thank me for not reporting you.

222
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,080
-But Nata, you told me...
-Look.

223
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,360
If you blame me again
for what happened, I'm leaving.

224
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,760
No, I'm sorry.

225
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
-You were a pig.
-I know.

226
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
I've been apologizing since it happened.

227
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,080
How do I know you won't do it again?

228
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,280
Because I really mean it.

229
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,560
I haven't slept since we broke up.

230
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,120
Right.

231
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,640
Because of your guilty conscience.

232
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,120
Because you're the love of my life.

233
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,280
And don't piss me off,
or I'll tell my mother and bye-bye Canada.

234
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,400
<i>Nata, wait.</i>

235
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,240
ENTER CANADA WITH CRIMINAL RECORD...

236
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,720
ENTRY TO CANADA IS NOT PERMITTED
WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD

237
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,560
<i>What do I have to do
to get a second chance?</i>

238
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,240
Work hard at it.

239
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,680
I want everyone to see
that you're dying to be with me again

240
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,560
and you'd do anything to get me back.

241
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,400
I'll do it.

242
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,520
And I want a proper date,
not the shit we had on Valentine's Day.

243
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,440
You'll have that too.

244
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
If you do it right, maybe

245
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,960
I'll give you another chance.

246
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,040
I've missed you.

247
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,880
He was fouling a lot.
I was on the ground all the time.

248
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,880
-Really?
-We were mad.

249
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,440
So, in the end, we scored.

250
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,880
-Sure.
-Did you see it?

251
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,280
When are you coming to watch me again?
I'll dedicate a goal to you.

252
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,000
If you need anything,
I'm right behind, okay?

253
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,800
-Are you back with Alberto?
-No, don't start.

254
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,960
-It's incredible you even talk to him.
-Good morning.

255
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,560
Can we sit down, please?

256
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,000
You're quiet today and so well-behaved.

257
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,200
Let's open our books to page 155.

258
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
<i>I don't get it.</i>

259
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,760
It's crazy getting back with him
after what he did.

260
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,200
Keep it down.
It wasn't so bad, okay? It's okay.

261
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
-Nothing happened.
-Bullshit, Nata.

262
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,160
He and his buddies nearly raped you.

263
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,800
They weren't going to rape me.

264
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,480
It was a gang bang, okay?
Some girls like it.

265
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,920
Do you?

266
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,280
-No, I don't. That's why we didn't do it.
-No, it's why <i>they</i> didn't.

267
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,600
Don't you realize
that you had no fucking power?

268
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,720
Look, not everything
is black and white, okay?

269
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,160
We've talked about it.
He's apologized tons of times.

270
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,680
And it's my decision.

271
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,200
I won't throw it all away
over some nonsense.

272
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,320
"Some nonsense"?

273
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,240
You know who you sound like?

274
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,560
Your mother.

275
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,800
You're turning into a fucking carbon copy.

276
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,800
It's pathetic seeing you play house
at 17 years old.

277
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,720
And with that guy, a loser and a clown,
who'll only ruin your life.

278
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,000
Who the fuck are you to judge me?

279
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,760
You know, I've never heard you say
you love him.

280
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,160
Fuck you, Alma. You're a real know-it-all

281
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,000
who's always lecturing others,
and you know what?

282
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,200
You're the worst of all.

283
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,920
Okay.

284
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,120
Come in.

285
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,240
-Are we meeting up today?
-Today?

286
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,680
I want to take you to a place
with spectacular sushi.

287
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,680
Really?

288
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,040
I'd love to,

289
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,520
but I can't.

290
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,400
I've got a ton of exams to correct here.

291
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,280
Can't you correct them tomorrow?
Or give B's...

292
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,560
-No.
-...to everyone?

293
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,200
I can't.

294
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,960
I can't today.

295
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,920
Okay.

296
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,960
-It's okay.
-Another time.

297
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,960
Sure.

298
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,240
Shut the door.

299
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,600
Ciao.

Hi.

305
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,880
Hi.

306
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,840
I saw you arguing with Nata.

307
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,960
Great, we're a trending topic.

308
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,280
If it's any consolation,
I think Alberto's an asshole.

309
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
Nata should be able to see it.

310
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,120
Why does everyone see
that she's fucking up except her?

311
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,000
Nobody knows they're fucking up
while they're fucking up.

312
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,200
I suppose.

313
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,760
Alma, you were right.

314
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,480
I was a bad friend.
I shouldn't have slept with you.

315
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,640
You were out of it.

316
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,400
No, you shouldn't have.

317
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,640
Right.

318
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,400
If I could turn back time,
I wouldn't do it again.

319
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
I swear.

320
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,760
I'm really sorry.

321
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,800
It's all right, Hernán.

322
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,600
I'm not just saying it.

323
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,640
I'm going to a therapy group.

324
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
They're helping me understand a lot.

325
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,000
Cool.

326
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,120
Negative.

327
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,960
I've been negative for two months, Mom.

328
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,520
Are you going to do the tests
until I'm 30?

329
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,680
-What was it?
-Negative!

330
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,160
Your daughter's asking
how long we'll be doing the tests.

331
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,320
Until 30 sounds good to me.

332
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,480
I don't care.
You're the ones spending a fortune.

333
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,600
The box of 50 is very cheap.

334
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,080
Go on, no more tests.

335
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Yes!

336
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,720
High five!

337
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,200
DAVID: ARE YOU AWAKE?

338
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,720
YEP. WHERE ARE YOU?

339
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,920
DAVID: IN A CLUB. RECORD LAUNCH

340
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,040
ANY MODELS BUGGING YOU?

341
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,800
DAVID: HUNDREDS, BUT NONE I LIKE
AS MUCH AS YOU

342
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,640
DAVID: I HAVE A SURPRISE, HAHA

343
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,560
REALLY? WHAT?

344
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,520
DAVID: IF I TELL YOU
IT WON'T BE A SURPRISE

345
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,480
SURPRISES TURN ME ON

346
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,280
DAVID: WILL TELL YOU LATER

347
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,240
DAVID: GET DRESSED UP
AND I'LL PICK YOU UP IN A BIT

348
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,760
<i>Hey.</i>

349
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
<i>What do you want?</i>

350
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,720
I can't eat all this alone.

351
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Will you help me?

352
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,520
I just want to talk, please.

353
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,360
This is shit. It should be banned.

354
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,320
I knew you couldn't resist it.

355
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,640
Playing dirty?

356
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,120
Again?

357
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,520
Listen, Mer. I want us
to keep seeing each other.

358
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,480
Greta...

359
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Look, Mer. I promise
I won't try to kiss you at any time.

360
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,600
I just want to go somewhere

361
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,720
and chat or have a smoke. That's it.

362
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,600
Besides, I turn 18 in three months.
I can wait.

363
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,760
But wait for what, Greta?

364
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm 20 years older than you.

365
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,040
Well, okay.

366
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
Okay. If you want, just say the word,

367
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
and I'm outta here.

368
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,680
But if for whatever reason,

369
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,480
because I'm

370
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,920
really witty,

371
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,680
smart,

372
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,200
you miss me,

373
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,480
you can tell me, because I'm not going
to act the idiot around here.

374
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,200
What?

375
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,520
What's that smile? Yes? No?

376
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,760
You know, I'm Gen Z.
You have to spell it out for me.

377
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,480
Sometimes.

378
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,520
Only sometimes.

379
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,360
Sure, I've missed you.

380
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,760
In fact, just before you came,

381
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,200
I was about to paint my big toe
and screw it up.

382
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,880
Shall I do it?

383
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,280
-Thanks.
-You look gorgeous.

384
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,400
-What?
-I brought you something.

385
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,400
-Really?
-Yes.

386
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,800
A surprise.

387
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,480
So you know I'm serious.

388
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,000
Do you like it?

389
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,520
A lot.

390
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,640
So,

391
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,480
are we getting back together or...

392
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,440
Well,

393
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,320
hold up a bit.

394
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,600
It's a good start,

395
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,960
but you have to work harder.

396
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,000
Right.

397
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,400
-I owed you a party.
-This is amazing.

398
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,920
Let's go.

399
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,320
-Get me a beer. I'll be right back, okay?
-Okay.

400
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,960
Two beers, please.

401
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,520
Thanks.

402
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,960
How are you?

403
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,520
Here I am.

404
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,400
Who was that?

405
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,200
The boss of all this.

406
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,520
A record company executive
and a former customer.

407
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,280
Jeez, it's Bárbara Lago!
I love that woman.

408
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,760
I know. Greta told me.

409
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,960
You can change it if you like.

410
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,400
No. No way.

411
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,240
I really like it.

412
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,840
It's perfect.

413
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,880
So, what's not right?

414
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,640
I'm a bit cut up about Alma.

415
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,400
We were friends for a long time.

416
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,160
I don't get
how you can still be her friend.

417
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,840
She can't stand you either.

418
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,720
She thinks you're a psychopath.

419
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,840
That bitch needs to be taught a lesson.

420
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,280
Come with me.

421
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,160
I'll wait until you're 18.

422
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,600
Two months ago, I'd have hidden
in your suitcase and gone with you.

423
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,200
But now I don't think it's what I want.

424
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,880
Why?

425
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,920
That trip is your dream.

426
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,440
I have to make my own trip.

427
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,480
Are you angry?

428
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,520
No.

429
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,600
No. It's just that...

430
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,280
I didn't expect
an emotional pullback like this.

431
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,960
What I told you in the café was true.

432
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Go on that trip.

433
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,120
And let me fuck you until you go, okay?

434
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,840
Come here.

435
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm going to let you take home the exams

436
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,800
so you can look at your mistakes.

437
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,560
You're welcome.

438
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,560
Wow, no way!

439
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,680
THE HISTORY OF SPAIN - 7
GO! YOU'RE DOING GREAT!

440
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,440
I'm going to tell you something important.

441
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,120
Excuse me, guys.

442
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Congratulations.

443
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,400
You did well in the exam.

444
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,520
Thanks.

445
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,120
And thanks for the encouragement.
I need it.

446
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,960
You don't sit with Natacha anymore.

447
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
She switched me for her boyfriend.

448
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,440
What happened there?

449
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,400
They split up,
I said some nasty things about Alberto,

450
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,080
now they're together, and I'm the bad guy.

451
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,360
Right, a classic. I've lost
a lot of friendships that way too.

452
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,360
But if I were her, I'd have no doubt

453
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,760
who I'd choose.

454
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,080
We had a staff meeting yesterday.
We were talking about you.

455
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,320
-My ears were burning.
-Right.

456
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,080
We think you can pass the year.

457
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,920
Even sit the SATs.

458
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,920
I think you'll have to put up with me
for another year.

459
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,480
How are your finals going?

460
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,680
Not great. I can't concentrate.

461
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,320
Everything all right at home?
With your friends? Any problems?

462
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,320
No.

463
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,040
No, I'm the problem. I'm just a bit lost.

464
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,840
I don't understand you.

465
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,360
You're very smart.

466
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,080
What happened?

467
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,960
Everyone's so sure, and I'm not.

468
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,280
I'm not like the others.

469
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,120
Just as well you're not.

470
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
No?

471
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,560
I mean, you're special.

472
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,200
-You say that because you know I'm down.
-Not at all.

473
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,640
Maybe you're right.

474
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,920
You have low self-esteem,
you're not interested in your studies...

475
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,080
The two could be related.

476
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,880
Right.

477
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,320
I could help you.

478
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,080
How?

479
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,160
We could meet up
once or twice a week after class,

480
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
in the classroom, in my office...

481
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,160
Look me in the eye.

482
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,440
What do you think?

483
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Think about it.

484
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,080
Okay?

485
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,360
<i>What did you say?</i>

486
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,760
That I'd think about it.

487
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,280
It's a trap, Alma.

488
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,360
He started like that with me.

489
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,800
The same thing will happen to you.
Do you want that?!

490
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,080
No, obviously not.
But if he tries anything on...

491
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,920
If he does, what?!

492
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,640
What'll you do when he jumps on you?
There'll be nobody there!

493
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,360
The school will be empty!

494
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,920
You're a fool
if you think you can stop him!

495
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
-Dammit!
-I won't let him touch me.

496
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,320
-I won't let him do anything.
-You don't get it!

497
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,920
It doesn't work like that!
This isn't a fucking game, Alma!

498
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,040
-Berta.
-Get out!

499
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,080
-What's wrong? Are you okay?
-Yes.

500
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,520
You'd better go.
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

501
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,080
-Fuck!
-Berta.

502
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,200
Go away!

503
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
-Take it easy.
-No!

504
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,240
-Take it easy.
-No!

505
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,680
-Breathe with me. Berta!
-No!

506
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,960
<i>Will we follow all the rules?</i>

507
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,240
<i>Yes!</i>

508
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,760
<i>And what's the main thing we have to do?</i>

509
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,800
<i>Have fun!</i>

510
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,600
<i>Come on, Frankie!</i>

511
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,560
Mom, my history teacher suggested
I do some orientation classes.

512
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,080
When would that be?

513
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,560
In the afternoon, once or twice a week.

514
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,360
That's nice of him.

515
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,680
Try it. Maybe it'll do you good.

516
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,680
Right?

517
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,480
What?

518
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,960
-I'm going to make a sandwich.
-Okay.

519
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,960
Here already?

520
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,960
Great.

521
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,320
Teenagers don't let themselves
be helped much.

522
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,720
Sure, I've tried drugs, psychics,
and the horoscope.

523
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,480
And still the same, right?

524
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,520
I'll put it on silent.

525
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,680
I didn't know what I wanted either.

526
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,000
I had no idea.

527
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
Not studying. I was sure about that.

528
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,120
-Let's go.
-Nothing appeals to me.

529
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,040
Right.

530
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
I think of something I might like,

531
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,680
and I think it's going to be
really boring or really hard.

532
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,160
Alma, you can do anything you want.

533
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,560
I'm not just saying it,
or I wouldn't be here.

534
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,360
I don't know why you bother with me.

535
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,520
I just told you.

536
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,920
You'll be able to do whatever you want.

537
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,880
I don't think it's fair you fall apart.

538
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,600
And...

539
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,560
-How did you know what you wanted to do?
-Me?

540
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,600
The same as you.

541
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,920
A teacher helped me.

542
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,600
I like to do the same for my students.

543
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Only the ones worth the effort, of course.

544
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,000
Sorry.

545
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,960
Sorry. I got tied up, and it got late.

546
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,280
I asked Andrea to join us
in these orientation sessions.

547
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,320
She thinks you have
a lot of potential. Right, Andrea?

548
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,240
Of course.

549
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,440
What do you think?

550
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,400
Good.

551
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,480
Let's see.

552
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,920
I'll share this with you.

553
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,160
Let's see what you think...

554
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,560
about this one here.

555
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,680
-After this one, right?
-Yes.

556
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,880
Okay, let's go.

557
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,480
Let's see.

558
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,000
-Are we doing a test?
-Yes, it's a multiple-choice test, okay?

559
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,520
So...
