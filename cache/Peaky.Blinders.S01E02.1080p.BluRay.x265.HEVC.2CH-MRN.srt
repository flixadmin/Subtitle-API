1
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:04,881
<i>He's a Chief Inspector.</i>

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:06,401
I reckon it's communists he's after.

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:08,681
So this copper's going
to leave us alone, right?

4
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:11,641
What the fuck!

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:15,481
I want you to see this as me
introducing myself to you.

6
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:18,801
He said Mr Churchill sent him
to Birmingham.

7
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:20,641
Something about a robbery.

8
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:24,041
Thomas, you're a bookmaker.
You're not a fool.

9
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:27,201
You sell these guns to anyone who has
use to them, you will hang.

10
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:30,521
I'm just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

11
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:33,601
I'm with you 'cause you're the
only man around here not scared of them.

12
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:36,321
The only difference between
you and me, Freddie,

13
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:39,801
is that, sometimes, my horses
stand a chance of winning.

14
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,201
Tommy!

15
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,721
You're fixing races now.

16
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:46,601
<i>I'm here about the job as a barmaid.</i>

17
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,321
Are you in position?

18
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:52,641
I am, sir.

19
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:33,161
<i>♪ Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the track</i>

20
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:39,721
<i>♪ Where the viaduct looms
like a bird of doom</i>

21
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:43,761
<i>♪ As it shifts and cracks</i>

22
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:49,641
<i>♪ Where secrets lie in the border fires
in the humming wires... ♪</i>

23
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,001
I thought you said we were
going to the fair.

24
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:57,441
We have business first.
Come on. Bring your wits.

25
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,681
- What business?
- That's the Lee family.

26
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:02,881
Tommy! 'Johnny-dogs!

27
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,161
Tommy, how the hell are ya?

28
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:07,761
All the better for getting
the city smoke out of me lungs.

29
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,121
I thought you became
a bit too grand for us.

30
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,401
- I've been busy.
- I'm riding with the Lee family now.

31
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:17,161
I heard. Myself, I'd rather
live among pigs.

32
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:19,321
Come on, Tommy, no disputing.

33
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:21,481
So your first fair since France?

34
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,881
What do you know about France?
You war-shy, gypsy bastard.

35
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,041
- So this is the horse?
- And that's the car.

36
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,241
Hang on a minute.

37
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:50,481
You're not swapping the family car
for a bloody horse.

38
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,401
Of course we're not swapping it.

39
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:54,441
Huh? That'd be mad.

40
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:55,881
We're gonna play two up.

41
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,321
- Here you are.
- Yeah, I knew it.

42
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:21,241
See, I knew it. Tommy, you bloody idiot.

43
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:22,601
Shut up, Arthur, I won.

44
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:24,001
Oi!

45
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:26,601
I promised johnny I'd let him have
a spin in the car if he lost.

46
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:29,001
All right.

47
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,481
Are you Lee boys laughing at my brother?

48
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,321
Are ya?

49
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:42,641
- Eh?
- Tommy! Tommy, come on!

50
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:45,641
- I asked you a question.
- Tommy, come on, it's just the craic.

51
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,681
Get your family out of here,

52
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,081
and go and enjoy yourselves at the fair
before they start a war. Huh?

53
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,241
Yeah, but his mum was a didicoy whore.

54
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:31,641
We will take them
before last night's beer

55
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,881
turns to piss and wakes the devils up.

56
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,201
We will leave no stone unturned.

57
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:40,761
Every gun, every bullet
will be brought to me for inspection.

58
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:44,801
Now, take your positions.

59
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,841
Freddie...

60
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,617
Are you sure your brothers
are at the fair?

61
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,081
If it was them, they wouldn't knock.

62
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:33,561
Mr Thorne!

63
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,961
What is it?

64
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,841
The police are rounding up
the communists.

65
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:42,521
Come on, Ada. If the cops find me,
we're screwed. Fuck!

66
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,081
Ada.

67
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:07,841
You have to jump, Ada. I'll catch ya.

68
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,001
Come on.

69
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,201
Look at this.

70
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,961
A prescription for iron tablets
for Ada fucking Shelby.

71
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:28,881
Mrs Donovan, I need that favour.

72
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:31,001
- Come in and be quick.
- I'm not coming in. She is.

73
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:32,961
Holy Jesus! It's the Shelby girl.

74
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,697
You've not seen her with me,
okay, Mrs Donovan?

75
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,857
Just give her a cup of tea
and let her stay

76
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:36,921
until the police are gone.

77
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:39,721
She's the sister of those
Peaky Blinder devils.

78
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,721
And, yet, she's an angel. Come on, Ada.

79
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,161
What are you gonna do, Freddie?

80
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,121
Me? I'm gonna have to leave town
for a bit.

81
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:07,321
A gentleman would take off his hat.

82
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:10,401
Put out his pipe.

83
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:21,081
I see you Specials only dare come here

84
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,041
when you know
the boys are away at the fair.

85
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:25,281
You mean your nephews?

86
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:30,361
With their guns and their razors?
Is it them you're lighting candles for?

87
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:32,921
No.

88
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,801
I'm lighting candles for the boys
from The Garrison

89
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,761
who lost their lives in France.

90
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:41,161
There's a list there.

91
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:43,881
Look.

92
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,641
I hear you didn't make it to France,

93
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:52,801
Inspector Campbell.

94
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,961
You've heard of me?

95
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:00,721
I've heard of you.

96
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,161
Is it the Holy Grail you're looking for?

97
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,481
As a matter of fact,

98
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,401
it is the Holy Grail I'm looking for.

99
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:16,961
Something precious, something stolen.
Perhaps you know what I'm talking about.

100
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:23,921
Sorry. I misunderstood your intention
when you pushed me against the wall.

101
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,641
Turn the place upside down.

102
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:44,881
Arthur Shelby said you people
would help us.

103
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:47,577
If we don't know what you've lost,
how can we help you find it?

104
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:50,441
But I have found out subsequently
that I was speaking to the wrong man.

105
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:53,561
Next time, I want to talk to the boss.

106
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:58,561
Lickey Tea Rooms. Friday, 10:00.

107
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,361
And when I say "the boss,"
I mean Thomas.

108
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,361
Come on.

109
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,441
Now what the bloody hell's
been going on here?

110
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:40,441
Jesus Christ.

111
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:43,801
The coppers told everyone Arthur
had agreed to it when he was arrested.

112
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:47,321
They said the Peaky Blinders had cleared
out to the fair to let them do it.

113
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,201
No one never said nothing to that copper

114
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,361
about smashing up bloody houses!

115
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:54,561
All right. Which pubs did they do?

116
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,921
The Guns, The Chain, The Marquis.

117
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:58,921
All the ones that pay you
to protect them.

118
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:01,441
The only one they didn't touch
was The Garrison.

119
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,761
Made sure people think we were in on it.

120
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,321
Smart, this copper.

121
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,961
So go on. Drink your beers. Get out.

122
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,721
You better show people
you'll still the cocks of the walk.

123
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,201
Hand out some cash
to the landlords of the pubs.

124
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:19,081
Pay some veterans to fix the places up.

125
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:21,041
Give us the bag.

126
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:23,001
So what about you, Tommy?

127
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:26,081
I've to go to Charlie's
to stable the horse.

128
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,961
Looked foot sore in the box.

129
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,321
Let them see your faces.

130
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:43,921
So we both know what
they were looking for.

131
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:51,561
You don't read the papers?

132
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,321
Racing papers.

133
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,401
So let me tell you the odds.

134
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:58,681
I reckon it's 3-to-1
there'll be a revolution.

135
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:00,601
I wouldn't bet on that.

136
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:02,361
That copper's betting on it.

137
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,721
He's not gonna let it rest
till he gets those guns back.

138
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:15,601
Did he talk to ya, Pol?

139
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,601
In the church.

140
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,201
Did he try to find our Ada?

141
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:24,121
She was sleeping.

142
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:29,081
Where was she sleeping, Pol?

143
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:33,361
I thought you didn't care
for women's business.

144
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,441
He knows you're the boss.

145
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,361
He wants to meet you.

146
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,721
- Will you talk to him?
- No.

147
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,641
You don't parlay when you're
on the back foot.

148
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,401
We'll strike a blow back first.

149
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:17,761
Hey, lad.

150
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:20,481
- What are you doing?
- We're having a fire.

151
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:24,001
Take off your picture of the King.

152
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:25,081
What?

153
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:26,561
Bring it to Watery Lane.

154
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:49,961
Chuck them on, boys.

155
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:51,521
Yeah!

156
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,641
Well, I hope to God you
know what you're doing.

157
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:19,441
I'm the reporter.

158
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:21,281
<i>The Birmingham Evening Despatch.</i>

159
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:23,161
I had a phone call.

160
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,961
Someone called Thomas Shelby?

161
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:28,041
Come with me.

162
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:33,001
Move aside. Give us a bit of room.
Tommy.

163
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,081
Move back for us, please, folks.

164
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,281
You're Mr Shelby?

165
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:38,721
- All the way back, please.
- I am.

166
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,561
You said I would be protected.

167
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:45,561
You're protected.

168
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:47,961
What's going on?

169
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,561
There are some things I want you
to write down.

170
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,841
Now, first of all.

171
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:57,001
It's not the people around here
that are disloyal to the King.

172
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,081
It's the opposite.

173
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:01,361
You see, we don't want our beloved king

174
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,881
looking down and seeing the things
that have been done to us.

175
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:06,561
So we are taking down his pictures.

176
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:08,081
But why are you burning them?

177
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,881
We went through hell for our king.

178
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:15,041
Walked through the flames of war.
Write all this down!

179
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,721
And now we're being attacked
in our own homes.

180
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:21,081
These new coppers over from Belfast,

181
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:23,721
breaking into our homes
and interfering with our women.

182
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:26,321
We don't think our king
would want to see that happening.

183
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:29,761
So we are lighting fires
to raise the alarm.

184
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:33,681
May I ask you,
in what capacity do you speak?

185
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:35,361
No capacity.

186
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,361
I'm an ordinary man.

187
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:39,961
I won gallantry medals at the Somme.

188
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,641
I want you to write in your paper
what's going on here.

189
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:46,921
Go on, go.

190
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:57,921
Come in.

191
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:02,481
There... There...

192
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,201
There's a telephone call for you, sir,
on the London line.

193
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,401
There is? It's almost midnight.

194
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,281
It's Mr Winston Churchill, sir.

195
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:26,561
- Yes, sir.
- Inspector Campbell.

196
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:29,361
I hear there's been a bonfire
in your city.

197
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:33,361
There was a small fire reported
around 9:00 in Watery Lane.

198
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:35,521
<i>Certainly nothing to trouble
you about, sir.</i>

199
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,081
Ah, but I'm afraid it has troubled me.

200
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:42,121
Half an hour ago,
I received a wire communication

201
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,081
from <i>the editor</i> of <i>the
Birmingham Evening Despatch.</i>

202
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:49,561
<i>It seems one of his reporters
was invited to the fire</i>

203
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:53,001
<i>and discovered that they were burning
pictures of the King.</i>

204
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:54,681
Of the King?

205
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:58,561
Any newspaper report
which may cause embarrassment

206
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:01,201
to His Majesty is always referred first,

207
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,961
and as a matter of routine,
to the Home Office.

208
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:06,881
I will go down there immediately,
and, er, arrest those involved.

209
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,841
No, you most certainly will not
make arrests.

210
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,601
<i>If there are arrests,
there will be trials.</i>

211
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:17,241
If there are trials, there will be
more newspaper reports

212
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:21,521
which will necessarily mention
the burning of the King's likeness.

213
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,321
I put you in Birmingham
for one very specific reason.

214
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:30,401
Are you any nearer to finding
those stolen guns?

215
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,761
- We are making steady progress.
- We need results.

216
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:34,961
Goodnight, Mr Campbell.

217
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,361
<i>Sir... Could I at least ask...</i>

218
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:40,521
Does this report
name any of those involved?

219
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,521
It names a Mr Thomas Shelby.

220
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:46,161
The report mentions he's a war hero.

221
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:58,641
Good of you to join us.

222
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,641
- Where have you been all day?
- In bed.

223
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:06,121
Couldn't sleep. Then I couldn't wake up.

224
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:09,281
Then I was cold, and then
I had to go for a wee.

225
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:12,881
Then I was with this bear on a boat.

226
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:16,601
That was just a dream.
Then I was hungry.

227
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:18,641
Why are you reading the paper?

228
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:21,401
Why wouldn't I be?

229
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:23,281
Well, I've never seen you
read the paper.

230
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:25,441
I've only ever seen you
light fires with them.

231
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:29,521
The BSA on strike. Miners are on strike.

232
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,841
IRA are killing our boys.

233
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:33,441
Ten a day.

234
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:38,161
What?

235
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,161
Stand up.

236
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:42,441
- Why?
- Just stand up.

237
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:50,681
Side on.

238
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:54,121
Oi, what are you doing?

239
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,921
Ada,

240
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:58,761
how late are you?

241
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,001
One week.

242
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,041
Five weeks.

243
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,721
Seven, if you count weekends.
I think it's a lack of iron.

244
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:12,961
I got some tablets.

245
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,321
But they didn't work.

246
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:20,041
No.

247
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,201
You can get dressed now, love.

248
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:33,961
So, am I or not?

249
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,801
Keep bloody walking, Ada.
If anybody sees us here, they'll know.

250
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,321
I'm not getting rid of it, Aunt Pol.

251
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:46,937
Just come home and we'll talk about it.

252
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:48,921
You get off of me,
or I'll scream it, I swear.

253
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:56,042
All right, you want to do this
on the street? Let's do it.

254
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:57,761
Whose is it?

255
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,801
If I tell you, you'll tell them
and they'll cut him to pieces.

256
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,721
Not if he marries you, they won't.

257
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:08,241
Will he marry you?

258
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:11,097
I don't know. I don't know where he is.

259
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:12,161
Jesus Christ, Ada!

260
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,857
Look, he's gone away
but he said he'd come back.

261
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,337
Yeah, but they all say
they'll come back.

262
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:18,001
He's not like that,
he's a good man, he promised.

263
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:22,161
He will come back, Aunt Pol,
I know he will.

264
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,761
Get me down a Spanish saddle, Joe.

265
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:35,881
Yes, Tom. A Spanish saddle...
He's a beauty, Tom.

266
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:38,441
Yeah, yeah... Beautiful. Yeah.

267
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:46,401
Fine beast you got there, Thomas.

268
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:51,001
But is he worth falling out
with the Lee family over?

269
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,841
Just passing it on.

270
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:09,281
Declaration of war. The whole Lee clan.

271
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:18,521
The guns and now this.

272
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:22,521
The guns are not spoken of.

273
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:24,761
Right?

274
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:29,961
Tommy. Tommy!

275
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:34,641
You mind how to speak to me.

276
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,241
Forgive me, Uncle.

277
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:45,081
It's Thomas Shelby against
the whole bloody world, right?

278
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,321
Easy! Easy!

279
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:24,081
Easy, boy.

280
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:27,481
Shh. In France, we used to say...

281
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:31,801
Shh. In France we used to say it's just
the musical hall band turning up.

282
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:34,721
Shh. It's just trombones
and tubas, that's all.

283
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,241
It's just noise. Shh. Shh. Shh.

284
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:42,281
It's just noise, all right?
It's just noise.

285
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:44,641
You get used to it.

286
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,601
It's just noise. Good boy.

287
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,041
Good boy.

288
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:03,601
In some pain there, boy, eh?

289
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:10,681
I... I'm so sorry, Mr Shelby.

290
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:16,201
- I'm Grace, by the way.
- I know who you are.

291
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:20,041
What's his name?

292
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:22,121
He doesn't have a name.

293
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:24,081
Poor boy, deserves a name.

294
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,321
Do you have something to say to me?

295
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:33,361
The other night you came into the pub
when I was singing.

296
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,681
You said singing wasn't allowed.

297
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:41,201
I'd like there to be one night a week
when there's singing.

298
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,401
I think it would be good for everyone.

299
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:47,401
Saturday nights.

300
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:51,361
Harry was too afraid to ask you so...

301
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,001
But you're not?

302
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:58,561
I am.

303
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,121
But I love to sing.

304
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:06,041
You sound like one of those rich girls

305
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:08,321
who comes over from Dublin
for the races.

306
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:10,761
Do you like horses?

307
00:24:13,721 --> 00:24:15,321
How'd you fancy
earning some extra money?

308
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:16,801
Doing what?

309
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:20,681
Dig out a nice dress.

310
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:23,481
I want to take you to the races.

311
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,401
Go a couple of charges coming in, john.
Rock Ferry down two-eighths.

312
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:08,961
Sorry, Mr Shelby. Go on!

313
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:21,041
- All right, Mr Shelby. How's it going?
- Hello, Frank. How's the leg?

314
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:22,681
- Not bad.
- Good.

315
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:24,281
Nice to see you, son.

316
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:27,121
Morning, Charlie.

317
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,441
The odds are good, boss.

318
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:31,561
- How are we looking?
- Looking good, Tommy.

319
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:32,961
Tom my? Tom my?

320
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:34,841
They're all here for Monaghan Boy.

321
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:36,481
That's what I like to hear, johnny boy.

322
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,081
And Aunt Pol wants to see ya.

323
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,161
Tell me the man's name, Ada.

324
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:49,281
Rudolph Valentino.

325
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:10,721
Get out!

326
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:12,441
All of you.

327
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:14,361
Go on. Now!

328
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:19,761
I said tell me his fucking name.

329
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:26,401
Freddie fucking Thorne!

330
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:34,121
Yeah. Your best mate since school,
the man who saved your life in France.

331
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:36,641
So, go on. Go and cut him.

332
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,521
Cut him up and chuck him in the cut.

333
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:45,081
Oi! I'm a Shelby, too, you know!

334
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:47,321
Put my fucking film back on.

335
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:23,001
So Monaghan Boy finally lost?

336
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:26,601
Third time unlucky.

337
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:30,041
We took money from all over the city.

338
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:32,081
Yeah, but you'll pay it back
to people round here.

339
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:35,041
Buy your popularity back.

340
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:36,841
Already done.

341
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:38,681
Taught you well.

342
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:42,761
And you fixed this race
without the permission of Billy Kimber?

343
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:47,401
Obviously didn't teach you well enough!

344
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,841
Rule one. You don't punch
above your weight.

345
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,641
- Billy Kimber is there for the taking.
- Says who?

346
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:54,881
Says Tom and his parliament of one.

347
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,281
- I ran this business for five years.
- Yeah.

348
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:00,281
While I was away fighting, remember?

349
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:02,281
Where I learned some things, such as

350
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,961
you strike when the enemy is weak.

351
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:08,641
And I thought you came here
to talk family business.

352
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:13,281
I'll deal with it.
You're too busy taking over the world.

353
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,441
Polly.

354
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:17,161
It's about Ada. I need to know.

355
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:27,121
Ada wants you to give
Freddie this letter.

356
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:30,961
She wants Freddie to know
she's having his baby.

357
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:33,361
He deserves an opportunity
to do the right thing.

358
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:35,761
I say we give them a chance.

359
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:44,281
For a woman who's had a hard life of men,

360
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:46,521
you're still full of romance, eh?

361
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:50,561
What do you think Freddie sees
in our Ada?

362
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:51,961
- That's Freddie's business.
- No.

363
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:53,801
No, I'll tell you what he sees.

364
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:59,961
He sees machine guns and rifles and
ammunition and some glorious revolution.

365
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,881
What is it you really don't like
about Freddie?

366
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:04,601
She'll have no life with a
man on the run.

367
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:06,721
If you can't see that,
you can't see much.

368
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:14,721
Damn them for what they
did to you in France!

369
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:20,721
Tell Ada Freddie went to America.

370
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:22,961
Or Russia.

371
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:26,801
Polly, it'd do no good for Ada
to bring a baby into the world alone.

372
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:30,881
Pol, listen. The truth is you would've
hit me with that thing

373
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:33,001
if it weren't for the fact
that you know I'm right!

374
00:30:39,561 --> 00:30:40,881
Thought I heard someone knocking.

375
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:43,481
Couldn't get back to sleep.

376
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,321
The longer you leave it,

377
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,881
the worse it gets.

378
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:00,721
Believe me.

379
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:02,881
I know.

380
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:06,761
I was 16.

381
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:11,161
And I didn't dare tell anyone.

382
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:13,721
Polly, Freddie'll come back.

383
00:31:14,761 --> 00:31:16,361
In the end, I did it myself.

384
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:20,761
I did it to myself.

385
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:22,921
And I almost died.

386
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:25,361
And he didn't come back.

387
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:27,961
They don't. Why should they?

388
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:31,041
You know the words.

389
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:33,361
You're a whore. Baby's a bastard.

390
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:36,801
But there's no word for the man
who doesn't come back.

391
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:41,921
One day,

392
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,401
on your wedding day,

393
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:47,281
you'll have a good man on your arm.

394
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:49,801
And you'll say, "Polly",

395
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:51,721
"thank you,"

396
00:31:52,081 --> 00:31:53,201
"for common sense."

397
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:04,401
This woman's in Cardiff.

398
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,481
We'll take the train tomorrow.

399
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:13,041
Go to the castle afterwards for a treat.

400
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:09,121
I chose this place because

401
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,081
it is outside both of our jurisdictions.

402
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:15,521
Do you want tea?

403
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:19,881
Inspector, I responded
to your invitation

404
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:21,641
because I want us
to understand each other.

405
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:24,761
I'm a businessman.

406
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:28,081
I want to make my business successful.

407
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,321
And I want my city run peacefully.

408
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,321
Well, if the city is peaceful,
business can thrive.

409
00:33:37,441 --> 00:33:39,041
So we're on the same side.

410
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:42,281
I think perhaps we could be.

411
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:50,721
My...

412
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:58,521
How can we be on the same side
when I see things like this?

413
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:02,561
My men found this

414
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:04,481
in the bedroom

415
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,881
of a known communist.

416
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,881
It has your sister's name on it.

417
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:14,841
It was obvious she'd been
sleeping in his bed.

418
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:20,641
Are you also in bed
with the communists, Mr Shelby?

419
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,121
I do not share their fantasy.

420
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,201
And as for my sister,

421
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:28,081
I've already dealt with the situation.

422
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:31,681
Freddie Thorne is at the very top
of my list.

423
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:33,001
Well, cross him off.

424
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:35,721
He won't be returning to the city.

425
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:40,001
I'll make him part of our deal.

426
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:42,921
What deal?

427
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:50,481
You and your Specials will leave
my businesses alone from now on.

428
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:54,641
No more raids into our territory,
no more smashing our pubs.

429
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,401
No more lifting my runners.

430
00:34:56,801 --> 00:35:00,641
You will turn a blind eye
to all of my gambling operations. Also,

431
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,281
I am planning an expansion

432
00:35:03,961 --> 00:35:05,401
onto the race tracks.

433
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:08,121
I intend to do business
with Billy Kimber.

434
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:11,841
He runs most of the legal trackside
betting outside of London.

435
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,441
He has policemen on his payroll.

436
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:18,841
I want you to put in a word with
the Chief Inspector of Gloucestershire,

437
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:21,561
that his men should leave me alone

438
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:23,601
when I make my move.

439
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:28,281
Forgive me, I don't seem to have a pen

440
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:31,641
to write down this rather
long list of demands.

441
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:36,961
And what do I get in return?

442
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:40,521
I have what you're looking for.

443
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:48,081
I have the guns.

444
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,561
What guns?

445
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:53,881
- I'm not here to play games.
- Wait, wait...

446
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,561
Twenty five Lewis machine guns.
Fifty carbines.

447
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:10,961
Ten thousand rounds of ammunition.

448
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:13,161
All in a crate bound for Libya.

449
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:15,921
Stolen from the BSA
factory proofing bay.

450
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:20,561
I'm guessing they sent you to Birmingham
to get those guns back.

451
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,601
Well,

452
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,161
it's me that has them.

453
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:28,841
I have left word with men I trust,

454
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:31,601
that if I am taken into police custody
for whatever reason,

455
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,801
those guns will be shipped to Liverpool.

456
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,681
From there, they will be sent
directly to Belfast.

457
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:39,761
And sold to the Irish Republican Army.

458
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,161
All your good work in Ireland
will be undone.

459
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:46,001
Each stolen weapon
is numbered and marked.

460
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:50,241
If I sell them to the IRA, it won't
be long before Mr Churchill finds out.

461
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,577
I imagine you got into enough trouble

462
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:54,401
over the burning
of the King's photographs.

463
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,041
That was just a taster.

464
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:59,681
If those guns reach Belfast,

465
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:03,121
your life in the force is over.

466
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:07,201
When I have achieved
what I have set out to achieve,

467
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,521
I will let you know where
to find the guns.

468
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:11,561
You'll be a hero.

469
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,881
You'll probably get a medal.

470
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:17,641
I'm a fair man.

471
00:37:18,881 --> 00:37:19,961
It's a fair offer.

472
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:23,681
Do we have a deal?

473
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:33,921
I need an answer.

474
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:35,961
Right now.

475
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:41,961
Very well.

476
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:47,201
But I'd prefer if we don't
shake hands on it.

477
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:03,041
Now, why would I shake the hand of a man

478
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:05,681
who didn't even fight for his country?

479
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:51,321
Grace.

480
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:59,801
I have new information.

481
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:04,801
Thomas Shelby is now the beginning,

482
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:07,761
the middle and the end of your mission.

483
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:21,921
So what shall I do?

484
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,521
It hurts me as much as it...

485
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:29,921
As it would a father sending
his own daughter into a whorehouse.

486
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,441
But no matter how repugnant it may be,

487
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:39,401
you must do everything you can

488
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:40,601
to get close to him.

489
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:42,881
<i>And...</i>

490
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:45,401
<i>Find out where those guns are hidden.</i>

491
00:39:49,001 --> 00:39:50,081
Of course, when I say

492
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:51,761
everything, I don't mean...

493
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:56,361
You underestimate me in every way.

494
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:07,281
Here.

495
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,961
You are now active
on a military operation

496
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,681
on behalf of the Crown.

497
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:28,081
And I wish to God
circumstance hadn't chosen you.

498
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,281
It's what I'm trained for.

499
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:35,201
I'm late for my shift.

500
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:40,441
Grace,

501
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:43,801
my heart is with you.

502
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:01,721
Ahhh!

503
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:46,401
Tom! Tom! Tom!

504
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:48,361
You'd better come quick, Tom! Tom!

505
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,241
Curly, tell me.

506
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,241
Cursed, Tom.

507
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,481
Curly, Curly... Shh. Shh. Shh.
Curly, Curly.

508
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,961
Tell me. Tell me, Curly.
What's wrong with the horse?

509
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:32,801
You bought at the fair in bad feeling.

510
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:36,681
The Lees put a bad seed in the hoof
and got an old woman to put a spell.

511
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:43,801
So those Lee bastards cursed him.

512
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:47,001
Whatever it is, he says it

513
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,841
spread to the other feet.

514
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:51,441
It's going to his heart
by tomorrow, I say!

515
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:55,241
I've seen curses like this twice.
Can't take them back, Tom.

516
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:56,801
No.

517
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:58,801
I told you, Tommy.

518
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:02,561
Better enemies to have
than black blood gypsies.

519
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:07,641
Get out.

520
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:10,481
Get out, Curly.

521
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:17,841
I'm sorry.

522
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,641
We're closed, Mr Shelby.

523
00:43:59,281 --> 00:44:00,801
Just get me a drink.

524
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:16,161
Shall I leave you alone?

525
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,361
Came here for company.

526
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:21,921
Where's Harry?

527
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:23,561
He took the night off.

528
00:44:26,561 --> 00:44:28,201
Went to the pictures.

529
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:36,641
How's your beautiful horse?

530
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:48,681
I just put a bullet in his head.

531
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:54,281
Was he lame?

532
00:44:57,681 --> 00:44:59,281
He looked at me the wrong way.

533
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:04,281
It's not a good idea
to look at Tommy Shelby the wrong way.

534
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:11,521
- What a waste.
- Yeah.

535
00:45:12,081 --> 00:45:14,121
A waste is what it is.

536
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:21,721
You know, in France...

537
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:29,081
In France, I got used to seeing men die.

538
00:45:31,281 --> 00:45:33,081
Never got used to seeing horses die.

539
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:36,761
They die badly.

540
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:45,761
I dug out a dress like you asked.

541
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:48,761
Thanks.

542
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,881
It's Cheltenham you're talking about.

543
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:02,241
Cheltenham's a grand affair, is it not?

544
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:04,121
The King will be there.

545
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:06,281
- King George?
- No.

546
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:11,001
King Billy Kimber. And all his men.

547
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:15,161
And what must I do?

548
00:46:15,801 --> 00:46:18,081
For £2, you'll do what I ask you to do.

549
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:21,281
I want three.

550
00:46:23,321 --> 00:46:26,201
If I'm meeting a king,
I won't be wearing a cheap dress.

551
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:31,441
And I ask you to let me sing.

552
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:33,401
It's part of the deal now, too.

553
00:46:35,121 --> 00:46:36,281
Since when?

554
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:39,881
Since you nearly smiled.

555
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,841
Saturday nights. Open and easy.

556
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:50,041
Everyone gets to sing their song,
just like we did in Dublin.

557
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:51,401
You never worked in Dublin.

558
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:54,041
So don't lie to me.

559
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:58,201
I asked around about that pub
you said you used to work in.

560
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:00,441
I have friends over there.

561
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,881
No one has heard of you.

562
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:10,801
My guess is,

563
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,801
you're a girl from a good family

564
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:15,921
who got herself pregnant.

565
00:47:19,721 --> 00:47:21,081
It's not something I want known.

566
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:24,121
And bringing a child into the
world alone ruined your life.

567
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:27,521
Right?

568
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:32,521
So I'm right.

569
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:34,521
And Polly is wrong.

570
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:37,641
Right about what?

571
00:47:38,401 --> 00:47:40,001
Doesn't matter.

572
00:47:41,281 --> 00:47:42,681
Looks like it matters to you.

573
00:47:43,881 --> 00:47:45,681
Family business.

574
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:50,961
You won't tell anyone my secret?

575
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:54,641
Do you think I tell people things?

576
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:00,401
So what do you sing?

577
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:03,961
- Anything you want.
- Right.

578
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:06,641
Get up on the chair.

579
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:09,121
Okay.

580
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:17,521
Happy or sad?

581
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:22,641
Sad.

582
00:48:24,241 --> 00:48:26,601
Okay. But I warn you,

583
00:48:27,481 --> 00:48:28,561
it'll break your heart.

584
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,521
Already broken.

You came back?

605
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:26,801
I got a tip-off.

606
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:28,721
Freddie, Tommy will kill you.

607
00:50:28,961 --> 00:50:30,361
It's Tommy who tipped me off.

608
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:32,881
Maybe he's got half a heart, after all.

609
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:35,601
Tommy got a message to me.

610
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:39,161
Said, "Get out of town.
Take her with you."

611
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:42,481
So.

612
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:47,601
Ada Shelby,

613
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:51,761
will you marry me?

614
00:50:53,561 --> 00:50:54,681
Yes.

615
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:56,401
Yes.

616
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,441
Yes!

617
00:51:14,761 --> 00:51:17,321
Right. Get on this bloody train
and get out of here.

618
00:51:18,521 --> 00:51:20,241
- Come on, both of you.
- Freddie, come on.

619
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:24,361
Freddie... Cardiff's okay,
anywhere but here's okay.

620
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:27,041
We're not going anywhere, Ada.

621
00:51:29,161 --> 00:51:31,001
We're gonna stay here,
we're gonna marry here.

622
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:34,761
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.

623
00:52:02,281 --> 00:52:03,801
Did you want whisky as well?

624
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:05,401
No, just beer.

625
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:08,121
Why no whisky, Tom.
You expecting trouble?

626
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,321
Jesus Christ, Tommy, what the hell
made you let them sing?

627
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,001
They sound like they're strangling cats
out there.

628
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:20,041
All right. Twenty's the play, come on.

629
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:24,321
Now, what did make you change
your mind though, Tommy? Hmm?

630
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:29,161
- It's about time, Tommy.
- Time for what?

631
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:30,681
Well...

632
00:52:30,761 --> 00:52:33,761
- Time you took yourself a woman.
- Just play the bloody hand.

633
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:36,321
You stay the way you are, Tommy.

634
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:38,041
Remember what Dad used to say.

635
00:52:38,641 --> 00:52:42,241
- Fast women and slow horses...
- Will ruin your life.

636
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:45,441
- Coppers.
- No.

Is there any man here named Shelby?

646
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:34,961
I said, "Is there any man here
named Shelby?"

647
00:53:41,561 --> 00:53:42,721
Harry, get these men a drink.

648
00:53:43,281 --> 00:53:44,681
Everyone else go home.

649
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,481
You go home.

650
00:53:59,961 --> 00:54:02,481
- But Mr Fenton said...
- I said go home.

651
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:08,561
I've never approved of women in pubs
but when they look like that...

652
00:54:09,081 --> 00:54:11,161
You said you want men called Shelby.

653
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:13,361
You've got three of them.

654
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:16,841
Right, I never heard of ya.
And then I did hear of ya,

655
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:20,281
some little didicoy razor gang.
I thought to meself, so what?

656
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:22,881
But then you fucked me over.

657
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:26,041
So now you have my undivided attention.

658
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:30,921
By the way, which one am I talking to?
Who's the boss?

659
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:35,681
- Well, I'm the oldest.
- Ha! Clearly.

660
00:54:36,161 --> 00:54:37,721
Are you laughing at my brother?

661
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:43,001
Right. He's the oldest.
You're the thickest.

662
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:45,561
I'm told the boss is called Tommy,
and I'm guessing that's you,

663
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:48,121
'cause you're looking me up and down
like I'm a fucking tart.

664
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:52,121
I want to know what you want.

665
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:55,721
There were suspicious betting patterns
at Kempton Park.

666
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:57,161
A horse called Monaghan Boy...

667
00:54:58,641 --> 00:55:00,961
He won by a length twice
and then finished last.

668
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:03,561
With £3,000 bet on him.

669
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:05,441
Which one am I talking to?

670
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:09,761
- Which one of you is the boss?
- I'm Mr Kimber's adviser and accountant.

671
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:12,961
And I'm the fucking boss, okay?
Right. End of parlay.

672
00:55:13,121 --> 00:55:15,361
You fixed the race
without my permission.

673
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,121
You fucking gypsy scum!

674
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:23,201
What, live off the war pensions and
these poor old Garrison Lane widows?

675
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:28,081
That's your level. I am Billy Kimber!
I run the races

676
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:31,761
and you fixed one of them. So I'm
gonna have you shot against the post.

677
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:34,761
Mr Kimber.

678
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:40,401
Look at it.

679
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:43,481
That has my name in it.

680
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,001
It's from the Lee family.

681
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:50,521
You are also at war with the Lees,
Mr Kimber, am I right?

682
00:55:54,761 --> 00:55:57,241
The Lees are attacking your bookies
and taking your money.

683
00:55:57,481 --> 00:56:00,641
Your men can't control them.
You need help.

684
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:04,921
Perhaps we should listen to what
Mr Shelby has to say,

685
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:07,521
before we make our decisions.

686
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:10,041
Right. The Lees

687
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:12,801
are doing a lot of talking at the fairs.

688
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:14,241
They have a lot of kin.

689
00:56:14,321 --> 00:56:16,321
They're saying the racetracks
are easy meat

690
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:19,001
because the police are busy
with strikes. Now,

691
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:21,961
we have connections.
We know how they operate.

692
00:56:22,601 --> 00:56:24,881
You have muscle.

693
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:28,081
Together we can beat them.
Divided, maybe not.

694
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:34,441
Mr Kimber, perhaps we should take
some time for reflection.

695
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:37,841
Possibly make arrangements
for a second meeting.

696
00:56:38,601 --> 00:56:40,121
I admire you, Mr Kimber.

697
00:56:41,321 --> 00:56:45,001
You started with nothing
and built a legitimate business.

698
00:56:46,161 --> 00:56:50,081
It would be an honour
to work with you, Mr Kimber.

699
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:56,361
Nobody works "with" me.
People work "for" me.

700
00:57:01,561 --> 00:57:02,681
Pick it up, pikey.

701
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,281
Sit. Sit down.

702
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:25,001
It's for your ceiling.

703
00:57:25,881 --> 00:57:27,041
Thank you, Mr Kimber.

704
00:57:31,521 --> 00:57:32,601
We will be at Cheltenham.

705
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:35,001
As will I.

706
00:57:56,361 --> 00:57:58,321
So you picked a fight with the Lee's
on purpose.

707
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:02,801
Tommy, we can't mess with
Billy fucking Kimber.

708
00:58:03,241 --> 00:58:05,241
Get yourself a decent haircut, man.

709
00:58:05,641 --> 00:58:06,881
We're going to the races.

710
00:58:29,441 --> 00:58:35,201
