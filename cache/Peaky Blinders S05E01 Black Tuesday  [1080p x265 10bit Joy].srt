"We cannot give you the assurance

10
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,440
Here's my favourite part.

11
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,840
"We have never even heard of your people,

12
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,240

13
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,560

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,520
Hmm.

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,720
Wait. Wait, wait, say that again.

36
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,320
No.

37
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,440
No, that cannot be possible!

Peter, my beautiful pilot.

39
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,040
Now, will you please fly me
and my winnings back to England?

40
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
Ten spoonfuls of sugar for me, please.

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,120
Is that for one?

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,240
Look, Ruby.

43
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,520
Daddy's back from his call.

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,080
Everything's going to be all right now.

45
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,200
No.

46
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,120
Oh, no, no.

47
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,640
No, no, no.

48
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,160
Oh, no.

49
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,680
Hello.

50
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,520
Arthur! Arthur, where's Tommy?

51
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,480
Just get to him
and tell him that we've lost the lot.

52
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,600
Stay in. Stay put.

53
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,480
You'll hear from Tommy.

54
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,320
Arthur, what are you talking about?
How is that possible?

55
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,840
It's possible because this
morning in New York City at 6:00 a.m.,

56
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,440
the Wall Street stock exchange crashed.

57
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
<i>Like a steam train.</i>

58
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
And we were most definitely on board.

59
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,600
Fuck it!

60
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,640
All right. Come on, get changed.

61
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
-Jesus Christ!
-Bring the car round.

62
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,280
Got to get out of here.
Hurry up! Come on!

63
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm going!

64
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,760
Change of plan.

65
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,240
We're not going to London anymore.
We're going straight to Birmingham.

66
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,680
-There are other passengers.
-Not anymore.

67
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If you're going to England,

68
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,159
-I'm coming with you.
-No, no, no.

69
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,799
I love you, you love me. That's the truth.

70
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,640
Gina, wait, come on.

71
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,080
I wanna meet your family.

72
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,120
No, you don't.

73
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,680
Oh, fuck.

74
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,120
Now you've heard of us.

75
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,040
- Come on.

76
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,440
-Couch. Couch!

77
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,560
Put something down for the blood.
My sister'll fucking kill me.

78
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,440
Be fucking careful.

79
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,840
She spends thousands of pounds
on this shit.

80
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,640
Get me some booze.

81
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,160
Just fucking get the thing out of me
and sew me up. Just do it.

82
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,000
Peaky boy, give me your blade.

83
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,040
That's enough.

84
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,080
Don't want you throwing up
on your sister's furniture.

85
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,440
You know what you're doing?

86
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,560
- I've done this a dozen times.

87
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,360
I once took a bullet from between
two ribs, one inch from the heart.

88
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Mind you, it was a horse.

89
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
And the horse did die.

90
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,240
-Hold him. Hold him.

91
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,800
-Here you go.

92
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,920
Just a little one.

93
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,760
- What the fuck is going on?
-Oh, fuck.

94
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,000
Hello, Ada.

95
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,440
-Get out. Both of you.
- Oh, fuck.

96
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,000
Push this on the wound.
Keep up the pressure.

97
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Get out.

98
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I'm so sorry, Ada.

99
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,960
They broke a statue of some thin woman.

100
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,640
Fucking statues.

101
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
What has Tommy told you?

102
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,240
Shelbys stay out of the sporting stuff.

103
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,960
What? To maintain your fucking reputation?

104
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,920
Oi!

105
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,480
You listen to me.

106
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,280
We've got a chance.
Tommy has given us that chance.

107
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,120
He's got power, we've got money,
and our past is left behind us.

108
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,160
And you've got a precious young life,
Finn, you fucking idiot!

109
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,120
Three inches to the left
and that would've been gone.

110
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,400
You've got nothing to prove, Finn.

111
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,440
You have got nothing to prove.

112
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,120
Daddy! Daddy!

113
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
Come here, you.
Come here, come here, come here. Ooh!

114
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,280
Now, what have you been up to, eh?

115
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,200
Any time, Johnny.

116
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,720
All right, you heard the man. Let's go.

117
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,880
Where's Charles?

118
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,040
He's in the wagon. He won't come out.

119
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,760
He heard Johnny talking Rokka.
He understands more Gypsy than we think.

120
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,760
He heard him say you shot the horse.
I told him it was mercy.

121
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,200
I said it's what you do
when a horse gets sick.

122
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,640
He doesn't understand.

123
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,960
Dad, why did you shoot him?

124
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,440
Charlie, get out here now.
Let's get it done.

125
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,320
Charles, come here.

126
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Sit down.

127
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,080
Now listen to me.

128
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,520
Your horse was sick. He was in pain.

129
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,320
The vet couldn't do anything.
Even Curly couldn't do anything.

130
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,640
I put him to sleep.

131
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
It's what you do.

132
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,440
-No, it's what you do!
- Charlie.

133
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,680
Shoot horses, shoot people.
Everybody says!

134
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Come here.

135
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,120
Dangerous, my beautiful horse.

136
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,120
Too wild to race.

137
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Wouldn't take the reins or the whip.

138
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,840
Should have been a war horse.

139
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,520
Got tired of the pasture.

140
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,920
Couldn't stick the peace and the quiet,
gave up on life...

141
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,520
And he's now free.

142
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,440
In the bleak...

143
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,880
You're crying?

144
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Tom, I'm sorry.

145
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,320
I didn't know your boy spoke Rokka.

146
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,880
Fill it in, Johnny.

147
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Take her.

148
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,760
I've called the house. The office.

149
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,400
But if I tell you, you won't believe it.

150
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,440
So I'll show you.

151
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,720
Huh?

152
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,920
I told Michael on Friday
this was going to happen.

153
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah.

154
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,720
Fucking Michael said he was advised by
the broker that the prices would rebound.

155
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Everybody was told the same thing.

156
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,560
He held on.

157
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,760
-Michael held on...
-Yeah.

158
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,040
Michael.

159
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,040
Michael held on.

160
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,040
Yeah.

161
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,160
Michael held on,

162
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,000
and carried on dancing and playing

163
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
and fucking in the snow.

164
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Charlie!

165
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,800
Charlie, come out here now.

166
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,760
The kid never fucking listens.

167
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,520
He never listens, Lizzie.

168
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,880
What do I have to do
to make people fucking listen to me?

169
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,560
Holy fuck.

170
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,560
What do we do now, Tommy, eh?

171
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,800
What do we do?

172
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,400
Lizzie, you go with Arthur to Birmingham.

173
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,640
You stay in the Midland Hotel.

174
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,320
Arthur, call a full meeting for
the board of directors tomorrow at noon.

175
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
A full fucking meeting.

176
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,360
What about today, eh?

177
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,120
What's wrong with today, Tom?

178
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
Need to do some thinking.

179
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,800
Oh. Oh, you do that best
on your own, don't you, eh?

180
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,920
I won't be on my own. I'm never on my own.

181
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,240
Lizzie, you have the driver
come back tomorrow.

182
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:59,120
And Arthur, tell my boy that sometimes,
death is a kindness.

183
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,720
Come on.

184
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,960
<i>What now?</i>

185
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,200
What am I, a genie?

186
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,000
You summon me up
with your little bottle of dope.

187
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,800
I take it for the pain and to keep warm.

188
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,360
Is that what it's for?

189
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,800
The warmth?

190
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,000
The warmth.

191
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,400
All this time...

192
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,080
I know.

193
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,080
Our love still remains.

194
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,720
But you have to listen
to the voices that you hear.

195
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,360
Do what they tell you to do.

196
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,320
Too much to do, Grace.

197
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,120
The kids...

198
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
No need to say goodbye.

199
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
No need to sleep.

200
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,760
Just think, Tom.

201
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,560
- Linda!

202
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,600
Fuck.

203
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,920
Oh.

204
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
There you are, eh?

205
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,640
You're the chairman, Arthur,
so start acting like one.

206
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,640
Chairman, am I? Hmm?

207
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
No.

208
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,320
I'm the fucking doorman, Linda.

209
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
Hmm?

210
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,520
And you ain't coming in here tonight,
love, dressed like that.

211
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,800
Tommy made me the chairman
so that he could stay clean.

212
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,360
It's called an arrangement.

213
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,000
It's an opportunity.

214
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,320
I know who I am, Linda.

215
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,760
I know who I am,
and I'm all right with it.

216
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,000
Finally. Hmm.

217
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,240
I can live with it.

218
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
I need you to be all right with it.

219
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,360
I need you to be all right with it.

220
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,680
Eh?

221
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,080
What is it, eh?

222
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,920
And what do you want, hmm?

223
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,520
Would you want the chairman, do you?

224
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,880
With his fancy briefcase?

225
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
And his gold fountain pen, eh?

226
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,760
Hmm?

227
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,520
What do you want?

228
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,520
Chairman or doorman, hmm?

229
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,320
You think we can fuck and it'll be okay,
and I'll be quiet? Well, I won't.

230
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,120
Every week, your brother's down in London

231
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
making out he's fucking Robin Hood,
champion of the people,

232
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
while you're up here
running the racket for him.

233
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,640
And according to your arrangement,
if anything should happen,

234
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,080
it'd be you who takes the blame,
does the time, or swings for it.

235
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,240
And what do you want?

236
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,560
I want you...

237
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,320
...to take the opportunity

238
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,560
that God and the New York Stock Exchange

239
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,000
-has presented to you.

240
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,840
Mr Shelby, the meeting
will be starting soon.

241
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,840
Yeah, all right.

242
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,120
Be right there.

243
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Thank you, Edna.

244
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,880
And shut the door!

245
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,600
Okay, now.

246
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,600
Hmm. Very nice.

247
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,640
Let's begin.

248
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,680
Yesterday, as you all know,
there was a fucking terrible...

249
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,720
There was a terrible disaster.

250
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,640
Hmm?

251
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,440
It wasn't just for us,
it was for the whole world.

252
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,040
It happened in New York.
That's where it happened.

253
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,200
And it slowly spread to London.

254
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,760
And then to, er, fucking Hong Kong. Hmm?

255
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,080
The whole thing...
The whole thing went up.

256
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,520
Well, actually, the whole thing
went fucking down, but...

257
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,440
We wasn't the only ones hurt by this.

258
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,440
Whole world is hurt, a lot of people.

259
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,440
In the papers.

260
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,400
It's all over the news.
Everyone's talking about it.

261
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,560
Arthur,

262
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
shouldn't we just wait for Thomas?

263
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,840
Polly, Arthur's now
the chairman of the board.

264
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,400
Er, Mr Chairman,
perhaps while we wait for Thomas,

265
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,800
I might lighten the gloom and express,

266
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,600
as a relatively new member
of this company,

267
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,160
what a pleasure it is to be in a boardroom
that has so many females in it.

268
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,360
Yeah, and all are females who are
both... sharp-witted and decorative.

269
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,280
Yeah, well,
we're a very modern company, Mr Greene.

270
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,960
Indeed.

271
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,640
Although, there are still some amongst us
who cling to their old-fashioned values.

272
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,840
How far have we got?

273
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,080
We've established
that ladies are decorative.

274
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,960
We've only just sat down, Tom.

275
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,120
Actually, erm, Arthur has some documents
that he'd like to hand out.

276
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,120
Yeah?

277
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,800
What documents?

278
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,920
I was just explaining
to everyone, Tom, that, erm...

279
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,000
well, we're fucked. Ain't that right, hmm?

280
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,160
Yes and no.

281
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,360
It is true that a large proportion
of the company's funds

282
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,080
were invested in American stocks
and shares.

283
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,320
Invested or hidden?

284
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,480
All investments are approved
by the board, Linda.

285
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,480
Only the ones that went
through the books, Thomas.

286
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,600
Linda, after this meeting, there will be
another meeting, for just family.

287
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,520
Did we vote on this?

288
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Arthur--

289
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,200
"Arthur,
can't you control your wife?"

290
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,400
We are a very modern company, Mr Greene.

291
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,400
To be precise, everything we channelled
through the New York Stock Exchange

292
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,240
is now offering a return
of ten cents to the dollar.

293
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,360
And the Nolan Bank of America,
where we invested our fluidity,

294
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,280
is offering five cents to the dollar
on all deposits.

295
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah.

296
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,520
But there is hope.

297
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Why? What have you got in there,
a magic wand?

298
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,520
As non-executive director of the company,

299
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,920
I need permission from the chairman
to present my strategy to the board.

300
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,360
Permission granted, Tom.

The Peaky Blinders are coming.
The Peaky Blinders are coming.

308
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,680
Micky, the Peaky Blinders are coming.

309
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,920
Ladies and gents. Peaky Blinders
are on the way. Please vacate. Thank you.

310
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,440
- Good to see you.
- Mr Shelby.

311
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,800
- Mr Shelby.
-Yeah.

312
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,360
Thank you for what you did.

313
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,520
What did I do?

314
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,240
He was gonna evict us,
that bastard, Fellows.

315
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,640
Now he's cut our rent in half.

316
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,640
Good. Glad to hear it. Glad to hear it.

317
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,040
That was a strong lesson for him.

318
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,560
How far can we go, Mr Shelby,
with this beautiful dream?

319
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,240
All the way, brother. All the way.

320
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,840
-Revolution, man.
- Yeah.

321
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,680
This crash, Mr Shelby, they're saying
they're gonna cut my hours.

322
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,000
-Yeah? Where do you work?
-Greenhams Engineering.

323
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,040
Greenham Brothers, I know them.
They're not gonna cut your hours.

324
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,840
God bless you. God bless you both.

325
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,000
Enjoy your drink.

326
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,520
Gentlemen and ladies,
if you could all move into the Saloon bar,

327
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,200
where you will all be served
a free pint of Stingo.

328
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,360
Any man who served in France
gets a brandy chaser.

329
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Yeah!

330
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,320
Despite what you're reading
in the newspapers,

331
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,440
I want to hear singing and laughing.

332
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,960
Fuck the stock market!

333
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,400
Fuck the stock market!

334
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,640
They backed the wrong horses.
So fucking what, eh?

335
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,120
Thank you, Mr Shelby.
A politician who gets things done.

336
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,640
You're welcome. You're welcome.

337
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,920
Get down off the furniture.

338
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,360
Sorry, Ada.
I get excited, don't I?

339
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,720
Right...

340
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,720
Can I begin this family meeting
with a proposal?

341
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,920
From now on,
we find somewhere else to meet?

342
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,760
Your husband believes that being seen
mixing with the common people

343
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,240
is good politics.

344
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,600
Hmm. Well, if this is our campaign
for socialism,

345
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,920
perhaps next time, Polly, you won't wear
earrings worth more than the pub.

346
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,680
Right. Family meeting. First item.

347
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,320
This.

348
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,600
Dug out of our Finn's arm yesterday

349
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,120
by Aberama Gold
using your gin and a razor blade.

350
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,800
Finn?

351
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,960
He says they were sent
to Limehouse. Chinatown.

352
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,440
Sent by fucking who?

353
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,040
Sent by me.

354
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,000
I told Finn to stay out of it.
He obviously didn't listen.

355
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Oh, Tommy, sweetheart, I listen to you.

356
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,280
I listen to you when you tell me
no more sport for anyone named Shelby.

357
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,840
I listen to you when you make me promises.

358
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,200
What's in Chinatown, Tommy?
What the fuck is going on?

359
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,880
Fifty thousand pound. In cash.

360
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,720
He said they were sent
to Chinatown to kill somebody.

361
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,000
That kid needs educating,
Tommy, he really does.

362
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,320
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

363
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,120
It was a particular opportunity.

364
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,360
A particular opportunity
presented to me in confidence.

365
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,320
I dealt with it in confidence.

366
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,760
But you told Polly.

367
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,840
Tommy told me that there was a pimp
in East London who sold kids.

368
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,880
Fucking kids, Lizzie, eh? Hmm?

369
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,440
This pimp was blackmailing a senior member
of the House of Lords. A very wealthy man.

370
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,440
Now this pimp is lying in a ditch.

371
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,760
Covered in flies.

372
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,440
World's a better place.

373
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,760
Holy fuck. So now your business
is improving the world.

374
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,760
Sometimes, Ada...

375
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,040
killing is a kindness.

376
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,960
Hmm?

377
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,000
The man we did the job for
is a High Court judge.

378
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,000
We received intelligence from
a senior police officer at Scotland Yard.

379
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,840
I've made lots of new friends in London.
Men with influence.

380
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,400
The police felt the same way
about this pimp as we did.

381
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,520
He wasn't worth a trial.

382
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,120
The coppers cleared the streets for us.

383
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,840
This work was commissioned
by a High Court judge,

384
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,480
by Scotland Yard
and by the House of Lords.

385
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,360
It's a particular opportunity.
It's not to be repeated.

386
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,440
-And it was the right thing to do.
-Fucking right.

387
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,320
Lizzie, you need to understand.

388
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,040
That you tell Polly, not me.

389
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,000
You need to understand

390
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,280
that the corridors of Westminster
are very dimly lit,

391
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,520
and for those who make the rules,
there are no rules.

392
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,600
We own the ropes.
Who's gonna hang us now, eh?

393
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,520
-"We"? We own the ropes, do we?
-Lizzie?

394
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,000
Lizzie, if Finn had listened to me,
you wouldn't have known.

395
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,800
When we go home, I'll explain.

396
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,080
I can't be bothered
with this shit.

397
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,880
-So. Tommy Shelby, MP.

398
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,000
Business as usual.

399
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,480
The strategy I outlined earlier

400
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,760
to rebuild the conventional part
of this business will take time.

401
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,880
In the meantime--

402
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,520
Just business as fucking usual!

403
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
In the meantime,

404
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,600
it is fortunate that we have maintained
other sources of cash income.

405
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,280
Because until the stock market recovers,
cash is king.

406
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,960
And cash we have.

407
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,600
No one is gonna hang you, Tommy.

408
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,000
You're gonna hang yourself.

409
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,000
Someone has to pay for them paintings
on your wall, Ada.

410
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,960
Yeah, bye-bye, Ada.

411
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,600
You need to go easy on Ada.

412
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,560
Polly.

413
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,720
When am I ever not easy on Ada, eh?

414
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,440
Thomas, the thing is, Ada...

415
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,560
-She's pregnant.

416
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,640
Ada's what?

417
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,280
These days, people tell me things
without even speaking.

418
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,360
Wait a minute.

419
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,080
Wait a minute.

420
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,640
Ada's fucking pregnant, hmm?

421
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,920
And Polly, you need to reassure Ada
that it's 1929, times have changed,

422
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,360
we have a lot to do,
and no one gives a fuck who the father is.

423
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,360
Really?

424
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,360
I already know who the father is.

425
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,880
But we've had enough shocks for one day.

426
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,760
Okay.

427
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,840
All right, go on then.
How long you known about Ada, huh?

428
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,200
I know her doctor. He calls me.

429
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,880
Yeah, longer than me.

430
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Have a look at this.

431
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,639
What's that funny writing on there?

432
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,719
Chinese.

433
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,280
Ah. Right.

434
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,679
And what is it, hmm?

435
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Bad news?

436
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,280
Maybe.

437
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,880
- Angels of Retribution?
- Yeah.

438
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,480
Burn the letter they sent.

439
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,239
It's already done.

440
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,480
Look at that, Tom.

441
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,600
Pulled from our brother, eh?

442
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,120
Finally took a first bullet.

443
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,880
No one fucking listens to me.

444
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,440
Here, give it here. I'll keep it for him.

445
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,840
-I still have my first one.
- Yeah.

446
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,680
Arthur, you can tell our comrades
they can come back in.

447
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,840
Where you going, brother?

448
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,040
<i>♪ I really wanna fight for my country</i>
<i>Just like the old boys and Nazis ♪</i>

449
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:48,320
<i>♪ Gotta feel it, know who's the enemy</i>
<i>Execution and familiarity ♪</i>

450
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,240
<i>♪ Man is seeking, damn he's gotta destroy</i>
<i>Comprehend the race war, it's in ploy ♪</i>

451
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,040
<i>♪ Gotta keep that dopamine joy ♪</i>

452
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,760
<i>♪ Man, I gotta feel alive now ♪</i>

453
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,320
The huge losses
on the British stock exchange

454
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,520
will bite into our economy
for the foreseeable future.

455
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,560
I therefore must ask the trade unions
to possess understanding.

456
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,520
The need for their
flexibility and cooperation

457
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
is paramount in the coming months

458
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,680
as we attempt to rebuild
this great nation.

459
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,080
Mr Thomas Shelby.

460
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,760
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

461
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,560
My Right Honourable Friend,
the member for Epping,

462
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,680
asks that following the crash,

463
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,480
trade union members be more flexible
when carrying out their duties.

464
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,480
What he's really asking is that
the working man carry the can.

465
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,640
The grand casino in Monte Carlo
is a small and timid affair

466
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,560
when compared to the wild games of chance
being played in London and New York

467
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,320
by gamblers in silk gloves
and beaver hats,

468
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,960
and when they lose their bets,

469
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,320
turn around and ask
the shoe-shine to pay for it.

470
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Well, on behalf of the shoe-shines
and the can-carriers of South Birmingham

471
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,400
and all across Great Britain,

472
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,800
I would suggest that those
who so recklessly lost their fortunes

473
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,120
on the capitalist lottery

474
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,480
-learn to shine their own shoes...
- Yes.

475
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,480
-...carry their own cans...
-Yes.

476
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,800
...and pay their own bills.

477
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,480
-Yeah!

478
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,320
Er, Mr Shelby?

479
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,080
I just wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your speech.

480
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,680
You speak very eloquently.

481
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,040
Thank you.

482
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,320
My name's Mosley, by the way,
Oswald Mosley.

483
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,200
Yeah, I know who you are.

484
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,160
My constituency borders yours.

485
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,320
And let me just say,
you've come to my attention.

486
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,400
Come.

487
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,480
Ah.

488
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,080
I have bad news, Mister...

489
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,640
Shelby.

490
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,080
We agreed £50,000
on completion of business.

491
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,040
My wife and I have had a misfortune
on the London Exchange.

492
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,280
There's £20,000 there.

493
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,600
You'll have to wait for the rest.

494
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,560
Cavalry, eh?

495
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,120
-Mmm.

496
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,920
Yeah.

497
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,800
I spent a long time
waiting for the cavalry, me.

498
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,880
One time, me and my comrades
waited three days.

499
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,400
When the cavalry finally came,

500
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,800
an officer on the back
of a fine white horse

501
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,000
joked that he'd been delayed

502
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,960
playing a game of whist.

503
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,040
So, I took out my Webley revolver
and I shot him in the head,

504
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,360
stole his horse,
reported him for cowardice.

505
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,480
All for a game of chance.

506
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,800
After my people completed their task
in Chinatown,

507
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,920
they collected all the photographs,

508
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,560
letters and cheques
that were causing you concern.

509
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,520
I now have them in a safe place.

510
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:43,080
On Monday, you will give me
the full £50,000 in cash,

511
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,720
or I will steal your white horse
from under you.

512
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,680
How the fuck did a man like you
get into a position of trust

513
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,800
in a place of power and privilege?

514
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,880
A man like me?

515
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,000
A man like me?

516
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Lord Suckerby,

517
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,520
I've seen the photographs.

518
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,200
Monday.

519
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,360
-Shelby!

520
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,240
Sorry I'm late, Ada.

521
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,760
We've been having briefings
from the Home Office.

522
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,880
The police are concerned about the effect
of the crash in industrial areas.

523
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,200
- Ah.
-Everything all right?

524
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,640
Yeah, fine.

525
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,360
We lost money in New York,
so I've been up late.

526
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,360
Has your brother been busy?

527
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,760
Er, he's had two meetings
with Mr Shapurji Saklatvala,

528
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,760
former communist MP of Battersea.

529
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,520
He's been approached
by an anarchist group in Walsall,

530
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,960
he's setting up a meeting.

531
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,160
And there's talk of a mass walkout
of bus drivers,

532
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,920
Nottingham and Derby,
organised by two communist conveners,

533
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,760
not formally known to Special Branch.

534
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,600
He's also had a telephone conversation
with Jessie Eden,

535
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,200
who is organising a committee
to resist wage cuts across the city,

536
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,760
but he'll report more when he sees her.

537
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,560
It's all in there, though.
Names and everything.

538
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,280
I heard he had the Labour benches
roaring approval in the House today.

539
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,280
Hmm.

540
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,520
If only he meant it, he'd be dangerous.

541
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,080
I didn't know you drank stout, Ada.
I thought it was gin.

542
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,680
Times are hard.

543
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,040
Hmm.

544
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,080
Exactly how much did you lose?

545
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,920
Don't worry about it.
Tommy has a plan.

546
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
He thinks that we can turn the collapse
of the stock exchange to our advantage.

547
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,160
He says, "When others retreat,
you advance."

548
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,800
He says we can wave cash
in the faces of desperate men.

549
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,840
You tell your brother from me,
he's doing excellent work.

550
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,320
I'm told two more military contracts for
vehicles and parts for the army in India

551
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,640
-are on their way to him.
-Yeah.

552
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,360
Er...

553
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,600
Fuck!

554
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,600
Come.

555
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,280
Mr Shelby, this arrived from New York.

556
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,080
It's from Winston Churchill.

557
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,560
He says he was in New York
and had dinner with Charlie Chaplin,

558
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,040
and Chaplin mentioned your name.

559
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,840
So, he's in New York,
and he doesn't mention the crash.

560
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,600
No. Even though, in the bar last night,

561
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,440
Mr Churchill's private secretary reckoned
he lost £75,000 in two hours.

562
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,760
And you?

563
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,000
Were you affected, Mr Shelby?

564
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,720
I'm going to my apartment, Adam.
You lock up.

565
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,840
Sorry, Mr Shelby,
you have one more appointment.

566
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,160
You set it yourself.
It's in the diary from last week.

567
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,120
A journalist from the<i> Times.</i>

568
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,160
He used to be with the <i>Birmingham Mail.</i>
He sent you some questions.

569
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,360
You said you wanted to meet him.

570
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
He's outside.

571
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,720
Yes.

572
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,840
Send him in.

573
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,560
Er, Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the <i>London Times.</i>

574
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
Have a seat.

575
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,320
Adam, you go home. I'll lock up.

576
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,480
Mr Shelby, do you remember me?

577
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,520
No.

578
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,120
Once, in Small Heath, you were
burning photographs of the king.

579
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,680
<i>London Times. </i>You've done well.

580
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,000
As have you, sir.

581
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,960
To put it mildly.

582
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,360
I sent you a list of questions.

583
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,000
Yeah, I misplaced them.

584
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,840
-Yeah, well, you have a lot on your plate.
-Yes.

585
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,720
All I remember is that
your questions interested me.

586
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,640
Oh.

587
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,360
Good.

588
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,960
Sorry, this...

589
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,480
Ah. Here we are.

590
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,960
Yes, erm...

591
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,200
Shall we, erm...

592
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,760
So, Mr Shelby,
traditionally in this country,

593
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,520
print journalists
take no interest in the, er...

594
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,720
in the private lives of politicians.

595
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,240
"Private lives"?

596
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,640
But in these modern times,
especially in America,

597
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,000
journalists are beginning to...

598
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,920
Well, that is to say, yes, erm, shall I...

599
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,720
So, readers are beginning to say...

600
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,880
Want to know more about
the men who represent them.

601
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,600
Of course.

602
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,520
In these modern times.

603
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,240
Whereas, before, it would have been
seen as ungentlemanly

604
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,680
to ask a public figure questions about
personal matters or business affairs--

605
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,640
Oh, well, no need to worry.

606
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,640
I'm no gentleman.

607
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,400
Hmm.

608
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,040
Er, Mr Shelby, as I said in my letter,

609
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,440
ten years ago, I was a journalist
on the<i> Birmingham Evening Mail.</i>

610
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,400
And, of course, working in that city,
it was impossible not to know your name.

611
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,560
And your reputation.

612
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,360
So, when I saw that you had been elected
as a Socialist--

613
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,360
You reflected on the fact
that working people

614
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,000
can indeed change their lives
for the better.

615
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,640
Channel their abilities in new directions.
Discover better methods.

616
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,200
Aim for happier outcomes.

617
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,680
Even win awards for industry.

618
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,040
You can write this down, Mr Levitt.

619
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,040
The question I have for you,
Mr Shelby, is this.

620
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,320
Was your conversion from bookmaker
to socialist politician

621
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,520
a gradual thing, or...

622
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,840
-a road to Damascus experience?

623
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
Yeah.

624
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,160
Now I hear that question.

625
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,200
I remember receiving your letters,

626
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,400
and I distinctly remember
your use of the word "bookmaker".

627
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,920
Er... You...
Were you not a bookmaker, sir?

628
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,920
Yes. I gained a licence in 1919
for on-track betting.

629
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,160
But since 1923, I've made my fortune

630
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,320
in the manufacture,
sale and export of motorcars.

631
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,880
And lately, gin.

632
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,840
And lately, three new homes
for orphaned children.

633
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,120
You can write all this down, Mr Levitt.

634
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,680
I have another question, Mr Shelby.

635
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,920
In Birmingham,
at the time that I was there...

636
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,000
there was a Major Campbell.

637
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,720
He was found dead.

638
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,360
A member of your family was charged.

639
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,960
All right, you answer me this.
Answer me this.

640
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,960
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

641
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,480
Is it evolution or revolution?

642
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,480
And what is it about
working-class men like me,

643
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,600
standing up in the House of Commons
and speaking from the heart?

644
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,840
What is it that so troubles you
that you would try to undermine me?

645
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,080
I am talking about specific events, sir.

646
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,240
Which I don't recall.

647
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,160
With which I was never personally linked.

648
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,240
And after which,
all convictions were quashed.

649
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,680
Yeah, now I...
I recall receiving your letter.

650
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,080
And I recall that when I did,

651
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,320
I asked a colleague of mine
to carry out some research.

652
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,680
Just a moment.

653
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,280
Here we are.

654
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,480
Ah.

655
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,880
Michael Levitt, correct?

656
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

657
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,880
Journalist.

658
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,800
Unmarried.

659
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,680
Apartment in Maida Vale.

660
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,680
An apartment opposite
the Underground station.

661
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,840
"Unmarried" is underlined.

662
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,840
"Mr Levitt enjoys walks in the park.

663
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,160
Sometimes alone.

664
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,560
Sometimes not alone.

665
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,040
Sometimes with other men."

666
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,200
"Sometimes with other men."

667
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,560
I'm old-fashioned, Michael.

668
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,600
I believe private lives
should remain private.

669
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,880
Not everything modern is good, now, is it?

670
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,080
You gonna write this down...
in your little fucking book?

671
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,280
Well?

672
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,640
Not yet. I didn't tell him.

673
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,960
Him knowing or not knowing
has no relevance to what we are drinking.

674
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,560
It's vintage.

675
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,480
-Fuck it.

676
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,640
This... is for us.

677
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,280
Let's drink to the baby.

678
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,640
Polly, do you remember
when I was last pregnant?

679
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,240
You were gonna take me to Cardiff.

680
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,640
I was gonna get rid of it.

681
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,160
What about this time?

682
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,720
Imagine.

683
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,680
The father's scared.

684
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,400
He runs away.

685
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,200
You're left.

686
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,920
Oh, sweetheart.

687
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:34,880
The baby's black, he's a bastard,
and it's Birmingham.

688
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,960
But you don't care...

689
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,480
because the world has changed.

690
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,000
And the baby's eyes are golden.

691
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,320
And you're gonna leave her with Aunt Polly
every day to look after.

692
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,160
Aunt Polly who insisted
that you called her Elizabeth.

693
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,360
How do you know it's a "her"?

694
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,520
'Cause I'm Polly Gray.

695
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,080
It's a girl?

696
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,680
Golden.

697
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,000
To be born in the year 1930,

698
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,760
where everything will be changed
for the better.

699
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,400
She'll be the colour of a Hollywood Oscar.

700
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,240
What will Tommy say?

701
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,960
Tommy knows.

702
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,920
Hmm.

703
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,880
He's also seen that the world's big
and round, and he says, "So what?"

704
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,480
Tommy is right, you know, Ada.

705
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,640
We are flying above the rules now.

706
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,840
We're bold people, aren't we, Polly?

707
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,840
That's the beauty.

708
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,440
Hello, Cyril.

709
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,920
At least you're still talking to me.

710
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,120
Where is everyone?

711
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,960
Your wife is upstairs with Ruby.

712
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,640
You know, Frances,

713
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,400
if there were to be a snap election
in this house today,

714
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,560
wouldn't win it.

715
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,960
Even if I were running
against the devil himself.

716
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,880
Oh.

717
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,360
-I gathered.
-Hmm.

718
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,800
Where's Charles?

719
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,000
Charles is in the stable.

720
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,960
Thank you.

721
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,520
Did Arthur explain?

722
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,360
He said it's God's will.

723
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,120
But you're not God!

724
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,840
No, I'm not God.

725
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,920
Not yet.
