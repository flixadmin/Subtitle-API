Now, when I came in here, Mr Solomons,

157
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
I stopped to tie my shoelace.
Isn't that a fact?

158
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Ollie?

159
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,800
I stopped to tie my shoelace.

160
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,240
And while I was doing it,

161
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,720
I laid a hand grenade
on one of your barrels,

162
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,920
Mark 15, with wired trip.

163
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,400
And my friend upstairs...

164
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,240
Well, he's like one of those anarchists
that blew up Wall Street, you know?

165
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,640
He's a professional.

166
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,640
And he's in charge of the wire.

167
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,920
If I don't walk out that door
on the stroke of 7:00,

168
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,120
he's going to trigger the grenade and...

169
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,200
...your very combustible rum
will blow us all to hell.

170
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,720
And I don't care...

171
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,920
...'cause I'm already dead.

172
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,920
He tied his lace, Alfie.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,560
-And there is a kid at the door.
-From a good family, too.

174
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,080
Ollie, it's shocking what they become...

175
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,120
What were you doing when this happened?

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,200
He tied his lace, nothing else.

177
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,600
Yeah, but what were you doing?

178
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,800
I was marking the runners in the paper.

179
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,360
What are you doing?

180
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,920
Just checking the time. Carry on.

181
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,720
Right, Ollie, I want you to go outside,
yeah, and shoot that boy in the face

182
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,320
from the good family, all right?

183
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,720
Anyone walks through that door
except me, he blows the grenade.

184
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,920
-He tied his fucking lace...
-I did tie my lace.

185
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,280
I bet, 100 to 1,

186
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,480
you're fucking lying, mate.
That's my money.

187
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,800
Well, see, you've failed
to consider the form.

188
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,120
I did blow up me own pub...

189
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
-...for the insurance.
-(SIGHS HEAVILY)

190
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,480
ALFIE: OK right...
Well, considering the form,

191
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,760
I would say 65 to 1. Very good odds.

192
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,960
And I would be more than happy
and agree

193
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,480
if you were to sign over
65o/o of your business to me.

194
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,520
-Thank you.
-Sixty-five? No deal.

195
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,400
-Ollie, what do you say?
-Jesus Christ, Alfie.

196
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,360
He tied his fucking lace, I saw him!

197
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,000
-Mmm-hmm.
-He planted a grenade, I know he did.

198
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,160
Alfie, it's Tommy fucking Shelby...

(OLLIE BREATHING HEAVILY)

You're behaving like a fucking child.

This is a man's world.

202
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,880
Take your apron off,

203
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,040
and sit in the corner like a little boy.

204
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,880
Fuck off. Now.

-Four minutes.
-All right, four minutes.

-(TOMMY CLEARS THROAT)
-Talk to me about hand grenades.

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,880
The chalk mark on the barrel,
at knee height.

208
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,480
It's a Hamilton Christmas.

209
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,640
I took out the pin
and put it on the wire.

210
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,200
(EXHALES)

211
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
Based on this...

212
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,600
...forty-five percent.

213
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
-Thirty.
-Oh, fuck off, Tommy.

214
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
That's far too little.

215
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,040
In France, Mr Solomons,
while I was a tunneller, a clay-kicker.

216
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
179.

217
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,400
I blew up Schwaben Höhe.

218
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,040
Same kit I'm using today.

219
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,640
It's funny, that.

220
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,360
I do know the 179.

221
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,480
And I heard they all got buried.

222
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,640
Three of us dug ourselves out.

223
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,760
Like you're digging yourself out now?

224
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,960
Like I'm digging now.

225
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,040
Fuck me.

Thirty-five.

How the fuck did you
get me out of that?

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,880
I need you today, brother.

233
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
I pulled some strings.

-You all right?
-I am now.

235
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,160
So Arthur's back in charge now?

236
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,960
He's in charge of you,
and you're both in charge of him.

237
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,280
Look-out duties only today.

-Captain?
-Ah, we promoted you.

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,240
Well, the boys decided you're no longer
like a Sergeant Major.

245
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,160
Fucking those rich women
and using those fancy words.

246
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,720
I'd say you're more like a captain
these days.

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,600
Fine, well, I'll take it
as a compliment.

out of your hair and your clothes.

It's what I should have done

-Very good.

on a racetrack these days

292
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,840
with a loaded weapon, you get 20 years.

293

That's all right.
Today, you won't get lifted.

294
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,280
Because today, there will be
no coppers around to lift you.

295
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,640
At exactly 3:00, there will be
an incident in the owners' enclosure

296
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,320
and all the coppers on the track
will be diverted. All of them.

297
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,440
They will be looking for someone.

-So you will be free to operate at will.
-Looking for who?

299
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,040
Me. They will be looking for me.

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,720
Now, while the coppers are busy with me,

301

you will make your move
on Sabini's pitches.

302
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,120
You will confiscate his takings,
you'll destroy his licences,

303
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,440
and you do it at gunpoint.

304
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,320
He usually has police protection,
so they won't be armed.

305
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,080
We should aim to complete the takeover
without a shot being fired, understood?

306
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,560
And remember, the licences are
more important than the takings.

do not make a move until 3:00.
