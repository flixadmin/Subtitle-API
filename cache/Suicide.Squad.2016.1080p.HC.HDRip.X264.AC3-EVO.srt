3
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:39,767
Chow time!

4
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:40,956
It's time!

5
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,651
Floyd, step up to the door.
Dinner time.

6
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,939
Only my friends call me Floyd.

7
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:52,254
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

8
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,852
What's that?

9
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:56,122
That is called loaf.

10
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:56,743
A loaf!

11
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,169
It's got a little bit of pasghetti in there.

12
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:00,754
Toenails.

13
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:02,416
Rat shit.

14
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:04,478
Everything a growing fella needs, like you.

15
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:09,127
- Come hear. Can I tell you something? Can I tell a secret?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:11,108
One day...

17
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:14,011
Somehow, Someway,
I'm gonna get outta here.

18
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:18,726
And I'm gonna rain down on you,
like the Holy Ghost.

19
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,447
Man, you just threatened a staff number.

20
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:23,361
Yeah?

21
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:24,711
Yeah, you have.

22
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:25,821
Do something.

23
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:28,079
Let's have some fun.

24
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,439
Open a goddamn gate!

25
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,465
Come on guys. Don't waste my time.

26
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:04,242
Sector C! Pat attention!
Boss is on deck!

27
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:08,504
Open!

28
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:11,102
Bravo 14, Open perimeter fence.
Stay Back!

29
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:13,633
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

30
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:17,139
You gonna come down from there or what?

31
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:21,576
Look at you.

32
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:25,930
You know the rules, hotness.

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,506
You gotta keep off these bars.

34
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,347
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

35
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:32,676
Oh, my good.

36
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:37,084
You are really in bad shape upstairs, lady!

37
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:38,989
Can you come in here and tell me that?

38
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,518
Or are you too scared?

39
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,500
Come on, I'm bored.

40
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,352
I'm bored, play with me.

41
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:47,352
You put five of my guards in the hospital, honey.

42
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:49,373
No one's gonna play with you.

43
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:51,238
You sleep on the ground.

44
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,313
I sleep where I want, when I want, with who I want.

45
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:58,715
Oh man. I love you.

46
00:02:58,716 --> 00:02:59,787
Alpha one...

47
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:01,001
hit her<.i>

48
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,063
Come on man. You're 66 foot four.
She's a tiny little girl.

49
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,377
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

50
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:11,854
We got chocolate, strawberry or vanilla.

51
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,331
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

52
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,441
Spring break!

53
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,145
That is just a whole lot of pretty in a whole lot of crazy.

54
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:51,121
The world changed when Superman
flew across the sky.<.i>

55
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,099
And it changed again when he didn't.

56
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,317
Remember.

57
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:07,415
And that is why I'm here.<.i>

Hello Amanda.

60
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,578
We lose a national hero...

61
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:32,709
but you sit there looking like the cat that ate the canary.

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,239
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

63
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:37,424
It's taken some work.

64
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:40,888
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

65
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,342
There's rumors, Amanda...

66
00:04:45,032 --> 00:04:47,035
Some of them have abilities.

67
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,676
The rumors are right.

68
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:51,878
You know what a problem with a metahuman is?

69
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,233
The human part.

70
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:56,203
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.

71
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,181
The next Superman might not.

72
00:04:58,578 --> 00:04:59,802
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

73
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,764
I'm fighting fire with fire.

74
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:06,072
You are not going to pitch us that Task Force X project of yours again, are you?

75
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,483
Yes.

76
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,509
But this time, you're gonna listen.

77
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:14,613
Floyd Lawton, AKA Deadshot.

78
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:33,364
He is the most wanted hitman in the world.<.i>

79
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:40,373
Let's say he has an elite clientele.

80
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:43,396
- What?
- Hey Angelo.

81
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:46,751
This is the exterminator you called for your rat problem.

82
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,139
My account's looking a little thin.

83
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:52,317
No one gets paid until what needs to get done, gets done.<.i>

84
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,807
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, No honey.

85
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:59,056
Wow! Here is your boy right now.

86
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,027
With about 20 of his new best friends.

87
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:08,391
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

88
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,988
Listen. Stop being cute and do your job!

89
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,604
They're taking him outta the car now.

90
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:16,855
In about 30 seconds, your window is gonna close forever.

91
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,123
Okay, Okay, Okay. Relax.

92
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,692
There was an accounting error.

93
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:21,853
We sent it.

94
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,412
Now double it for being an dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.

95
00:06:25,783 --> 00:06:29,399
- We're not the kind of people you play with.
- Did you threaten me?

96
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:32,069
This dude's gonna get a sore throat.
From all the singing he's about to do.

97
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,263
You son of a bitch.

98
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:37,852
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

99
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:59,918
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

100
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:04,244
His is an 11-year-old honor student in Gotham city.
His daughter.

101
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:06,703
So we watched her and waited.

102
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,530
You should talk to Mama more.

103
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:10,603
Yeah, yeah. I know.

104
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,583
Mama stays in bed a lot.

105
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,905
Yeah. She's still going out at night?

106
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:17,994
Dad, it's okay, I can take care of her.

107
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,366
I know how to make pancakes now.

108
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,165
Hey babe, That's beautiful.

109
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:27,112
She's supposed to be taking care of you.
That's how that's supposed to work.

110
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:31,289
I want you to come and live with me.

111
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:35,797
All right? I came into some resources. I'mma get us spot.

112
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,069
It's gonna be nice, all right?

113
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:41,353
Mama says I can't live with you because you kill people.

114
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,682
That's not true, That's a lie. She is lying to you.

115
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,014
Daddy...

116
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:48,204
I know you do bad things.

117
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:51,278
Don't worry. I still love you.

118
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,823
Come on.

119
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:57,689
And you caught him?

120
00:07:57,807 --> 00:07:58,860
Not me.

121
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:02,069
I just gave an anonymous tip the right guy in the Gotham city.

122
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:03,841
I'mma figure this out.

123
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,743
All right?

124
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,308
It's over, Headshot.

125
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,412
I do not want to do this
in front of your daughter.

126
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,980
- Daddy, please.
- Zoe, move!

127
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,845
Please daddy. Don't do it.

128
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,975
Please.

129
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,743
Don't do it.

130
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,062
All right.

131
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:56,843
Love you, daddy.

132
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,646
So now we have the man who never misses.

133
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:00,886
Where'd you put him?

134
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:03,917
Let's just say. I put him in a hole and threw away the hole.

135
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,218
Harley Quinn.

136
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,266
Before she ran off and joined the circus...

137
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:20,104
She was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.<.i>

138
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:22,459
A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.<.i>

139
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,362
She was assigned to The Clown himself.

140
00:09:26,694 --> 00:09:29,135
Dr. Quinzel.

141
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,937
You know, I lived for these moments with you.

142
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:33,546
What do you get?

143
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:34,871
I got you a kitty.

144
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:36,926
So thoughtful.

145
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:38,687
She thought she was curing him ...<.i>

146
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,920
But, She was falling in love.<.i>

147
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:44,246
There is something you could do
for me...

148
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:45,263
Doctor.

149
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:46,607
Anything. I mean, yeah.

150
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:50,728
I need a machine gun.

151
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,227
A Machine gun?

152
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:58,027
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

153
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,343
Get off me!

154
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:17,432
What do we have here?

155
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:21,252
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me Mr.J?

156
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:22,385
What?

157
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,312
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya

158
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,006
I'm just gonna hurt ya...

159
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:33,790
really, really bad.

160
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:35,682
You think so?

161
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:38,083
Well, I can take it.

162
00:10:45,823 --> 00:10:48,611
They became the king and the queen of Gotham city.<.i>

163
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:52,072
And god help anyone who disrespected the queen.

164
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,463
- We finally meet.
- He ain't shake hands.

165
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,612
But sit down and have a drink.

166
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,152
Hey, J.

167
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,500
On behalf of everybody, welcome back.

168
00:11:06,563 --> 00:11:09,320
I wanted to come by and
personally say thank you.

169
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:12,308
You're making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

170
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,768
Are you sweet talkin' me?

171
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,797
I love this guy.

172
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:23,250
He's so intense!

173
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:30,176
You're lucky man.

174
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:32,570
You got a bad bitch.

175
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:37,273
Oh, that she is.

176
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:40,007
The fire in my loins.

177
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:43,149
The itch in my pants.

178
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,546
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

179
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:01,038
Oh, come to Daddy.

180
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:02,912
Puddin"!

181
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:09,836
Listen! You are my gift to this handsome hunka hunka!

182
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:13,190
You belong to him now.

183
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,905
You're cute!

184
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,147
You want me?

185
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:24,502
I'm all yours.

186
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:27,699
I don't want no beef.

187
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:29,995
You don't want no beef?
You don't want ..

188
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:32,443
Why, what's wrong? ( Dont't wanna beef?)
You don't like me?

189
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,257
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

190
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,586
This is your lady.

191
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,709
Look, are you enjoying yourself?

192
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,636
No.

193
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,646
- That's your lady, Joker!
- That's right!

194
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:45,983
You, J!

195
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:51,522
And, That was just the beginning.<.i>

196
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:02,389
Come on, Puddin". Do it!

197
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,466
Oh...

198
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:09,326
- We have got company.
- Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

199
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:13,229
She is crazier than him.<.i>

200
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,006
And more fearless.<.i>

201
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:18,557
Stupid Bat, You're ruining date night!

202
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:22,073
Puddin...

203
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:27,817
Puddin", I can't swimmmmm!

204
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:05,637
And the Bat got her, too.<.i>

205
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,892
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.<.i>

206
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:24,355
And then there's the Aussie.

207
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,941
Digger Harkness.

208
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:29,867
Or as the tabloids call him: Capitan Boomerang.<.i>

209
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:39,744
We're gonna be rich.

210
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:43,258
Yeah, you and me, mate.
Go and get the car.

211
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,126
He robbed every bank in Australia. At least once.<.i>

212
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:49,085
Then he came to America for a fresh target set.

213
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,190
Doesn't work well with others.

214
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,109
No honor among thieves, ha?

215
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:05,204
But he tangled with a metahuman and,
lived to tell about it.

216
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:08,929
And have you heard of the pyro kinetic homeboy?

217
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,964
How'd you catch him?

218
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,217
We did not. He surrendered.

219
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:21,788
Chato Santana. On the street they call him El Diablo.

220
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,740
This LA gangbanger thought
he was the king of the world ...<.i>

221
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,406
until he lost his queen.<.i>

222
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:32,912
Gets jumped in prison riot and
incinerates half the yard.

223
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,206
The security video is incredible.

224
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:40,484
Oh, Jesus.

225
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:43,586
- What the hell is that?
- His name is Waylon Jones.

226
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,981
KC, dinner.

227
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:47,612
Open it up, B.

228
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,923
Evolution took a step backwards with this one.<.i>

229
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:53,265
Give me that, Smitty.

230
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:55,447
Where you at?

231
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,874
They call him Killer Croc.<.i>

232
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:02,956
He looked like a monster.<.i>

233
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:05,464
So they treated him like a monster.<.i>

234
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:09,048
Then he became a monster.<.i>

235
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:13,121
He was chased out of Gotham by the bat.

236
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,861
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

237
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,553
He never found it.

238
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:27,861
I saved the best for last.

239
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:30,224
- The witch.
- A witch?

240
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:33,648
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.

241
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:36,830
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

242
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,385
Archaeologist doctor June Moone ...<.i>

243
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,824
Wondered into the wrong cave.

244
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,598
June...

245
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:00,711
She opened something she shouldn't have ...<.i>

246
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:15,486
releasing a metahuman more powerful
than any we've encountered.

247
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:18,075
The Enchantress.

248
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,622
She inhabits Dr.Moone's body now.<.i>

249
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:27,893
Where is this witch?

250
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:29,558
In my pocket.

251
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,958
Now tell him why she won't turn you into a frog.

252
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,706
Some say the witch has
a secret buried heart...

253
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,389
and whoever finds it, can control the witch.<.i>

254
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,441
So we searched the cave where she turned up ...<.i>

255
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,207
and we found her heart.<.i>

256
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:46,040
That thing's her heart?

257
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:48,564
She is vulnerable without it.

258
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,976
You want to put our national security in the hands of...

259
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:54,370
witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?

260
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,213
- Don't forget about the Joker's girlfriend.
- These are villains Amanda.

261
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:59,297
What makes you think you can control them?

262
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:02,576
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interests...

263
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,273
for the national security of the U.S is what I do for a living.

264
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:10,611
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced...

265
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,116
Colonel Rick Flag.<.i>

266
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:36,836
Help me.

267
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:40,376
I assigned him to watch Dr.Moone,
and just as I hoped ...<.i>

268
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:42,171
it got personal.<.i>

269
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:44,229
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

270
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,866
I have the witch's heart.

271
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,989
And Dr.Moone has his.

272
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,223
Now he'll follow my orders as Holy Writ.

273
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,275
In a world of flying men and monsters...

274
00:18:57,413 --> 00:19:00,143
this is the only way to protect our country.

275
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:09,627
What if Superman had decided to fly down,
rip off the roof of the White House...

276
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,750
and grab the president of the US right out of the Overall office?

277
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:14,818
Who would've stopped him?

278
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,211
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea...

279
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,695
anthrax in our mail. We got fluoride in our water.

280
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:24,796
But what happens if
the next Superman...

281
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:26,892
becomes a terrorist?

282
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,873
Amanda Waller has a plan.
Amanda?

283
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:33,820
I want to build a team of some very bad people
who I think can do some good.

284
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:36,541
Like fight a next war,
defeat the next Superman.

285
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:38,090
Not on my watch.

286
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,722
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

287
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:45,771
General, we run them covertly non-attributed.
Strictly need to know.

288
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:48,571
And if they get caught,
we throw them under [???]

289
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:53,113
The next war will be fought
with these meta humans. Ours or Theirs.

290
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:55,694
We're not the only ones kicking up rocks looking for them.

291
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,993
You know we can't control these people.

292
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,013
June, Be strong!

293
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,592
Dr.Moone.

294
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:34,517
Enchantress.

295
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,740
Meet the Enchantress.

296
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:54,001
Everything we know about her,
is in your briefing packs.

297
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:56,853
She's walked this earth
for a very long time...

298
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:59,298
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

299
00:20:59,364 --> 00:21:01,999
This meeting is... is now a magic show?

300
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:05,264
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

301
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:09,571
Go get it, girl.

302
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:29,195
How about a little something from
the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

303
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:41,472
We've been chasing these plans for years.

304
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:45,742
Please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

305
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:47,917
Thank you. We'd like Dr.Moone back.

306
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:49,943
Enchantress.

307
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,034
Please, Please.

308
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:04,555
I'm sorry. I can'... I can't do that again.
I can'...

309
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:06,243
Flag, get her out of here.

310
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,008
I move to...

311
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:15,791
authorize Amanda Waller to establish
"Task Force X" under the Argus program.

312
00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:19,064
All right.

313
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:21,707
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

314
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,143
Welcome to Belle Reve, special security barracks.
How you doing man?

315
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:38,277
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She is in charge.

316
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,386
Welcome, ma'am.
How are you?

317
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,565
I'm here to assist you in anyway.

318
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:44,451
Where are they?

319
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,450
Are you the Devil?

320
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:08,631
Maybe.

321
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:39,721
Ain't you scared?

322
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:47,016
Why'd they put you down here?

323
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,333
I asked.

324
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:56,178
You. Ese<.i>

325
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:58,204
Hola, amigo.<.i>

326
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:02,067
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

327
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:15,513
What's up? Hey, you want some of this?<.i>

328
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:16,972
Then come down here.

329
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,322
That ain't me.

330
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:20,424
That wasn't you?

331
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,405
Nah, they say it's me, but that ain't me.

332
00:24:22,406 --> 00:24:23,733
That guy's gone.

333
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,234
He's dead.

334
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:26,765
And yet, here you are.

335
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:27,424
Ma'am.

336
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,896
Let me try to talk to him.

337
00:24:33,885 --> 00:24:35,840
You wanna die in here buddy?

338
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:38,623
You got a real shot at
walking at the block again.

339
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,575
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.

340
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:42,898
A Women.

341
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:44,110
Look, man...

342
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:46,937
You ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

343
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:48,472
Ask what?

344
00:24:48,665 --> 00:24:50,251
I'm a man. Okay?

345
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:52,486
I ain't no weapon.

346
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:55,638
I'mmna die in peace before
I raise my fists again.

347
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:58,959
I've caused enough harm.

348
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:09,388
All right, unlock him.

349
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,630
What?

350
00:25:10,753 --> 00:25:11,812
You heard me.

351
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:13,097
You know what this man can do?

352
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:16,467
I'm here to find out.
Lose the restraints.

353
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:22,719
OK.

354
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,984
What is this?

355
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:27,022
Cheerleading tryouts?

356
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:29,120
Let's go. Let's see what you can do.

357
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:31,131
They say you never missed a shot.

358
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,501
Prove it.

359
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:47,125
Now you got one in the chamber.

360
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:48,907
What you gonna do with it?

361
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:51,394
- Hhhh... Hey.
- Shit.

362
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,215
Give me the word, boss.
I'll drop him.

363
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:54,384
Everybody calm down.

364
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,411
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

365
00:25:56,412 --> 00:25:57,619
Tell them: "Put it down".

366
00:25:57,892 --> 00:25:58,113
Stand down.

367
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,768
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

368
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:02,602
What's for dinner?

369
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:04,611
Ames, if this man shoots me...

370
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:06,487
I want you to kill him...

371
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,118
And I want you to go and clear my browser history.

372
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:11,510
See...

373
00:26:12,328 --> 00:26:14,299
the firing pin is filed down, right?

374
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,875
Mag full of dummy rounds.

375
00:26:16,018 --> 00:26:17,977
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

376
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:19,589
You're absolutely right.

377
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:22,478
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

378
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,083
Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.

379
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:27,562
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

380
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:29,572
I've known you, like, nine months.

381
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:32,330
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was real cookie.

382
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:36,397
What?

383
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,614
Y'all Jokers must be crazy.

384
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:33,966
All right.
Now you know what you're buyin'.

385
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:35,992
Let me tell you the price. First...

386
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:37,699
I want outta here.

387
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:41,024
Second, I want full custody of my daughter.

388
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:43,095
All right?
And her mom can have, like...

389
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,220
supervised visits. But, her boyfriend can't come.

390
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:47,725
Darnell can't come.

391
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:49,361
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

392
00:27:49,606 --> 00:27:52,443
Third, y'all gonna pay for my daughter's whole education.

393
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,198
Best schools.
And then I want her to go to college.

394
00:27:55,447 --> 00:27:57,011
Like Harvard. Or Yale.

395
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,929
- So Ivy league.
- Ivy league, yeah.

396
00:27:58,945 --> 00:28:00,452
One of them big joints, you know?

397
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,547
And if she can't cut it...

398
00:28:02,653 --> 00:28:06,392
and her grades start slipping, I need you to
white-people that thing. You know how y'all do.

399
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:08,001
- Oh yeah.
- You know, right? Ok.

400
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,588
Now that's my price.
But I'm concerned...

401
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:12,634
'cause I don't see
nobody writing shit down.

402
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:15,579
You're in no position
to make any demands.

403
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:18,711
Oh. I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.

404
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,305
No, errand boy.

405
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,341
I'm talking to your boss.

406
00:28:24,226 --> 00:28:25,773
That's my price, sweetie.

407
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,495
You know what it is.

408
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:33,247
You notice these are criminals?

409
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:37,296
They're psychotic antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

410
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,401
Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you...

411
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,286
a team of pipe hitters who'll do
anything you can dream up.

412
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,634
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

413
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:46,330
In WW2, the US Navy made a deal with he mafia...

414
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:48,252
to protect its ships on the waterfront.

415
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,551
This ain't WW2.

416
00:28:49,683 --> 00:28:51,325
It's WW3.

417
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:53,159
What are you really up to?

418
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,098
It's a "need-to-know", and, all you
need to know is you work for me.

419
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,879
That can change with a phone call.

420
00:28:58,064 --> 00:28:59,353
I have friends, too. You know.

421
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:03,421
There you go. Call'em.

422
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,325
But without you minding
her, your lady friend stays

423
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:09,297
here strapped to a board
in a drug-induced coma.

424
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:12,365
They warned me about you.

425
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:16,384
I didn't believe the stories.

426
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,448
Nobody does.

427
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:34,679
Where is she?

428
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:37,737
It's complex. This is not just her.

429
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,578
Everybody's disappeared.

430
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:42,201
This new law,
where if you're a bad enough, bad guy

431
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:43,724
they stamp "Terrorist" on your jacket.

432
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,599
They send you to this swamp in Louisiana.

433
00:29:47,074 --> 00:29:48,302
A black site.

434
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,209
That's where she is.

435
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,227
So what are we doni'?

436
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:56,294
Bring the car around.

437
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:59,115
We're going for a drive.

438
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:21,386
Lester! Lester!
Hit me one more time!

439
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:23,491
Come on, Man.

440
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:26,412
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10k.

441
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,434
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

442
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,642
Good job, Man.

443
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,873
He's killin' it.

444
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,327
Come on Man. Why am I here?

445
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,384
All right! Yeah! I'm down.
I get it! All right?

446
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:44,509
I've had run of bad decks.
Not my fault.

447
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:45,491
All right?

448
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:47,345
Dude, this is real.

449
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,851
I had to stop these guys from burning down
your house with your kids in it.

450
00:30:55,424 --> 00:30:56,760
But, you're lucky.

451
00:30:57,468 --> 00:30:59,492
Maybe. Why do you think so?

452
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:05,406
You. Slick, what's up?

453
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:08,340
Griggs. You are ...?

454
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,366
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

455
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:11,781
Can I go, man?

456
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:12,955
What the hell's going on, man?

457
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,357
This is crazy.

458
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,045
All of that chitchat's gonna get you hurt.

459
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:24,315
My God!!!

460
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:46,368
I could tell you meant that.

461
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,531
Yeah.

462
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:53,262
You're gonna be my friend.

463
00:32:09,365 --> 00:32:11,617
Enchantress.

464
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:25,719
- Log time of death. 16:20
- June?

465
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,369
- Let's get her down to the morgue.
- June?

466
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:31,690
June?

467
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:33,495
June.

468
00:32:35,032 --> 00:32:36,177
June.

469
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,210
What did you do?

470
00:32:43,082 --> 00:32:44,023
OK.

471
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,776
Sister.

472
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:17,243
Brother.

473
00:33:21,177 --> 00:33:23,633
Pus, it could be the routing number.

474
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:25,744
Wanna go for drinks?

475
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,097
Brother I have freed you.

476
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:43,815
Where are we?

477
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:47,673
The same world only much later.

478
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:51,281
What happened?

479
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:55,509
The humans turned against us.

480
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:59,112
But they worshipped us?

481
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:02,149
We were gods to them.

482
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:05,619
Now they worship machines.

483
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,315
So I will build a machine.

484
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:13,366
That will destroy them all.

485
00:34:14,107 --> 00:34:15,913
Build your strength.

486
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:17,206
Feed on them.

487
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:20,173
And wait for me to return.

488
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:25,335
Enchantress.

489
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:29,254
God damn it!

490
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:32,648
June! June!

491
00:34:34,968 --> 00:34:36,545
June! I'm sorry.

492
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,112
She went somewhere.

493
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:53,338
If you have to choose between her or me...

494
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:55,023
stop her.

495
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,289
Promise me you'll stop her.

496
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,631
Even if it kills me.

497
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:30,398
Sir!

498
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,068
Sir, You okay?

499
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:33,408
Can you breathe?

500
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:35,306
Did you take anything?

501
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:38,638
This is 21. Send medical to my location.

502
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:40,520
I'm a physician.

503
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:42,624
Roger. Bringing medical to your location.<.i>

504
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:44,986
No pulse. Starting compressions.

505
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,426
Sir.

506
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,252
Midway city is under attack.

507
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:16,572
It's a non-human entity.

508
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,414
I think you know what to do, sir.

509
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:20,466
Activate Task Force X...

510
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,493
and get Amanda Waller and her whole circus on scene ASAP.
(ASAP = as soon as possible)

511
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:24,006
Sir.

512
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,339
We're gonna live with Task Force X. Pull'em.

513
00:36:33,762 --> 00:36:35,626
Prisoners, get down on your knees. Now!

514
00:36:35,722 --> 00:36:37,574
Down on your knees! Hands in the air!
Turn around.

515
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:38,414
Hands up high!

516
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:40,105
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

517
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,277
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

518
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:46,427
Do not fire that goddamn weapon!

519
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:49,166
Damn it!

520
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,459
Open the gate!

521
00:36:52,622 --> 00:36:54,303
Everybody, line up for extraction.

522
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,182
Let's go! Let's move, move!

523
00:36:56,844 --> 00:36:59,210
Yeah! Open the door! Let's go!

524
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:06,683
Hit him!

525
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:08,335
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

526
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:10,800
Where you at?

527
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:19,069
Is that the new guy?

528
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:24,863
What is that?

529
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:26,426
What is that?

530
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:28,496
- Who are you?
- Standby. Arming device.

531
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:29,655
Who are you? I don't know who you are.

532
00:37:29,758 --> 00:37:30,516
Device armed.

533
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:33,214
Hey... I'm talking to you.
Hey... I'm talking to you.

534
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:35,254
Injection Successful.

535
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,406
Location verified.

536
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,255
Anybody who touches me is dead.

537
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:41,611
Anybody who...

538
00:37:42,212 --> 00:37:43,212
lady.

539
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:44,649
Injection Successful.

540
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:47,468
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

541
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:48,579
Next!

542
00:37:48,698 --> 00:37:51,065
Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.

543
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,204
Come on.

544
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:56,760
Shut up, and get it done.

545
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,139
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

546
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:03,543
It's from Mr. J.

547
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,184
You gonna tell him I took care of you?

548
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:07,922
You're so screwed.

549
00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:09,830
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

550
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:10,988
Get off me! Get off me!

551
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,436
Harley, what do you mean by that?

552
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:14,646
Harley!!!

553
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,616
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr.Van Criss.

554
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,747
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

555
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,243
Cool if I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.

556
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,536
Thank you. You're a good man.

557
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,487
Open up.

558
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:57,246
Just please, do whatever they say.<.i>

559
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:00,542
Do whatever they say. Just do it.<.i>

560
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,530
This look neat.

561
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:20,967
Light it up! Light it up! Light it up!

562
00:39:30,313 --> 00:39:31,897
He's right above us.

563
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:34,118
This is a mistake.
Rick, I can't do this.

564
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,479
- I can't d...
- Listen... Listen.

565
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:37,159
There is no other way.

566
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,442
Just get it done.

567
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,179
Just get it done.

568
00:39:46,488 --> 00:39:47,994
Enchantress.

569
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:50,117
Flag, talk to me.
What' going on down there?

570
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:53,241
Amanda, she is bolted.<.i>

571
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:54,691
Say it again?

572
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,223
She is bolted.

573
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,972
Shit!

574
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:04,562
Brother help me.

575
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,233
Before she kills me.

576
00:40:22,148 --> 00:40:24,008
Where's your heart?

577
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:26,255
I will take it back.

578
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:29,604
Untill then you will share your power.

579
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,652
Now help me build my weapon.

580
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:36,804
It's time to wipe them out.

581
00:40:59,696 --> 00:41:00,611
Go!

582
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,884
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

583
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:15,734
I thought this was contained!

584
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:22,823
Guys. I need all three of you follow me please.

585
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:26,380
Anybody with blood.

586
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:33,364
This is the worst day of my life.

587
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:38,110
All evacuees must report
to a FEMA representative.<.i>

588
00:41:39,843 --> 00:41:41,578
What's going on in that city?

589
00:41:42,131 --> 00:41:43,642
Those assholes here yet?

590
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:45,885
Yeah. They're here.

591
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:49,757
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

592
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:54,603
What the hell, Flag?

593
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:58,184
Unlock'em.

594
00:42:06,447 --> 00:42:08,855
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

595
00:42:09,138 --> 00:42:10,405
How do you do?

596
00:42:16,603 --> 00:42:17,335
Haaah?

597
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:18,942
What was that?

598
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:21,198
I should kill everyone and escape?

599
00:42:22,842 --> 00:42:25,828
Sorry. The voices.

600
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:29,821
I'm kidding. Jeez!

601
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:32,065
That's not what they really said.

602
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:33,791
What do we got here?

603
00:42:33,794 --> 00:42:36,700
12 pounds of shit in a 10-pound sack.

604
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,281
Welcome to party, Capitan Boomerang.

605
00:42:48,094 --> 00:42:50,620
Hey, hey, hey... What's going on, man?

606
00:42:50,746 --> 00:42:51,902
Calm down.

607
00:42:52,054 --> 00:42:54,160
Hey, one minute I'm playing Mahjong with me nanna...

608
00:42:54,315 --> 00:42:56,495
then this red streak hits me outta nowhere.

609
00:42:56,629 --> 00:42:59,138
Shut up! You were caught robbing a diamond exchange.

610
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,612
I was not.

611
00:43:02,465 --> 00:43:03,565
Here comes Slipknot...

612
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:06,485
the man who climb anything. Wonderful.

613
00:43:06,636 --> 00:43:08,267
Have a good time, scumbag.

614
00:43:10,578 --> 00:43:11,818
Straighten up!

615
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,555
She had a mouth.

616
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:17,821
Listen up!

617
00:43:18,459 --> 00:43:19,904
In your necks...

618
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:23,920
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

619
00:43:24,242 --> 00:43:25,519
As the size of a rice grain...

620
00:43:25,762 --> 00:43:27,673
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

621
00:43:28,444 --> 00:43:31,052
You disobey me, you die.

622
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:35,200
You try to escape, you die.

623
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:39,788
You otherwise irritate or vex me, and guess what?

624
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,465
You die.

625
00:43:41,797 --> 00:43:44,850
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

626
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:46,168
Lady, shut up!

627
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,361
This is the deal.

628
00:43:49,284 --> 00:43:51,508
You're going somewhere very bad...

629
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,879
to do something that'll get you killed.

630
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:55,411
But until that happens...

631
00:43:56,757 --> 00:43:58,203
you're my problem.

632
00:43:59,757 --> 00:44:02,114
So was that like a pep talk?

633
00:44:02,227 --> 00:44:03,630
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

634
00:44:03,752 --> 00:44:05,560
There's your shit.

635
00:44:05,682 --> 00:44:08,122
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

636
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,624
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

637
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:12,116
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

638
00:44:12,227 --> 00:44:14,476
He's like a gold standard. OK?

639
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:17,189
Triangle, bitch. Study
(Kind of strategy for effective attacking in basketball)

640
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:21,031
What?

641
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:28,995
Won't fit anymore?

642
00:45:30,468 --> 00:45:32,194
Too much junk in the trunk?

643
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:36,313
Nah. Every time I put this on, somebody dies.

644
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:38,468
And?

645
00:45:39,484 --> 00:45:41,114
I like putting it on.

646
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:43,026
Goody.

647
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:46,497
Somethin' tells me a whole lotta
people are about to die.

648
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:47,936
Yeah. It's us.

649
00:45:48,074 --> 00:45:49,486
We're being led to our deaths.

650
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:50,831
Speak for yourself mate.

651
00:45:51,222 --> 00:45:53,372
Hey, what's that crop on your face?
Does it wash off?

652
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:58,004
Hey, if you like a girl, can you
light her cigarette with your pinkie?

653
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,713
Because that would be real classy.

654
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:02,371
Hey, y'all might wanna leave old boy alone.

655
00:46:02,524 --> 00:46:04,650
He could torch this whole joint.

656
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:05,945
Ain't right, ese?

657
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:08,497
Ain't got nothing to worry about from me.

658
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:10,042
I'm cool, homie.

659
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:12,239
Behold the voice of god.

660
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:16,904
For those of you who
don't know me officially ...<.i>

661
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:18,761
My Name is Amanda Waller.<.i>

662
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:22,995
There's an active terrorist event in Midway City.

663
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:27,695
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT-1 and get them to safety.

664
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,114
I'm sorry.

665
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:33,722
For those of us who don't speak good guy,
what is HVT-1?

666
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:35,893
The only person that matters in the city...

667
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:37,846
the one person you can't kill.

668
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:41,519
Complete the mission, you get
time off your prison sentence.

669
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,370
Fail the mission, you die.

670
00:46:43,503 --> 00:46:45,246
Anything happens to Colonel Flag ...<.i>

671
00:46:45,397 --> 00:46:47,085
I'll kill every single one of you.

672
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:49,867
Remember, I'm watching.<.i>

673
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:52,742
I see everything.

674
00:46:55,753 --> 00:46:57,370
There's your pep talk.

675
00:46:57,631 --> 00:46:59,874
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

676
00:47:00,523 --> 00:47:01,808
So that's it?

677
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:04,879
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

678
00:47:04,965 --> 00:47:07,259
I'll notify your next of kin.

679
00:47:09,102 --> 00:47:11,125
Alpha, Bravo team, Mount up!

680
00:47:16,956 --> 00:47:18,050
Your' late.

681
00:47:18,454 --> 00:47:19,516
I was busy.

682
00:47:30,871 --> 00:47:32,543
Please have mercy.

683
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,878
Where was the mercy for my husband?

684
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,977
I didn't kill him.

685
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,083
But you watched.

686
00:47:39,817 --> 00:47:41,995
Criminals deserve no mercy.

687
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:46,083
This is Katana.

688
00:47:46,212 --> 00:47:47,400
She's got my back.

689
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:50,605
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke...

690
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:52,900
Just like mowing the lawn.

691
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:55,264
I would advise not getting killed by her.

692
00:47:55,424 --> 00:47:58,563
Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

693
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:01,646
Harley Quinn.
Nice to meet ya.

694
00:48:01,777 --> 00:48:03,449
Love your perfume.

695
00:48:03,577 --> 00:48:05,589
What is that? The stench of death?

696
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:09,830
- Should I kill them?
- Easy cowgirl.

697
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,289
Ain't that kind of mission.
Have a seat..

698
00:48:12,637 --> 00:48:14,223
She seems nice.

699
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:30,067
I'm coming for you.

700
00:48:49,152 --> 00:48:50,784
Look at that pretty lights!

701
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:53,626
Are you guys seein' this?

702
00:48:55,363 --> 00:48:56,284
What happened?

703
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,721
Terror attack.

704
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:03,359
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

705
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:05,328
You know, usual shit.

706
00:49:05,429 --> 00:49:06,429
Right.

707
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:09,204
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

708
00:49:10,341 --> 00:49:11,447
I don't know if they told you...

709
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:14,757
but I'm a hitman. I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

710
00:49:14,842 --> 00:49:16,358
Anything for a dollar, right?

711
00:49:16,925 --> 00:49:19,681
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

712
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,496
I'm a soldier!

713
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:24,771
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

714
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,268
When the shooting starts...

715
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:29,789
and it will,
you'll cut and run.

716
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:45,340
Six-one is going down.

717
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:47,663
Six-one is going down hard.

718
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:03,314
Stand by. Drop the ramp.

719
00:50:12,778 --> 00:50:14,152
What a ride!

720
00:50:14,497 --> 00:50:17,678
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.

721
00:50:35,276 --> 00:50:36,269
Mind games.

722
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,239
What's that?
- All this bomb in the neck crap.

723
00:50:40,356 --> 00:50:41,473
That ain't real, mate.

724
00:50:41,898 --> 00:50:44,543
See. They're trying to trap us
with our own minds. Right?

725
00:50:44,664 --> 00:50:47,772
But you look around, we're free, brah.

726
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:49,160
How do you know this?

727
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:51,290
Just trust me. I know, all right?
It's a con.

728
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:54,246
Now I'm going.
Because I got a life to live.

729
00:50:54,779 --> 00:50:56,581
Question is, are you coming?

730
00:51:00,712 --> 00:51:02,814
Yeah! Smart!

731
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:25,767
Hold your fire.

732
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:29,991
Sorry. It's what I do.

733
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,761
Damn it.

734
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:46,130
Now that's a killer app!

735
00:51:46,872 --> 00:51:48,474
Okay. You wanna keep playing...

736
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:51,073
the Hollywood Squares<.i> version of
"I'll Blow your freaking Head Off?"

737
00:51:51,396 --> 00:51:52,485
Are you next?

738
00:51:53,222 --> 00:51:54,356
You tripping, homie.

739
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,611
You next, Deadshot?

740
00:51:59,938 --> 00:52:00,939
You just threatened me?

741
00:52:01,393 --> 00:52:02,394
Oh, yeah.

742
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,728
He just threatened me.

743
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:09,315
Move.

744
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,455
You got a boyfriend?

745
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,578
I'm gonna kill him.

746
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:20,087
Well, you better make it quick
'cause he's gonna kill all of us one by one.

747
00:52:20,479 --> 00:52:23,223
I'm gonna drop him. The sword lady.
Five or seven of these SEALs.

748
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:25,082
After that, I'm gonna need some help.
You down?

749
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:27,668
Always. What about
the shit in our necks?

750
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:31,159
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

751
00:52:34,031 --> 00:52:36,109
You're my friend, too.

752
00:52:37,423 --> 00:52:40,347
Stay evil, doll face, Spread the word.

753
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:46,647
I'm standing by for follow on tasking.<.i>

754
00:52:56,876 --> 00:52:58,986
C2, what is the operational load of the PLS?

755
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:00,859
Boss, we got people up here.

756
00:53:01,963 --> 00:53:03,265
I'm on my way.

757
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,971
Shit!

758
00:53:17,175 --> 00:53:19,027
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.<.i>

759
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:20,622
Flag. Get out of there.

760
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,289
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.<.i>

761
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:24,494
Copy that.

762
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,500
We're diverting.

763
00:53:26,726 --> 00:53:29,260
Bump out second two squad two blocks east.

764
00:53:29,366 --> 00:53:30,567
We'll pass through you...

765
00:53:30,823 --> 00:53:31,824
continue north.

766
00:53:32,244 --> 00:53:33,839
Take Bravo two blocks east.

767
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:35,631
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

768
00:53:35,638 --> 00:53:36,639
Copy that.

769
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:47,207
Hey. I like these odds, mate.

770
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:48,563
You just say the word.

771
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:49,694
Yeah.

772
00:53:50,407 --> 00:53:51,408
Come on.

773
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:52,779
Yeah.

774
00:53:53,285 --> 00:53:54,553
Hold that thought.

775
00:54:03,843 --> 00:54:05,979
Rick, why do they look like that?

776
00:54:06,064 --> 00:54:07,065
Just stay cool.

777
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,000
The hell are they?

778
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:24,260
You cut run.
I'll blow your head off.

779
00:54:35,762 --> 00:54:36,763
Hit'em!

780
00:55:33,976 --> 00:55:34,835
Hey.

781
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:01,782
Get off me!

782
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:07,442
Get off me! Son of a...

783
00:56:11,807 --> 00:56:12,808
Flag!

784
00:56:14,355 --> 00:56:15,521
- Good riddance.
- Harley.

785
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,542
He dies. We die.

786
00:56:29,356 --> 00:56:30,623
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

787
00:56:33,032 --> 00:56:34,100
Backblast, clear!

788
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:24,173
Pinky.

789
00:57:28,503 --> 00:57:30,868
That's how I cut and run.

790
00:57:38,438 --> 00:57:39,439
Hey.

791
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:40,919
Hey. Come on.

792
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:43,088
What? I saw it move.

793
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,800
See? It flinched.
I think.

794
00:57:47,753 --> 00:57:49,707
Hey. You were some help. Princess.

795
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:51,606
It's better this way.

796
00:57:52,054 --> 00:57:53,055
Trust me.

797
00:57:53,448 --> 00:57:55,300
Oh, yeah you're the fire bloke. Eh?

798
00:57:55,315 --> 00:57:55,796
Yeah, I was. Yeah.

799
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:57,472
Right. Yeah. Hey.

800
00:57:58,677 --> 00:57:59,745
Well. Look at here.

801
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:01,391
It's fire.

802
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,166
Wants to explain this?

803
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:11,733
If I told you, would you believe me?

804
00:58:13,418 --> 00:58:15,157
- What are they?
- I don't know.

805
00:58:15,236 --> 00:58:16,580
That's bullshit.

806
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,611
This guy had a 3000$ watch.

807
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,325
Is that a Person?

808
00:58:23,043 --> 00:58:24,339
It was.

809
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:26,164
Now it's not.

810
00:58:27,514 --> 00:58:28,884
Hey, don't.

811
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,517
What?

812
00:58:30,782 --> 00:58:32,385
We got a job to do.

813
00:58:35,223 --> 00:58:36,247
Keep movin'.

814
00:58:39,168 --> 00:58:40,978
Get your boys moving.

815
00:58:43,655 --> 00:58:44,985
Let's go.

816
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,520
Waller, we are moving toward the objective.

817
00:58:55,644 --> 00:58:57,683
Contacting Bravo. You got the visual?

818
00:58:57,724 --> 00:58:58,523
Stand by.

819
00:58:58,665 --> 00:58:59,871
Anything on the squadron?

820
00:58:59,908 --> 00:59:00,766
No ma'am.

821
00:59:01,074 --> 00:59:03,600
Code7 I need your sensors
in those coordinates.

822
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:04,706
Flag, it's a negative.

823
00:59:04,857 --> 00:59:07,747
[???], but we've lost them.

824
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:45,650
Seriously?

825
00:59:45,851 --> 00:59:47,727
What the hell is wrong with you people?

826
00:59:48,246 --> 00:59:51,906
We're bad guys.
It's what we do.

827
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:11,667
Take a knee.

828
01:00:17,386 --> 01:00:19,174
Our body's at the top of that building.

829
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:20,196
We get up there...

830
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,194
Pull them out of
the vault they're hiding in.

831
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:24,284
Helos extract us off the roof.

832
01:00:24,293 --> 01:00:26,072
- It's miller times.
- Check.

833
01:00:38,992 --> 01:00:39,800
Waller?

834
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,455
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.<.i>

835
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,116
What do say we get this over with?

836
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:50,552
What the hell? Deadshot.

837
01:00:50,665 --> 01:00:51,940
Fall back.

838
01:00:57,743 --> 01:00:59,573
You mind if we tag along?

839
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:15,187
Look like we have a spot of luck. Eh?

840
01:01:16,092 --> 01:01:17,846
Be a walk in the park.

841
01:01:18,154 --> 01:01:19,634
Easy peasy.

842
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:21,875
Don't make me shoot you.

843
01:01:27,025 --> 01:01:28,983
God damn it. Harley!

844
01:01:29,241 --> 01:01:30,593
Go! Go! Go! Go!

845
01:01:34,867 --> 01:01:37,191
I am coming to my lady...

846
01:02:18,564 --> 01:02:19,398
Hey, guys!

847
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:27,686
Come on. Let's go.

848
01:02:37,098 --> 01:02:40,779
Ma'am. I got motion detectors
going off on the secure floors.

849
01:02:43,182 --> 01:02:44,020
Flag...

850
01:02:44,155 --> 01:02:45,515
- They're all around you.<.i>
- Hold.

851
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,811
Use extreme caution.

852
01:02:49,376 --> 01:02:50,721
I don't like this, Flag.

853
01:02:52,513 --> 01:02:54,048
I don't like it either.

854
01:02:58,850 --> 01:02:59,851
Pussy.

855
01:02:59,852 --> 01:03:01,775
I will knock your ass out.

856
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,375
I do not care that you're a girl.

857
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:55,428
They're after Flag again.

858
01:03:56,714 --> 01:03:58,165
Get off me.

859
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:04,291
Circle up. Circle around him.

860
01:04:09,864 --> 01:04:10,865
Let me fight!

861
01:04:10,866 --> 01:04:12,252
You die. We die.

862
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:17,269
Clear! Everyone move out.

863
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:33,522
- Where you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!

864
01:04:33,523 --> 01:04:36,307
You know what? You don't stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!

865
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:37,610
Don't touch me, man!

866
01:04:37,611 --> 01:04:38,876
- Don't touch you? What you gonna do?
- Don't touch me!

867
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:40,894
I'm touching you! I'm touching you!

868
01:04:41,008 --> 01:04:42,828
- Do something. Do something!
- Don't touch me!

869
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,109
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see...

870
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,847
- You wanna see something?
- Yes I wanna see something.

871
01:05:10,793 --> 01:05:12,680
I was just trying to get you there.

872
01:05:13,907 --> 01:05:15,534
Phil Jackson. We good, right?

873
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,258
I knew you'd come through.

874
01:05:20,775 --> 01:05:22,342
That shit crazy.

875
01:05:32,187 --> 01:05:33,609
Clear.

876
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,572
I gotta work on my cardio.

877
01:05:59,161 --> 01:06:00,162
Question.

878
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:04,889
Would you die for me?

879
01:06:07,406 --> 01:06:07,994
Yes.

880
01:06:08,212 --> 01:06:09,816
That's too easy.

881
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:12,461
Would you ...?

882
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,173
Would you live for me?

883
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:21,040
Yes.

884
01:06:22,038 --> 01:06:23,675
Careful.

885
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:28,968
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

886
01:06:30,256 --> 01:06:31,047
Desire becomes surrender.

887
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:33,894
Surrender becomes power.

888
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:39,159
Do you want this?

889
01:06:40,145 --> 01:06:41,212
I do.

890
01:06:41,213 --> 01:06:42,763
Say it.

891
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,467
Say it. Say it.

892
01:06:45,609 --> 01:06:48,225
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

893
01:06:48,394 --> 01:06:49,395
Please.

894
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:52,430
God, you're so...

895
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:53,943
Good.

896
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:02,218
Relax.

897
01:08:02,225 --> 01:08:03,226
Just me.

898
01:08:07,012 --> 01:08:09,183
You ever been in love?

899
01:08:11,185 --> 01:08:13,172
Nah. Never.

900
01:08:13,186 --> 01:08:14,511
Bullshit.

901
01:08:14,695 --> 01:08:18,416
You don't kill as many people as
I've killed and still sleep like a kitten.

902
01:08:18,544 --> 01:08:20,346
If you feel shit like love.

903
01:08:22,696 --> 01:08:24,921
Another textbook sociopath.

904
01:08:28,787 --> 01:08:29,786
Clear.

905
01:08:29,809 --> 01:08:31,106
Clear.

906
01:08:32,617 --> 01:08:33,539
All right, secure the roof.

907
01:08:33,558 --> 01:08:36,491
Sweep for shooters
so we can bring in our aviation assets.

908
01:08:36,693 --> 01:08:37,794
Going to the roof.

909
01:08:45,508 --> 01:08:46,509
Wait here.

910
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:47,669
Please.

911
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:51,143
I don't wanna gave this dude
a heart attack okay?

912
01:08:51,487 --> 01:08:53,397
He's embarrassed of us.

913
01:08:53,427 --> 01:08:54,428
Hey, Flag.

914
01:08:55,036 --> 01:08:58,572
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

915
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,228
You ready? Let's go.

916
01:09:07,337 --> 01:09:09,575
You wouldn't have made it without them.

917
01:09:09,626 --> 01:09:12,608
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

918
01:09:12,712 --> 01:09:15,275
Admit it, rick. I was right.

919
01:09:15,407 --> 01:09:17,069
Yeah, I told you to get on the damn truck.

920
01:09:17,145 --> 01:09:17,971
Why'd you say?

921
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,009
I was studying your girlfriend.

922
01:09:20,147 --> 01:09:21,610
She takes an average person...

923
01:09:21,751 --> 01:09:25,056
A yoga mom an elderly retiree
and she turns them into a soldier.

924
01:09:25,057 --> 01:09:27,248
Who can take a headshot and still fight.

925
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,377
It's an instant army.

926
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:31,580
How'd she do it. Flag?

927
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:33,400
How'd she game the system...

928
01:09:33,401 --> 01:09:35,488
With you watching her every move?

929
01:09:38,518 --> 01:09:40,384
I'll accept the consequences.

930
01:09:40,922 --> 01:09:42,497
I am your consequence.

931
01:09:42,537 --> 01:09:44,381
You might need to be careful.

932
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:47,152
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

933
01:09:47,243 --> 01:09:48,779
I can take care of myself.

934
01:09:48,905 --> 01:09:50,796
- Shut it down, wipe the drivers.
- Yes, ma'am.

935
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:52,195
Copy that.

936
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:55,251
Hey, man I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped...

937
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,344
In your temple of
soldierly self-righteousness...

938
01:09:58,512 --> 01:10:01,717
But a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

939
01:10:01,726 --> 01:10:03,729
Oh, says the guy who shoots people for money.

940
01:10:03,739 --> 01:10:05,126
My cards is on the table, man.

941
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:06,601
It got done. Didn't it?

942
01:10:12,306 --> 01:10:15,242
Damn. That is just...

943
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:17,749
A mean lady.

944
01:10:17,831 --> 01:10:19,233
Yeah. You get used to it.

945
01:10:21,206 --> 01:10:23,522
And I'm the bad guy?

946
01:10:27,202 --> 01:10:28,203
That's gangsta.

947
01:10:30,203 --> 01:10:31,102
What?

948
01:10:31,108 --> 01:10:32,809
They weren't cleared
for any of this any of it.

949
01:10:32,818 --> 01:10:36,335
Hey. I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes, too.

950
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,014
No way.

951
01:10:57,857 --> 01:10:58,858
Let's go home.

952
01:10:59,621 --> 01:11:00,822
Yeah. Let's go home.

953
01:11:02,019 --> 01:11:04,479
That sounds good.
You guys wanna go home?

954
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:06,792
Or you wanna go back to prison?

955
01:11:07,035 --> 01:11:08,859
I'm not going back to prison.

956
01:11:08,874 --> 01:11:09,915
What I'm saying is...

957
01:11:10,241 --> 01:11:12,567
We kill the pair of 'em now
before they kill us.

958
01:11:13,123 --> 01:11:14,124
I got this.

959
01:11:18,018 --> 01:11:19,685
You all made it this far.

960
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:24,199
Don't get high-spirited on me
and run a good thing.

961
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:41,551
I like her.

962
01:11:45,827 --> 01:11:46,452
Savior one-zero,

963
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,137
this is Ground Element.

964
01:11:51,549 --> 01:11:53,777
Savior one-zero,
how copy?

965
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,205
Savior one-zero, the LZ's clear.

966
01:12:03,765 --> 01:12:05,329
Boss, they're not talking to me.

967
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:08,715
Our bird's been jacked.

968
01:12:09,694 --> 01:12:10,695
Light it up!

969
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:39,415
What? I got hickey or something?

970
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:42,148
Professor, could you pick up the pace?

971
01:12:44,624 --> 01:12:46,324
Now!

972
01:12:53,812 --> 01:12:54,813
Harley!

973
01:12:57,946 --> 01:12:58,947
Hello, baby.

974
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,013
Kill her!

975
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:06,829
Her nanite's disarmed!

976
01:13:08,989 --> 01:13:09,990
Come on, baby.

977
01:13:25,815 --> 01:13:26,816
Deadshot...

978
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:29,771
Shoot that woman right now!

979
01:13:30,097 --> 01:13:31,939
She ain't do shit to me.

980
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:34,134
You're a hitman. Right?

981
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:35,642
I got a contract.

982
01:13:35,717 --> 01:13:37,207
Kill Harley Quinn.

983
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:39,539
Do it your freedom
and your kid.

984
01:13:41,385 --> 01:13:43,442
Now she dead.

985
01:14:22,906 --> 01:14:23,907
I missed.

986
01:14:29,188 --> 01:14:30,189
Good one, mate.

987
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:32,189
It's Waller.

988
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:36,322
Savior one-zero's been hijaked.
Shoot it down.

989
01:14:36,323 --> 01:14:38,170
Rager that ma'am.
Going hot.

990
01:14:46,043 --> 01:14:47,044
Puddin'!

991
01:14:52,275 --> 01:14:54,425
You got all dressed up for me?

992
01:14:54,537 --> 01:14:56,837
You know I'd do anything for you.

993
01:14:57,001 --> 01:14:57,509
By the way...

994
01:14:57,847 --> 01:15:01,397
I've got some grape soda on ice,
and a bear skin rug waitin'.

995
01:15:01,405 --> 01:15:02,406
Yeah?

996
01:15:02,749 --> 01:15:04,244
Boss, we got a problem.

997
01:15:09,716 --> 01:15:13,076
- This bird is baked.
- No.

998
01:15:14,726 --> 01:15:16,956
Okay, honey. It's me and you.

999
01:15:16,962 --> 01:15:18,292
Let's do it.

1000
01:15:44,834 --> 01:15:46,170
Target destroyed, ma'am.

1001
01:15:46,483 --> 01:15:48,798
Thank you. Now get me off this roof.

1002
01:15:49,615 --> 01:15:51,246
Yes, ma'am. We are inbound.

1003
01:15:54,521 --> 01:15:56,919
The Joker and Harley Quinn are no more.

1004
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,755
You couldn't save her.

1005
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:09,298
Roger. I see ya.

1006
01:16:12,643 --> 01:16:13,881
Watch your step. Ma'am.

1007
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:18,700
Stand by. I'll send another helo!

1008
01:17:19,645 --> 01:17:21,133
Waller's down.

1009
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:22,804
It's over.

1010
01:17:23,361 --> 01:17:26,630
Ops just confirmed.
She's down. 1k west.

1011
01:17:29,264 --> 01:17:30,960
Let's go get her.

1012
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:38,020
The mission's not over.

1013
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:41,403
Nah. It is for me.
We had a deal.

1014
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:43,676
Without Waller, you got nothing.

1015
01:18:29,731 --> 01:18:32,199
Hey, guys. I'm back!

1016
01:18:33,812 --> 01:18:36,369
I missed you all so much.

1017
01:18:37,024 --> 01:18:39,158
We're glad you could make it.

1018
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:55,437
Hey, craziness.

1019
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:17,074
Bring me my sister's heart.

1020
01:19:41,537 --> 01:19:45,324
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

1021
01:19:45,549 --> 01:19:49,477
Now tell me how to
destroy your armies.

1022
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,828
Do your worst, bitch!

1023
01:20:20,226 --> 01:20:21,317
So let me guess.

1024
01:20:22,523 --> 01:20:25,610
We're going to the swirling
wing of trash in the sky.

1025
01:20:26,038 --> 01:20:27,657
You know, 'cause why wouldn't we?

1026
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,172
When does this end, Flag?

1027
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:33,988
Load up.
We're in for a fight.

1028
01:20:59,133 --> 01:21:02,320
You tell everybody everything.

1029
01:21:02,397 --> 01:21:05,297
Or me and you are gonna go right now.

1030
01:21:11,494 --> 01:21:12,561
Three days ago,

1031
01:21:12,569 --> 01:21:15,555
a non-human entity appeared in the subway station.

1032
01:21:16,928 --> 01:21:18,597
Waller, we're almost there.

1033
01:21:18,695 --> 01:21:22,557
So Waller sent me and
a woman with incredibles abilities.

1034
01:21:22,762 --> 01:21:24,516
Enchantress.

1035
01:21:25,474 --> 01:21:26,475
A witch.

1036
01:21:27,954 --> 01:21:29,485
See, nobody could get near this thing...

1037
01:21:29,491 --> 01:21:31,448
but the witch could.

1038
01:21:33,485 --> 01:21:34,679
Bombs ready.

1039
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:38,080
Set for two seconds. You just
press the button and drop it.

1040
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:44,816
Needless to say the whole thing was a bad idea.

1041
01:21:44,825 --> 01:21:46,332
She bolted!

1042
01:21:47,048 --> 01:21:48,049
Shit!

1043
01:21:52,537 --> 01:21:54,083
Brother help me.

1044
01:21:55,652 --> 01:21:58,649
And that's how she escaped from Waller.

1045
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,433
So now you know.

1046
01:22:03,607 --> 01:22:05,691
You can just kill me right now...

1047
01:22:05,892 --> 01:22:08,762
but I'm going to have a drink.

1048
01:22:08,809 --> 01:22:10,833
Hey! Deadshot, I need your help.

1049
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:13,635
No, sir. You need a miracle.

1050
01:22:47,891 --> 01:22:51,452
Here's to honor among thieves

1051
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:52,720
I'm not a thief.

1052
01:22:55,169 --> 01:22:57,225
Oh.She's not a thief.

1053
01:23:02,005 --> 01:23:04,074
Well, we almost pulled it off...

1054
01:23:04,459 --> 01:23:07,773
Despite what everybody thought.

1055
01:23:07,785 --> 01:23:11,784
Worst part of it is, they're gonna
blame us for the whole thing.

1056
01:23:11,842 --> 01:23:14,141
And they can't have people
knowing the truth.

1057
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:16,280
We're the patsies.

1058
01:23:16,414 --> 01:23:17,795
The cover-up.

1059
01:23:18,944 --> 01:23:22,395
Don't forget, we're the bad guys.

1060
01:23:25,721 --> 01:23:29,402
For about two sweet seconds...

1061
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:30,803
I had hope.

1062
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:33,097
You had hope huh?

1063
01:23:35,358 --> 01:23:38,408
Hope don't stop the wheel
from turning, my brother.

1064
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:39,911
You preaching?

1065
01:23:40,039 --> 01:23:42,107
It's coming back around for you.

1066
01:23:42,442 --> 01:23:45,141
How many people you killed, man?

1067
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,583
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

1068
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:50,681
You ain't ever whacked down no women.

1069
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:52,485
No kids.

1070
01:23:53,815 --> 01:23:55,867
I don't kill women and children.

1071
01:23:56,102 --> 01:23:57,103
I do.

1072
01:24:00,284 --> 01:24:02,820
See, I was born with the Devil's gift.

1073
01:24:03,002 --> 01:24:05,605
I kept it hidden most of my life, but...

1074
01:24:06,549 --> 01:24:09,726
The older I got, the stronger I got.

1075
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,809
So I started using it.

1076
01:24:12,702 --> 01:24:14,680
For business, you know.

1077
01:24:15,219 --> 01:24:16,980
The more power on the street I got...

1078
01:24:16,981 --> 01:24:18,150
The more firepower I got.

1079
01:24:18,151 --> 01:24:19,492
Like that shit went hand in hand.

1080
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:21,780
You know? One was feeding the other.

1081
01:24:22,894 --> 01:24:25,232
Ain't nobody tell me no.

1082
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,936
Except my old lady.

1083
01:24:30,455 --> 01:24:32,713
You know, she used to pray for me.

1084
01:24:33,172 --> 01:24:34,233
You're welcome.

1085
01:24:36,296 --> 01:24:38,098
Even when I didn't want it.

1086
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,766
God didn't give me this.

1087
01:24:51,035 --> 01:24:53,502
Why should he take it away?

1088
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,261
Hey.

1089
01:24:57,602 --> 01:24:58,609
This is our home.

1090
01:24:58,908 --> 01:25:00,432
You put that back where you found it.

1091
01:25:00,587 --> 01:25:02,336
I'm taking my kids to my Mom's.

1092
01:25:02,418 --> 01:25:04,362
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!

1093
01:25:04,552 --> 01:25:08,320
See when I get mad, I lose
control you know, I just...

1094
01:25:08,592 --> 01:25:09,593
I don't know what I do...

1095
01:25:16,898 --> 01:25:17,899
till it's done.

1096
01:25:33,249 --> 01:25:34,250
And the kids?

1097
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:39,308
He killed them.

1098
01:25:43,293 --> 01:25:44,737
Didn't you?

1099
01:25:52,911 --> 01:25:54,697
Own that shit.

1100
01:25:55,465 --> 01:25:56,466
Own it.

1101
01:25:56,633 --> 01:25:58,938
What'd you think was
gonna happen? Huh?

1102
01:25:59,142 --> 01:26:01,062
Hey Harley, Come on.

1103
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:02,971
What you were just...

1104
01:26:03,152 --> 01:26:04,268
Thinking you can have a happy family...

1105
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,461
And coach little leagues
and make car payments?

1106
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:12,038
Normal's a setting on the dryer.
People like us, we don't get normal!

1107
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:14,321
Why is it always a knife fight…

1108
01:26:14,322 --> 01:26:16,724
every single time you open your mouth?

1109
01:26:18,664 --> 01:26:22,354
You know, outside you're amazing.

1110
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,675
But inside, you're ugly.

1111
01:26:26,676 --> 01:26:28,559
We all are.

1112
01:26:28,668 --> 01:26:31,107
We all are!

1113
01:26:31,128 --> 01:26:32,326
Except for him.

1114
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,791
He's ugly on the outside, too.

1115
01:26:35,797 --> 01:26:37,798
Not me, shorty.

1116
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,902
I'm beautiful.

1117
01:26:44,203 --> 01:26:46,628
Yeah, you are.

1118
01:26:56,589 --> 01:26:58,125
We don't want you here.

1119
01:27:05,577 --> 01:27:09,732
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1120
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,593
Yeah.

1121
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,222
I never been with a witch before.
What's that like?

1122
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:23,391
Apparently that's why the creatures
chase him all the time.

1123
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:25,670
'Cause the witch is scared of him.

1124
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:28,059
The only woman I ever cared about...

1125
01:27:28,061 --> 01:27:30,538
is trapped inside that monster.

1126
01:27:30,668 --> 01:27:35,442
If I don't stop the witch, it's over.
Everything is over.

1127
01:27:35,692 --> 01:27:36,693
Everything.

1128
01:27:40,397 --> 01:27:41,598
You're free to go.

1129
01:27:55,907 --> 01:27:58,977
Your daughter writes you everyday.

1130
01:28:01,805 --> 01:28:03,719
Every single day.

1131
01:28:19,374 --> 01:28:21,309
You had these the whole time?

1132
01:28:22,813 --> 01:28:26,175
You had letters from my daughter the whole time?

1133
01:28:30,331 --> 01:28:31,867
I'm gonna get you there.

1134
01:28:32,842 --> 01:28:34,510
And you're gonna end this.

1135
01:28:34,612 --> 01:28:37,222
I'm gonna carry your ass if I have to.

1136
01:28:38,365 --> 01:28:41,955
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

1137
01:28:41,961 --> 01:28:44,714
Everybody's gonna know what we did.

1138
01:28:44,959 --> 01:28:48,356
And my daughter is
gonna know that her daddy…

1139
01:28:48,602 --> 01:28:51,168
is not a piece of shit.

1140
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,376
I'll come.

1141
01:29:05,154 --> 01:29:06,155
What?

1142
01:29:06,665 --> 01:29:08,603
You got something better to do?

1143
01:29:08,605 --> 01:29:09,606
Come on!

1144
01:29:11,943 --> 01:29:12,944
Pussies.

1145
01:29:48,707 --> 01:29:51,103
We think that thing's a weapon.

1146
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:52,151
Here. Lower.

1147
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:01,829
We gotta take out the big one.

1148
01:30:04,508 --> 01:30:08,280
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1149
01:30:09,141 --> 01:30:10,574
There's a flooded tunnel...

1150
01:30:10,579 --> 01:30:12,351
Leads right underneath that building.

1151
01:30:12,516 --> 01:30:17,055
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim underneath that things feet.

1152
01:30:17,062 --> 01:30:20,329
We get in its face and distract
the hell out of that son of a bitch.

1153
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:21,810
So the swimmers can blow the bomb.

1154
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:25,559
That's how we take it out.

1155
01:30:35,748 --> 01:30:37,841
I'm going with ya.

1156
01:30:39,515 --> 01:30:40,516
We got this.

1157
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:43,879
I'm not asking bro.

1158
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:48,976
I live underground.

1159
01:30:49,093 --> 01:30:51,741
Y'all are just tourist.

1160
01:31:09,335 --> 01:31:12,399
My dear husband if I die in battle.

1161
01:31:13,032 --> 01:31:15,964
We will be together.

1162
01:31:16,623 --> 01:31:19,612
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

1163
01:31:20,599 --> 01:31:23,025
His souls trapped inside of it.

1164
01:31:23,349 --> 01:31:25,208
She talks to him.

1165
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:26,834
Hey. Well...

1166
01:31:27,365 --> 01:31:30,071
You know what they say
about the crazy ones.

1167
01:31:31,289 --> 01:31:32,290
Huh?

1168
01:31:39,897 --> 01:31:40,898
Let's do this.

1169
01:32:23,996 --> 01:32:25,597
You gonna fight with us?

1170
01:32:26,373 --> 01:32:27,908
What if I lose control?

1171
01:32:28,193 --> 01:32:30,262
Then maybe we'll have a chance.

1172
01:32:43,133 --> 01:32:44,134
Duck in.

1173
01:32:56,602 --> 01:33:00,339
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff right?

1174
01:33:00,764 --> 01:33:01,765
Yeah why?

1175
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:04,606
I'm off my meds.

1176
01:33:06,222 --> 01:33:07,890
That's your old lady huh?

1177
01:33:08,216 --> 01:33:08,893
Yeah.

1178
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,569
Well, you need to handle this shit, alll right?

1179
01:33:11,570 --> 01:33:13,656
Get up there, smack on her ass,

1180
01:33:13,759 --> 01:33:15,316
tell her: " knock this shit off".

1181
01:33:15,338 --> 01:33:17,340
I do not think that'd be wise.

1182
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:19,408
I'm gonna draw out the big one.

1183
01:33:19,832 --> 01:33:22,515
My boys will detonate the bomb underneath him.

1184
01:33:26,396 --> 01:33:29,451
You know, we should
get a drink sometimes.

1185
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:32,023
I've been waiting for you all night.

1186
01:33:34,183 --> 01:33:35,784
Step out of the shadows.

1187
01:33:36,073 --> 01:33:38,541
I won't bite.

1188
01:33:42,162 --> 01:33:43,763
What the hell? Grab her.

1189
01:33:45,751 --> 01:33:48,014
Why are you here?

1190
01:33:48,048 --> 01:33:51,054
Because the soldier led you?

1191
01:33:51,172 --> 01:33:52,975
And all for Waller?

1192
01:33:53,082 --> 01:33:56,111
Why do you serve those who cage you?

1193
01:33:56,174 --> 01:33:57,175
I am your ally.

1194
01:33:58,536 --> 01:34:01,308
And I know what you want.

1195
01:34:01,409 --> 01:34:04,439
Exactly what you want.

1196
01:34:45,953 --> 01:34:46,954
Baby. Baby.

1197
01:34:48,334 --> 01:34:51,630
Baby. It's just a nightmare.

1198
01:34:52,256 --> 01:34:54,223
It's just a bad dream.

1199
01:34:54,798 --> 01:34:55,799
I'm here.

1200
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:07,959
Miss me?

1201
01:35:15,147 --> 01:35:19,005
I'll put the kids to sleep
and then we can kick in?

1202
01:35:20,211 --> 01:35:21,698
Yeah?

1203
01:35:23,669 --> 01:35:27,430
I can't change what I did. And neither can you!

1204
01:35:27,431 --> 01:35:29,868
He married me.

1205
01:35:31,281 --> 01:35:32,591
It's not real.

1206
01:35:32,673 --> 01:35:34,324
I killed the Bat.

1207
01:35:34,325 --> 01:35:36,106
No homie, you don't want that.

1208
01:35:36,196 --> 01:35:38,054
What? I want that.

1209
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,182
- She's trying to play games with you man. It's not real!
- He's right.

1210
01:35:42,352 --> 01:35:43,807
It's not real.

1211
01:35:46,193 --> 01:35:49,209
How long have you been able to see?

1212
01:35:49,503 --> 01:35:51,255
My whole life.

1213
01:35:52,253 --> 01:35:54,188
You can't have them.

1214
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:55,745
These are my people right here.

1215
01:35:55,762 --> 01:35:57,645
But it is our time.

1216
01:35:57,758 --> 01:36:00,471
The sun is setting and the magic rises.

1217
01:36:00,472 --> 01:36:02,874
The met humans are a sign of change.

1218
01:36:03,871 --> 01:36:04,872
Lady...

1219
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:07,757
You are EVIL!

1220
01:36:08,424 --> 01:36:09,425
Brother.

1221
01:36:10,116 --> 01:36:11,450
Make them bow to me.

1222
01:36:12,376 --> 01:36:13,377
Oh wow!

1223
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:17,841
Uh-oh!

1224
01:36:18,589 --> 01:36:19,590
Who's this?

1225
01:36:20,193 --> 01:36:21,586
It's gonna be bad!

1226
01:36:21,587 --> 01:36:23,068
We should run.

1227
01:36:34,451 --> 01:36:36,415
GQ, come in. We're in position.

1228
01:36:45,584 --> 01:36:48,042
We gotta get him in that corner
That's where the bomb will be.

1229
01:36:48,047 --> 01:36:50,118
I'll do it! I'll get him there.

1230
01:37:03,831 --> 01:37:05,870
I lost one family.
I ain't gonaa lose one another.

1231
01:37:05,878 --> 01:37:07,102
Look, think it through...

1232
01:37:07,312 --> 01:37:08,313
I got this.

1233
01:37:08,799 --> 01:37:11,001
Let me show you what I really am.

1234
01:37:12,597 --> 01:37:13,598
Over here!

1235
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:57,288
Go!

1236
01:38:11,352 --> 01:38:13,203
Rick, in position. Standing by.

1237
01:38:13,419 --> 01:38:15,329
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

1238
01:38:29,857 --> 01:38:31,592
Get him mate.
- Come on.

1239
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:34,551
Yeah, do it.

1240
01:38:44,488 --> 01:38:46,721
Diablo, get clear
Get out of there!

1241
01:38:46,804 --> 01:38:48,270
Blow it!

1242
01:38:51,223 --> 01:38:52,590
Blow it.

1243
01:38:54,958 --> 01:38:55,959
Now GQ, now.

1244
01:38:56,296 --> 01:38:57,297
NO!

1245
01:38:59,091 --> 01:39:00,092
Everybody down!

1246
01:39:01,925 --> 01:39:03,956
Now you're screwed.

1247
01:39:09,153 --> 01:39:12,041
Brother!

1248
01:39:38,286 --> 01:39:39,287
You next.

1249
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:44,219
My spell is complete.

1250
01:39:44,354 --> 01:39:48,195
Once you and armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

1251
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:52,076
And it would be mine to rule.

1252
01:40:06,991 --> 01:40:09,200
That was our main satellite uplink.

1253
01:40:13,946 --> 01:40:16,016
How did this witch even know how to target this thing?

1254
01:40:16,024 --> 01:40:18,044
It's a secret facility.

1255
01:40:22,529 --> 01:40:24,264
You got a move here, Flag?

1256
01:40:24,398 --> 01:40:26,793
We gotta cut her heart out.

1257
01:40:57,628 --> 01:40:58,883
While we're fighting...

1258
01:40:58,885 --> 01:41:01,631
that thing is laying waste to the whole damn world.

1259
01:41:08,751 --> 01:41:09,752
Where is she?

1260
01:41:10,342 --> 01:41:11,343
I don't know.

1261
01:41:16,162 --> 01:41:17,163
Hey.

1262
01:41:23,817 --> 01:41:25,171
Look out look out!

1263
01:41:49,448 --> 01:41:50,449
Sorry.

1264
01:41:56,306 --> 01:41:57,307
Flag!

1265
01:42:31,942 --> 01:42:33,614
Enough!

1266
01:42:36,855 --> 01:42:39,408
Of all who have faced me...

1267
01:42:39,475 --> 01:42:42,248
you have earned mercy.

1268
01:42:42,328 --> 01:42:44,816
For the last time...

1269
01:42:44,915 --> 01:42:46,728
join me...

1270
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,564
or die.

1271
01:42:50,236 --> 01:42:52,038
I'm not much of a joiner...

1272
01:42:54,227 --> 01:42:56,573
but maybe we should.

1273
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:58,164
Hey.

1274
01:42:58,165 --> 01:42:59,902
She's trying to take over the world.

1275
01:42:59,903 --> 01:43:00,900
So?

1276
01:43:01,545 --> 01:43:03,826
What's the world ever
done for us anyway?

1277
01:43:03,943 --> 01:43:05,170
It hates us.

1278
01:43:05,726 --> 01:43:07,776
Hey Harley!

1279
01:43:10,756 --> 01:43:12,623
Hey lady?

1280
01:43:15,101 --> 01:43:17,402
I lost my Puddin'.

1281
01:43:18,574 --> 01:43:20,854
But you can get him back, right?

1282
01:43:21,497 --> 01:43:23,734
I can, my dear.

1283
01:43:24,033 --> 01:43:27,102
Anything you want.

1284
01:43:29,799 --> 01:43:30,660
You promise?

1285
01:43:30,665 --> 01:43:32,809
Yes. Child.

1286
01:43:34,432 --> 01:43:36,235
You need only Bow...

1287
01:43:37,202 --> 01:43:41,194
and serve beneath my feet.

1288
01:43:45,747 --> 01:43:48,265
I like what you're sellin' lady.

1289
01:43:49,015 --> 01:43:52,639
There's only one teeny problem.

1290
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,536
You messed with my friends.

1291
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,335
Her heart's out!
We can ends this.

1292
01:44:07,755 --> 01:44:08,756
Hey, Croc!

1293
01:44:12,388 --> 01:44:13,824
Harley!

1294
01:44:58,046 --> 01:45:00,571
Please Daddy, Don't do it.

1295
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:05,989
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.

1296
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:08,379
Daddy I love you.

1297
01:45:09,217 --> 01:45:11,597
Please don't do this.

1298
01:46:06,028 --> 01:46:07,449
That was a great shot man.

1299
01:46:07,450 --> 01:46:09,856
Hey, I don't do hugs. I'm not a hugger.

1300
01:46:09,857 --> 01:46:12,778
I'm not a hugger. All right?

1301
01:46:19,146 --> 01:46:21,847
Let me join my brother.

1302
01:46:22,758 --> 01:46:23,759
Katana, no!

1303
01:46:29,121 --> 01:46:30,122
Give me that.

1304
01:46:32,253 --> 01:46:33,589
You bring June back.

1305
01:46:33,822 --> 01:46:34,961
You bring her back.

1306
01:46:35,089 --> 01:46:37,229
She's not coming back.

1307
01:46:37,458 --> 01:46:38,361
I'll crush this.

1308
01:46:38,489 --> 01:46:39,948
Do you hear me?

1309
01:46:40,090 --> 01:46:41,776
You bring June back or I'll crush this!

1310
01:46:41,938 --> 01:46:43,652
Go ahead.

1311
01:46:44,205 --> 01:46:46,419
You don't have the balls.

1312
01:47:39,049 --> 01:47:40,547
Hey, Flag.

1313
01:47:50,067 --> 01:47:51,074
June!

1314
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,219
She's gone.

1315
01:48:02,267 --> 01:48:03,859
I though killed you.

1316
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:05,758
I thought I killed you.

1317
01:48:06,755 --> 01:48:12,061
Y'all don't mind.
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

1318
01:48:12,178 --> 01:48:14,629
Yeah, and I got some business
to handle back in Gotham.

1319
01:48:14,754 --> 01:48:16,207
I'm going to hotwire a car
Need a ride?

1320
01:48:16,236 --> 01:48:17,572
You are not driving.

1321
01:48:17,672 --> 01:48:18,673
Why not?

1322
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:23,783
How are you not dead?

1323
01:48:24,174 --> 01:48:26,315
We just saved the world.

1324
01:48:26,832 --> 01:48:28,795
A "thank you" would be nice.

1325
01:48:29,142 --> 01:48:30,623
Thank you.

1326
01:48:31,193 --> 01:48:32,194
You're welcome.

1327
01:48:32,398 --> 01:48:34,401
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1328
01:48:34,656 --> 01:48:37,221
Ten years off you prison sentences.

1329
01:48:40,104 --> 01:48:43,344
Nah. That's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1330
01:48:45,557 --> 01:48:47,054
That can be arranged.

1331
01:48:48,107 --> 01:48:49,866
Ant other requests?

1332
01:48:50,501 --> 01:48:52,371
An espresso machine.

1333
01:48:52,728 --> 01:48:54,617
BET.

1334
01:48:54,993 --> 01:48:57,887
Ten years off a triple life sentence?

1335
01:48:57,896 --> 01:48:59,802
Darling, I'm walking out of here
a free man..

1336
01:48:59,803 --> 01:49:01,810
Or we're to start having some real fun.

1337
01:49:01,811 --> 01:49:04,956
Why don't have some fun?

1338
01:49:13,457 --> 01:49:16,674
You're trying to figure out this length.

1339
01:49:17,162 --> 01:49:18,530
That's the hypotenuse.

1340
01:49:18,971 --> 01:49:20,370
So you have to know this angle.

1341
01:49:20,611 --> 01:49:23,298
Okay. So, if you're up here...

1342
01:49:23,323 --> 01:49:24,744
like an a building...

1343
01:49:24,898 --> 01:49:28,178
And you shoot a man down here
an the street...

1344
01:49:28,230 --> 01:49:30,524
That's how far the bullet actually goes?

1345
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:33,250
Yeah. That's... that's right!

1346
01:49:33,461 --> 01:49:34,899
Tou are so smart, Right.

1347
01:49:34,903 --> 01:49:37,207
The hypotenuse, good one.

1348
01:49:38,327 --> 01:49:40,245
So that would make you
have to know the angle...

1349
01:49:40,354 --> 01:49:42,785
Between the building and the sidewalk.

1350
01:49:42,787 --> 01:49:44,517
You got to know that angle.

1351
01:49:44,518 --> 01:49:46,174
No, I mean, in real life...

1352
01:49:46,175 --> 01:49:47,229
You have variables.

1353
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:48,779
You know. You got rifling twist.

1354
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:51,399
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1355
01:49:51,954 --> 01:49:55,918
Some shots you'll even have to take
the curvature of the earth in with the...

1356
01:49:56,044 --> 01:49:57,456
It's time.

1357
01:49:58,729 --> 01:49:59,730
Wind effect.

1358
01:50:01,515 --> 01:50:03,785
You know, there's a lot variables...

1359
01:50:04,657 --> 01:50:06,356
In the street.

1360
01:50:09,903 --> 01:50:11,409
I gotta go.

1361
01:50:11,977 --> 01:50:13,311
Are you coming back?

1362
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:16,211
Yeah.

1363
01:50:16,311 --> 01:50:18,944
I'm working it out. All right?

1364
01:50:18,945 --> 01:50:23,817
You know, promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go...

1365
01:50:23,818 --> 01:50:25,752
Without killing them all.

1366
01:50:25,836 --> 01:50:27,018
Bring in it.

1367
01:50:30,134 --> 01:50:31,269
I love you. Daddy.

1368
01:50:34,129 --> 01:50:35,609
I love you.

1369
01:51:01,334 --> 01:51:04,119
Hey! Let me out!

1370
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,045
Let me out of here right now!

1371
01:51:06,355 --> 01:51:09,532
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

1372
01:51:09,806 --> 01:51:13,455
Let me out of here. Darling, please.
Please, I'm begging you. Seriously.

1373
01:51:13,456 --> 01:51:16,790
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1374
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,703
Come on!

1375
01:52:13,022 --> 01:52:14,865
Puddin"!

1376
01:52:16,991 --> 01:52:19,413
Let's go home.

1377
01:52:21,803 --> 01:52:25,169
Our channel ID: <font color="#ffff80">@SubElites.</font>

1378

My E-mail address: <font color="#8080ff">aliakbar_1022@yahoo.com</font>
My Telegram ID: <font color="#0000ff">@Aliakbar99.</font>

1379
01:52:33,054 --> 01:52:37,881
Listen, I can keep a secret, OK?
What do you want?

1380
01:52:37,882 --> 01:52:38,966
People have asked questions

1381
01:52:39,007 --> 01:52:40,376
about Midway City.

1382
01:52:40,504 --> 01:52:42,036
The kind of people can get the answers,

1383
01:52:42,236 --> 01:52:45,236
And if they can get those answers, [???]

1384
01:52:45,538 --> 01:52:49,445
Consider yourself under my protection. If you deliver.

1385
01:53:06,027 --> 01:53:07,155
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1386
01:53:09,831 --> 01:53:11,142
It likes to make friends.

1387
01:53:13,194 --> 01:53:14,195
It's the difference between us.

1388
01:53:14,237 --> 01:53:15,238
You believe in friendship.

1389
01:53:15,343 --> 01:53:16,424
I believe in the leverage.

1390
01:53:17,966 --> 01:53:18,967
Goodnight.

1391
01:53:19,086 --> 01:53:20,448
You look tired.

1392
01:53:21,042 --> 01:53:23,294
You should stop working at nights.

1393
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:28,145
You should shout it down,
or my friends and I will for you.
