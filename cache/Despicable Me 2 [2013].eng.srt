1
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,253
Ta-da!

2
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,948
Ta-da!

3
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:32,157
Ta-da!

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,742
Ta-da!! Ta...
Ta-da!

5
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,120
Ta-da!

6
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,622
Ta-da!

7
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:18,490
Three weeks, and we're
still no closer to cracking this.

8
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,493
Right, bring him in!

9
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,911
Yes, sir.

10
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,146
This is the best party ever!

11
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,203
Yeah!

12
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,427
Oh, no!
A dragon is approaching!

13
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:30,020
Fear not, for here come
the gallant knights to save us.

14
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,665
No, no, no. What do you
mean she's not coming?

15
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,585
I have a backyard full
of these little girls

16
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,619
who are counting on a visit
from a fairy princess.

17
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,752
Hurts!

18
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:00,717
Stop it!

19
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,642
Listen! I don't want a refund,
I want the fairy princess,

20
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,102
Please, please,
I'm begging you.

21
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,605
You know what?
I hope that you can sleep at night,

22
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,107
you crusher of
little girls' dreams!

23
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,819
When's the fairy
princess coming?

24
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,530
Any minute now!

25
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,242
Stall them!

26
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:43,093
Okay! Okay, all right.

27
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,803
That's enough of
the magic show.

28
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,183
Wait, did you hear that?

29
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,979
It sounded like the twinkling
sounds of magical fairy dust.

30
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,523
It's the fairy princess!
She's coming!

31
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:58,692
Look!

32
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,931
It is I, Gruzinkerbell,

33
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,436
the most magical
fairy princess of all!

34
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,607
And I am here to
wish Princess Agnes

35
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,984
a very happy birthday!

36
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,986
How come you're so fat?

37
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,363
Because

38
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,074
my house is made of candy,

39
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,078
and sometimes I eat
instead of facing my problems!

40
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,927
How come you have...

41
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,499
Okay, time for cake.

42
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,633
Thank you, Gruzinkerbell!
You're the best fairy princess ever!

43
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,789
You are welcome, little girl!

44
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,184
I know it's really you, Gru.
I'm just pretending for the other kids.

45
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,531
Hey there, Gru.
Mr. Life of the Party!

46
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,443
Hello, Jillian.

47
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,696
So, I'm gonna go
out on a limb here,

48
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:31,628
but my friend Natalie is
recently single, and...

49
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,705
No, no, no, get off the
limb right now. No limb.

50
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:38,166
Come on, she's a riot!

51
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,294
She sings karaoke,
she has a lot of free time,

52
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,047
looks aren't that
important to her...

53
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,218
No, Jills, that is not happening.
Seriously, I'm fine.

54
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,762
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.
How about my cousin Linda?

55
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,930
No!

56
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,724
I know someone whose
husband just died...

57
00:07:57,547 --> 00:08:00,021
I'm sorry,
I did not see you there.

58
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:02,906
Or there.

59
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,078
Kyle? Kyle?

60
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:16,736
Kyle, no!

61
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,794
Do not do your
business on the petunias!

62
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,919
There you go.
Those are Fred's, go crazy.

63
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,383
Good boy!

64
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,592
Mr. Gru?

65
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,844
I didn't... What? Yes?

66
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,932
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde
of the AVL.

67
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,454
Sorry, you're gonna
have to come with me.

68
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,274
Sorry, I... Freeze ray!

69
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,071
You know, you really
should announce

70
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,115
your weapons after
you fire them, Mr. Gru.

71
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,700
For example...

72
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,663
Lipstick taser!

73
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,456
Oh, it works so good.

74
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,052
Man!

75
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,305
Large person.

76
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:23,772
Sorry.

77
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,819
Get. In. There...

78
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,655
...You. Big. Man!

79
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,579
Boss!

80
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,251
What? Where?

81
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,346
Foot is asleep.

82
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,230
Pins and needles!

83
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:39,384
Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.

84
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,513
I apologize for our methods
in getting you here.

85
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,266
I don't.
I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

86
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,017
I am not gonna lie,
I enjoyed that.

87
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,728
Every second of it.
Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.

88
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,563
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

89
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,940
Sorry, sir.

90
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,566
Okay, this is bogus!

91
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,821
I don't know who you people
think you are, but...

92
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,365
We are the Anti-Villain League.

93
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,480
An ultra-secret organization

94
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:07,912
dedicated to fighting
crime on a global scale.

95
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:13,126
Rob a bank, we're not interested.
Kill someone, not our deal.

96
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,950
But you want to melt
the polar ice caps,

97
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,047
or vaporize Mount Fuji,

98
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:21,801
or even steal the Moon...

99
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,220
Then we notice.

100
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,265
First of all, you got
no proof that I did that.

101
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,185
Second, after I did do that,
I put it back!

102
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,979
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.

103
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,064
That's why we brought you here.

104
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:39,193
I am the League's director,
Silas Ramsbottom.

105
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,903
Bottom.

106
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,292
Hilarious.

107
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,286
Agent Wilde?

108
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:49,676
Me now?

109
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,231
Recently,
an entire top-secret lab

110
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,791
disappeared from
the Arctic Circle.

111
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,070
Yeah, the entire lab, just...

112
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,589
Gone. Where did it go?

113
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,090
I don't care.

114
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:03,676
The lab was
devoted to experiments

115
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,013
involving PX-41,
a transmutation serum.

116
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,100
What is PX-41, you ask?
It's pretty bad. Look.

117
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:33,748
You usually don't
see that in bunnies.

118
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,835
As you can see, in the wrong hands,
the PX-41 serum

119
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,750
could be the most devastating
weapon on Earth.

120
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:47,261
Fortunately, it has a very
distinct chemical footprint.

121
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,431
And using the latest
chem-tracking technology,

122
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,684
we found traces of it
in the Paradise Mall.

123
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,144
A mall?

124
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,855
Precisely. And we
believe that one of these

125
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,400
shop owners is
a master criminal.

126
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,692
And that's where you come in.

127
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:06,155
As an ex-villain, you know how
a villain thinks, how a villain acts.

128
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,241
The plan is to set
you up undercover

129
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,284
at a shop in the mall,
where hopefully...

130
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,287
Okay, I see
where this is going,

131
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,707
with all the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> stuff,
but no. No!

132
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,503
I'm a father now.
And a legitimate businessman.

133
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,298
I am developing a line
of delicious jams and jellies.

134
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,760
"Jams and jellies"?

135
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:30,763
Attitude!
That's right!

136
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,807
So, thanks, but no thanks.

137
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:38,688
And here's a tip. Instead of
tasing people and kidnapping them,

138
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,479
maybe you should
just give them a call!

139
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:43,693
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt.

140
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,097
Ramsbottom.

141
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,029
Yeah,
like that's any better.

142
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:48,420
Hello.

143
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,847
Look, I probably
shouldn't be saying this.

144
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:06,215
But your work as a villain
was kind of amazing.

145
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,553
So, if you ever wanna get back
to doing something awesome,

146
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,347
give us a call.

147
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,785
Hey, I told you
guys to get to bed.

148
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:36,078
Sorry.

149
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,705
So, when you going
on your date?

150
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,651
What?

151
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:41,125
Remember, Miss Jillian said
she was arranging a date for you.

152
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,254
Yeah, well, she is a nut job,
and I'm not going on any date.

153
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,465
Why not? Are you scared?

154
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,391
Hey, did you guys see
the Moon landing on TV?

155
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,102
Yeah, I can't believe it.
It's so cool!

156
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,646
Excuse me? Lisa?

157
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,980
I was talking to
Billy the other day.

158
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,148
No way!

159
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,566
He is so cute.

160
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:08,744
Hey, Lisa,
I was wondering if you...

161
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,074
Gru touched Lisa!
Gru touched Lisa!

162
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,827
Lisa's got Gruties!

163
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:28,089
Scared? Of what? Women?
No! That's bonkers!

164
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:32,426
I just have no interest in going
on a date, that's all. Case closed.

165
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,846
I'm not scared.
Of women. Or dates.

166
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,557
Let's go to bed.

167
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,351
Good night, Edith.

168
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,620
Good night, Margo.

169
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,065
Hold the horses.
Who are you texting?

170
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,775
No one. Just my friend Avery.

171
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:52,655
Avery. Avery?
Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?

172
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,115
Does it matter?

173
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,535
No, no, it doesn't
matter unless it's a boy!

174
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,996
I know what makes you a boy.

175
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,082
you do?

176
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,334
Your bald head.

177
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:08,004
Yes.

178
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,172
It's really smooth.

179
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,579
Sometimes I stare at it,

180
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,884
and imagine a little
chick popping out.

181
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,848
Good night, Agnes.

182
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:22,059
Never get older.

183
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,266
Okay, okay.

184
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,132
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

185
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:39,762
Donnie, hang in there, baby!
It's almost Friday.

186
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,556
So, how's today's batch,
Dr. Nefario?

187
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,350
I developed a new formula

188
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,268
which allowed me
to get every known

189
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,188
kind of berry into
one flavor of jelly.

190
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,360
That tastes good!

191
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,700
I love the flavor of that!

192
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,364
It's horrible, isn't it?

193
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,782
No, no!

194
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,834
We're making great progress!

195
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,286
Here, try some of this.

196
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,707
Okay, just because
everybody hates it,

197
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:21,804
doesn't mean it's not good!

198
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,723
Listen, Gru,

199
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,391
there's something
I've been meaning

200
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,184
to talk to you
about for some time now.

201
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,103
What? What's wrong?

202
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,400
I miss being evil.

203
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,516
Sinister plots,
large-scale crimes.

204
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,654
It's what I live for.

205
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,602
I mean, don't you
think there's more

206
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:43,594
to our future than jelly?

207
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,871
Well, I'm also
considering a line of jams.

208
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,332
The thing is, Gru,

209
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,669
I've had an offer of
employment elsewhere.

210
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,088
Dr. Nefario!

211
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,215
Come on,
you're kidding, right?

212
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,470
It's a great opportunity for me.

213
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,262
Bigger lab, more evil,

214
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:05,181
full dental.

215
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,982
Very well.

216
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,694
Let us give you
the proper send-off.

217
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,404
Minions!

218
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,246
The highest honor
awarded to Dr. Nefario

219
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,166
for your years of service,

220
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,711
the 21-fart gun salute!

221
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:47,056
I counted 22.

222
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,231
Farewell, my friends.

223
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,960
This may take a while.

224
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,587
Go about your business.

225
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,425
I miss you already!

226
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,649
Are you sure we
should be doing this?

227
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,818
Yes, it's for his own good.

228
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,487
Okay,
we need to choose a picture.

229
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,614
No.

230
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,990
Scary.

231
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,241
Weird.

232
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,202
What is that?

233
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,997
Good morning, girls!
I have an announcement to make.

234
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,041
Hey, what celebrity do you look like?

235
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:39,460
Bruce Willis.

236
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:41,346
No.

237
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:42,880
Humpty Dumpty!

238
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:44,506
Gollum!

239
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,968
Okay,
what are you doing?

240
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,767
We're signing you
up for online dating!

241
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,848
Okay. What? No, no, no.

242
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:54,808
Come on. It's fun.

243
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,769
And it's time for
you to get out there.

244
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,064
No! Stop!
No one is ever getting out there! Ever!

245
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,359
Okay, now for the announcement.

246
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,861
I have accepted a new job.

247
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,196
Really?

248
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,783
Yes, I have been recruited
by a top-secret agency

249
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,202
to go undercover
and save the world!

250
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,620
You're gonna be a spy?

251
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,580
That's right, baby!

252
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,540
Gru's back in the game.

253
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,406
With gadgets and
weapons and cool cars.

254
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,336
The whole deal.

255
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,545
Awesome!

256
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,923
Are you really
gonna save the world?

257
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,510
Yes. Yes, I am.

258
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,378
"Bake My Day."

259
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,540
All right.

260
00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:18,726
Here is the cupcake
recipe I got off the Internet.

261
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,858
And don't go nuts
with the sprinkles!

262
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,592
I wasn't expecting that.
Or was I?

263
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:56,039
You got... you got a little...

264
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,808
Here, I'll get it.

265
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:02,895
It's just spreading.

266
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,314
All right, all right.
I got it! Stop it!

267
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:07,941
I'll let you get it.

268
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,862
Yeah, what you just
saw there was a little

269
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,614
something new
I've been working on.

270
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,618
It's a combination of Jujitsu,
Krav Maga, Aztec warfare

271
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,870
and krumping.

272
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,664
Okay, that's weird.
Why are you here?

273
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,417
On assignment from Silas.
I'm your new partner.

274
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,505
What? No, no "yay."

275
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,257
Ramsbottom didn't say anything
about a partner.

276
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,259
Well, it seems that because
of your checkered past,

277
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,095
everyone else
refused to work with you.

278
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,555
But not me. I stepped up.

279
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,184
And I'm new, so I kind of have
to do what they tell me anyway.

280
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,894
Walla!

281
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,317
Do you know this guy?

282
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,486
Yes, he's one of my minions.

283
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:54,404
I'm sorry.

284
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,148
I should have known.

285
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,367
You are free to go.

286
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,134
<i>Kampai!</i>

287
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,025
<i>Dave...</i>

288
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,279
Earth to Dave!

289
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,157
You can leave now.

290
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,126
So, what do we got?
Who's on the list?

291
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,544
Fire them at me.

292
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,672
First suspect,
Hedda Blumentoft,

293
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,632
proprietor of Mum's
the Word Floral Shop.

294
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,509
No, not her.

295
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,219
Okay, moving on...

296
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,139
Chuck Kinney,
owner of Stuff-A-Bear.

297
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:06,602
I don't think so.

298
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,562
Hello?

299
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,443
<i>Buenos días,</i> my friends!

300
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,237
I am Eduardo Perez,

301
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,477
owner of <i>Salsa y Salsa</i>
restaurant,

302
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:20,616
across the mall.

303
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:23,744
Now open for breakfast.
And you are?

304
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,622
Gru. And this is Lucy.
And we are closed.

305
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,916
This is just going
to take <i>un momento.</i>

306
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,460
I am throwing a big
<i>Cinco de Mayo</i> party,

307
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,631
and I am going to need
200 of your best cupcakes

308
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:39,551
decorated with
the Mexican flag.

309
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,345
It looks something like this.

310
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,348
What do you think?

311
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,447
Look away!

312
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,326
Anyway, I have to go.

313
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,815
It's all settled.
I'll pick them up next week!

314
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,260
Have a good day.
Come by if you get a chance, okay?

315
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,576
And welcome to
the mall family.

316
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,627
El Macho.

317
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,087
What?

318
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,338
But it couldn't be.

319
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,006
What? What couldn't be?

320
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,756
That guy looks exactly like
a villain named...

321
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:24,554
El Macho.

322
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,515
From about 20 years ago.

323
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,022
<i>He was ruthless!</i>

324
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,691
<i>He was dangerous.</i>

325
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,695
<i>And as the name implies,
very macho.</i>

326
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:55,043
<i>He had a reputation for pulling
off heists using only his bare hands!</i>

327
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:02,175
<i>But sadly, like all the greats,
El Macho was gone too soon.</i>

328
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,554
<i>He died in the most
macho way possible.</i>

329
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,389
<i>Riding a shark</i>

330
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,643
<i>with 250 pounds of dynamite
strapped to his chest</i>

331
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,897
<i>into the mouth of
an active volcano!</i>

332
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,985
<i>It was glorious.</i>

333
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,240
Yeah, sounds like
El Macho's pretty dead.

334
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,784
They never found the body.
Oh, no.

335
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:33,081
All that was ever retrieved
was a pile of singed chest hair.

336
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,793
But that face!
It has got to be El Macho!

337
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:41,256
Then what do you say you and I
break into his restaurant? Tonight!

338
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,051
Yes, that's good,
because I am telling you,

339
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:48,388
if anybody in this
place has the PX-41 serum,

340
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,640
it's him.

341
00:30:53,254 --> 00:30:56,855
All right, all right, homework done,
pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.

342
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,106
What's the big hurry?

343
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,150
I just have
a lot of work to do.

344
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,194
Work, what kind of work?

345
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,987
Very important business.

346
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,679
So, hugs, kisses.

347
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:08,784
Good night, sleep tight, don't let
the bedbugs blah-blah-blah.

348
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,370
But you said
you'd help me practice

349
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,538
my part for
the Mother's Day show.

350
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,210
Fine, fine.
Let me hear it. Quickly.

351
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:22,089
<i>She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.</i>

352
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,175
<i>My mother is beyond compare.</i>

353
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:28,220
<i>We love you,
mothers, everywhere.</i>

354
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,640
Wow! That was something else.

355
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,768
I really liked the way
you smiled at the end.

356
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,937
Let's try this one more time,

357
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:42,192
but a teensy bit less
like a zombie, okay?

358
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,318
Okay.

359
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,446
<i>She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair...</i>

360
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,323
Perfect! Time to go.

361
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,951
I don't think I should do this.

362
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,328
Well, what do you mean?
Why not?

363
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,122
I don't even have a mom.

364
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,583
Well, you don't need
one to do the show.

365
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,420
I mean, you did
the Veterans Day Pageant

366
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,004
and you haven't been in combat.

367
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,507
This is different.

368
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:10,637
Okay, well, then maybe
you can just use your imagination.

369
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,598
You mean
I pretend I have a mom?

370
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,476
Yes, right?
You can do that, can't you?

371
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,687
Yeah! I do that all the time.

372
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,188
Thanks, Gru!

373
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,522
Hey!

374
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,055
All right. Hey, hey,
no, no! No.

375
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,308
Hey. Hey, please.

376
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,561
Kevin, Jerry,
watch the girls for me, okay?

377
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,064
Dave, Stuart, come this way!
With me! Come on!

378
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,985
Come on!

379
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,283
- Oca!
- Oca!

380
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,610
Looka too!

381
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,310
We're stealth ninjas.
We make no sound.

382
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,604
Right. Gotcha.

383
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,028
All right, El Macho.
You're going down.

384
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,155
- Wait! Wait.
- What?

385
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,907
What are you doing?

386
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,619
I'm checking for
laser beam alarm triggers.

387
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,121
It's a restaurant!

388
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,748
You never know what
kind of booby traps

389
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,416
this guy could have set.
Come on.

390
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,835
There are no booby traps.

391
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:31,921
Booby!

392
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:44,559
There's a chicken.

393
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:46,936
Are you lost, little guy?

394
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,980
You must be lost.

395
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:51,262
Some guard dog.

396
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,739
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!

397
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,490
I got you!

398
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,254
I got it!

399
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,984
What is wrong with that chicken?

400
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,619
Hey, that <i>pollo es loco.</i>

401
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:41,282
No?

402
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:43,326
Okay, let's go.

403
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,001
Are you getting anything?

404
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,628
No, not yet.

405
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,212
But, hey, maybe you
can find something

406
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:57,507
with these X-ray goggles.

407
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,642
How are they working?
Tell me! Tell me!

408
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,674
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?

409
00:37:10,955 --> 00:37:14,232
That's an image I'll never
get out of my brain.

410
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,159
I knew it!

411
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,161
The serum is in here!

412
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:27,495
Then let's get it.

413
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,000
This is going to be good!

414
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:39,966
What?

415
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,178
Salsa?

416
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:44,992
Man!

417
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,564
Somebody's going
to die tonight.

418
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,262
Pollito!

419
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,324
What did they do to you?
Pollito? Can you hear me?

420
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,953
Who would do this to
such a sweet little chicken?

421
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,955
What? Who's there?

422
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,709
You coming out?
Or am I gonna go in?

423
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,887
Stop!

424
00:38:26,629 --> 00:38:27,918
My eyes!

425
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,392
Gru, call one of
your munchkins!

426
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,686
We've been spotted!
Come get us!

427
00:38:34,238 --> 00:38:35,146
Hey!

428
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,678
Subtle.

429
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,290
Over here! Over here!

430
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,959
Over

431
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,168
here.

432
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,260
Hold tight!

433
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,606
I have you now!

434
00:39:54,373 --> 00:39:55,476
Ice cream!

435
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,744
All right, there he is.

436
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,789
Suspect number eight,
Floyd Eaglesan.

437
00:40:58,612 --> 00:40:59,499
Okay.

438
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,542
See if you can get closer.
Go, go.

439
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,097
All right.

440
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,348
What the...

441
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,685
Oh, no. That's not good.

442
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,064
Hey, what?

443
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,990
Hey, Gru!

444
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,534
Girls!
What are you doing here?

445
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,577
Well, we thought
we'd come visit you at work.

446
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,414
So, you're saving the world
in a garbage can?

447
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,000
Funny.

448
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,918
Hey! There you are.

449
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,541
Who's this?

450
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:49,590
Lucy, these are my girls,
Margo, Edith and Agnes.

451
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,552
Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls.

452
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,595
- Hello.
- Hi.

453
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,397
Are you single?

454
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:06,607
Goodness.

455
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:08,944
Hey! I have an idea.

456
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:10,737
Since Lucy and I
have lots of work to do,

457
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:13,489
why don't you girls go
and explore the mall?

458
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,784
Here is some money, go
buy some useless mall junk.

459
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,536
Some headbands and...

460
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,121
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

461
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:24,167
Are you out of your gourd?
No! She just works with me.

462
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,668
Plus, you love her.

463
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,463
<i>You love her! You love her!
You really, really love her!</i>

464
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,797
<i>And you're gonna get married!</i>

465
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:30,965
Okay, stop.
This is a song of lies.

466
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,133
<i>And I will be
the flower girl!</i>

467
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,826
I don't even like her.
Now, go have fun!

468
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:38,347
Almost forgot. Hugs!

469
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,932
Good luck saving the world. Bye.

470
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,309
Bye, Gru!

471
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,941
Kids, right? They're funny.

472
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,985
Those girls totally adore you.

473
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,820
I bet you're a fun dad.

474
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,657
I am pretty fun.

475
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,001
Is that stealing?

476
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,004
Not if my wish was that
I would get a lot of free coins.

477
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,703
Cool glasses.

478
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,124
I'm Antonio.

479
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,209
I'm Margo.

480
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,963
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?

481
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,006
Sure.

482
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,801
I'm Margo.

483
00:44:05,274 --> 00:44:06,978
I'll catch up
with you guys later.

484
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,396
Bye!

485
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,525
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"

486
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,485
We gotta go tell Gru!

487
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,783
All right, I'm going in.

488
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,911
<i>If it picks up any traces of the serum,
the sensor in your belt buckle</i>

489
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,371
will make a sound like this...

490
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,832
Okay!

491
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,667
I get it. I get it.

492
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,969
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.

493
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,638
It's about time you showed up,

494
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,098
Mr. Gru.

495
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,351
You know my name?

496
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,939
When someone moves into the
mall who is folically-challenged,

497
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,610
I make it my business
to know all about them.

498
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,446
You are bald, and that is bad.

499
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,282
There you go, my sweet.

500
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,242
<i>I'm getting nothing so far.</i>

501
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,952
I think you need
to move around.

502
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:15,421
This looks interesting.
What is it?

503
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,089
I take it you're an art lover?

504
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,299
<i>No serum.</i>

505
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,592
Yeah, not so much.

506
00:45:23,605 --> 00:45:26,349
How about this
impressive trinket?

507
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,605
I'd hardly call it
a trinket, Mr. Gru.

508
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,852
<i>- Nothing.</i>
- The International...

509
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,062
Yeah, I don't care.

510
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,645
<i>Hold on,
I'm picking up something.</i>

511
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:40,738
<i>Behind that wall!</i>

512
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,490
And what do we have here?

513
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,826
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.

514
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,163
No, thanks. So, what's on
the other side of the wall?

515
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,581
Here you are!
Look at me! Focus!

516
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:51,832
<i>Gru?</i>

517
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:56,420
I promise that this wig
will transform you from ugly

518
00:45:56,947 --> 00:45:59,590
to irresistible.

519
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,842
Margo has a boyfriend!

520
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,928
And they're going on a date!

521
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,346
Date? Boyfriend?

522
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,681
What?

523
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,194
There she goes!

524
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:33,874
You're so funny.

525
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,126
Gross!

526
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,378
- Look, they're in love.
- No, no, no.

527
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,880
Do not say that. No, no, no.

528
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:44,302
And my dream is to one day
play video games for a living.

529
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,264
You're so complicated.

530
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,932
Margo.

531
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,600
What is going on here?

532
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:56,480
Gru, <i>se llama</i> Antonio.
<i>Me llamo</i> Margo.

533
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,900
Me llama-lama ding-dong.
Who cares? Let's go.

534
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,391
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

535
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,861
Yay, Pop!

536
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,571
That's awesome!

537
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:51,118
- So good to see you again, <i>mi compadre!</i>
- Yeah.

538
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:53,662
I see you have
already met my father.

539
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,915
What? Father?

540
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,418
<i>Sí.</i> Look at this crazy
small world we live in, eh?

541
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,504
Come, sit,
let me get you something.

542
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:05,341
Look at you.

543
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,856
He likes me.

544
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:13,682
I'm sorry.
Pollito is usually very friendly.

545
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:15,351
He had a rough night.

546
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,607
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.

547
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,484
That is a pity.

548
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,278
Young love is beautiful, no?

549
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,302
No!

550
00:48:27,927 --> 00:48:31,325
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other.

551
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,328
You are right,
<i>Cabeza de huevo.</i>

552
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,664
They must get to
know each other better!

553
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:40,876
Antonio, why don't you invite
your girlfriend and her family

554
00:48:41,206 --> 00:48:42,586
to our <i>Cinco de Mayo</i> party?

555
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,712
No, no.

556
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,922
<i>Sí!</i>

557
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,022
I'm sorry, El Macho?

558
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,150
Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect

559
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,277
after the whole salsa incident?

560
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,863
Yes, but there has
been a new development,

561
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,032
and I'm telling you,
this is the guy.

562
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,535
You need to
arrest him immediately.

563
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,122
And his deviously charming son!

564
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,125
I'm pretty sure that
the son is involved, too.

565
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,878
The son, also!
You got to get the son!

566
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:27,548
I think that
the son is the mastermind!

567
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,176
There's a look,
there's a devilish look

568
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:31,802
in his eyes,
and I don't like it!

569
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,971
Yes, but I don't
really see any evidence.

570
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,806
Evidence, schmevidence.
I go with my gut,

571
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,560
and my gut tells me
that this guy is El Macho.

572
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,146
Lock him up, lock up the son.

573
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:46,233
Don't forget about the son.
The kid gives me the creeps!

574
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,319
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

575
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:53,407
But, on the less...
"crazy" side of things,

576
00:49:53,964 --> 00:49:56,702
Gru discovered traces of
the serum at Eagle Hair Club!

577
00:49:57,978 --> 00:49:59,038
Interesting.

578
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,332
Yeah! And you know
who made that happen? Huh?

579
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,710
This guy.
Nailed it. Amazing, right?

580
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:08,589
No, I mean, sure.
But it's not him, it is El Macho!

581
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,591
Mr. Gru, please!

582
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,594
No! It is him,
and I will prove it!

583
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,264
Gru, come on!

584
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:22,061
He really thinks it's El Macho.

585
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,271
Can you tell?

586
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,836
Give me that!

587
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,888
Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out!

588
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,765
Kevin?

589
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,518
Hey, Lance,
where the heck is Kevin?

590
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:50,190
All right, we need to revisit the
number of vacation days you guys get.

591
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,651
I can't find anybody anymore.

592
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,446
Gru, it's Jillian!

593
00:51:56,556 --> 00:51:58,365
I've got good news!

594
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,659
I have my friend
Shannon here with me.

595
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,870
I was thinking you
two could get some grub.

596
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,236
You know, tear it up,
see what happens!

597
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,541
Open up!

598
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,171
Agnes! Agnes.
Tell Jillian I'm not here.

599
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,381
Gru's not here.

600
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,216
Are you sure?

601
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,801
Yes, he just told me!

602
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,473
I mean, no,
he didn't just tell me.

603
00:52:23,686 --> 00:52:25,684
Agnes, where is Gru?

604
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,937
He's putting on lipstick!

605
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,899
He's swatting at flies!

606
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,067
No! No!

607
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,652
He's chopping his head off!

608
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:39,114
He's pooping?

609
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,909
I know you're in there, Gru!

610
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:45,454
There's no way you're
getting out of this!

611
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,046
I have to tell you,
I was so nervous about tonight.

612
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,341
I mean there's just so
many phonies out there!

613
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,910
Yes, I hear you.

614
00:53:02,238 --> 00:53:03,389
So, do you work out?

615
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:04,556
Well...

616
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:07,518
I mean, obviously, you don't,
but would you consider it?

617
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:11,271
Physical fitness is very
important to Shannon.

618
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,197
As you can tell, right?

619
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,610
I can tell.

620
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,861
Solid.

621
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,531
We are in the restaurant,
you know.

622
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,951
Hi. Takeout for Lucy?

623
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,577
Sure, just a sec.

624
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,602
<i>Your accent is so exotic.</i>

625
00:53:41,165 --> 00:53:43,137
Well, thank you very much.

626
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,888
I know someone who
can fix that for you.

627
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,808
And you'll be
talking normal in no time!

628
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,312
Is it hot in here?

629
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,024
How's the food?

630
00:53:57,198 --> 00:53:58,237
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

631
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:00,779
Are you wearing a wig?

632
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,030
What?

633
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:04,074
I don't think so.

634
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,325
I knew it.

635
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,578
You're a phony.
I hate phonies!

636
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:09,872
What?
No. These locks are all mine.

637
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,248
No, they're not!

638
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,612
You know what I'm gonna do?

639
00:54:12,636 --> 00:54:14,460
I'm gonna rip that
thing off your head,

640
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:15,672
and show everyone what

641
00:54:15,696 --> 00:54:17,421
<i>a bald-headed
phony you are.</i>

642
00:54:17,511 --> 00:54:18,753
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

643
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,725
Hello?

644
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,340
Hello? Are you...

645
00:54:31,387 --> 00:54:32,478
Hey, Gru.

646
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:35,689
Hello, Lucy.
How are you doing?

647
00:54:36,145 --> 00:54:38,192
Looks like your
date's out for the count.

648
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,278
It's like she's been shot
with a mild moose tranquilizer.

649
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,995
Yeah, I'm winking because
that's what actually happened.

650
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,290
<i>Scusi,</i> what's happening here?
She no like?

651
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,833
She's just...

652
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,004
Sí, sí.

653
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,006
Shall we take her home?

654
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,996
Well, I think you did it.

655
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,927
You just officially had
the worst date ever.

656
00:55:47,582 --> 00:55:48,595
Tell me about it.

657
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:49,961
Don't worry.

658
00:55:49,985 --> 00:55:52,182
It can only get
better from here, right?

659
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,393
But if it doesn't, you can
always borrow my dart gun.

660
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,854
I've had to use it on
one or two dates myself.

661
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,189
Yeah, you know,
as far as dates go,

662
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,608
I think I'm good
with just the one.

663
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,490
Well,
good night, partner.

664
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,077
This was fun.

665
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,997
Yes. Surprisingly, it was.

666
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:16,415
And...

667
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,958
just between you and me?

668
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,419
You look much better bald.

669
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,298
See you tomorrow.

670
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,483
So, I take it
the date went well?

671
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,488
No, it was horrible.

672
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,075
High-five!

673
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,209
Bump it.

674
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,253
Mr. Ramsbottom?

675
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:46,588
Oh, hello.

676
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,131
What are you doing here?

677
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,133
- We got him.
- Got who?

678
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,927
Floyd Eaglesan!

679
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,972
Our agents located a secret
room in his shop last night

680
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,848
and discovered this.

681
00:57:56,932 --> 00:58:01,061
It's empty, but we found
traces of the PX-41 serum in it.

682
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,562
He's our man.

683
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:07,067
So, somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

684
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,735
I was framed!

685
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,404
You won't get away with this!

686
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,031
Get your mitts off of me!
I am a legitimate businessman.

687
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:16,868
All right. So what now?

688
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:20,038
Well, now you're free to
go back to your business.

689
00:58:21,013 --> 00:58:22,582
Jams and jellies.

690
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,668
And it looks like
Agent Wilde will be

691
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,712
transferring to our
Australian branch.

692
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:28,630
Australia?

693
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:29,923
Yes.

694
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,758
But thank you for everything.

695
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,678
And by everything,
of course I mean nothing.

696
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,347
Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru.

697
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,062
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

698
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,564
So, we got him.

699
00:58:46,904 --> 00:58:48,170
That's great.

700
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,694
And now you're
going to Australia?

701
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,530
Well, it's not definite yet.
I'm still figuring it out.

702
00:58:53,818 --> 00:58:55,506
I've already been
working on my accent.

703
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,993
Wallaby. Didgeridoo.

704
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,553
Hugh Jackman.

705
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:04,750
So... Pretty excited.

706
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,085
Great.

707
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,463
Well, good luck.

708
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:12,340
Thanks. You, too.

709
00:59:14,031 --> 00:59:15,802
Here.
I wanted to give you this.

710
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,804
Your lipstick taser?

711
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,806
Yeah, it's just a memento.

712
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,977
Just, you know,
from the first time we met.

713
00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:26,313
Thank you, Lucy.

714
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,648
Agent Wilde.

715
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,235
Well, it looks like
they need you, so...

716
00:59:32,472 --> 00:59:35,113
Yeah, I better go.

717
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,574
Bye, Gru.

718
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,029
I brought you an umbrella.

719
01:00:20,509 --> 01:00:22,661
- Thank you.
- What are you doing out here?

720
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:27,374
Remember when you
said that I liked Lucy?

721
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:31,002
Well, it turns out,

722
01:00:31,376 --> 01:00:32,394
you're right.

723
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,214
Really?

724
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,757
Yes, but...

725
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,885
Well, she's moving away.

726
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,763
I'm never going
to see her again.

727
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,602
Is there anything
I could do to help?

728
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,940
I don't...
I don't think so, sweetheart.

729
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,569
Well, is there
anything you could do?

730
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,823
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.

731
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,993
I know up to this
point our relationship

732
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,122
has been strictly professional,

733
01:01:05,677 --> 01:01:09,318
and you're leaving for
Australia and all, but...

734
01:01:10,154 --> 01:01:12,716
Okay, here is the question.

735
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,754
Would you like to...

736
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:18,605
To go out on a date?

737
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:21,928
No.

738
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,972
Okay, that's not helping.

739
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,058
All right, here we go.
For real this time.

740
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,320
I can do this.

741
01:01:57,367 --> 01:01:58,298
I hate you!

742
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,945
Kevin?

743
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:03,780
Tom?

744
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:04,948
Hello!

745
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,284
<i>- Kampai!
- Kampai!</i>

746
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:08,802
<i>Kampai!</i>

747
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:32,225
<i>Cinco de May-ya-yo!
Cinco de May-ya-yo!</i>

748
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,446
This place is awesome!

749
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,607
Okay. Let's party.

750
01:03:49,263 --> 01:03:51,828
But first,
let's go over the rules.

751
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,165
Because what is fun
without the rules?

752
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,958
Agnes, easy on the churros.

753
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,377
- Edith, try not to kill anyone.
<i>- Hai!</i>

754
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,670
Margo!

755
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:01,880
Hello, Mr. Gru.

756
01:04:02,513 --> 01:04:03,340
Okay.

757
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:04,966
Gru!

758
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:10,013
There must be the standard
6 feet of space between you and boys.

759
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,890
Especially this boy.

760
01:04:13,942 --> 01:04:14,976
You are a funny man.

761
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,937
There are no rules, <i>señor.</i>
It's <i>Cinco de Mayo.</i>

762
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,315
Come on!
They're starting the dance!

763
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,941
<i>¡Arriba!</i>

764
01:05:19,563 --> 01:05:22,930
So glad you could
make it, <i>mi compadre.</i>

765
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,422
Hey, what's wrong?

766
01:05:25,661 --> 01:05:27,507
Nothing.
Nothing is wrong.

767
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:28,618
I'm just chilling

768
01:05:28,643 --> 01:05:32,345
with the guac,
from my chip hat.

769
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:38,643
Gru, please. I know
that look all too well.

770
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,007
It is the look
of a broken heart.

771
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:42,564
How did you know?

772
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:46,151
Believe me, my friend,
I too have spent many nights

773
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:49,904
trying to drown my
sorrows in guacamole.

774
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,323
- You?
- Yes.

775
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,161
But we are survivors.

776
01:05:56,244 --> 01:06:00,373
There's much more to
us than meets the eye.

777
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,917
Enjoy the party.

778
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,309
Say what?

779
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:59,158
Would you like some
peanuts or pretzels?

780
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,748
That's a good joke.

781
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:12,171
I just did a boom boom.

782
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,967
I really need you to
make a choice, hon.

783
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,012
I choose Gru.

784
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,848
I choose Gru!

785
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,604
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

786
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,355
You're welcome!

787
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:06,392
You have not lost
your touch, my friend.

788
01:09:07,491 --> 01:09:08,770
I knew it!

789
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,438
You are El Macho!

790
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,815
That's right!

791
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,296
Nobody believed me!

792
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:16,486
But I knew you weren't dead!

793
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:20,920
Of course not.
I merely faked my death.

794
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,369
But now, it's time for me

795
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:28,414
to make a spectacular
return to evil.

796
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:29,866
Doctor!

797
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:34,337
I think it's time we showed
Gru what we're up to here.

798
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,464
Dr. Nefario?

799
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,716
Nice to see you, Gru.

800
01:09:39,368 --> 01:09:40,410
Wha...?

801
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:43,513
So, this is your
new job opportunity??

802
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,557
Absolutely.
You're gonna like this.

803
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,730
Sorry.

804
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,609
I had to borrow some of your minions,
but it was for a worthy cause.

805
01:09:57,919 --> 01:09:59,028
Kevin!

806
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,281
No, he's not Kevin anymore.

807
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:07,370
Now he is an indestructible,
mindless killing machine!

808
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,540
Just watch this.

809
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:27,140
And here's the best part!

810
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:30,476
I got an army of them!

811
01:10:32,074 --> 01:10:33,137
Look, look, look!

812
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:47,076
Soon I will unleash
them on the world,

813
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:51,289
and if anyone,
anyone tries to stop them...

814
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,168
...their city gets eaten!

815
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,211
We can do it together.

816
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,504
Together?

817
01:10:58,629 --> 01:10:59,672
Together!

818
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:03,050
I have admired your
work for years, <i>amigo.</i>

819
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:06,512
Stealing the Moon!
Are you kidding?

820
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,931
We would be unstoppable!

821
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,684
Men like you, men like me.

822
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:15,855
We should be ruling the world!

823
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,690
So, are you in?

824
01:11:20,343 --> 01:11:21,694
Yeah, probably.

825
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,362
Probably?

826
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,115
I mean, yes, yes!
Of course, yes.

827
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,993
I just have a lot
going on right now.

828
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,829
I just need to get
some things off my plate

829
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:35,208
before we start taking
over the world, that's all.

830
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,210
- Excuse me?
- No, forget it.

831
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,546
One hundred percent! I am in!

832
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,758
I think...
Do you hear that? I do.

833
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:47,553
That's Agnes calling
me from on the surface.

834
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,849
Totally in!

835
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,894
You know what?

836
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,563
I am not so
convinced that he is in.

837
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,913
Edith, Agnes, come on!

838
01:12:11,788 --> 01:12:12,591
Sorry.

839
01:12:12,687 --> 01:12:14,288
We need to go home now.
Where is Margo?

840
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:15,998
But I didn't get a turn!

841
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:23,756
Margo!

842
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,133
Come on. We're leaving...

843
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,010
Hey, what's wrong?

844
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,679
I hate boys.

845
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,507
Yes. They stink.

846
01:12:35,069 --> 01:12:37,186
Sorry.
Honey, we got to go.

847
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:01,841
Sorry.

848
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,267
Hey! Pollito,
what's the matter?

849
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,476
Hey, Eduardo!

850
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,395
Lucia, I apologize.

851
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,231
Pollito,
he's usually not like this.

852
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,972
The same thing happened
the other day with...

853
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:26,986
with Gru, and...

854
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,226
Well, speaking of Gru...
have you seen him?

855
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,576
I really need to talk to him.

856
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,829
Yes. I think he's
somewhere around here.

857
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,755
You two are close, no?

858
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:40,499
I don't know.

859
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:43,920
I mean, "close,"
I wouldn't say we were close.

860
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,005
Why, did he say we were close?
Did he say that?

861
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,591
It's more what he didn't say.

862
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:52,011
For instance,
he never mentioned

863
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:55,222
that you were both working
for the Anti-Villain League!

864
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,100
You're coming with me.

865
01:13:58,184 --> 01:13:59,226
Hey!

866
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,896
Crikey!

867
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,404
So, Eduardo's
actually El Macho?

868
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,739
Cool!

869
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,157
No, it is not cool!

870
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,618
Plus, I pretty much
knew it was him all along,

871
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,703
so if anyone's cool, it's me!

872
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:20,748
<i>Gru!</i>

873
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,917
Well, Dr. Nefario.

874
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,795
<i>El Macho's onto you.
He knows you're working for the AVL.</i>

875
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,838
<i>And he's got your partner.</i>

876
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,715
Lucy?

877
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,094
That's impossible.
She's on her way to Australia!

878
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,303
<i>Nefario?</i>

879
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,638
<i>Sorry, gotta go!</i>

880
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,849
He's got Lucy?

881
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,519
Not for long.

882
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:44,063
Come on, we're
getting her out of there.

883
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,028
What was that?

884
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,166
I don't see anything.

885
01:16:41,392 --> 01:16:42,338
Run!

886
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:43,891
My unicorn!

887
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,351
Agnes, no!

888
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,137
Come on! Hurry!

889
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:25,808
What's the matter?

890
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,118
<i>Ooh là là.</i>

891
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,164
Kevin!

892
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,418
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

893
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:54,253
In the flesh.

894
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:58,942
Behold, the antidote.

895
01:18:01,121 --> 01:18:04,847
Come on. Let's finally put
this horrible jelly to some good use.

896
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,990
Hey, guys, come on!
Stay focused here.

897
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:07,534
Curses! Foiled again!

898
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,204
These guys captured me!

899
01:19:44,883 --> 01:19:46,047
No?

900
01:19:48,905 --> 01:19:50,032
Run!

901
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,462
Up that tree!

902
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:02,840
Hurry! Hurry!

903
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,694
Hello, Gru!

904
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:09,114
Hey hey!
Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

905
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:11,367
I put an antidote in the jelly.

906
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:15,871
I mean, I'm happy to create an
evil army to destroy the world,

907
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:18,707
but nobody
messes with my family.

908
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,834
Thank you, Doctor.

909
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,878
Now, let's go get the...

910
01:21:24,288 --> 01:21:25,297
Hi!

911
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,757
You brought the girls?

912
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:28,476
Yes!

913
01:21:29,866 --> 01:21:31,053
Was that wrong?

914
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,607
What's happening
to my minions?

915
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,775
Gru?

916
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,571
You guys, take care of
the rest of the minions.

917
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,657
I'm going to find Lucy.

918
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,586
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!

919
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,659
It's over, El Macho.

920
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,077
Now, where is Lucy?

921
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,746
Let me show you.

922
01:22:52,868 --> 01:22:53,844
Hey, Gru!

923
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,292
Turns out you
were right about the

924
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:57,079
whole El Macho thing, huh?

925
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,978
One push of this button,
and I send that rocket

926
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:07,441
straight into the same volcano
where I faked my death.

927
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:10,486
Only this time, it's for real.

928
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:12,029
No!

929
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,115
Tallyho!

930
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:25,584
We could have ruled
the world together, Gru!

931
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,544
But now,

932
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,588
you're gonna die.

933
01:24:42,408 --> 01:24:44,746
Lipstick taser!

934
01:24:45,861 --> 01:24:47,082
He copied me.

935
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:57,676
I am not afraid
of your jelly guns.

936
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:01,096
This ain't a jelly gun, sunshine.

937
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:17,321
Don't worry about me,
Gru, I'll be fine.

938
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:19,865
I have survived
lots worse than this.

939
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,366
Okay,
that's not entirely true.

940
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,493
I'm actually kind of
freaking out up here!

941
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:25,662
Don't worry,
I will get you out of this.

942
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:36,381
I really hate that chicken.

943
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:03,367
Is there a red one?
It's usually the red one!

944
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,747
Gru, anytime now!

945
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,210
Listen, Lucy, we may not
get out of this alive,

946
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,266
so I need to
ask you a question.

947
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:16,713
Better make it quick.

948
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:19,200
If I had asked
you out on a date,

949
01:26:19,224 --> 01:26:20,634
what would you have said?

950
01:26:21,297 --> 01:26:22,344
Are you kidding me?

951
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,470
Yes!

952
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:26,890
Jump!

953
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:40,987
Lucy!

954
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:43,907
Lucy, where are you?

955
01:26:47,384 --> 01:26:48,328
Lucy!

956
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:50,288
Gru!

957
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:55,240
Sorry!

958
01:26:55,479 --> 01:26:58,088
I guess you need your arms
to tread water, huh?

959
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,306
They'll be back.

960
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,506
<i>Underwear...</i>

961
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,684
<i>Underwear...</i>

962
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:04,112
<i>Underwear...</i>

963
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,964
Can I be
the first to say, "Ew!"

964
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,551
<i>Underwear...</i>

965
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:43,276
Okay.

966
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:45,654
Excuse me.

967
01:28:47,892 --> 01:28:49,449
Hi, excuse me.

968
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:02,462
Hi, everybody.
I'd like to make some toast.

969
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:06,216
Okay.

970
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:08,718
She...

971
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:13,056
She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.

972
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,017
We love you,
mothers, everywhere.

973
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:19,855
And my new mom,
Lucy, is beyond compare.

974
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,700
To the bride and Gru!

975
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,263
Yeah!

976
01:30:05,237 --> 01:30:07,444
I'm so happy!

977
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,950
Hey, Bob! Stuart!

978
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,943
No?

979
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,158
Bob!

980
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:01,473
Okay.

981
01:32:31,229 --> 01:32:32,146
Okay.

982
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,128
Blah.
