1
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,544
Jackie: Hello,
my reptilian friend.

2
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,684
Aah!

3
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,987
Aah. Unh. Aah, aah.

4
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,891
Bad day.

5
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,660
Waaah!

6
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,797
Jackie: Waaah!

7
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,436
Unh! Unh!

8
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,137
Excuse me.

9
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,572
Pardon me.

10
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,040
So sorry.

11
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,512
Vanessa:
Remember us, chan?

12
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,681
You snatched
the nebilla opal,

13
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,149
the sword of badang,

14
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,985
and now the silver iguana
of yorumba

15
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,955
right out of our
greedy little hands.

16
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:33,492
Jackie: Yes, heh.
Nice to see you
all again, heh heh.

17
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:34,760
How've you been? Heh.

18
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,361
Bye-bye.

19
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,600
Unh, ho!

20
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,969
Aah!

21
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,041
Waah!

22
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,984
Jackie: Heh heh.
Pleasant day for a hike.

23
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,753
Jade: Jackie!

24
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,957
Welcome aboard
Jade airlines.

25
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,095
Jade: And that's how we
returned the silver iguana

26
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,530
to the museum of yorumba.

27
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,665
Comic fans: Cool.

28
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,967
Larry: Wow.

29
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,903
I wish I could
go on an adventure.

30
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,304
Scott: You could start

31
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,540
by movin' out of
your mom's basement.

32
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,142
(Laughs)

33
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,510
Jade: Come on, Larry.

34
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,912
You're going
to the super duper
convention this weekend.

35
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,514
That's exciting, right?

36
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,216
Larry: Duh. Everyone
who's anyone in comics

37
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,751
is gonna be there.

38
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:36,054
But just once,
I wanna go to the con

39
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:39,458
with a story like
the silver iguana of yorumba.

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,762
I wanna be a hero
like super moose or you...

41
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,863
Or Jackie.

42
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,732
Jackie: Oh ho. Hero.

43
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:50,469
You've been listening
to too many of Jade's stories.

44
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,671
Jade: I know
how you feel, dude.
Larry: Ow!

45
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,273
Jade: Jackie tries
- to leave me out of the action

46
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,574
all the time.

47
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,143
Larry: But you don't
take no for an answer.

48
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,145
You go after what you want.

49
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,980
Jade: You could do
the same thing, Larry.

50
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,349
Be like super moose.

51
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,251
Free the hero inside.

52
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:10,756
Larry: Ah. I don't know
if there's a hero in there.

53
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,695
(Rumbling)

54
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,269
Uncle: Earthquake.

55
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,637
(Gasps)

56
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,307
Demon chi is loose!

57
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,609
The demon chi is still near.

58
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,178
Tohru and I will repair
the containment unit

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,015
while you find all 5 missing
demon powers.

60
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,917
Tohru: Remember,
the chi-o-matic holds

61
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,719
only one power at a time.

62
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,788
You must come back
to the containment unit

63
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,489
after capturing each one.

64
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,491
Jackie: Ow!
Jade: Hey!

65
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,094
Uncle: Evil does not sleep!

66
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,798
Captain black:
I'll put on some coffee.

67
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,938
(Jade gasps)
Chi at 12 o'clock high!

68
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,077
Jade: Good aim, Tex!

69
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,890
Jade: Gotcha.

70
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,998
(Captain black snoring)

71
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,638
Uncle: Water, moon,
sky, wind.

72
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,040
(Jade yawns)
- Now back to snoozeville.

73
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:38,477
Uncle: Aiyaah!
- Earth demon chi is not here!

74
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,913
Tohru: Mmm. The chi-o-matic
does not detect the power

75
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,016
within section 13.

76
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,422
(Drago snores, grunts)

77
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,174
(Ice, fist, cobra snoring)

78
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,342
(Clanging)

79
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,576
Strikemaster ice: What? Yaa?

80
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,579
Yo, why you gotta
wake me up, dawg?

81
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,348
My dream was off the hook!

82
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,084
Drago: We have work to do.

83
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:23,722
Kids: Yeah! Watch out, man!
Whoo! Whoo!

84
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:27,025
Larry: How am I ever gonna
free my inner hero?

85
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,994
(Sighs) Maybe I should read

86
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,996
some <i> super moose</i>
àback issues.

87
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,934
Larry: Hey! Watch it! Whoa!

88
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,602
Oof!

89
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,973
(Larry shivers)

90
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,176
Tingly.

91
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,282
(Larry gasps)
Lizard men!

92
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:53,385
Just like in <i> astonishing</i>
à <i> moose tales number 157!</i>

93
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:57,055
Drago: You have
something I want.

94
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:01,026
And what I want, I take!

95
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,935
Strikemaster ice:
What's the dilly, yo?

96
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,337
Drago: He's using
the power of dai gui,

97
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,439
the earth demon!

98
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,145
Larry: Aah!

99
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,047
Mc cobra: Huh? Ooh!

100
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,053
Larry: Bleah! Bleah!
Wh--what's goin' on?

101
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,658
Larry: Please--
please don't hurt me!

102
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,726
(Rumbles)

103
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,465
Strikemaster ice: I'm so
gonna burn your crust!

104
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,267
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Inhales)

105
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,103
Strikemaster ice: Unh! Ooh!

106
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,275
Larry: Unh! Ow.

107
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,944
Drago: Playtime's over.

108
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,086
Drago: Aah!

109
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,054
Jade: Step back,
lizard lips.

110
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,624
Larry, you have
the earth demon chi?

111
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,259
Drago: don't worry,
little missy.

112
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,494
He won't have it for long!

113
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,864
Jade: Leave my friend alone!

114
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,034
(Ice crew grunting)

115
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,773
Drago: Why are these fools
still breathing?!

116
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,616
Tohru: Whooaaahh!

117
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,219
(Crash)

118
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,388
Jade: Larry, listen--

119
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,856
you have
these weirdo powers

120
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,257
because some demon chi
got into your body.

121
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,826
Larry: Demons? Ha!

122
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,394
There's no such thing.

123
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,431
Uh, fire breathing
lizard men, maybe.

124
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,666
But not demons.

125
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,303
Ok, I'm outta here!

126
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,604
Jade: Larry, wait!

127
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,243
Drago: Let's go, boys!

128
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,912
The chi's gone underground.

129
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:04,216
Jade: We gotta
go after Larry!

130
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,452
Jackie: No. The tunnel
could collapse with
you inside.

131
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,856
Tohru: Jade is right.
We must find Larry
before drago does.

132
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:14,793
Uncle: And before evil chi
corrupts Larry's own chi,

133
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,895
turning him into a demon.

134
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,935
Larry: Something's
definitely different.

135
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,271
That stuff I did
with the ground

136
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,341
and these...Muscles.

137
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,744
I--I have super powers!

138
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,946
I've finally unlocked
the hero within!

139
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,281
(Dog pants, barks)

140
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,283
Larry: But
- these new powers mean

141
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,887
I have
great responsibility. Yes.

142
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:47,125
It's time--time to fulfill
my destiny!

143
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,663
Strikemaster ice:
- Yo, we would've had that chi

144
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,432
if you hadn't tried
that inverted 720
off the vert ramp.

145
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,800
Fist: Whoa!

146
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,002
Strikemaster ice:
Whoa, hey, unh!

147
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,403
Drago: Quiet!

148
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,506
That earth demon chi
is still out there.

149
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:05,544
We're going to find it,
take it, and bury chan!

150
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,250
Jade: This is where
the comic shop owner
said Larry lives.

151
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,719
Jackie: Thank you, Jade.
I will take it from...

152
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,491
Larry's mom: Yes?

153
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,460
Jade: Uh, hi. Can Larry
come out and play?

154
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,564
Larry's mom: Lawrence
is trying on his new costume.

155
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,199
He's going to fulfill
his destiny, you know.

156
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,267
Come in.

157
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,942
(Rumbling)

158
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,477
Jackie: We are too late!

159
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,180
Uncle: Very strong reading.

160
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,983
Demon chi
- must be above ground!

161
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,953
Jade: I hope Larry's
not doing anything crazy.

162
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:52,057
Larry: This is my city:
San Francisco--

163
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,060
the city
I've sworn to protect.

164
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:58,330
I am...Uh...

165
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,166
I, uh, ooh.

166
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,869
Spectacu-Larry!

167
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,372
(Mayor speaking)

168
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:11,009
Vandal: The mayor
doesn't deserve a statue!

169
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,680
Vandal: We're here to show
his true colors!

170
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,881
(Rumbling)

171
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,017
Vandals: Aah!

172
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,889
Larry: Spectacu-Larry
at your service, mayor!

173
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,424
No need to thank me.

174
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,494
It's all in a day's work
for the seismic superhero.

175
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,867
Larry: Nothing bad
happens to art

176
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,969
on the amazing
spectacu-Larry's watch.

177
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,278
Larry: It's back
to the big house for you,

178
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,983
compliments of the stupendous
spectacu-Larry!

179
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,052
Can ya dig it?

180
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,121
(Sirens)

181
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,092
Jade: We're getting warmer.

182
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,961
Uncle: Not warm enough!

183
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,929
Jackie: Rather than trying
to catch up to Larry,

184
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,432
perhaps we should attempt
to get ahead of him.

185
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,135
Tohru: Where would
a superhero go?

186
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,202
Jade: I know!

187
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,273
(People chattering)

188
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,474
Jade: Cool!

189
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,542
Uncle: We must hurry.

190
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:21,146
Split up and look
for teenager in a costume!

191
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,788
Jackie:
That is everyone here.

192
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,257
Uncle: Do not argue
with uncle!

193
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,260
Jackie: Ooh!

194
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,329
Krampon warrior Scott:
Nok-cha! Blork gup-ta!

195
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,331
Jackie: Uh, excuse me?

196
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,467
Krampon warrior Scott:
You have offended our honor!

197
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,335
You must apologize!

198
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,538
Jackie: Ooh, I am sorry.

199
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,773
Krampon warrior Scott:
In our language!

200
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,876
Tohru: Oh.

201
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,280
<i>Sumo girl</i> was
- my favorite show growing up.

202
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,749
Sumo girl: Mine, too.

203
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,752
(Giggles) What's your name,
big boy?

204
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:05,457
Tohru: Eh, uh, uh,
I must keep searching.

205
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,892
Sumo girl:
A man on a mission. Ooh.

206
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,527
I like that.

207
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:15,433
Lisa: Ok, I'm attacking
your wizard with my swordsman.

208
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,037
Danny: My wizard casts
a melting spell.

209
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,639
Your sword is slag! Ha!

210
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,708
Uncle: Aiyaa!

211
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,643
Magic must defeat magic!

212
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,245
Up! Up!

213
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,086
You want a piece of uncle?

214
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:43,094
(Jade gasps)
- <i>Super moose number one!</i>

215
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,064
Jade: I'll give you
20 bucks.

216
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,799
Booth owner: Ha!
Are you kiddin', kid?

217
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,768
It's worth
10 times that, easy.

218
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,269
(Rumbling)

219
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,341
Larry: Behold!
Spectacu-Larry!

220
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:03,314
Jackie: Ah, Larry, please,
you are not a superhero!

221
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,216
Jade: Yeah, you have
all these powers

222
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,452
because the demon chi
is taking control of you!

223
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,287
Larry: You're wrong, Jade!

224
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,189
I know what's happening!

225
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,925
I'm, uh, I'm...

226
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,895
I'm turning into
super moose!

227
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,730
Drago:
What you're turning into

228
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:22,200
is a major pain in my tail!

229
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,670
Krampon warrior Scott:
Dude, weak costume.

230
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,072
I could totally
see the latex.

231
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:31,075
Jackie: Tohru, do you have
the chi-o-matic?

232
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,378
Tohru: No, uncle
was carrying it.

233
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,280
Jackie: Find uncle.

234
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,115
We will try to keep drago
from absorbing
the demon chi.

235
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,449
Jade: But, uh--

236
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,517
(drago growling)

237
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,020
Jackie: Waah!

238
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,396
All: Unh!

239
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,097
(All cheer, applaud)

240
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,866
Jackie: Aah! Hot, hot, hot!

241
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,238
Jade: How about
I go find uncle?

242
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,507
Larry: Nice block,
Larry-lad!

243
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,710
Now let a real hero
do his job!

244
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,512
Larry-lad?

245
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,715
(Drago growls)

246
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,619
My hero ain't nothin'
but a sandwich...

247
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,087
Mama's boy.

248
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,090
Larry: ¶ do do do do do ¶

249
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,159
antler action!

250
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,039
Larry: You are more powerful
than I expected, villains.

251
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,543
But spectacu-Larry
has mights to spare!

252
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:42,480
(Drago screams)

253
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,048
Aah!

254
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,387
Jackie: Aah! Please, do not
touch the celebrity guest!

255
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,090
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, we ain't playin'
dress up, mama's boy.

256
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:55,159
Ice crew: Hywaah!

257
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,728
Tohru: Rrrah!

258
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,233
Larry: Who wants
spectacu-Larry's autograph?

259
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,506
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, it's time to make
this big chunkie

260
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,475
into a lot
of little chunkies.

261
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,843
Ice crew: Unh!

262
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,515
Sumo girl: May I join you?

263
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,717
Tohru: Oh, by all means.

264
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:25,690
Danny: My plus-3 elvish sword
paralyzes your cleric ranger!

265
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,593
Uncle: Ah, but
- my cleric ranger has a...

266
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,628
Uncle: Blowfish.

267
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,830
(Danny gasps)
(Crowd laughs)

268
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,735
(Jade panting)
Uncle! Jackie...Larry...

269
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,939
Uncle: In a minute!
Uncle is busy kicking Booty!

270
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,609
Jade: Drago...Demon chi...

271
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:49,714
(Uncle sighs)
- Uncle will be right back.

272
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,784
Do not touch uncle's cards.

273
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,889
(All yelling)

274
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,263
Jackie: Larry! Stop!

275
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,799
Larry, earth demon voice:
Stand aside, Larry-lad,

276
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,802
while I eradicate
these evildoers!

277
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,842
Larry: Huh?

278
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,677
Jackie: Unh!

279
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,384
(Rumbling)

280
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:26,851
(All yelling)

281
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,826
Larry: You raise your hand
against me, Larry-lad?!

282
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,828
I'm the hero!

283
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,364
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-guai-
fie-Dee-tsao...

284
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,632
Larry:
What trickery is this?

285
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,435
Jade: He's taking away
your powers, Larry.
It's for your own good.

286
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,705
Larry: I thought
I could trust you.

287
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,941
But you have betrayed me!

288
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,911
All: Aah!

289
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,848
Larry: Once my friends...

290
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,283
Now my enemies!

291
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,692
Uncle: His transformation
into earth demon dai gui

292
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,594
is nearly complete!

293
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,195
Jade: No!
Larry's still in there!

294
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,864
I know I can reach him!
I know it!

295
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,933
Hey, uh, spectacu-Larry!

296
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,136
This isn't how
a superhero acts.

297
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,039
Larry:
How do <i> you</i> know, Jade?

298
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,274
You're not a superhero!

299
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,476
Jade: No. But I've read
a lot of <i> super moose</i> comics

300
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,211
just like you.

301
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,514
Remember <i> the terrible traps</i>
à <i> of the toilet master?</i>

302
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,883
Larry: <i> Spectacular</i>
à <i> super moose number 39.</i>

303
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,885
Jade: Super moose's mind
was taken over

304
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,854
by the toilet master
who turned him against
the animal avengers.

305
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,289
But when super moose
remembered

306
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,690
to trust the hero inside,

307
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,159
he was able to save the day.

308
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:44,262
Larry: Hero...Inside...

309
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,763
Jade: Look around you,
Larry.

310
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,632
Would super moose
trash this place

311
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:48,866
and scare everyone?

312
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,002
Is this acting like
the hero inside?

313
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,978
Larry: What have I done?

314
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,282
Jade: It's not you.
It's the demon chi.
We can help you.

315
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:08,753
Larry: Mustn't give in...
To demon.

316
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,857
Still a hero...Inside,

317
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:17,428
and his name...Is...
Larry.

318
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,134
Uncle: Yu-mo-gue-guai-
fie-Dee-tsao,

319
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,902
yu-mo-gue-guai-
fie-Dee-tsao,

320
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,871
yu-mo-gue-guai-
fie-Dee-tsao.

321
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,841
Larry: Aaahhh!

322
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,814
Jade: Larry! You ok?

323
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,683
Larry, normal voice:
I--I think so.

324
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,352
I feel all tingly.

325
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,823
(Booth owners grumbling)

326
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:46,958
Booth owner: Hey, who's gonna
pay for this damage?

327
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,494
Jackie: Wait! No.
I didn't...

328
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,862
It wasn't...

329
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:04,008
Uncle: Uncle is
new grand master wizard!

330
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,044
Sumo girl: Call me.

331
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:15,353
Sumo girl: Mmmph!
- We'll go out for a big lunch.

332
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,588
(Tohru laughs)

333
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,224
Jade: Come on, Larry.
Let's...

334
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,626
Hey! How much?

335
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,194
Booth owner: Go ahead,
take it, kid.

336
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,595
It's worthless now.

337
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:25,930
Jade: Not to me.

338
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,468
Jackie: After
all we went through,

339
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,303
you want more comics?

340
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,906
Jade: Tch.
Not just any comic.

341
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,843
Scott: Could you sign it,
"to my best pal?"

342
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,412
Jade: Hey, Larry.

343
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,181
Larry: Jade,
ya made it!

344
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,649
Check it out.

345
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,284
Jade: <i> The adventures</i>
à <i> of spectacu-Larry</i>

346
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,085
<i>with his sidekick larr-ina.</i>

347
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,620
Jackie: What about
Larry-lad?

348
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,490
Jade: Awesome! Hey, I have
a million story ideas.

349
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,625
How about
larr-ina saves the city?

350
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,827
No, wait, the world!
Stay with me here.

351
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,197
Dragon-boy
and the lizard men
- shoot a missile into the sun

352
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,499
to turn the earth
into a reptile's
only desert planet!

353
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,100
Spectacu-Larry
tries to stop 'em.

354
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,002
But he gets captured,
so it's up to larr-ina

355
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:07,038
to get the self-destruct code
before it's too late.

356
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,006
Oh, and larr-ina
should be able to fly,

357
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,708
and how about X-ray vision?

358
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,449
Jade: Hey, Jackie, what do
you do to relax?

359
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,750
Jackie: When I relax,

360
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,885
I have, like, a loft,

361
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,287
and I call up some friends.

362
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,856
We sit down,
listen to music,

363
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,925
watch TV, yeah.

364
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,128
Because from TV,
I can learn so many things.
