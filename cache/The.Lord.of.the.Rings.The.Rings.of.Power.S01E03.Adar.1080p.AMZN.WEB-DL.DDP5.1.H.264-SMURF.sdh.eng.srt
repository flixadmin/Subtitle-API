What...

5
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,041
Up she goes...

6
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,875
NORI: Where is it you're from, anyway?

[Largo groans]

10
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,916
He wants us to help him find 
those stars.

11
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,458
Nori?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
GALADRIEL: Duty demanded 
I return to Middle-earth.

13
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,625
It wasn't Elves that chased me
from my homeland. It was Orcs.

14
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,833
Was that the mark of your people's king?

15
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:41,958
My people have no king.

16

[thunder breaking]

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,458
All the far outposts are being disbanded.

18
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,000
Taking a last look?

19
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,791
It has changed much, Watchwarden.

20
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,625
But the Men who live here have not.

21
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:03,833
The blood of those who stood with 
Morgoth still darkens their veins.

22
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,500
Someone dug this passage.
Something. Men did not do this.

Toss him out with the rest.

40
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,958
VRATH: You toss him out with the rest.
I had sun duty yesterday.

41
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,666
LURKA: You'll stay in the sun till 
you're black as coal

42
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,916
if Adar wills it.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,041

HALBRAND: She lives.

65
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,541
Our hosts. Saviors or captors?

66
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,666
It's not poisoned. If that's your concern.

67
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,166
Not for humans, anyway.

One of the Eldar. Onboard my ship?

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,541
Strange tides indeed.

73
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,958
What vessel is this?

74
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,541
Be at ease. I'm obliged to deliver you
safely to my betters.

75
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,958
They will answer your questions, not I.

76
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,666
To what port do we sail?

77
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,375
See for yourself. We're nearly there.

78
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,291
Nearly where?

79
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,208
Home.

HALBRAND: What is this place?

84
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,166
GALADRIEL: There is only one place 
it can be.

85
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,916
The Land of the Star.

86
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,458
The westernmost of all mortal realms.

87
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,291
The Island Kingdom of Númenor.

88
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,000
ELENDIL: Harbor speed!

MAN #1: Is that an Elf?
MAN #2: See nothing...

91
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,041
GALADRIEL: Since when did Men like me
build kingdoms such as this?

92
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,041
[children laughing]

93
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,958
These Men are not like you.

94
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,791
In the Great War,
your ancestors stood with Morgoth.

95
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,625
These Men stood with the Elves.

96
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,041
As a reward,
the Valar granted them this island,

97
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,125
which has changed much since then.

98
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,500
Do I detect a note of envy?

99
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,833
Not envy.

100
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,541
Sorrow.

101
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,458
Once, Elves came and went
freely from these shores.

102
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,291
Our people were as kin.

103
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,000
Sharing gifts, knowledge.

104
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,708
What happened?

105
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,750
Númenor began to turn away our ships.

106
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,875
In time, they broke off all contact.

107
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,041
Why?

108
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,375
We may be about to find out.

109
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,625
ELENDIL: Keep moving.

110
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,333
You would not want to be lost here
without an escort.

111
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,041
MAN: Put it with the others.

112
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,500
Too hot.

115
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,375
PHARAZÔN: Patience. Patience.

116
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,916
We are men and women of Númenor.

117
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,500
I suggest we set history aside
for the moment and show some restraint.

118
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's try not to antagonize these people.

119
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,416
Captain. The Queen Regent is occupied.

120
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,041
As is Chancellor Pharazôn.
I suggest that you...

121
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,666

[crowd silences]

125
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,416
[whispers] Kneel.

126
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,291
No one kneels in Númenor.

127
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,166
[whispers] Sorry.

128
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,541
[sighs]

129
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,083
Speak, Elf.

130
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,000
Name thyself.

131
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,833
Galadriel of the Noldor.

132
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,375
Daughter of the Golden House of Finarfin.

133
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,500
Commander of the Northern Armies
of High King Gil-galad.

134
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,833
Halbrand.

135
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,541
Of the Southlands.

136
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,416
A Man and an Elf, together?

137
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,208
Circumstances arose that...

138
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,416
We are companions by chance.
Met on the open sea.

139
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,250
Your captain, here, delivered us 
from certain death.

140
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,166
All we ask is that Númenor
continue his mercy

141
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,791
and grant us ship's passage
to Middle-earth.

142
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,125
[crowd chattering]

143
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,416
It's been generations since a ship 
of Númenor

144
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,375
was permitted to make such a journey
on an Elf's behalf.

145
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,875
It is because of the Elves that 
you were given this island.

146
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:28,958
[confused chatter]
What?

147
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,708
Surely you can spare a few planks 
and a rudder.

148
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,458
[crowd chattering]

149
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,958
Our ancestors were not given anything.

150
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,125
They paid for this isle with the 
blood of their kin.

151
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,458
What the Elf means...

152
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,000
Then if blood be the price of passage,
I will pay it.

153
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,458
[crowd exclaiming]

154
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,500
But one way or another, 
I will depart.

155
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,916
I welcome you to try.

156
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,291
GALADRIEL: I have no need of 
your welcome.

157
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,791
QUEEN MÍRIEL: And you are quickly
wearing out yours.

158
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,541
Guards!
My friends.

159
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,000
[crowd silences]

160
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:06,208
It seems to me that our leaving
presents some complications.

161
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,333
Perhaps it'd be better if we stayed...

162
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:13,125
Stayed?
Long enough, good Queen,

163
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,500
to give you and your advisors adequate 
time to weigh our request.

164
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,125
A few days, perhaps?

165
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,083
[crowd murmuring]

166
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Three days. And the Elf is to be 
restricted to palace ground.

167
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,625
I will not be made a prisoner.

168
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,416
I would sooner knee-cap a stallion

169
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,666
than seek to imprison the mighty 
commander of the Northern Armies.

170
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,250
[crowd laughing]

171
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,375
So, you shall be Númenor's guest.

172
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,916
HALBRAND: Captain...

173
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,375
My gratitude.

174
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,791
[grunts]

175
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,375
[chattering]

176
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,791
[whispering] "Good Queen?"

177
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,333
[sighs] The Southlands will still be 
there in three days.

178
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,583
GALADRIEL: But will its people?

179
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,708
Look around you. This is a paradise.

180
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,208
Ripe with opportunity.

181
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,500
You really expect me to leap with you
back into the furnace?

182
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,833
You leapt into the sea to save one life.

183
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,208
I seek to save many.

184
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,250
I have been searching for my peace
for longer than you know.

185
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,583
Please, for both our sakes,
let me keep it.

186
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,083
[sighs]

187
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,833
Perhaps some peace would do you 
good as well.

188
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,833
But at the very least...

189
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,666
do try not to make any new enemies.

190
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:57,833
[heavy breathing]

191
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,416
It would be wise to resolve this 
matter swiftly.

192
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,666
She is but one Elf.

193
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,000
PHARAZÔN: An avalanche can 
start with one stone.

194
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,833
We dare not invite your father's cloud
back overhead.

195
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,541
Tell me about this captain.

196
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,583
His name is Elendil.

197
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,166
Originally of a noble line,
now a Sea Guardsman with a son,

198
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,625
if memory serves, set to follow him 
into the service.

199
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,208
SAIL-MASTER: Heave!

200
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,625
Together now!

201
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,291
[waves crashing]

202
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,875
Heave!

203
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,416
You'll have to haul a sheet faster than that 
if you want a spot in my guard!

204
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,458
Come on, cadets!
[cadets grunting]

205
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,166
Together now!

206
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,000
WOMAN ( whispering]: Isildur...

207
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,250
VALANDIL: Isildur!

208
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,083
Isildur!

209
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,416
SAIL-MASTER: Any cadet who earns
their place in the Sea Guard

210
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,000
becomes more than just
Númenor's protector.

211
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,166
Not that one!

212
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,250
[cadets exclaiming]

213
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,750
SAIL-MASTER: Imrahil!

214
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,208
Portside! Haul it into portside!

215
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,208
Valandil! Ontamo!

216
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:32,958
Help! Pull!

217
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,958
[grunting]

218
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,875
SAIL-MASTER: Co-ordination, cadets!
Back to it!

219
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,416
[panting]

220
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,708
There is no harsher master than 
the sea.

221
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,458
[panting]

222
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,750
[waves splashing]
[birds chirping]

223
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,750

224
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,833
[panting]

225
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,500
The sea is always right!

226
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,125
ALL: The sea is always right!

227
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,666
ONTAMO: Poor Imrahil.

228
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,416
His father is like to toss him out
on the stones.

229
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,958
VALANDIL: Blind luck Isil's not 
joining him.

230
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,833
Me?

231
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,166
Your mind was in the bleeding 
clouds again all day. What is it?

232
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,458
Just eager to get out there. 
That's all.

233
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,833
Nine more days. Nine more days!

234
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,916
We pass the Sea Trial, in four years,
we'll make officers.

235
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,833
Ten more, we'll have our own command.

236
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,958
Mmm. Eight more for me.
Eighteen maybe.

237
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,166
[laughter]
CADET: Isildur! Your sister's here.

238
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,875
There you are.

239
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,500
[laughs] Berek, my boy.

240
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,750
VALANDIL: Look who put down the 
sketchbook for once.

241
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,500
Aw, you didn't have to come all 
this way just to see me. [groans]

242
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,958
Isil, cantina?
Nah, you go.

243
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,541
Come find us later. Don't be like 
your brother.

244
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,583
Got your whole life to be an old maid.

245
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,666
Or to be young.

246
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,750
[laughter]

247
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,916
What are you doing here? 
Where's Father?

248
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,625
QUEEN MÍRIEL: The Faithful believe that
when the petals of the White Tree fall,

249
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,375
it is no idle thing,

250
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,000
but the very tears of the Valar 
themselves.

251
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,333
A living reminder that their eyes

252
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:04,708
and their judgment are ever upon us.

253
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,416
Do you believe that?

254
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,041
In my experience, it is unwise to 
live one's life

255
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,916
guessing after signs and portents.

256
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,500
[chuckles]

257
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,166
"Elendil." An uncommon name.

258
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,916
From our western shores, is it not?

259
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,416
Mmm. It originates there.

260
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,208
Pray tell, what does it mean?

261
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,125
One who loves the stars.

262
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,625
That is not its only translation, is it?

263
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,250
In the ancient tongue of the Eldar,

264
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,791
it can also mean "Elf-friend."

265
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,125
And are you? An Elf-friend?

266
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,083
I'm a loyal servant of Númenor.

267
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,875
And yet, though Elves have been 
unwelcome on our shore

268
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,916
since the reign of my grandfather's
great grandfather,

269
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,333
you chose to break with that 
precedent. Why?

270
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,500
It was the sea that put her in my path.

271
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,000
And the sea is always right.

272
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,916
The sea cannot commit treason.

273
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,208
With respect, Queen Regent,

274
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,541
given the circumstances, I did only
what I believed to be most prudent.

275
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,291
If, Elendil, that is truly your wish,

276
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:39,250
then I shall have to ask you to 
perform a service.

277
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,708
[scabbard clinks]

278
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,166
[Orcs grunting]

00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,666

[woman screaming in distance]

284
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,750
[whispering] These passages reach 
all the way to Hordern.

285
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,500
Possibly beyond.

286
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,083
This must be how they escaped
our detection.

287
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,583
And how they shield themselves
from sunlight.

288
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,875
[chains clinking]

289
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:56,958
[flies buzzing]

290
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,416
They're searching for something.

291
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,625
Some sort of weapon, perhaps?

292
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,000
I do not know.

293
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,041
But they ransack village after village,

294
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,375
toiling nightly to find it for their leader.

295
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,500
One the Orcs speak of with near-worship,

296
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,041
even reverence, if Orcs were capable 
of such a thing.

297
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,041
It seems Morgoth has a successor.

298
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:21,875
"Adar."

299
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,541
Why would Orcs refer to their leader
by an Elvish word?

300
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,583
REVION: Sauron was said to have
many names in days of old.

301
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,333
Perhaps this is one of them.

302
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,041
There is more at work here
than we can yet see.

303
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,166
First opportunity either of you has

304
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,500
to get a glimpse above this trench,
you'll take it.

305
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,458
Locate the closest tree line,

306
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,458
and when the sun is at its strongest,
we will make our escape.

307
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,625
If even one of us makes it home,

308
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,458
we can return in force

309
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,375
and sweep the enemy from these lands

310
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,041
like salt from a table.
[woman screams]

311
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:57,791
[prisoners gasping]
Sew those lips and dig, Elf!

312
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,000
These roots block our path.
LURKA: Then rip them out.

313
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,833
Rip the whole stinking tree down!

314
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:09,666
Felling a tree will slow our progress.
We shall go around.

315
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,333
Try it, Elf.
And I'll make a map of your back.

316
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,916
[growls]

317
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:20,833
This tree sprang from the earth
long before you crawled

318
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,916
from whatever wretched place you grew.

319
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,291
It has earned its place in these lands.

320
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:30,208
[Magrot laughing maniacally]

321
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,666
[Orcs laughing]

322
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,916
MAGROT: Good, Elf.

323
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,958
Very good.

324
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,500
[breathing heavily]

325
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,458
You showed strength.

326
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:46,750
You just earned your company
a water ration.

327
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,083
Don't be afraid.

328
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,666
Surely you thirst.

329
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,500
[sighs]

330
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,458
[chuckles] There...

331
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,083
[chuckles softly]

332
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,666
[gulps, sighs]

333
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:56,458
[growls]

334
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,125
[Orcs laughing]

335
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
[coughs]

336
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,250
[laughing maniacally]

337
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,791
[sighs]

338
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,416
[chuckles]

339
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,916
Tree.

340
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,875
[in Quenya] Húna hravan! Húna hravan!

341
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,166
[Orcs laughing]

342
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,541
[softly in English] I will cut it.

343
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,375
I will cut it down!

344
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,291
[laughter stops]

345
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,750
[in Quenya] Ánin apsene...

346
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:24,500
[Orcs cheering]

347
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,625
GUARD: You will inform Pharazôn
that she's escaped.

348
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:36,958
I informed him last time.

349
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,291
GUARD: That was a dog.

350
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,291
[idle chatter]

351
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,750
[lively chatter]

352
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:02,791
ELENDIL: Be wiser to steal the half-sail.

353
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,875
That skiff will hardly get you out 
of the harbor.

354
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,958
I assure you it's an improvement on my 
prior mode of passage.

355
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,500
[laughs] Still. Can't let you take it.

356
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,625
I'm afraid the Queen has charged me

357
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:18,208
with seeing to it that you cause no 
further disturbance.

358
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,166
I believe she saw it as a punishment.

359
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,083
Then she and I have something in 
common after all.

360
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,333
We both wish you'd never brought me here.

361
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,000
I will take my chances on the skiff.

362
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:33,333
That would leave me little choice, but 
to shout for your minders.

363
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:37,083
Suppose the words never manage
to escape your throat?

364
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,875
Supposing they did,

365
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:44,916
you'd be back at the palace in chains,
even further from your destination.

366
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,666
Who is this mortal who speaks to me as if 
he has the slightest idea who I am?

367
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:57,125
I have a daughter who runs fast,
and a son who runs blind.

368
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,625
Your eyes bear a striking resemblance 
to both.

369
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:05,083
Where I run and how I run there
are none of your concern.

370
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,916
Anywhere is better than here, where 
I'm hated by all who see me.

371
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:13,375
So call to your guards, or get out 
of my way.

372
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:18,541
[in Quenya] You're not hated by 
all, m'lady.

373
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,875
[in Quenya] You speak Elvish?

374
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:25,041
[in English] Where I was raised,
many speak it.

375
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,375
It is still taught in our Hall of Lore.

376
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,958
Still carved on statues throughout
the city, if you look closely.

377
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,333
Your Hall of Lore, how far is that?

378
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,958
A quarter day's ride.

379
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,333
What is it you seek?

380
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,291
Did you say "ride"?

381
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,708
[hammering]

382
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:54,875
There is not another man on this isle
that knows this craft better than I.

383
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:58,666
I will shovel coal if need be,
I'll splinter wood,

384
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,250
I'll shape a sea anchor for you, free of charge,

385
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,083
sturdier than anything you have ever seen.
How's that?

386
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,500
I'm here to start anew.

387
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,458
Lend me that chance. Please.

388
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,458
And I won't forget it.

389
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,833
You've a stout heart, lad.

390
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:23,541
But until you've earned your guild crest,
you can't forge steel in Númenor.

391
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,750
[hammering]

392
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:29,791
[lively chatter]

393
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,125
TAMAR: That's him, isn't it?

394
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,416
The fellow who sailed in with the Elf?

395
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,041
It's you, isn't it?

396
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,625
Certainly appears that way.

397
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,375
What are you called, again?
Depends.

398
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,166
Depends on what?

399
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:47,958
[mouthful] How close we are.

400
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,666
And how close are you and the She-elf?

401
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,291
You're on a lucky streak, low man.

402
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:07,750
Free sail to our island, eating our food,

403
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,375
drinking our ale...

404
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,958
What will you take next?

405
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,958
Our lands? Our trades?

406
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,666
Don't forget your women.

407
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,375
Look at the mouth on him.

408
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,833
TAMAR: Maybe he and the She-elf
aren't so close after all.

409
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,666
Wager she'd prefer someone
of better breeding.

410
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,375
[mocking laughter]

411
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,958
You're right. You're right.

412
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,791
Here I am.

413
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,541
I'm a guest on your island,

414
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,750
and I haven't shown you
the faintest bit of gratitude.

415
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,250
How 'bout this?

416
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,291
Next few rounds on me!

417
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,750
[all cheering]

418
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:59,500
[lively chatter, laughter]

419
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,041
You're not so bad, low man.

420
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,625
Well, then, I best make my retreat,

421
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,541
while you've still got a warm 
opinion of me.

422
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:13,208
Men, ladies, anon!

423
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:17,375
[all cheering]

424
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,416

[chuckles]

426
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,291
TAMAR: Hey, low man.

427
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,666
Really thought I wouldn't notice?

428
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,958
Well, I thought it was worth a try.

429
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,791
[men chuckle]
Take it.

430
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,208
I don't want any trouble.

431
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,333
[men laughing]

432
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,166
Bit late for that, isn't it?

433
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:59,208
I believe it is.

434
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,125
[grunts]

435
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,875

[men laughing]

437
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,625
Hmm.

438
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:16,666
[sighs]

439
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Please. Don't do this.
[grunts]

440
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,041
[grunts]

441
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,583
Why not? Low man!
[groans]

442
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:30,541

00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,375
TAMAR: Go.

00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:57,625
[Tamar coughs]

452
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:58,916
MAN (nervously]: Over here.

453
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,416
[guards panting]

454
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,583
ELENDIL: We're looking for any 
information you may have on this.

455
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,333
LOREMASTER: I will take a look.

456
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:45,458
You didn't say the Hall of Lore was 
assembled by Elros himself.

457
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:48,875
It is rather remarkable.

458
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,916
ELENDIL: Of course...

459
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,625
You knew Elros.

460
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,250
GALADRIEL: An uncommon spirit.

461
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:59,208
But I was always closer with his brother.

462
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,250
ELENDIL: Remarkable.

463
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,833
Thank you for bringing me here.

464
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,083
Thank our last king.

465
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,916
It was because of him
this place wasn't torn down.

466
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,541
He was loyal to the Elves?

467
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,250
Is loyal.

468
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,583
We forced him from the throne for it.

469
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:26,041
They say he spends his days
in the tower now.

470
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,833
An exile in his own kingdom.

471
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,833
There.

472
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,541
What is this?

473
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:48,750
The account of a human spy retrieved 
from an enemy dungeon.

474
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,375
He drew this.
To record the tower's location.

475
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,875
GALADRIEL: Wait a moment.
I must be blind.

476
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,833
This is no sigil.

477
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,583
[blazing]

478
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,958
It is a map of the Southlands.

479
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,916
It is as Halbrand said.

480
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,291
And the inscription?

481
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,541
It is the Black Speech.

482
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:27,125
It speaks not only of a place, but a plan.

483
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,416
A plan by which to create a realm 
of their own,

484
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,333
where evil would not only endure, 
but thrive.

485
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,500
A plan to be enacted in the event 
of Morgoth's defeat...

486
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,166
By his successor.

487
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,791
Galadriel.

488
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,875
GALADRIEL: Matters are worse
than I imagined.

489
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,375
Then the Southlands are in grave danger.

490
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,250
If Sauron has indeed returned,

491
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:08,583
the Southlands are but the beginning.

492
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,333
[muffled laughter echoing]

493
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:38,500

00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,958
[muffled laughter echoing]

495
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,666
[muffled laughter, exclaiming]

496
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,333
[all chanting]
Nobody goes off-trail.

497
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,958
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

498
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,041
SADOC: That's right.

499
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,625
Nobody goes off-trail.

500
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,958
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

501
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,958
Nobody goes off-trail.

502
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:19,833
Come on. [laughs]
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

503
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,833
Nobody goes off-trail.

504
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,791
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

505
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,958
Nobody goes off-trail.

506
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,083
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

507
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,708
SADOC: Nobody goes off-trail.

508
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,250
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

509
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,625
SADOC: Nobody goes off-trail.

510
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:37,458
MARIGOLD: So it's not better.
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

511
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,625
SADOC: Nobody goes off-trail.

512
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,375
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

513
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,708
SADOC: Nobody goes off-trail.

514
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,750
We can't carry the cart without you.

515
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:50,000
We're going to be left behind.

516
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,833
No Brandyfoot has ever been left behind.

517
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,458
[Marigold sniffles]

518
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,875
You know, after I lost Rose,

519
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:11,000
felt like the wheels broke out
from under me.

520
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:17,625
And then I saw you in the grass.

521
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,875
Right in this clearing.

522
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,666
You were so beautiful that day.
[chuckles]

523
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,833
And in an instant,

524
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:32,875
I knew I'd grow old with you, Marigold.
[laughs]

525
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,791
We'll make it to the Grove.

526
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:44,708
All of us?

527
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,416
All of us.

528
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,791
How?

529
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,666
I'll stay at the front of the caravan.

530
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,666
And we've got Nori.

531
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,958
No! Look, once that girl puts her 
head to something,

532
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,208
[sighs]

533
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,375
nothing can stop her.

534
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,666
[gasps]

535
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,375
[panting]

536
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,958
[exclaims] You lay one paw 
on that book,

537
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,708
and old Sadoc will use your hide
to make his next batch of pages!

538
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,375
You got a better idea?
The migration's tomorrow.

539
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,166
If you want to help him find 
those stars,

540
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,166
our best hope is in that book.

541
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,875
I don't want to help him.

542
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,750
He's a giant with a brackish temper,
who sometimes murders fireflies.

543
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,250
That was an accident.

544
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:41,000
Now, I say the sensible thing to do
is top off his food,

545
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:44,250
point him to the nearest human village,
and "Fare thee well, stranger."

546
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,625
That's not where he belongs.
And where does he belong?

547
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:50,333
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Why's it your problem?

548
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:54,916
What sense is it sticking your neck out
for him any more than you already have?

549
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,875
There's head-sense, Poppy,
and there's heart-sense.

550
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,791
There's common sense and nonsense.

551
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,750
And if you're all out of the first,
then you can borrow some of mine.

552
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:04,333
Rather borrow some star charts
out of that book instead.

553
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:07,625
And you're gonna help me.
Or would you rather I let slip to Malva

554
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,958
it was you who put fireweed
in her toe cream?

555
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,291
Hmm?
I'll keep watch.

556
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,333
Go.

557
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,083
POPPY: Aren't you supposed to do 
your speech now, Mr. Burrows?

558
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,166
SADOC: Certainly. I just have to 
fetch it from my cart.

559
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,916
Oh, good idea. You do that.
Fetch it from your cart!

560
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,750
[grunts]

561
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,750
"Rested legs and full carts"?

562
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,916
[grumbles] No...

563
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,750
Mmm. No, no, no. [sighs]

564
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,666
Ah-ha!

565
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,083
[gasps]

566
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:18,500
"Full carts and fuller bellies."

567
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:20,125
[laughs]

568
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,333
Mr. Burrows!

569
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:31,583
SADOC: What is it now?

570
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,666
Oh, no, it's just, um, everyone's waiting.

571
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:37,500
Are you all right?

572
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,291
SADOC: Yes, yes. Almost done.

573
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,333
How much have you got left?

574
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:45,666
Just a little left?

575
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,333
Just tell them I'm almost ready.

576
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:51,458
Right. No! I mean left. Yes. No, I...

577
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,791
I'll tell 'em right now, go straight now.

578
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:58,958
SADOC: Calm yourself,
and get yourself some chestnut pie.

579
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,041
[grunts]

580
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,000
Strange girl, that one. [clears throat]

581
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,958
[panting]

582
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:13,416
[lively chatter]

583
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,625
[Sadoc clears throat]

584
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:25,750
Most agreeable, honorable Harfoots.

585
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:29,541
[Harfoots cheering, laughing]

586
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,291
[chuckles]

587
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:34,000
Another season has passed in this glade,

588
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:38,000
leaving us with full carts
and fuller bellies.

589
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,708
Some fuller than most,
if we're being honest about it.

590
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:42,958
[exclaims]
[all laughing]

591
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,666
SADOC: Uh, what else...

592
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,250
The Moon is very full,

593
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,291
so be careful where you're having
your shenanigans later on.

594
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,791
It'll be in full view of the entire camp.

595
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,333
And nobody wants that.

596
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:54,708
[Sadoc laughs]

597
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,666
I'm only joking ya.

598
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,333
And now, before we begin our next journey,

599
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:04,833
we remember those from prior migrations,

600
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:08,750
who fell behind.
[Harfoots] Hear, hear.

601
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:12,583
And should any Harfoot
fall behind this migration,

602
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:16,083
they likewise will be carried with us

603
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:19,000
in our hearts and in our memories.

604
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,666
In life, we could not wait for them.

605
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:34,625
But here, now, we welcome to our circle...

606
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:45,000
Miles Brightapple.

607
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:50,583
Stuck in the snows of the mountain pass.

608
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,166
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

609
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,166
Chance Proudfellow.

610
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,291
Yarrow Proudfellow.

Strap, Dewis,

612
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,041
Linseed Proudfellow.
[sniffling]

613
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,541
Taken by landslide one rainy winter day.

614

[Harfoots] We wait for you.

615

Daffodil Burrows.

Wolves.

619
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:35,333
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

620
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:41,708
SADOC: Druda Bumbelly.
She ate the sunshine yellow berries.

621
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:42,875
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

622
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,291
Blovo Bolgerbuck.

623
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,083
Bees.

624
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:17,166
[all chuckling]

625
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,583
We all loved him, but he was an ijit.

626
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:21,958
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

627
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:28,500
SADOC: Ma Hambley.
Was making a sculpture...

628
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:34,708
[gasps]

629
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,291
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

630
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:45,666
[grunts]

631
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,625
[grunting]

632
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:50,916
[clattering]

633
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,125
[Harfoots exclaiming]
[gasps]

634
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,875
[Harfoots exclaiming]

635
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,625
[shouting]

636
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:15,041
[Harfoots screaming]

637
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:21,916
[shouting]

638
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,500
[panting]

639
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,166
Nori?

640
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:54,541
[Harfoots murmuring]

641
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:57,208
SADOC: You have lied, stolen,

642
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,916
brought a dangerous outsider
into our midst.

643
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,125
And she lied.

644
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:03,375
He already said that.
Well, she did.

645
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:06,083
But, no, he was lost. Hurt.

646
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,750
What was I supposed to do?
Leave him there?

647
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:12,166
You must admit, Sadoc, it's 
quite extraordinary.

648
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,125
[stammers] Have you ever heard tell
of beings falling from the stars?

649
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:19,791
I've heard of beings who were 
turned into stars.

650
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,458
Never the other way around.

651
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,708
It's very troubling.

652
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,666
But what about the stars on that page?

653
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,125
What's it say they mean?

654
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,333
Nothing. The pages are all burnt up.
Why didn't you bother to read them?

655
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:33,125
I thought we'd have time later.

656
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,541
Who's "we"?

657
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:40,083
No one. Just me. He's my friend.

658
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,041
VILMA: We don't need friends, girl.

659
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,166
We need to survive.

660
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,041
Without friends, what are we 
surviving for?

661
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:50,416
"Good little Harfoots, stick to the path, 
flee every danger,"

662
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,000
heaven forbid we explore something 
new for once!

663
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:54,791
Elanor Kellamark Brandyfoot!

664
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,333
Our way has kept us alive 
a thousand years.

665
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,708
MALVA: Our laws are clear.

666
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:07,541
Any Harfoot that breaks them
is to be decaravaned.

667
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:10,875
[Harfoots exclaiming]

668
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:16,750
Our laws are clear, indeed. But...

669
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,083
Miss Brandyfoot is young.

670
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:28,416
With as much hair still to grow on 
her toes as sense between her ears.

671
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,583
Tomorrow we depart as planned.

672
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,708
And the Brandyfoot cart will be with us.

673
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,083
[Harfoots murmuring]

674
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:40,833
At the back of the caravan.
[Harfoots gasping]

675
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:42,708
At the back?
At the back.

676
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:45,291
LARGO: Wait, wait, wait a sun-sliver,
now, Sadoc.

677
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,291
We have to talk about this.

678
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:51,583
Now, you mean the back of the back,
or do you mean the middle of the back?

679
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,416
SADOC: I mean the back.
[sighs]

680
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:58,208
You may as well have stamped our name
in the book of the left-behinds.

681
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,083
[gasping]

682
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,333
There's a reason he came to us.

683
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:06,541
Honestly, Nori.

684
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:09,875
Do you see a destiny in this?

685
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,625
Do you think the stars reached down
and touched ya, is that it?

686
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:18,625
Do you think you're special?
You're just a child.

687
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:22,791
I know I'm not special.

688
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,625
I know I'm just one little Harfoot
in a grand wide world.

689
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:29,875
But he is special.

690
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:33,125
I can feel it.

691
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:37,625
My darling girl.

692
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,875
Ever has your heart been 
like your father's.

693
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,250
But the tallest milkweed gets snipped.

694
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,541
It's time to pack.

695
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:06,791
WOMAN: Oh, no!

696
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,291
[man laughs]
WOMAN: Oh!

697
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,166
MAN: You will die, Queen!
WOMAN: Oh, no!

698
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,000
MAN: Oh, no! Galadriel!
WOMAN #2: I smite you!

699
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:15,041
MAN: Oh, no! [groaning]
[Woman #2 laughs]

700
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,333
WOMAN: Take that!

701
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,625
ISILDUR: Galadriel?

702
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,333
The Galadriel? Scourge of the Orcs?

703
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:23,625
Never mind what she's the scourge of.
Why is she in Númenor?

704
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,583
Waiting for a ship to Middle-earth.

705
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:33,125
Queen Regent's raised me to Post Captain,
to keep account of her in the meantime.

706
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,500
You brought in an Elf, so Míriel 
promoted you?

707
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:37,458
Who gets to escort her back?

708
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:39,541
Looking for a promotion, cadet?

709
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,041
Nine days until the Sea Trial.

710
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,291
[whispers] Tell him.
You ready?

711
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:46,833
I'm afraid our northside relations
have taken the liberty

712
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:49,833
of inviting themselves over
for a feast to see you off.

713
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:53,125
Trust that's all right?
I was thinking I might defer.

714
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:57,916
Defer?
Just for a season, perhaps.

715
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:01,958
ELENDIL: Did you know about this?

716
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:06,083
Well, I listen to him on occasion,
so, yes, I had my suspicions.

717
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,791
And you didn't bother
telling me about them?

718
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,375
I'm only thinking about it.
I was talking to Eärien.

719
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,958
I've been carrying a bit on my 
shoulders lately, Father.

720
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,916
Is this really so tragic?
Anárion told me you deferred twice...

721
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,250
Anárion? What's your brother
have to do with this?

722
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,750
Nothing.
Well, slightly more than nothing.

723
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:23,166
Thanks.

724
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:27,708
Oh, good gods.

725
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,166
I'll tell you what I told him.

726
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,625
There is nothing for us on our 
western shores.

727
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,666
The past is dead.

728
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,083
We either move forward or 
we die with it.

729
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:47,625
[scoffing]

730
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:50,916
And do you think it was easy convincing
the sail-master you were up to the task?

731
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,166
I never asked you to do that.

732
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,750
Yes, you did when you got into a scrap
with the Queen's guards.

733
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:57,166
They started that!
Or got thrown out of your horse training.

734
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,458
That wasn't my fault!

735
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,000
Actually, Isil's right, that one wasn't...

736
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:02,083
I wasn't talking to you!
[chattering stops]

737
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:06,583
MESSENGER: Pardon me, Captain.
What?

738
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,166
Message for your daughter, Eärien.

739
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:23,541
I know you've doubts, son.

740
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:30,541
But... But can you not trust that I have
ever your best interest at heart?

741
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:37,333
The watery part of this world has a way
of healing even the deepest of wounds.

742
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:40,041
The way it's healed yours?

743
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:50,250
In nine days' time, when the Sea Trial
begins and that ship launches,

744
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:51,833
you will be on it.

745
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:52,750
[sighs]

746
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,875
EÄRIEN: Father.
What is it?

747
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,375
I made apprentice.

748
00:53:57,958 --> 00:54:00,458
I've been accepted to the Builder's Guild.

749
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:03,666
How? I thought the guild never 
reconsidered.

750
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,916
Isildur convinced me to reapply.

751
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,416
Isildur convinced you?

752
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:15,500
[crowd applauding]

753
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:18,666
[crowd cheering]

754
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,875
GALADRIEL: How fares the quest 
for peace?

755
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,916
Better than expected.

756
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,291
What happened?

757
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,833
Dispute about a woman.

758
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:36,750
Halbrand.

759
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,041
Don't start.

760
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:40,166
You do not belong on this island.

761
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,083
If there's one of us that doesn't 
belong here, Elf, it's you.

762
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:46,166
I'm not so sure of that anymore.

763
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,833
But of one thing I am now certain.

764
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,666
You are more than you claim.

765
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,833
I found this in the Hall of Lore.

766
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:12,958
That's funny. I found this on a 
dead man.

767
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,500
Thought the pattern suited me.

768
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,875
Many ages ago,

769
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:22,958
a man bearing that mark

770
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:26,750
united the scattered tribes of 
the Southlands under one banner.

771
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,958
The very banner that might
unite them again today.

772
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:34,458
Against the evil that now seeks
to claim their lands.

773
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,541
Your lands, Halbrand.

774
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:45,166
Your people have no king, 
for you are him.

775
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,541
[chuckles]

776
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,333
That's an odd thing to say
to a man in a cage.

777
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:55,666
A cage you have landed in because
you chafe under the rags of the common.

778
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:59,708
And the armor that ought to rest
upon your shoulders

779
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,208
weighs upon your soul.

780
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:17,958
Be careful, Elf.

781
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:22,875
The heir to this mark is heir to 
more than just nobility.

782
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,875
For it was his ancestor who swore 
a blood oath to Morgoth.

783
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,875
I am not the hero you seek.

784
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:40,250
For it was my family that lost the war.

785
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,208
And it was mine who started it.

786
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,791
Ours was no chance meeting.

787
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:47,333
Not fate, nor destiny,

788
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:50,416
nor any other words Men use
to speak of the forces

789
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
they lack the conviction to name.

790
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:55,791
Ours was the work of something greater.

791
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:58,333
You must see it.

792
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:01,166
All I see is an Elf who won't put 
down her sword.

793
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,458
Come with me to Middle-earth.

794
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:07,416
And together we will redeem
both our bloodlines.

795
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,375
How?

796
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:12,125
You're stuck on this island.

797
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,000
And you're still short an army.

798
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,625
That is all about to change.

799
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,583
It is here, Father.

800
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,625
The moment we feared.

801
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:06,125
The Elf has arrived.

802
