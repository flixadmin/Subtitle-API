2
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:48,001
Wireless crackling
with instructions.

3
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,466
Patil, don't move from there.
Be alert.

4
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,169
Yes, Sir. Okay. Out.

5
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,089
It's always crowded here.

6
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,380
Its okay, Morey.
We have to go straight.

7
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,381
Look at that... you scum!

8
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,260
You get awesome chicken
on the left here.

9
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,627
Don't just pay lip service, Morey.
Get it tomorrow.

10
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,715
Morey, stop here. Ma'am...

11
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:40,134
Jai Hind, Ma'am.

12
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,676
Yes, Sir.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,593
Yes, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir.

14
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,468
Boss is in a bad mood today.

15
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:54,339
He's pissed with everyone.

16
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,298
His wife must've screamt at him

17
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,255
Ma'am, his PA was telling me,

18
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,177
he forgot to take his wife
shopping for their anniversary.

19
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:05,046
She got so upset she cancelled
their dinner reservations.

20
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,379
We can handle the
toughest of criminals easily...

21
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,462
...but when it comes to handling
family, we goof up.

22
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:13,634
So true, Ma'am.

23
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,219
That's why Morey is
taking the day off tomorrow.

24
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,003
Oh yes. It's your sister-in-law's
wedding on Sunday, right?

25
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:19,671
Yes, Ma'am.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,547
How is your younger
one studying?

27
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,172
Wonder when she studies!

28
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:25,670
She's always glued
to the TV or the computer.

29
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,800
That reminds me...

30
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:32,796
Hello.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,094
- Hello, Meera.
- Yes, Aunty.

32
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,294
- Done with your revision?
- Of course.

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,468
I can hear the TV.

34
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,297
- When are you coming?
- Soon.

35
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:42,168
- Have you got it?
- What?

36
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,796
Yes, Ma'am.

37
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,003
I was speaking to Jafar.

38
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:45,884
Okay.

39
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,585
Better get done with
your revision till I am back.

40
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,091
Okay, bye.

41
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,047
Have you fed them?

42
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,085
They are getting a royal treatment.

43
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,636
Morey, is feeding them
cheese since the afternoon.

44
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:59,090
Who told you mice eat cheese, Morey?

45
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,301
I saw it on Tom & Jerry.

46
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,010
These guys love cheese.

47
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,426
Our surveillance team
is already there, right?

48
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,002
I'll confirm, Ma'am.

49
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:09,259
Shinde...

50
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,550
The baby's crying...

51
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:49,918
Oh my God!

52
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,709
You son of a...

53
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:54,834
Get up!

54
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,044
Bloody rascal!

55
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,386
Only a mouse can get
another mouse out of his hole.

56
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,377
Ma'am, please don't shoot me.
Please, Ma'am.

57
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,340
We are not going to shoot you.

58
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,251
Please, Ma'am...

59
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,133
I don't have orders to shoot you,
you scum.

60
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,298
I have to take you in alive.

61
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,634
- Jafar...
- Yes, Ma'am.

62
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,003
- Send the rest of the unit inside.
- Yes, Ma'am.

63
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:23,509
God knows who else is hiding
inside for a threesome.

64
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,384
Get him!

65
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,548
You son of a...

66
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,836
You have dodged us
four times before.

67
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,426
You think we'll let
you escape so easily?

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,594
Ma'am, I am warning you.
Ali Bhai will ruin you.

69
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,589
Take him away!

70
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,504
Giving refuge to
rats spreads plague.

71
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,379
Rehman, you should be
thankful to me.

72
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:12,217
You could at least
make love one last time.

73
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,669
Jafar was all set
to spoil it for you.

74
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,336
You are ragging me,
aren't you, Ma'am?

75
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:19,634
Sir's call.

76
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,209
- Yes, Sir.
- You got Rehman?

77
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,755
Yes, we are taking
him to the station.

78
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,090
I had ordered you to
get him out and nab him...

79
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,797
...not barge right inside the chawl.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,298
You know how sly Rehman is, Sir.

81
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,465
If we had let him come out
he would definitely have escaped.

82
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,420
We would have arrested
him again if he escaped.

83
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,214
But who would be responsible...

84
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,669
...if a civilian was
killed in a shootout?

85
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,300
We had taken precautions, Sir.

86
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,176
Taking rats along
was your precaution?

87
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,585
Oh, for God's sake, Shivani!

88
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,672
It was a calculated risk, Sir.

89
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:50,509
Your job is to take orders,
not risks. You understand?

90
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,136
Someone please take
Sir's wife for shopping.

91
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,839
Go home, Ma'am.

92
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,548
Meera has asked you
to come early, right?

93
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,756
If we don't get this
rascal's paperwork right...

94
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,919
...he'll find a loophole
to escape from the law.

95
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,214
No chance, Ma'am.

96
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,002
We'll keep the papers
ready by morning.

97
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,043
You have a look at it.

98
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:24,793
Okay.

99
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,009
Sorry, I am late again.

100
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,050
It's okay.

101
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,552
Meera, wake up.
Your Aunty is home.

102
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,376
Sorry...

103
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,885
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

104
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,795
Aunty! You are so late.
Happy birthday, Aunty!

105
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,379
For me?

106
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:14,251
No, Aunty. I stood first
in the orange belt category.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,468
Wow! Did you show it to mom and dad?

108
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:18,293
Yes.

109
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,428
Happy birthday to you...

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,550
Happy birthday dear Shivani...

111
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,219
Happy birthday to you.

112
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,051
This is for Meera.

113
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,003
And for me? Come on...

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,547
Fast, fast, fast.

115
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,466
And this is for you.

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,503
Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am.

117
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,635
Just like John Abraham
(Indian film star).

118
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,757
Wear these goggles
and ride a bike in style...

119
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,380
Hey, hey!

120
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,716
If I look like John Abraham,
then girls will chase me.

121
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,126
Show me something else.

122
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,427
Of course, Ma'am.
I'll show you something else.

123
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,093
I have a lot of variety.

124
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:38,214
Try this one.

125
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,719
Chulbul style.
Dabang (Indian film).

126
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,094
He was a cop just like you.

127
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,545
Roam around in style with these.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,380
That one Chulbul Pandey is enough.
We don't need another.

129
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,007
Ma'am, I also have
a Sunny Leone style goggle.

130
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,335
But that one doesn't have a glass.

131
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,091
It's a see through.
That's why I am not offering it.

132
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,172
But don't worry Ma'am.

133
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,628
I know exactly
what you are looking for.

134
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,427
Hang on a second.
I have a lot of variety...

135
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,002
What the hell is going on there?

136
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,009
Go check Morey.

137
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,131
Ignore it, Ma'am.
We are from the crime branch.

138
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,797
Why do we need to get into it?

139
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:23,170
Morey, we are from
the crime branch later.

140
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,919
We are cops first. Let's go.

141
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,043
Let's go.

142
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,755
Ma'am, goggles...

143
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,135
How dare they celebrate
Valentine's Day!

144
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,420
Enough! Enough of this destruction!

145
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:56,085
Ma'am, please don't come in our way.
Let us do ourjob.

146
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,425
Get lost!

147
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,167
Only one of us can
do ourjob right now.

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,468
And right now, I am on duty.

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,128
So, you stop working
and let me work.

150
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,427
Don't act smart.
Shut up and get lost.

151
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,672
You guys keep 905F191!

152
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:13,043
Last warning.

153
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,755
You and your bloody last warning!

154
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,585
You...!
I will screw your happiness!

155
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:18,759
Start counting, Morey.

156
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,002
Section 143 - unlawful assembly.

157
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,835
Section 147 - rioting.

158
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,090
Section 132 - abetment of mutiny.

159
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,552
Section 504 - intentional
insult with intent...

160
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,797
...to provoke breach of peace.

161
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,511
Section 506 - criminal intimidation.

162
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,213
Get up!

163
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,465
Two more sections left. Get up!

164
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,549
Section 188 - disobedience
to order given by public servant.

165
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,628
And Section 353 - assault
or criminal force...

166
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,302
...to deter public servant
from discharge of duty.

167
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,877
Anybody else wants a lesson in law?

168
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,094
Jafar, did you get
record the video?

169
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:58,134
Yes, Ma'am.

170
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,006
Make sure your boss
gets my name right.

171
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,465
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

172
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,715
Senior Inspector, Crime Branch,

173
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:11,418
Unit 3.

174
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,510
Do whatever the hell you want!

175
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,379
Get lost!

176
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,626
Aunty, it's only for fifty bucks.

177
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,919
- How much?
- Aunty, fifty bucks.

178
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,050
No, no. Give it for thirty.

179
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,464
No, Aunty. Take it for fifty.

180
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,800
Okay, let's settle
at thirty-five. Okay?

181
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,126
Okay.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,592
PYaafi!

183
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,755
Pyaari! Come here!

184
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,005
Hang on. Aunty, please hurry.

185
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,010
Here's a twenty... thirty...

186
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,009
Pyaari, come quickly!

187
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,009
coming!

188
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:46,418
Keep the change.

189
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,251
Pyaari, get in.

190
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:53,379
How are you?

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,546
There it is.

192
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,673
Read later, Pyaari. Eat first.

193
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,378
I am going to treat
both of you this Friday.

194
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,009
Really? Why?

195
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,084
It's my birthday.

196
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,835
- Really?
- No.

197
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,386
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday
along with Ganpati's (Hindu God).

198
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:15,543
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

199
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,797
Very smart.

200
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,630
If the whole of India
will celebrate...

201
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,585
...then even we must too, right?

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,674
Right. I'll get the cake.
Which flavour do you like?

203
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:24,754
Kaalakhatta.

204
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,001
Aunty, kaalakhatta...

205
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,210
No problem.
If that's what Miss Pyaari wants.

206
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,003
Done. Kaalakhatta cake.
How old will you be?

207
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,467
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

208
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:35,383
Me too.

209
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,002
You too? Same pinch.

210
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,344
What a stroke of luck
it was that I found you!

211
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,386
Remember how you were standing
at the railway station?

212
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,470
If it wouldn't have been for me,
your uncle would have sold you off.

213
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,544
Aunty, but you met me, right?

214
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,048
My Ganpati selected you for me.

215
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,251
And me?

216
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,002
You, I have selected myself!

217
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,002
Shivani, please put
these eye drops for me.

218
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,215
Just a second. I am on my last set.

219
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,546
ASlain?

220
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,551
Hurry up please.
I have to go to the clinic.

221
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,421
What happened?

222
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:24,001
Your Kaku never lets
me work out in peace.

223
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,001
Really.

224
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,003
Why are there so many
boxes of cake in the fridge?

225
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,425
There will be one more today.

226
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,126
Why?

227
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,127
These are Pyaari's birthday cakes.

228
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,798
Its been three days,
I just can't find her.

229
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,877
So a new cake every day?

230
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,176
We can't feed her a stale
cake on her birthday, can we?

231
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:47,592
Just you wait! I'll pull her ears
and get her home today.

232
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:48,379
Very good.

233
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,001
Yes, Jafar.

234
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,501
I'll handle that.

235
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,380
You keep the charge sheet ready.

236
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,546
I'll come in some time.

237
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,839
Yes, Jafar.

238
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,718
Ma'am, I want to meet Pyaari.

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,592
Who are you?

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,627
Tell Pyaari, Shivani Aunty is here.

241
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,209
Who is Shivani Aunty?

242
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,132
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
Crime Branch, Senior Inspector.

243
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,171
Did you find her?

244
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,468
- Who?
- Her.

245
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,092
Who's her?

246
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,920
You just asked for her.
Pyaari. Did you find her?

247
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,590
Find Pyaari? Where is she?

248
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:42,342
I thought since you are
a cop you might have found Pyaari.

249
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,294
Who let these kids inside?

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,842
What's wrong with her?

251
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,051
She's missing since
the last four days.

252
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,466
Usually we wait for two days
before we file a missing complaint.

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,048
These kids wander off sometimes.

254
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,423
But they come back
in a couple of days.

255
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,127
Pyaari didn't come
back till last evening...

256
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,093
...so we filed a missing complaint.

257
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,002
Where? At the D. N.
Nagar Police Station?

258
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,259
This is D. N. Nagar...

259
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,585
...so we'll obviously go to
D. N. Nagar Police Station, right?

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,001
When did you see her last?

261
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,046
Four days back.

262
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,709
I want to meet these kids.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,297
Ma'am, please wait. Tambe!

264
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,256
She was with us
three days ago. And...

265
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:18,466
You fool! We even ate wadapaav.

266
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,252
Kids get lost but
they also come back.

267
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,756
You come after a few days.
You'll find her.

268
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,045
We played together at bed time.
Hide and seek.

269
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,044
I haven't seen her after that.

270
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,468
I saw her when I came
in the morning.

271
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,793
Don't know where she
disappeared later.

272
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,593
She was carrying her bag of books.

273
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,503
I even asked her
where she was going.

274
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,552
But she didn't say anything.
She just left.

275
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,844
Six months ago even Yashoda
Didi disappeared in the same way.

276
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,001
One cup of tea

277
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,543
Since when do you
have your stall here?

278
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,635
What's the matter Ma'am?
ls anything wrong?

279
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,093
Just answer my question.

280
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,218
I regularly bribe Mr. Pawar, Ma'am.

281
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,261
You won't have to pay,
if you work for me.

282
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,050
What's the job?

283
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,052
You have to keep an
eye on this shelter home.

284
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,005
Who comes in, who goes out.

285
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,256
You want me to be
an informer, right?

286
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,922
You are very smart, huh?

287
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,466
A girl called Pyaari
is missing from here.

288
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,460
Give me all the
information you can get.

289
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,342
Clear?

290
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,584
Write my number down.

291
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,334
9-3-2...

292
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,465
Meera, are you ready?

293
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,256
I have made your
favourite breakfast today.

294
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,585
Sharda Bai, one more
cup of tea please.

295
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,300
Yes, Sir.

296
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,256
Let me comb your hair today.

297
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,006
- Sir, tea.
- Clear this.

298
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,090
You need a good hair-cut.

299
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,254
We'll go to a posh salon
in Bandra this Sunday...

300
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,920
...and get you a nice haircut. Okay?

301
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,794
How can you be so normal, Aunty?

302
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,002
Pyaari is missing since five days.

303
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,294
And we are behaving
as if it never happened.

304
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:07,884
She has been kidnapped.

305
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,760
Wonder where Pyaari is now...

306
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,209
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello.

307
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,880
There's no network inside.

308
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,502
So he comes out to take his calls.

309
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,800
Something about dealings...

310
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,252
He bought a new cell
phone a few days ago.

311
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,718
He is obsessed with
clicking snaps on his phone.

312
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,001
He has clicked mine too.

313
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,251
Where would he be right now?

314
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,378
Ogling at girls outside
Chaaya restaurant.

315
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,251
Kapin

316
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,592
What are you up to?

317
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,802
Nothing much.
I was just heading home.

318
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,926
Heading home? I'll drop you.

319
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,376
No, Ma'am, don't bother.

320
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,002
It's no bother. Come, sit.

321
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,009
Come.

322
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,380
Come sit.

323
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,004
Half our life is spent
waiting in this Mumbai traffic.

324
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:40,339
Whose call is it? Answer it.

325
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,552
It's from home.
I am going home anyway.

326
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,547
Your family is missing you, huh?

327
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:56,502
Well... my wife gets worried
if I don't reach home on time.

328
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,296
Anyway...

329
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,584
May I take a snap with you, Sir?

330
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,377
Yes, of course.

331
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:04,714
Take a good one.

332
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,718
Done? Show me.

333
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,294
What a phone you have there!

334
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,334
Ma'am, take a look.

335
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,009
Latest mobile.

336
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,004
Wow!

337
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:19,425
Jafar, what did you earn in
so many years with the police force?

338
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,133
Peanuts!

339
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,633
We should also quit
our jobs and join an NGO.

340
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,218
Pick little girls
from the shelter home...

341
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:30,919
...sell them and buy
expensive cell phones.

342
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,091
Get home on time and enjoy life.
Right, Kapil?

343
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,173
Don't play dumb. We know.

344
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,792
Jafar, let's start his
interrogation here itself.

345
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:53,592
If we wait for the traffic to
move Kapil won't get home on time.

346
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:54,759
Good idea, Ma'am.

347
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:58,216
Speak up. Who do you work for?

348
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:02,376
I don't understand what
you are talking about, Sir.

349
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,843
Why are you stretching it?

350
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,505
We are in an 'instant' era.

351
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,549
The quicker you answer,
the quicker you get home.

352
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:11,259
Come on speak up.

353
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,593
On whose instructions
did you kidnap Pyaari?

354
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,592
Where is she?

355
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,297
Speak UP, you scum!

356
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,886
He's just pretending.

357
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,544
You are messing with my head now!

358
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,339
Are you done?

359
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:34,260
- He's been shot, Ma'am!
- What?!

360
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,671
There they are!

361
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,173
Morey, call the control
room and get reinforcement.

362
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,172
- Quick!
- Okay, Ma'am.

363
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:43,759
Morey keep his mobile.

364
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,092
Move aside!

365
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,626
Move!

366
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,005
The other shooter.

367
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,344
Jafar, this matter
is getting complicated.

368
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,300
Damn!

369
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,296
Pyaari, where are you my child!

370
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,209
Come here.

371
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,546
Move.

372
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,003
Stop fooling around, guys!

373
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:00,842
Come on.

374
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,552
- Go there. Who's next?
- She.

375
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,676
What's the matter, baby?
Having fun, aren't you?

376
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,627
Will you rip it or should I?

377
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,256
- Come on.
- No, please no!

378
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,467
Come here.

379
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:13,543
No!

380
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,421
Get her.

381
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,002
Come on. Stand straight, you!

382
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,427
I am telling you for the last time.

383
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,002
Don't do this to me.

384
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,422
Please!

385
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,585
Easy, Mattu!

386
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:11,259
Take it off!

387
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:25,170
Take a good look. She's a virgin!

388
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,584
In spite of you around?

389
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:29,045
Don't you find anyone
else to pick on!

390
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,467
Put her in No. 2.

391
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:33,543
Baby Doll!

392
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,552
Come here to Papa. Come.

393
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:38,543
Hey!

394
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,137
Don't come near me rascals.
Don't come.

395
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,043
Are you insane?!

396
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,880
Who will you kill
with that splinter?

397
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,085
Myself. I will slash myself.

398
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:53,168
Don't slash your wrists.

399
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:56,511
It'll hurt more
and will take more time.

400
00:25:58,292 --> 00:25:59,509
Loretto School, Kolkata, huh?

401
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:01,919
Her school is very famous.

402
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,551
I was in Hindu College.

403
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,919
Dropped out in the second year.

404
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,635
But that I can help you with.

405
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:13,213
No really.

406
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:18,092
If you really want to die
then cut this vein of your neck.

407
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,130
It'll be quick and
it'll be painless.

408
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,087
And if you still want to run
I really suggest you drop that idea.

409
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,002
Because you have seen me.

410
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,251
What's her name?

411
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:30,842
Mrunal.

412
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,300
Mrunal, now it leaves
us with two options.

413
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,627
You either work for me...

414
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,048
Don't come, don't come.

415
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,255
Chill. It's okay.

416
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,343
Or I will have to kill you.

417
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,509
What were you about to do?

418
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,257
Yeah. I would have
also done the same.

419
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,669
Slash your wrist slightly from here.

420
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:57,090
It would have taken
5-7 days for you to die.

421
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,510
In front of all the girls.

422
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,376
Is that what you want?

423
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,876
But what to do?

424
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,844
A bit of drama is required
to control so many of you.

425
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,085
And that leaves us
with our last option.

426
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,835
If you want to stay alive...

427
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:17,546
...and lead a good life
I can help you with that too.

428
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,843
You are quite hot, you know.

429
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,173
I can get you the best clients.

430
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:27,923
5 star hotels, fine dining,
beaches, clubs, foreign trips.

431
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:30,425
Think about it.

432
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:36,673
But the way I look at it, you don't
really have a choice. Do you?

433
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,094
Mattu, keep her for Hong Kong.

434
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,885
Come on, Charlie's Angel.

435
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,627
Put her in No. 1

436
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,879
The shooter has been identified.
He's Hanif Hatela's man.

437
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,711
- Hanif, the hired assassin?
- Yes, Ma'am.

438
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:43,509
Look at this.

439
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,586
We found a treasure in Kapil's phone.

440
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,926
All the notorious ones together?

441
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,003
Ma'am most of them are
members of the Ali Gang.

442
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,172
This one is Balu Kotian...

443
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,926
...and this one is Dhapna Khalid.

444
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,377
Go back.

445
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,464
Just a moment.

446
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:06,592
This...

447
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,668
Who's this?

448
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,669
I have never seen him before.

449
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,003
Kapil loved to flaunt
his connections.

450
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:19,711
He's surely a member of some gang.

451
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,927
This is definitely a huge syndicate.

452
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:29,843
To pick up a girl so smoothly,
and then shoot him...

453
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:33,671
Only an organized gang
can operate with such finesse.

454
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,838
There is one man,
who keeps track of such things.

455
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:49,261
Is this a new style
of interrogation?

456
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,627
Feed meat and extract information?

457
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,670
Tell me, Rehman,
is anything free in life?

458
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,002
If everything was without a price...

459
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,422
...then would you
have become a gangster?

460
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,421
You are right.

461
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,009
Do you know him?

462
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,297
Are you kidding me?

463
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,252
You want me to be an
informer at my stature?

464
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,293
You idiot!

465
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,585
When I had come to arrest you...

466
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,004
...you were begging
me not to shoot you.

467
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,343
And now you talk about stature?

468
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,678
Don't waste my time.
I have loads of other work.

469
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,046
Katyal.

470
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,005
He is Sunny Katyal.

471
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,089
He's not from Mumbai.

472
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,339
He started operating here
around three years ago.

473
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,423
He has fifteen car showrooms now.

474
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,219
But the real dough comes from
drugs and trafficking.

475
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,420
Whenever a girl between
<i>8</i> to 18 years disappears...

476
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:00,715
more often than
not he is involved.

477
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,083
You can call him
the wholesaler of trafficking.

478
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,754
No matter where a girl disappears
from, she ends up in his net.

479
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,710
Why is he not on our radar yet?

480
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:15,011
Your radar? He is not
even on our radar yet.

481
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,628
It's impossible to crack
how he smuggles drugs and girls.

482
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,795
How do the other
gangs let him operate?

483
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,172
He is a very smart man.

484
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:24,876
Keeps everyone happy-

485
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,634
Has no enemies.

486
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,424
But I have a strong doubt that
he is not the brain behind all this.

487
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:33,011
There is someone
bigger supporting him.

488
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:36,876
You gave me a lot of information
in return for a Mutton Kolhapuri.

489
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,674
I did it for the girl.
Not for the food.

490
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,877
Thanks for the meat.

491
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,626
Katyal.

492
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,129
Sunny Katyal.

493
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,301
I want to know about
every message...

494
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:02,709
...every call that's
made from his cell phone.

495
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:06,087
What time he wakes up in the morning
to who he bangs in the night!

496
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,425
I want to know everything.

497
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:08,168
Got it?

498
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,043
Yes, Ma'am.

499
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,002
- Check the angle of the video.
- Yes, Sir.

500
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:36,418
I want it clear.

501
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,551
Hello, Vakil Sir.
It's a mess here.

502
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,094
The crime branch people
have made my life hell.

503
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,002
I think they'll very soon
monitor me in the loo!

504
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,510
How did they get to know about you?

505
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,343
How do I know that Vakil Sir?

506
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,295
I just know that they are
behind my life with a vengeance.

507
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,384
What will you do now?

508
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,010
I am thinking of talking
to the commissioner.

509
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,254
Moron!

510
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:35,886
Why inform the commissioner about
things that he doesn't know yet!

511
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,251
Then please tell
me what I should do.

512
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,261
Find out the price of the inspector
who's leading this operation.

513
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,876
Throw some money at him.

514
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,843
That's the problem, Vakil Sir.

515
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:44,634
It's some woman.

516
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,426
She has a track record
of not accepting bribes.

517
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,420
Woman? Tell me her name.

518
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:52,761
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
From the crime branch.

519
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:54,755
Do one thing.

520
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,632
Get me her number.
I'll call her tomorrow.

521
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:03,884
Get me the number!
Like it's a piece of cake.

522
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,919
Where the hell am I sitting!

523
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,127
Just when some money
was on its way...

524
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:12,549
...this moron has made plans
to ruin it.

525
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:18,717
I have a feeling this inspector
is going to ask for a huge price.

526
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,169
Has Mr. Singh's payment come?

527
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:22,213
Yes.

528
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:27,668
The batch of girls
this time is superb.

529
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:30,259
Really?

530
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:32,501
What did he say?

531
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,801
He signed a 200,000 deal.

532
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:39,167
The foreigners loved the
service that our girls gave.

533
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,377
What is the status of the girls
from Bangladesh?

534
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,047
It's getting delayed.

535
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,003
The security at the border
has become very stringent.

536
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,171
It will take a week more.

537
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:52,002
You are very lenient with them,
Vakil Sir.

538
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,882
They are very prompt
at collecting their payments.

539
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,506
But when it comes to delivery,
a week's delay?

540
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,671
Not done.

541
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:06,213
What was her name?

542
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:07,713
Shivani Roy.

543
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,007
Wow! She's hot.

544
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,794
Let it be, Vakil sir.

545
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,336
You are too old to
deal with women like her.

546
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:22,010
I'll talk to her.

547
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,215
Tell Katyal to get
all information on her.

548
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,135
A week has passed
and no leads yet.

549
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,301
Either he is smart
or our information is wrong.

550
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,336
Yeah, Mr. Sinha (Boss) too
is getting impatient.

551
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,718
Let's wait for a few more days.

552
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,002
I am sure he will
commit some mistake.

553
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,090
Come on. I have got dinner.

554
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,046
Hello?

555
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,800
You reached home, Ma'am?

556
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,796
Who's this?

557
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,796
Doesn't matter.

558
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:05,510
How come you picked dinner
from Aaswaad tonight?

559
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,252
Sharda bai didn't
come to work today?

560
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,552
Yes. Aaswaad has lovely food.

561
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:12,510
- Want to join us for dinner?
- I had heard right about you.

562
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,505
Aunty, what have you got?

563
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:15,130
Someone else would
have been rattled.

564
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:17,795
Set the plates.
lam very hungry. Call Kaku.

565
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,335
Go, quick, quick.

566
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,130
Tell me.

567
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:23,759
Why are you watching me?

568
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:28,008
If you keep a watch on my men then
I will have to watch you, right?

569
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:31,386
Oh! So you are Katyal's daddy!

570
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:34,010
You sound like his son though.

571
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,422
How does it matter?

572
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,842
It's the same family.

573
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,673
The whole family seems twisted.

574
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:44,011
You are calling me from VOIP
so I can't trace your call?

575
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,468
To deal with a sharp
officer like you...

576
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:48,590
...one needs to be prepared, right?

577
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,718
No point tracing the IP address...

578
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,717
You won't find anything.

579
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,339
Enough br399i"9-

580
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,173
Get to the point.
My food is getting cold.

581
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,549
Stop watching my people
and quote your price.

582
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,339
I want my daughter back.

583
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,717
Daughter?

584
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,134
You have a daughter?

585
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,882
The girl you picked up
from the Andheri shelter home...

586
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,126
...is like my daughter.

587
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,584
Oh! That's why you
are behind my life.

588
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,969
It might have been possible
if you had asked earlier.

589
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,092
It's difficult now.

590
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,590
Fine. Then the surveillance
will continue.

591
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:32,133
You are stretching this
a bit too much.

592
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:36,420
She was like your daughter,
but not your real daughter, right?

593
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,876
Let's do one thing.

594
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,925
There's a 35 story skyscraper
coming up in Wadala.

595
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,798
The top floor is yours.

596
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:51,593
No thanks. If the elevator
breaks down, who'll climb 35 floors!

597
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:55,009
Then tell me what you want.

598
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,085
I told you I want Pyaari back.

599
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,302
Shivani ji, you
aren't listening to me.

600
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:05,170
That girl has seen too much.

601
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,210
I don't take such
a risk in my business.

602
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,717
It's too late now.

603
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,672
Aunty, hurry up!

604
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,426
Listen, kid.

605
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:20,091
I'll come hunting to
your house to rescue Pyaari.

606
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:21,009
But rescue I will.

607
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:23,794
That's a lot of anger Ma'am.

608
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,093
Chill. Don't get worked up.

609
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:27,509
It doesn't suit you.

610
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,376
Anything else?

611
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,417
Don't do this.
Think about it please.

612
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,298
You need to think about it Junior.

613
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,886
I won't take too
long to reach Pyaari...

614
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:43,012
...but the day I reach her you
won't be capable of even thinking.

615
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:48,545
Okay, Ma'am.
You do your job and I'll do mine.

616
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,085
Let's just both do
what's best for business.

617
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:54,261
But I have to admit
it was fun talking to you.

618
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,293
Bye Ma'am.

619
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:04,502
Hello. Mattu, put that
girl Pyaari in tonight's lot.

620
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,673
Jafar, pick Katyal from his house.

621
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,048
I'll finish dinner and come.
Yes, right now.

622
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,043
How dare you touch me?

623
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:17,046
You can't harass a responsible
and innocent citizen this way.

624
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,716
Please, please, Sir, speak in Hindi.
I do not understand.

625
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,422
I will speak to the Human Rights
Organisations...

626
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,467
...and feed you to the dogs.

627
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:26,793
Sure.

628
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,501
- Jafar?
- Patil?

629
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:37,008
You feed us to the dogs
and we will feed you jalebis.

630
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:38,668
Jalebi?

631
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:44,634
You will eat the jalebis, feel Very
sleepy but we won't let you sleep.

632
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:46,838
I don't eat jalebis.

633
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,297
Shut up and eat! Or I'll...

634
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:53,007
Eat it. He hits very hard. Eat it.

635
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,593
I will eat it. Hang on a second.

636
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:56,384
Eat.

637
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:09,126
Gentlemen, please key in your
bids on your iPad screens now.

638
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:16,542
For the sweet and spicy No. 104.

639
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,003
She looks grown
but is just a child.

640
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:26,385
100% virgin. 100% pure. Guaranteed.

641
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:38,759
No!

642
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,420
I thought I'll celebrate
my birthday with Ganpati.

643
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:47,842
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

644
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,751
How are you?

645
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,002
- How old will you be?
- How old are you?

646
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,175
- Twelve.
- Me too.

647
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,046
You too?

648
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,752
Pyaari, come quickly.

649
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,166
You met me, right, Aunty?
My Ganpati selected you for me.

650
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,422
What will you become
when you grow up?

651
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,759
An airplane driver.

652
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:11,671
What?

653
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,636
It's called a pilot,
not a driver, you fool!

654
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,009
Same thing.

655
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:21,172
I'll fly the plane very high,
right in the middle of clouds.

656
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:36,007
Ma'am, have your ginger
tea and fix your mood.

657
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,384
Thank you, Jafar.

658
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,176
He's a seasoned player.

659
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,593
We stuffed him with
a kilo ofjalebis...

660
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:49,510
...didn't give him
even a drop of water...

661
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,798
...but he still
didn't open his mouth.

662
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,333
Ma'am I'll continue for the
next four hours. You go on home.

663
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,176
Ask Morey and Pawaskar
to continue later.

664
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,173
Don't let him sleep
even for a second.

665
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,255
Yes, Ma'am.

666
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,672
Thank you.

667
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,461
I am coming. Two minutes.

668
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,461
Aunty, you are so late!

669
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,837
Sorry. But I think
we'll soon find Pyaari.

670
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,177
Really, Aunty? You are the best,
Aunty. You are the best.

671
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,840
It won't hurt after
a couple of times.

672
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,092
Here...

673
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,134
.“cupcake.

674
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:08,919
For both of you.

675
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,594
Every girl gets it
after her first night.

676
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,300
Have it.

677
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,174
I too blew my past away
after my first night.

678
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,544
That's the only way to survive here.

679
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,879
Otherwise your life will be hell.

680
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:31,713
Come on, now blow the candle
and move on.

681
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:34,592
Come on.

682
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:44,507
It's a great idea to teach
that nosy cop a lesson.

683
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:47,466
But we'll have to
pay a fat price for it.

684
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:51,215
This guy will do our job for free.

685
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,459
Here.

686
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:55,755
<i>Ca“ Riyal.</i>

687
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,502
Tell him that this job must be done.

688
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,510
Performance bonus guaranteed.

689
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:10,970
Shivani ji, you will
stop nosing around after this.

690
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,879
Sometimes... I feel scared of you.

691
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:21,005
It's good that way.

692
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:24,090
Fear gets work done faster.

693
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:36,302
Morey... 21 missed calls!

694
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,459
Ma'am, come quickly.

695
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:48,418
Why?

696
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,005
Ma'am, come quickly please.

697
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:01,548
Get the pervert doctor!

698
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,173
In a shocking incident in Mumbai...

699
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,294
...a female patient
accused a doctor...

700
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,093
...of inappropriate behaviour.

701
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:32,295
Runa, that's my Kaku!

702
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,876
What's going on?

703
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:39,760
A few hours after the allegations...

704
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:42,010
...the members of
Maharashtra Seva Mandal...

705
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:47,085
...attacked the dispensary
and defamed the doctor.

706
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:50,761
We had no intentions of
taking the law in our hands.

707
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:54,171
But the people are
fuming with anger...

708
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:56,298
...because of the growing
exploitation of women.

709
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:58,924
The anger found its vent this way.

710
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,127
That doctor must be punished.

711
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:05,589
Please eat.

712
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,379
Hello?

713
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:50,712
It's the 'kid' speaking, Ma'am.

714
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,844
I am genuinely sorry
for what's happened.

715
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:59,466
In fact I even had tears
when I heard the news.

716
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:02,586
But I hope this doesn't
change things between us.

717
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:06,094
Because I am just
starting to like you.

718
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,461
There was nothing personal
about this, Ma'am.

719
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,467
It's just business.

720
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,002
Please don't harbour
any misunderstanding.

721
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:17,259
Please.

722
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,630
You know what, Junior,
I grew up in a village.

723
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:26,500
There was a dense
forest near my house.

724
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:31,671
That's why from early on
in life I knew animals very well.

725
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:36,209
Maybe that's the reason why Kamat
Sir took me in the crime branch.

726
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,423
To trap a mouse you
have to act like one.

727
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,715
To catch a dog you
have to think like one.

728
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:44,261
To hunt a tiger you
have to become one.

729
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:46,467
You know what you are?

730
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,802
You are that poisonous
snake near the river...

731
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:58,011
...who can't be seen but bites
oblivious kids swimming in the river.

732
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,378
You should have been with
the Discovery Channel, Ma'am.

733
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,627
What are you doing
in the police force?

734
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:10,386
You are the one who's
about to be discovered, kid.

735
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:13,215
I don't know what your name is.

736
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,878
I don't know
where you are speaking from.

737
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,459
Who your boss is
or where you have kept Pyaari.

738
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,794
But I've figured your type

739
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:28,376
No matter how far you
try to stay away...

740
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:31,090
...your nature will compel you
to come closer to me.

741
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,001
30 days.

742
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,755
I will hunt you down in 30 days.

743
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,835
And then with a lot of love and
patience I'll squish you to pulp.

744
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,920
Mark my words. 30 days.

745
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:05,012
Tandon Sir, I have heard there's
a high command meeting next week.

746
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:08,006
You hear everything, Mattu.
But you do nothing.

747
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,093
Sir, first you don't give
me an opportunity to work...

748
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:12,465
...and then you call me useless.
This is unfair, Sir.

749
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,007
Big announcements are to be made
in the party meeting this time.

750
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:18,840
Now you are making me drool.

751
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,298
Mr. Taneja is coming this time.

752
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:24,711
Really? That means
it's going to be huge.

753
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:25,834
That's awesome, Sir.

754
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:28,670
The contract for Taneja's
personal party must come to us.

755
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,422
Why should I get you the contract?

756
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:34,709
Name the drug and you'll get it,
Sir. Indian, South American.

757
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:39,588
And as far as girls go,
look at the choice, Sir.

758
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:41,840
Film star or porn star.

759
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,676
You are still not getting me, Mattu.

760
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:48,127
Why should I get you the contract?

761
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:52,213
Oh! I have been
blabbering like a fool.

762
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:55,010
The list will obviously
begin with you, Sir.

763
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:58,883
And shame on me if you
have to tell me your list.

764
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:05,459
Hey, Jennifer! Come here, baby.
Come here. Take Sir...

765
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:11,417
Oh! Good choice, Sir.
Hey, Julia Roberts!

766
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:13,294
Darling, baby, come here.

767
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,380
Don't be shy. Come here.

768
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,084
Good girl.

769
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:22,171
Keep the tray here and
take Sir to the washroom.

770
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,960
Call me on Monday.

771
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,210
Maybe this time you'll get lucky.

772
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,967
Don't forget, Sir!

773
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,584
Come, baby...

774
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:43,921
Hey, Mattu.

775
00:51:44,792 --> 00:51:47,511
You really do appear out of nowhere!

776
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:48,967
I have been watching you.

777
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,710
How long does it
take to crack a deal?

778
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,260
I am not selling water purifiers.

779
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,631
I am trying to crack a deal
worth crores. It takes time.

780
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:56,544
If he doesn't call on Monday...

781
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,795
I swear I'll go to Katra
and sell religious CDs.

782
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,377
If this deal doesn't come through...

783
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:03,132
I won't even leave you capable
of selling porn CDs at Palika.

784
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:04,760
I am at it.

785
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,093
Please don't threaten unnecessarily.

786
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:08,965
Okay. You crack this deal.

787
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,170
I'll send you to Mumbai
to look after our set up there.

788
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:12,293
Mumbai?

789
00:52:12,317 --> 00:52:32,832

790
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,710
But Katyal is looking
after Mumbai, right?

791
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,335
Left... left... Very good.

792
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:19,544
Good Job.

793
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:21,801
You fool! Be careful.

794
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:23,589
The packet will break.

795
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:25,134
Be careful.

796
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:29,461
Guggu, will the car
be fixed by evening?

797
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,130
Yes, Sir. It'll be ready.

798
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,755
Hello, Vakil Sir.

799
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:38,210
This time the consignment is superb!

800
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:40,215
Forget the consignment.
Listen to me.

801
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:43,712
That cop chick has lost it.
She will pick you up again.

802
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,882
Vakil Sir, she is after my life!

803
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:48,293
Should I fix her?

804
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:51,006
Don't be stupid, Katyal.

805
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:54,302
You want the entire Mumbai
Police force to come behind you?

806
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:55,376
What should I do then?

807
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,176
Go underground for a few days.

808
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,047
One of my men will
come in the evening.

809
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,635
Go with him to the safe house.

810
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:03,176
He will make arrangements
for you there.

811
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:05,131
What nonsense is this, Vakil Sir?

812
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:06,718
Don't crib so much!

813
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:08,960
Pack your bag and
be ready in the evening.

814
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:10,714
Go with my man.

815
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:12,838
Bye.

816
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:16,425
Pour it in my mouth!

817
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:18,092
Get lost!

818
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:20,173
I am surrounded by duck heads!

819
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,169
What's going on?

820
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:32,126
Vakil Sir has sent
such an atrocious car!

821
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:35,259
Good bye, Sir!

822
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:41,510
Hello? Hello?

823
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,925
The network conks off
at the slightest disturbance.

824
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,050
Nobody cheats the people more
than these cell phone companies.

825
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:59,835
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Sir?

826
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:01,751
Hello?

827
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:05,173
What's wrong?
Why did you stop the car?

828
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,219
Everything is bloody jinxed!

829
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:09,626
Get out of the car.

830
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,009
Get out.

831
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,255
Vakil Sir!

832
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:17,301
Get out of the car
or I'll shoot you.

833
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,377
I am getting out!

834
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,175
Listen to me.

835
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,214
Why are you doing this? For money?

836
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:25,634
I'll give you double.

837
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:26,759
Move!

838
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,422
Listen to me once.

839
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:32,386
I'll give you all the money
you want right away.

840
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,380
Your life will be made.

841
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:34,801
What's happening with me!

842
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,377
Isn't there a chance?

843
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:44,261
Vakil, what a way
to repay my loyalty!

844
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,548
Let me tell you one
thing before I die.

845
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:50,962
Don't ever be overtly
loyal to anybody in life.

846
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:53,709
It screws you.

847
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,592
Look at me.

848
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:56,876
Fifteen years...

849
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:13,835
The Hanif you hired to kill Kapil...

850
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:17,052
...eventually took the contract
to kill you.

851
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,631
What a business you guys run!

852
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:22,589
May I ask you something?

853
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,877
How did you know about this?

854
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,965
I am beginning to know
your boss a little bit.

855
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,835
He knew that if he didn't
pick you up I would have.

856
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:42,505
You would always remain a risk
to him even if he saved you.

857
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,342
When you sat in the car,

858
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:47,216
Morey recognized that
your driver was Hanif's man.

859
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:50,465
Hanif has a brick factory
here in Kharegaon.

860
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:52,969
It makes it easier
to dispose bodies.

861
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:54,671
True.

862
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:57,876
I won't leave that rascal.

863
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,467
Nor will l.

864
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,460
So tell me. Where does the kid stay?

865
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:06,048
Kid? Which kid?

866
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:07,422
Your boss.

867
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,422
He sounds like a kid on the phone.

868
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:10,800
What are you saying, Ma'am.

869
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,798
Vakil is at least
50 - 55 years old.

870
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:14,543
He is not a kid.

871
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:15,884
You scum!

872
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,127
If you waste our time again...

873
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,966
...I'll make you a eunuch
and sell you off.

874
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,840
I swear by God I am not lying.

875
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,251
If I am lying...

876
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:26,468
...then do whatever
you want to do with me.

877
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,636
Vakil got me to
Mumbai four years ago.

878
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,922
I am working with him since then.

879
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:33,671
Keep talking.

880
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,130
I know Vakil very well.

881
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,501
He stays in Delhi.

882
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:37,213
Hello?

883
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,840
Damn! Katyal escaped.

884
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:40,884
How?

885
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:42,885
Hanif's man was found dead.

886
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:44,842
How did he die?

887
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,134
He was shot.

888
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:47,043
Where?

889
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:50,836
<i>Te“ me, where was Han“ shot'?</i>

890
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:52,918
On the body.

891
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:56,049
Where on the body?
Front? Behind? Where?

892
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,252
He was shot in the head from behind.

893
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,796
Where did they find the dead body?

894
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,217
Near Kharegaon in a brick factory.

895
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:08,419
Hang up the other phone.

896
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:11,296
Hung UP-

897
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,379
Someone saved Katyal exactly
where he was supposed to be killed.

898
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:16,925
But who saved him?

899
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:18,168
Who else?

900
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,423
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

901
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,923
It's time to send her another gift.

902
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:09,669
Congrats Ma'am.

903
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:12,961
Someone has dared to point
a finger at me for the first time.

904
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:15,210
Every time you point
a finger at me...

905
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,381
...you will get this gift from me.

906
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:20,044
Your Kid.

907
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:45,551
Hunt this guy down.
No matter what.

908
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:07,713
Hello!

909
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,423
I have left from the hotel.
I am going to office now.

910
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,380
Be calm. You are the most
dangerous when you are calm.

911
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:24,419
Me and Sinha go back a long way.

912
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,172
He was my senior in the institute.

913
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:28,135
We used to have
fun times those days.

914
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,301
He praises you very highly.

915
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:34,751
He is my teacher and guide
otherwise I behave like a wild bull.

916
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:37,461
You know what.
Good officers like you...

917
00:59:37,792 --> 00:59:39,294
- May I?
- Yes, come in.

918
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,968
- Sir...
- Take a seat.

919
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:46,590
Meet Sub-Inspector
Balvinder Singh Sodhi.

920
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:47,918
A very efficient officer.

921
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:49,168
Shivani Roy.

922
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:51,636
- Ma'am... - Senior Inspector,
Mumbai Crime Branch.

923
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:54,585
She has come with information
on a huge child...

924
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:56,920
...and drug trafficking
syndicate in Delhi.

925
00:59:57,583 --> 01:00:01,008
You guys have my full support
to go the whole yard on this, okay?

926
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:01,921
Thank you, Sir.

927
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,465
- Where are we going?
- To meet my source.

928
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:06,298
Your source? Here?

929
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:09,257
I have got him here
with Sinha Sir's help.

930
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:10,964
- Mind if we take my motorcycle?
- Sure.

931
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,468
Ditto! This is exactly how he looks.

932
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:16,628
The same curls, light eyes.
He is the one.

933
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,468
The whole world knows him as Vakil.

934
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,502
But nobody knows his real name.

935
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:23,877
He sometimes deals
as Devinder Pasricha.

936
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:26,085
Or opens an office
in the name of Aakash Pandey.

937
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,504
But he keeps no name
or office for more than six months.

938
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:33,417
We haven't heard of him ever.

939
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:35,502
He takes pride in that.

940
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:37,676
He always boasts that
he will never get arrested.

941
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,630
Isn't there a way of reaching him?

942
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:41,214
Of course there is.

943
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:43,840
One is drugs and the other is girls.

944
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,344
And that too because
he is getting senile with age.

945
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,128
We can't go posing
as customers for girls.

946
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,753
He will be expecting me
to do something like this.

947
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:55,044
We'll have to play him
in such a way...

948
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,719
...that lures him to us
instead of us approaching him.

949
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:02,842
Usually drug suppliers
deal only in one kind of drug...

950
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,211
...but he deals
in all kinds of drugs.

951
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:07,590
If he has his way he'll sell
cough syrup as drugs.

952
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:08,842
He is that greedy.

953
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:10,760
As far as I know, Sodhi...

954
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,423
...South American drug
is hard to get, right?

955
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,631
Right. And even if you get it,
its very expensive.

956
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:19,881
That means a higher profit margin.

957
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:23,590
He will do anything for business.

958
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,300
If we can get this news to Vakil
that we are not buyers...

959
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:32,175
...but suppliers of such high-end
cocaine, he's bound to approach us.

960
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:35,219
Bob. There's a guy called Bob.

961
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:38,716
If he comes to know
then it is sure to reach Vakil.

962
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,424
But our drug supplier
should look genuine.

963
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,259
Why should we do it?

964
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,420
Because it's a question
of somebody's life Mbangwa.

965
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:57,551
But it's a matter of our life too.

966
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:58,959
And what if we get killed?

967
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:00,551
Who will kill you?

968
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:02,590
We are here to protect you. Relax.

969
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:04,543
Stupid policeman.

970
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:07,209
No.

971
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,547
Listen to me Mboso.

972
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,378
Don't forget
you don't have any passport.

973
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:17,381
So either I will make
papers to deport you back...

974
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,381
...or I will arrange
for your stay in Tihar Jail.

975
01:02:19,542 --> 01:02:21,294
You decide.

976
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,422
- Where's Bob?
- What?

977
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:40,341
- Where Bob? Bob?
- Bob? Down there.

978
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:41,088
Okay.

979
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:46,918
Hail Almighty!

980
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:50,010
Mindblowing stuff!

981
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:52,175
V973! 990d, Very good.

982
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:54,090
<i>'</i> Hey, Bob!
<i>'</i> Baby!

983
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:57,092
- Having fun?
- Yeah!

984
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,134
<i>Go BMW!'-!</i>

985
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:03,089
So, big guy, how much do you have?

986
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:04,379
Five.

987
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,922
Five what?

988
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:07,300
Five kilos.

989
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,130
Are you crazy?

990
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:13,008
I want 100 grams only.

991
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:17,841
Hey listen.
It's either full or nothing.

992
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:18,918
Let's go.

993
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,844
Listen, come here.

994
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:29,292
I will tell you one thing. I have
one customer who will take it all.

995
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:31,468
The whole material. Okay?

996
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,381
How much longer? Please hurry.

997
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:38,756
What should I tell Bob?

998
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:41,009
Who's Bob?

999
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:43,961
Our Bob. Bobby Kukreja.

1000
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,380
He met those Nigerians.

1001
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,006
- How much is he demanding?
- 50 lakhs.

1002
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:54,260
Give me some onions.

1003
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:57,173
The material will be
good if Bob has checked it.

1004
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,052
Besides the cricket season
is beginning from next month.

1005
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:03,468
How much longer?

1006
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,092
It's been a long time now.

1007
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:14,376
Tell all our people that
if someone demands girls...

1008
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:18,922
...especially young girls,
then don't entertain.

1009
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:22,586
Our cop chick will surely
send someone as a customer.

1010
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:24,884
Not to take any new customers?

1011
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,051
I said no.

1012
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:29,301
This is the limit now!
How much longer?

1013
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:32,177
Taste from my plate
if you are in such a rush.

1014
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,501
What else to say!

1015
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:39,666
Call the Nigerian.
But in our manner.

1016
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,168
Yeah, Bob.

1017
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:47,636
The call has come. I am leaving.

1018
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,175
Okay.

1019
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:55,386
Mathur, I'll wait at Babur Road.

1020
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,468
Tell me the position
of Mboso's car later.

1021
01:04:58,042 --> 01:04:58,793
Let's go.

1022
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:16,295
- Auto!
- Lajpat Nagar, please.

1023
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:19,458
Ma'am, what are you doing?
We called for it first.

1024
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:21,385
Shut up! Or I'll call the police.

1025
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,377
Ma'am we are the police.

1026
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:25,215
We are going to raid a place.
Want to come along?

1027
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,626
Ma'am, let's go.

1028
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:28,004
Sit. Quick.

1029
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,051
I am leaving. Have patience.
Let me take my bag.

1030
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:32,381
The cops are riding autos
these days.

1031
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:33,754
- Please hurry.
- Auto!

1032
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,211
- Tell Sodhi Mboso's location.
- Right away Ma'am.

1033
01:05:52,917 --> 01:05:54,794
We have got a biker
who's asking us to follow.

1034
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:55,838
Follow him.

1035
01:05:56,542 --> 01:06:00,547
Sodhi, a biker is guiding Mboso.
Be alert.

1036
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:49,009
Sodhi, stop.

1037
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:51,715
Stop following Mboso.
They are watching.

1038
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,510
Come, Sodhi. They have left.

1039
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:05,589
- Mathur...
- Yes, Ma'am.

1040
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,923
Track the car on
GPS and let me know.

1041
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:09,418
- Okay?
- Right, Ma'am.

1042
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,084
Go.

1043
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:22,794
Yes, Mathur.

1044
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:24,880
Sodhi, take a left.

1045
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,253
Vakil sir, is everything fine?
Should I come up?

1046
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,969
All okay. You can come up.

1047
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:34,713
Okay.

1048
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:41,636
Sodhi, Stop. That's Mboso's car.

1049
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,296
The cops are here.

1050
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:17,843
Get out from the back door.

1051
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:21,545
Sodhi, there'll be a back door.

1052
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:22,751
Cover from there.

1053
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,502
Bloody swine! You got the cops!

1054
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,593
Ratan, they'll come
up if they hear a gun shot.

1055
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,085
You leave from the back door.

1056
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,718
Vakil Sir, leave!
The cops have surrounded us.

1057
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,301
You've deceived Vakil!

1058
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:07,090
Leave, Vakil Sir.
Hurry! The police is here.

1059
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:09,965
Leave from the back door. Hurry!

1060
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,047
Ratan, you escape from the roof.

1061
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:21,547
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

1062
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:22,251
Okay.

1063
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:31,501
Break it.

1064
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:37,217
Yes, Vakil Sir?
Are you out of there?

1065
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:42,505
Come, you...

1066
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:45,009
You conned us!

1067
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,047
In the Nehru Place office...

1068
01:09:56,125 --> 01:10:00,380
...there's a black diary
beneath my chair.

1069
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:02,377
It has the numbers and
addresses of our clients.

1070
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,594
Keep that carefully.

1071
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:09,419
I don't have time.

1072
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:15,550
If they arrest me they'll reach you.

1073
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:18,294
And I won't ever let that happen.

1074
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,626
What are you talking about,
Vakil Sir?

1075
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:23,461
We'll get you out somehow.
You just leave now.

1076
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:27,508
Okay, Tiger. I got to go. Bye.

1077
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:29,502
Hello? Vakil Sir?

1078
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:33,421
Vakil Sir?

1079
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:54,377
Move, move. Sodhi.

1080
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:21,800
Damn!

1081
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,173
You piece of trash!

1082
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:33,794
- Hello?
- Good morning, Ma'am.

1083
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:35,918
Did you sleep well?

1084
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:39,632
You are up so early?
Do you work in a call centre?

1085
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:41,168
What to do Ma'am!

1086
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:44,469
I couldn't sleep wondering
how to kill you.

1087
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,928
So have you decided
how you'll kill me?

1088
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:52,542
I won't kill you.
You will kill yourself.

1089
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:56,427
I am just going to
lie back and watch you.

1090
01:12:57,667 --> 01:13:00,841
Wow! That's some style you got kid!

1091
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:02,959
Are you done wishing good morning...

1092
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:04,419
...or is there anything
else you want to say?

1093
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,175
What is there to say?

1094
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:11,002
Now, I will show you what I can do.

1095
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:15,219
You are sharp I must admit.

1096
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:18,176
You killed Vakil Sir...

1097
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:21,794
...hid your family safely.

1098
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:25,511
But now you can't harm me anymore.

1099
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:27,884
Because I am still alive.

1100
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,968
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1101
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:33,460
But you are in my territory.

1102
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:36,547
Beware.

1103
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:51,045
Don't chew. Swallow!

1104
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,211
Hey, Bengalan!
Don't you want to go to London?

1105
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:56,085
You just have to eat this pellet.

1106
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,002
Even the grapes are here.

1107
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,965
Will you practice with grapes?

1108
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:02,301
- I won't.
- What do you mean, I won't?

1109
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,172
You better!

1110
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:05,209
Open your mouth.

1111
01:14:05,292 --> 01:14:06,885
Give me some other work.

1112
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,049
Enough of your nonsense.
Eat or I'll slap you!

1113
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:13,420
Mattu is here.
Open your mouth and swallow it.

1114
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:16,170
- Stop your drama.
- Why don't you ask her to swallow?

1115
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:18,427
She got Ratan and Sunny arrested.

1116
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,093
Rest of our men are hiding, right?

1117
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:21,384
Yes, they are.

1118
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:22,710
You worry too much.

1119
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,210
By the way when are you
sending me to Mumbai?

1120
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:25,760
I'll take care of our set up there.

1121
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:28,461
Forget Mumbai.
What's the report here?

1122
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:31,799
6 girls are leaving for London
and 3 for Texas.

1123
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:34,674
Their domestic help visas
and documents are ready.

1124
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:36,880
Last time on the way
to the airport...

1125
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:38,881
...a pellet burst
in one girl's stomach.

1126
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:39,963
Remember?

1127
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:41,919
Is anyone else
going to die this time?

1128
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,094
No. This time Alka
has taken all precautions.

1129
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:45,794
- Right, Alka?
- Yes, Sir.

1130
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:47,794
This time I have used
the safest coatings.

1131
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:49,551
The pellets won't burst.

1132
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,047
Chill. Everything is under control.

1133
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:51,884
Yes.

1134
01:14:51,908 --> 01:15:04,624
<font color=White>♪ A  <font color=Red>K<font color=Yellow>H<font color=Green>o<font color=Cyan>m<font color=DarkOrange>e<font color=Magenta>n<font color=Green>y<font color=White>007 - <font color=#996666>T<font color=#66ff00>U<font color=#ffff66>T <font color=White>Presentation ♪

1135
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:55,629
Keep the No. 1 and 2 categories.
Get rid of the rest.

1136
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,172
We must have only
the best in the party.

1137
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,418
- Alka.
- Yes.

1138
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:00,385
Have you sent our man
to the police headquarters?

1139
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:03,045
Yes. He's been waiting
since the morning.

1140
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,676
She will definitely go there.

1141
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,048
You don't worry.
Dinesh will handle her.

1142
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:10,298
That girl with dengue...
do something about her.

1143
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:14,551
Angelina, baby...

1144
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:17,176
...what's wrong with you?

1145
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:18,925
- Nothing...
- Nothing!

1146
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:21,173
She hasn't slept well last night.

1147
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:23,711
Is your name Julia or Angelina?

1148
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:25,834
Julia...

1149
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:28,295
Then let me talk to Angelina.

1150
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,469
Look at your condition.
Why don't you do something about it?

1151
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:35,627
I am just tired...

1152
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:38,718
Tired, huh?

1153
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,379
That's why you have this
strip of cloth on your forehead.

1154
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:44,839
I understand.

1155
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:47,465
Come on.
I'll take you to the doctor.

1156
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:50,465
Dr. Brad Pitter for Angelina.

1157
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:51,509
No, no, no...

1158
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:53,881
Let it be, Mattu.
I'll take care of her. Let her go.

1159
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:57,383
No, Alka.
The doctor is waiting. Hurry.

1160
01:15:59,042 --> 01:16:02,546
Please let her stay. Please.

1161
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:05,676
- Come on.
- I am alright.

1162
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,968
- Alka!
- Coming. Come...

1163
01:16:14,167 --> 01:16:17,751
No! Please let her stay. Please.

1164
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:21,676
- Hurry.
- Yes.

1165
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,175
Runa...

1166
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,796
Runa...

1167
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:32,384
Get her quickly!

1168
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:35,797
Runa... No! Runa!

1169
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:37,001
Take her away. Come on!

1170
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:38,171
Runa!

1171
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:41,381
Please don't take her. Please stop!

1172
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:55,093
Shivani, don't stretch
this case too much.

1173
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:58,045
We have got the man
we were looking for.

1174
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:59,464
But we didn't, Sir!

1175
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:01,965
The mastermind of this
syndicate is still roaming free!

1176
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:05,128
This is what you think, Shivani.
We don't know that for sure.

1177
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:08,466
I know that for sure, Sir.
I have spoken to him myself.

1178
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,134
And not just drugs...

1179
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,835
...but he also is the kingpin
of sex trafficking.

1180
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:15,757
Shivani, trafficking is
altogether a different matter.

1181
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:19,171
We have a trafficking
department to investigate that.

1182
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:20,592
Department?

1183
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:25,834
There's a department to lodge
an FIR in every police station, Sir.

1184
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,003
In spite of that why is just one out
of every twenty complaint registered?

1185
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:31,756
Sir, you don't need
the law to do something.

1186
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:33,009
You need intent.

1187
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:36,254
And you are determined to find
that girl all by yourself, right?

1188
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,878
She has a name too. Pyaari.

1189
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:45,590
All these girls who need our
help just end up being 'that girl'.

1190
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,673
No name, no ties.

1191
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:52,760
It's very easy to give up on them.

1192
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:55,966
You know what, Shivani. You
are being unnecessarily emotional.

1193
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:58,886
So one should get emotional
only after girls are raped?

1194
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:03,175
What's the point of holding a candle
march after everything's over?

1195
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:07,136
After all these days, I don't know
what state I'll find Pyaari in.

1196
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:10,717
I don't even know if I'll ever
find her. Or if she'll be alive.

1197
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,422
But that doesn't mean that...

1198
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:16,213
...I forget about all these
girls like the rest of us.

1199
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,381
And that too after
being a police officer.

1200
01:18:19,792 --> 01:18:20,759
You know what, Sir...

1201
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:24,917
The day our police force gets
emotional and works for these girls,

1202
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,594
...nobody will dare
to harm them.

1203
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:28,509
Enough, Shivani!

1204
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:31,969
I agree that we have
arrested a drug dealer...

1205
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,469
...and drugs worth lakhs
because of you.

1206
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:37,427
But now allow us
to take over from here.

1207
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:38,714
Is that clear?

1208
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:40,047
Sir, why us all the time?

1209
01:18:40,167 --> 01:18:42,545
Shivani, please don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

1210
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:44,464
I will see you soon in Mumbai.

1211
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:45,376
Thank you, Sir.

1212
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,173
- Since when do you drive an auto?
- What, Ma'am?

1213
01:19:29,417 --> 01:19:31,761
I asked since when do you
drive an auto.

1214
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:33,585
Past four or five years.

1215
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:36,381
- Can you see that guy there?
- Where?

1216
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:38,761
- There, the white building.
- Where Ma'am?

1217
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,419
She escaped!

1218
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:36,300
Hello?

1219
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,631
Hello, I wanted to discuss an idea.

1220
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,422
About what, Miss Shivani?
The case is shut.

1221
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,798
- Hear me out.
- Okay.

1222
01:20:43,292 --> 01:20:46,421
We share the smallest
details of our life...

1223
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,720
...with our girlfriend
boyfriend or spouse, right?

1224
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:51,960
Yes, it's a natural human tendency.

1225
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:52,713
Correct!

1226
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:54,214
So Vakil will also
have someone like this.

1227
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:56,218
Nobody came to claim his body.

1228
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:57,925
Because of fear of interrogation.

1229
01:20:58,292 --> 01:20:59,965
Tell me what's your point.

1230
01:21:01,292 --> 01:21:02,885
Vakil must surely have someone.

1231
01:21:03,167 --> 01:21:04,384
Maybe not a wife. But someone.

1232
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,753
She will surely know
whom Vakil worked for.

1233
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,301
It seems possible.
But how will we find her?

1234
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,128
Whatever you found
on Vakil's body...

1235
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:16,670
...gun, pant, shirt,
wallet, anything.

1236
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:17,634
Get everything.

1237
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:20,589
We'll definitely find a clue.

1238
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,502
But Miss Shivani this is evidence.

1239
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,085
How can get it out of office?

1240
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:26,795
Sodhi, you said you would help.

1241
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:29,260
You will get me
in trouble Miss Shivani.

1242
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:33,087
I was so worried getting
these things out of office.

1243
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,757
Honestly whatever
we are doing is illegal.

1244
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:38,925
Always by the book.

1245
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:43,383
How will you arrest criminals
if you keep working by the law?

1246
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:47,382
On a serious note, Ma'am, I can't
get involved in this any further.

1247
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:51,087
I understand.
But what if we find something?

1248
01:21:51,292 --> 01:21:52,259
Please, Ma'am.

1249
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:55,636
Okay, okay. We'll cross
the bridge when we get there.

1250
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:58,461
What bridge? There's nothing here!

1251
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:08,173
Modern Tailors, Chandani Chowk.

1252
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:11,050
That's surprising.

1253
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:14,052
In an era of readymade,
this guy wore stitched clothes!

1254
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:15,547
Classic old school.

1255
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,083
Someone who stitches his trousers
and shirt form the same tailor...

1256
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:21,465
...is most likely to get
all his clothes stitched from him.

1257
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:23,294
Where is Modern Tailors?

1258
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:24,877
- Modern Tailors... Liyaqat Ali?
- Yes.

1259
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,552
Go straight and take a right.
First floor.

1260
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,252
- From here?
- Yes.

1261
01:22:29,792 --> 01:22:31,044
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1262
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,755
I am a social worker.
I am attached with AIIMS.

1263
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:40,959
I wanted to enquire about Mr. Vakil.

1264
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:44,220
I know him for the past 23 years.

1265
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:47,879
Was this an accident
or some police case?

1266
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:49,922
I don't know that.

1267
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:53,296
My job is to find out
if he has any relatives.

1268
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:57,751
I don't know of any relatives.

1269
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,094
But there is a lady with
whom he was acquainted with...

1270
01:23:01,167 --> 01:23:02,669
...for the past many years.

1271
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:08,925
Minu Rastogi.
She was a prostitute in Paharganj.

1272
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:13,382
Mr. Vakil's acquaintance
with her was still strong.

1273
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:16,836
Then she should
know about his death.

1274
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:17,959
Where does she stay?

1275
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:21,796
- Where is D-40?
- The second house.

1276
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:25,376
Yes?

1277
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:26,675
Is Minu Rastogi here?

1278
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:27,793
Who are you?

1279
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:30,548
Mumbai Police.
I want to speak with her.

1280
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:31,754
Please come in.

1281
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:34,210
- Hello!
- Hello! Please have a seat.

1282
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:36,209
Harish...

1283
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:38,169
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Come here.

1284
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:45,800
Get this medicine.

1285
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:48,254
Yes, Ma'am.

1286
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:49,926
Please sit.

1287
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:53,426
- Sugar?
- One spoon.

1288
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,501
I have diabetes.

1289
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,844
My doctor has completely
banned sugar for me.

1290
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:02,005
You are young.

1291
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:05,834
- Here...
- Thank you.

1292
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:11,926
How did Mr. Vakil's
fame reach the Mumbai police?

1293
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,546
It's a long story.

1294
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:17,795
I have a lot of time.

1295
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,593
- Got the medicine?
- No, Ma'am.

1296
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:23,926
- Did you look properly?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1297
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,924
If I find it later,
you know I'll shoot you, right?

1298
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:27,675
Yes.

1299
01:24:27,917 --> 01:24:30,386
I keep my servants on a tight leash.

1300
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,005
Go do your work.

1301
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:40,301
Actually...

1302
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:43,927
I hadn't sent Harish
to get medicine.

1303
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:48,295
I had sent him to see
if there are cops outside.

1304
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:50,718
No, no, I have come alone.

1305
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:58,962
O God, strange are your ways!

1306
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:03,716
The person my son is looking
for in the whole city...

1307
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:06,966
...is sitting right here in his
own house. And that too all alone!

1308
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:16,168
That boy who calls you,
is my son. Karan.

1309
01:25:18,542 --> 01:25:20,294
What do you call him?

1310
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:24,379
The kid.

1311
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:27,589
This is his house.

1312
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,214
What's happening to you?

1313
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:32,834
Feeling dizzy?

1314
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,550
Oh yeah... I put
sedatives in your tea.

1315
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,799
Now you won't be capable
of doing anything.

1316
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:49,459
And my Karan will
be back in some time.

1317
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:54,260
You killed Vakil, right!

1318
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:59,378
My Karan will torture you to death.

1319
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:03,842
What fun it'll be!

1320
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:19,011
Hello, Ma'am! How are you?

1321
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:25,379
Hey...

1322
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,168
I am Walt.

1323
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:34,301
Actually my name is Karan.

1324
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:37,420
But I have changed it to Walt.

1325
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:42,753
It's the name of the
hero in an English show.

1326
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:46,093
So you did keep your promise.

1327
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:49,170
You found me on the 27th day.

1328
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:51,969
That's amazing.

1329
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:55,839
Congratulations!

1330
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:59,503
I will keep my promise too.
I won't kill you.

1331
01:27:01,542 --> 01:27:03,135
I'll just bring you to a state...

1332
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:05,552
...where you'll beg me
to kill you.

1333
01:27:08,167 --> 01:27:09,168
<i>You'.!</i>

1334
01:27:29,292 --> 01:27:31,215
Mom, what's for lunch?

1335
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,169
Are all the girls ready?

1336
01:27:37,542 --> 01:27:40,295
Alka, you are on what's app again!

1337
01:27:40,667 --> 01:27:41,964
- Sorry, Ma'am.
- They will be here soon.

1338
01:27:42,042 --> 01:27:43,794
I'll get them ready
in just five minutes.

1339
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:48,842
How many times have I told you
that don't doll them up like kids?

1340
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:53,175
Those rascals should see
their lovers in them not daughters.

1341
01:27:53,583 --> 01:27:55,381
Honey, please. Thank you.

1342
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:56,293
Open your mouth...

That's good.

1346
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:10,461
And don't behave like a fool there.

1347
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:12,214
Be sexy!

1348

Good girl!

1349
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:15,460
Did you get what Ma'am is saying?

1350
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,419
No, no, don't tie her hair.

1351
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:21,132
Remove the pins. Quick. Quick.

1352
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,376
Thank you.

1353
01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:24,425
Look at that.

1354
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:29,920
Aren't you looking ravishing now!

1355
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,425
- Go put on your shoes.
- Be careful.

1356
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,878
- And put on a smile.
- Keep it down.

1357
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:35,380
- Did you get that woman!
- Yes.

1358
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:36,584
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Very good.

1359
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:37,919
She's very strong.

1360
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:40,465
- Look how she's still fighting.
- Wait!

1361
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,172
Who is she?

1362
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:44,834
I don't know.

1363
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:48,177
- Wait!
- Get back to work everybody!

1364
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:51,677
Is everyone ready?
Alka, anyone left?

1365
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,297
No, Ma'am, all are ready.

1366
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,048
Should I take them downstairs?

1367
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:57,127
No, no! I am going
to perform here now.

1368
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,380
Everybody please wait and watch.

1369
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:01,177
Come on. Get out and be ready.

1370
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:03,048
- Off you go! Come on!
- Yes, go on.

1371
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:04,593
Come on. You foreigner, come on.

1372
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:05,754
Get out.

1373
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:09,628
- Look at her desperate attempts!
- Let her try!

1374
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:11,005
She's not asking you.

1375
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:14,552
Julia, there's no movie
being shown here.

1376
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:16,376
Go.

1377
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:18,175
Go, or else I'll slap you! Go!

1378
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:18,879
Go!

1379
01:29:21,542 --> 01:29:24,512
We still have to deck her up.
Get her out of the sack.

1380
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:25,630
- Open it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1381
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:31,292
Ma'am, please co-operate.
Why are you fighting so much?

1382
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,632
Hang on, hang on. There, it's open.

1383
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:38,087
Hold it Madam. Cool down.

I have been doing this since
before you were even born!

I know exactly how to
tame the likes of you!

1388

Just untie my hands and see...

...you won't have a tongue
left to speak or eyes to see!

Hit her!
There's no use talking to her!

01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:29,876
But when one guy sets up
a small organized business...

1438
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:31,547
...and everyone gets upset!

1439
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:35,631
Why did you do all of this?

1440
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:37,714
What did you get?

1441
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,253
You women get personal too soon.

1442
01:32:46,542 --> 01:32:49,842
I agree that you are a cop,
from the crime branch.

1443
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,378
But to obsessively chase
just one criminal?

1444
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,426
What kind of professionalism
is this?

1445
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:56,800
Where did you learn this?

1446
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,842
Nonsense.

1447
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:07,296
That's why we men climb on top and
you women just stare at the ceiling.

1448
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,378
You know what I am saying,
Miss Shivani?

1449
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:15,130
The night is young.

1450
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:18,128
Stare at the ceiling
and scream your lungs out.

1451
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,005
Scream?

1452
01:33:25,708 --> 01:33:26,379
Scream.

1453
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:38,175
That's right.

1454
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:41,043
There's no point.

1455
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,297
Crime branch!

1456
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:00,001
Sir has come.

1457
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,594
Good evening, Sir. This is Mattu!

1458
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:08,959
- Welcome, Sir!
- God bless you.

1459
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:10,214
- How are you?
- All good.

1460
01:34:10,292 --> 01:34:12,044
Everything's ready for you.

1461
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:15,634
Welcome, Sir!

1462
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,048
- All well?
- With your blessings.

1463
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:19,544
- Please come, Sir.
- Tandon...

1464
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:20,800
Wait here.

1465
01:34:26,042 --> 01:34:26,759
Come, Sir.

1466
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,084
Come, Sir.

1467
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:31,548
Tandon, have you checked
everything personally?

1468
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:32,509
Yes, Sir.

1469
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,881
You are bound to be happy
with the arrangements.

1470
01:34:37,417 --> 01:34:38,418
Come, Sir.

1471
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,172
- Everything's ready.
- This way, Sir.

1472
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:43,467
Sir, to your left.

1473
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,585
The arrangements look great.

1474
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,049
Yes. You are the one who gave
us the opportunity to serve you.

1475
01:34:57,375 --> 01:34:59,753
There's a special gift
for you in the suite upstairs.

1476
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,673
You should check it
out if you are in the mood.

1477
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:03,214
Everybody knows.

1478
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:05,719
Be it the opposition or women...

1479
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,423
...I am always in a mood to crush!

1480
01:35:09,542 --> 01:35:13,046
Spoken like a true leader!
Brilliant, brilliant, I say!

1481
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:23,588
Hello!

1482
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:27,252
I have heard a lot about you.

1483
01:35:29,917 --> 01:35:30,509
You?

1484
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:33,761
Yes, I am who you think I am.

1485
01:35:35,292 --> 01:35:37,511
Everybody has their own hobbies.

1486
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:39,589
I am sure even you do.

1487
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:41,509
My hobby is this.

1488
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:44,760
Have you really come to rape me?

1489
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:47,716
I don't know how
one pretends to rape.

1490
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:51,421
You fight with all your strength.
Only then it'll be fun.

1491
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:11,259
You want to rape me!

1492
01:36:13,292 --> 01:36:15,545
Get up! Come on!

1493
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:20,880
Stop this party!

1494
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:22,464
Get out!

1495
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:23,714
What is happening?

1496
01:36:24,042 --> 01:36:25,760
Walt, where the hell are you?

1497
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:27,084
- Get out!
- What is going on, Mattu!

1498
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,718
Where did she come from!

1499
01:36:29,167 --> 01:36:30,168
She has lost it!

1500
01:36:32,792 --> 01:36:36,376
Karan Rastogi, do you want
this minister alive or not?

1501
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,630
<i>Tandon! Do something, Tandem!</i>

1502
01:36:38,708 --> 01:36:39,425
Mattu, wait!

1503
01:36:40,042 --> 01:36:41,965
Karan, if anything happens to Sir...

1504
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:44,670
...you and your mom
will die a miserable death.

1505
01:36:45,083 --> 01:36:46,835
One second, Ma'am. What do you want?

1506
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:49,798
I want all the girls out.

1507
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:52,252
What are you staring at, Alka?
Send all the girls out.

1508
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,296
- Girls, go out.
- Come on!

1509
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,376
Mattu, are you dead!

1510
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:57,169
Come on, Julia.
Angie, baby, hurry up. Scarlett, go.

1511
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:58,001
Hurry UP!

1512
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,047
Fast

1513
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:00,634
Fast, girls! Fast!

1514
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,876
Hurry up, Alka.

1515
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:03,922
- Pyaari, wait.
- Aunty.

1516
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:05,626
- Mattu!
- Yes?

1517
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,760
Give the key of the
mobile locker to Pyaari.

1518
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:09,130
Give her the damn key.

1519
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,422
You got the girls.

1520
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:15,592
What else do you want?

1521
01:37:16,083 --> 01:37:16,709
You.

1522
01:37:17,292 --> 01:37:18,214
You will come with me.

1523
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,752
Chill, Ma'am.
Chill. Chill, it's okay.

1524
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:25,585
- Step back. Step back.
- Help!

1525
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:28,427
- Help!
- Raise your hands.

1526
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:33,417
Tell them that no one moves
from here till you get back.

1527
01:37:33,667 --> 01:37:35,635
Nobody moves from here.
Tandon, keep him in check.

1528
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:36,383
You wait.

1529
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:38,881
Everybody, we have got
a bit of a situation.

1530
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,297
I am going to sort
it out and be right back.

1531
01:37:40,708 --> 01:37:42,176
Raise your hands! Move!

1532
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:43,921
Move!

1533
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:45,918
Come on.

1534
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:50,252
Move quickly! Look ahead.

1535
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:56,093
Damn! She has locked the door!

1536
01:37:57,042 --> 01:37:57,759
Come on quickly.

1537
01:37:57,833 --> 01:37:59,676
Aunty, but the exit
is this side.

1538
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,922
We are not going out.

1539
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:02,171
Open it!

1540
01:38:06,417 --> 01:38:08,511
Open! Get in.

1541
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:11,511
Come on, girls. Get in.

1542
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:14,584
Be there.

1543
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:18,050
Pyaari, close the door.

1544
01:38:19,667 --> 01:38:21,761
Lock the door. Lock it!

1545
01:38:32,917 --> 01:38:34,214
- Okay, okay.
- Get in!

1546
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:35,418
Get in!

1547
01:38:37,917 --> 01:38:40,716
Not bad, Ma'am. Not bad at all.

1548
01:38:41,167 --> 01:38:44,171
You guys think we cops
are morons, right?

1549
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,217
But how did you manage to do this?

1550
01:38:48,292 --> 01:38:51,136
When I got the address
to your place...

1551
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:53,673
...I had no clue
that it is your house.

1552
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,675
- Where is D-40?
- Second from the front.

1553
01:38:57,958 --> 01:39:00,381
In crime branch we are trained to...

1554
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:04,755
...carefully scan a place
before entering.

1555
01:39:05,167 --> 01:39:08,546
- Does Minu Rastogi stay here?
- Yes, she does.

1556
01:39:10,542 --> 01:39:11,714
Who else stays with her?

1557
01:39:11,917 --> 01:39:13,919
Her son and a servant.

1558
01:39:14,542 --> 01:39:15,509
How old is the son?

1559
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,127
Around 25-26.

1560
01:39:17,292 --> 01:39:21,172
I was wondering what to do next
when I heard a sound.

1561
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:26,170
Maybe God was trying
to tell me something.

1562
01:39:26,792 --> 01:39:29,796
I had heard this Azaan before.

1563
01:39:30,208 --> 01:39:31,130
But where?

1564
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:33,169
Then I remembered.

1565
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:35,585
But you can't do any harm to me.

1566
01:39:36,292 --> 01:39:37,168
Because I am still alive.

1567
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:38,968
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1568
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:45,678
That is the first time I wondered
if you are Minu Rastogi's son.

1569
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:49,048
But then who will take
a risk with you?

1570
01:39:49,375 --> 01:39:52,254
I began watching your house.

1571
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:54,169
I spotted you the next day.

1572
01:39:54,792 --> 01:39:56,044
Although, I hadn't seen you before.

1573
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:00,298
But one look at your sly face...

1574
01:40:00,792 --> 01:40:01,759
...and I knew it had to be you.

1575
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:05,421
The first thing I did was
put a GPS tracker in your car.

1576
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:10,136
48 hours went by...

1577
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:17,216
...you didn't go to any
of your hostels or warehouses.

1578
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,252
I wanted to reach Pyaari...

1579
01:40:19,542 --> 01:40:21,135
...and also the other girls.

1580
01:40:22,167 --> 01:40:25,216
Even if we did arrest you,
what could we charge you with?

1581
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:28,802
That's when I decided that
there's no point wasting time.

1582
01:40:29,083 --> 01:40:30,801
Now you yourself
will take me to Pyaari.

1583
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:35,008
I entered your house
but I was fully prepared.

1584
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:37,552
I just had to make the move
at the right time.

1585
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:46,093
Now I just need to inform Sodhi.

1586
01:40:46,417 --> 01:40:49,591
He'll track us on the GPS
and come here with the police unit.

1587
01:40:50,875 --> 01:40:52,843
Pyaari, get the phone.

1588
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,877
And what if I would have
killed you right then?

1589
01:40:57,708 --> 01:40:59,506
I had to take that risk.

1590
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:03,924
Like I said,
I knew your type.

1591
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:06,544
You wouldn't kill
me that easily.

1592
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,719
You would want to exploit me
like other women.

1593
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:13,927
I must give it to you. But what now?

1594
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:16,006
Sodhi, come.

1595
01:41:17,792 --> 01:41:21,251
The police will take at
least 25 minutes to get here.

1596
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:24,552
Your freedom lies behind that door.

1597
01:41:25,292 --> 01:41:28,842
And I am standing in
between you and your freedom.

1598
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:32,131
Kill me and claim your freedom.

1599
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:36,885
<i>Women... women...</i>

1600
01:41:38,583 --> 01:41:40,756
Take everything personally, right?

1601
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:42,418
Come on.

1602
01:41:43,375 --> 01:41:48,051
Let me see how far
on top a man can climb.

1603
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:49,842
As you wish.

1604
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:12,591
<i>Aunt“!</i>

1605
01:42:22,792 --> 01:42:24,089
Get up! Get up!

1606
01:43:01,167 --> 01:43:04,171
Hit me, Ma'am.
How much will you hit me?

1607
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:12,384
You will me hit me a little
and then arrest me, right?

1608
01:43:15,167 --> 01:43:17,215
You are forgetting one thing, Ma'am.

1609
01:43:19,292 --> 01:43:20,418
This is India.

1610
01:43:23,042 --> 01:43:25,886
Over here,
if you have the right contacts...

1611
01:43:26,125 --> 01:43:29,379
...the biggest of scandals
can be buried.

1612
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:32,877
This is trivial in comparison.

1613
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,802
So till then you
hit me and have fun.

1614
01:43:37,833 --> 01:43:39,005
Hit me, Ma'am.

1615
01:43:40,042 --> 01:43:41,544
There is nothing else you can do.

1616
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:43,300
This is India.

1617
01:43:49,542 --> 01:43:51,670
This one thing you are right about.

1618
01:43:52,583 --> 01:43:53,550
This is India.

1619
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:55,464
'This' is what goes on here.

1620
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:04,209
These people sitting outside
will bury your crime?

1621
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:08,755
They can do it only if you
reach the police station.

1622
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:13,542
But you won't reach the police
station because this is India.

1623
01:44:13,792 --> 01:44:17,001
Here, if you don't want
to bother the court too much...

1624
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:19,261
...issues can be settled this way.

1625
01:44:22,792 --> 01:44:23,543
Get up!

1626
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:29,761
Some people call it an 'Encounter'.

1627
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:33,218
Some call it 'Teaching a lesson'.

1628
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:36,800
Get up!

1629
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:48,469
Some also call it the 'Lokpal Bill'.

1630
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:52,717
What's your plan?

1631
01:44:55,625 --> 01:44:56,797
Are you going to murder me?

1632
01:44:58,792 --> 01:45:00,419
In front of everyone?

1633
01:45:03,458 --> 01:45:04,630
This is India.

1634
01:45:05,375 --> 01:45:07,878
In India, if 50 people
take the law in their hands...

1635
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:10,802
...and kill someone, then
it's not called a murder.

1636
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:12,968
It's called 'Public outrage'.

1637
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:31,131
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1638
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:36,464
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1639
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:51,298
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1640
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:56,548
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1641
01:45:56,792 --> 01:46:01,298
Touch my heart and I promise
you will mean the world to me

1642
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,969
But if you ever mess with me

1643
01:46:04,042 --> 01:46:06,591
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1644
01:46:09,083 --> 01:46:11,882
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1645
01:46:27,083 --> 01:46:31,964
If you think being a man gives you
the right to sell me like cattle

1646
01:46:32,167 --> 01:46:36,843
I will in that same place
destroy your entire race

1647
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:41,502
Hold my hand and walk with me
and I will never leave your side

1648
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:44,336
But if you ever mess with me

1649
01:46:44,417 --> 01:46:47,045
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1650
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:52,253
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1651
01:47:07,292 --> 01:47:12,378
In a skirt or a saree, at day
or at night I will not walk afraid

1652
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:17,544
I won't lead a life
full of fear and regret

1653
01:47:22,708 --> 01:47:27,544
In a world where mothers and sisters
are not a blessing but a curse

1654
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:32,544
I will break all shackles of rules
belonging to this world

1655
01:47:32,792 --> 01:47:37,377
Change the way you look at me and
I will shield you from the evil eye

1656
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:39,920
But if you ever mess with me

1657
01:47:40,042 --> 01:47:42,841
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1658
01:47:49,292 --> 01:47:52,216
Walt died on his way
to the hospital.

1659
01:47:52,708 --> 01:47:56,167
Mattu became a prosecution witness.

1660
01:47:56,625 --> 01:47:59,925
He revealed everything about Walt,

1661
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,423
Minu and Vakil along with
Tandon's involvement to the court.

1662
01:48:04,167 --> 01:48:06,761
First, the girls made up
Minu's face.

1663
01:48:07,167 --> 01:48:08,419
And then God did.

1664
01:48:08,708 --> 01:48:10,756
Minu later suffered
a paralysis attack.

1665
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:18,049
Taneja survived
and is now in Tiharjail.

1666
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:21,959
His scarred face is an
amusement to most in the jail.

1667
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:31,175
Today, we could bring back
the smile on Pyaari's face.

1668
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:34,917
But there are many like Pyaari that
have to be rescued from this muck.

1669
01:48:35,292 --> 01:48:38,296
Many others like Karan Rastogi
who are still scot-free...

1670
01:48:38,583 --> 01:48:39,800
must be stopped.

1671
01:48:40,167 --> 01:48:42,135
The Mardaani (Fighter)
that's hidden within...

1672
01:48:42,292 --> 01:48:45,045
has to be discovered by
every woman, every girl herself.

1673
01:48:45,046 --> 01:52:05,475

1674

The war is still on.
