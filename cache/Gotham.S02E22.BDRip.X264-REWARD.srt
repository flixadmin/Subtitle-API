<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:05,215
We're onto you, Professor Strange.

3
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:07,592
<i>Bad guys come in and monsters come out.</i>

4
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:10,053
I am Firefly.

5
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,390
Selina. Hugo Strange has Selina.

6
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:17,102
Do you remember your name?

7
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:18,978
My name is Fish Mooney.

8
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:23,358
Make me a grilled cheese sandwich.

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,362
You made me a sandwich? Why?

10
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:28,530
I don't know.

11
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:30,448
And how exactly do you plan on getting
into Arkham?

12
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:31,616
I'll ask for a tour.

13
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:33,785
From the man that ordered
the assassination of your father?

14
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:34,994
<i>He'll wanna find out what we know.</i>

15
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,830
<i>And he won't see me
and Lucius as a threat.</i>

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,416
I call Bullock,
he comes busting in with a hundred cops.

17
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:40,583
Take them.

18
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:46,589
<i>Move everything you can
to the facility upstate.</i>

19
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:49,426
<i>You have an explosive device. Use it.</i>

20
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,261
<i>Destroy Indian Hill.</i>

21
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:54,639
Basil is a chameleon of sorts.
Would you like to see?

22
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:02,939
You son of a bitch!

23
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,607
I'm Jim Gordon.

24
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,528
Right. Go get our guys.

25
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:15,493
No sign of Gordon.

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,454
<i>How long do you want us to wait?</i>

27
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,663
Give him 10 seconds.

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,666
If you don't see Jim,
bust that joint open and find him.

29
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,376
<i>Ready, entry team. We go on one!</i>

30
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:25,628
- Go!
- Go!

31
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:40,268
Go. Go!

32
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:43,354
Four, three, two--

33
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,024
Stand down.

34
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:50,236
- Stand down, officers.
- Hold. Hold.

35
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:51,654
Stand down.

36
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,365
- All clear.
<i>- Stand down. Stand down.</i>

37
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:55,992
All clear?

38
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,579
Sorry to waste your time, hoss.
How about a ride to HQ?

39
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:00,872
Sure thing, Jim. You okay?

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,374
You look kinda hinky.

41
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,210
Never better.

42
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,381
<i>Strange! Strange!</i>

43
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:14,052
Strange! Strange, you son of a bitch.
Come back here!

44
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:27,023
- So, you're really doing this?
- Not my call.

45
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:30,401
Prepare the patients for transport
to the upstate facility.

46
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,237
If even one of your patients
were to escape--

47
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,906
They won't.
The police won't be delayed much longer.

48
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,407
Prepare the patients and move fast.

49
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,076
As soon as we're done
with Gordon and Wayne,

50
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:39,494
<i>we will detonate the bomb.</i>

51
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:40,662
Yes, sir.

52
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,842
<i>Uh...</i>

53
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,761
<i>Okay, quiz kids.</i>

54
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,765
<i>Who's ready to play, "Life or Death"?</i>

55
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:04,102
Sir, Mr. Nygma. You are Nygma, aren't you?

56
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,896
This is absurd. The police know
we're here, you can't kill us.

57
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,356
Are you ready to play?

58
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:12,944
Yes.

59
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,445
<i>Good.</i>

60
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:17,615
<i>You have one guess,
five minutes to talk it over.</i>

61
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:22,036
Who runs Indian Hill?

62
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:28,710
<i>Who runs Indian Hill? You have one guess.</i>

63
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,837
Think carefully, fellas.

64
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,381
<i>Answer correctly,</i>

65
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:35,633
<i>or die.</i>

66
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,012
Strange.

67
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,514
- Strange?
- Hi.

68
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,271
What is that?

69
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:50,148
Honesty serum.

70
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:54,485
- I need to know what you know.
- Wait. Wait.

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,330
So, how do you feel now?

72
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:08,625
Not good.

73
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,628
Can you be more specific?

74
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,089
I feel vulnerable.

75
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,091
Naked.

76
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,511
Your feelings are entirely
natural and normal.

77
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,556
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

78
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:28,227
You are in a helpless situation.
There is nothing you can do.

79
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:31,356
Do you understand that?

80
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,857
Yes.

81
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,694
- No.
- No?

82
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,363
What can you do?

83
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:42,992
James, what can you do?

84
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,788
- Made a plan.
- Tell me your plan.

85
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,666
If I don't check in with the GCPD by noon,

86
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,251
tell them I'm safe,

87
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,629
they'll come after you.

88
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,090
Yes.

89
00:04:57,757 --> 00:04:58,883
Yes, I know.

90
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,595
<i>You did check in with the GCPD.</i>

91
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,639
Nobody's coming.

92
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,559
You can relax.

93
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,570
Jim! Jim!

94
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,117
- Harv.
- Strange is clean?

95
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,910
What the hell happened?

96
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,079
- Dead end.
- "Dead end"?

97
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,999
What are you talking about? Dead end?

98
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,210
- He's connected.
- So is my mechanic. Who isn't?

99
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,880
- Connected to people we can't cross.
- What people?

100
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:39,882
You don't wanna know.

101
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,510
Trust me.

102
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,264
You feelin' all right?
You look like a sack of fish.

103
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,057
A little flu, maybe.

104
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,517
Oh. Keep your distance.

105
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:52,145
I'm getting laid this weekend.
Fingers crossed.

106
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,442
<i>You have 60 seconds left.</i>

107
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,236
<i>Who runs Indian Hill?</i>

108
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,366
I say, Hugo Strange.

109
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,119
Wayne Enterprises.
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill.

110
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,287
That's surmised.

111
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,247
Why would he ask that question
if the answer was obvious?

112
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:12,582
He wants to know what we know.

113
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,126
- What we think we know.
- Which is Wayne Enterprises.

114
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:17,128
Is that your answer?
Running out of time here.

115
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:18,296
Yes.

116
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,675
Correct!

117
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:26,179
<i>Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill.</i>

118
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:28,473
Bravo, Brucey.

119
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,060
<i>You're almost safe.
Just one more question.</i>

120
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,436
- You ready?
- Yes.

121
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:36,272
<i>You have five minutes, quiz kids.
Answer correctly or die.</i>

122
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:43,404
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

123
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,417
Move 'em out in order of security grades.

124
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,669
Lowest risk, first.

125
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,005
Tranq 'em, immobilize them,
and put them on the bus.

126
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,092
And do it fast, but very, very carefully.

127
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,053
Security is our number-one priority.

128
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,221
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

129
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,350
- Hey, lady.
- Busy day, busy day.

130
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,185
We'll get to you, number 13.

131
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:18,481
Your mama may be number 13,
but I'm a human being.

132
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:21,692
Fish Mooney, bitch.

133
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,491
Here,

134
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,702
you're reanimant test case number 13.

135
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,622
And I'm Ms. Peabody.

136
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,293
And you best not talk about my mama.

137
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:42,046
Ms. Peabody,

138
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:44,882
I apologize.

139
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,345
I'm a bit stressed.
I don't like being locked up.

140
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,390
It's against my nature.

141
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:54,433
I understand, I do.

142
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,896
But you are a priceless,
scientific miracle.

143
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,731
You are history.

144
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:04,402
Seclusion is regrettable but inevitable.

145
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:07,405
Look, I've been here before.

146
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:10,992
All you mad scientists
say the same kind of stuff.

147
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:12,743
I don't care.

148
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:14,912
Let me go.

149
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,668
Sorry, 13.

150
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,879
Let's go.

151
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:29,510
You're messing with the wrong woman.
You hear me? The wrong woman.

152
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,170
Here?

153
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:06,464
A little too central, maybe?

154
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,050
You don't want one piece
to overpower the room.

155
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:10,927
<i>Try over there.</i>

156
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,853
You're absolutely right.

157
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,898
See, I told you she'd be useful.
Isn't that better?

158
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,193
Interior design ain't my thing.

00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,182
Answer quickly, please, Jim,
without thinking.

167
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,976
Who did you love more,
your mother or your father?

168
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:01,644
- Mother.
- Why?

169
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,896
I resented my father's strength.

170
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:07,191
- I see, yes. And when he died...
- Yes.

171
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:08,526
...how did you feel?

172
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,194
- Guilty.
- For a car crash?

173
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,029
Why? It was not your fault.

174
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,573
I imagined he was gone and then he was.

175
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,618
- You lost a child recently.
- Yes.

176
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,495
How does that make you feel?

177
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:21,789
Guilty.

178
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,042
Guilt, again. You blame yourself?

179
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,377
It was my fault.

180
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,838
Oh, I see, I didn't know that.

181
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:30,715
And what happened to the mother?

182
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,091
Lee, was it?

183
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:35,094
She's down south somewhere.

184
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,139
- You still love her?
- Yes.

185
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:39,890
- You want to be with her?
- Yes.

186
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,267
Why aren't you with her?

187
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,353
I've put her through enough pain.

188
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:48,274
Jim, I need you to relax.

189
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,360
Close your eyes.

190
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:56,073
Imagine that I am God.

191
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,744
All powerful.

192
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,871
I am God,

193
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:06,417
and I absolve you of all of your guilt.

194
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,754
I put that guilt on you. And now...

195
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,174
I take it away.

196
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:18,429
It's gone. Your burdens are gone.

197
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,435
So, how do you feel?

198
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,563
Good. Better.

199
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:29,774
Good.

200
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:32,276
Good. Good.

201
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:35,404
Jim,

202
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,951
now that we're relaxed
and speaking honestly, tell me,

203
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,622
what do you know about
our work here at Indian Hill?

204
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:48,042
You're building monsters for military use.

205
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,544
Oh, we're doing much more than that.
But for who?

206
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,506
Who owns Indian Hill?

207
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:55,674
Wayne Enterprises.

208
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,303
And who controls Wayne Enterprises
behind the scenes?

209
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,140
Who controls everything in Gotham?

210
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,768
Behind the scenes.

211
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,311
I don't know.

212
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,400
- The rich.
- Well, they are rich, I'm sure.

213
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,485
But can you be more specific?

214
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,824
Who controls Gotham, Jim?

215
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:25,830
You've never heard of a...

216
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,459
Secret council?

217
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,254
Secret council?

218
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,090
No.

219
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,176
Excellent.

220
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,929
Excellent. Thank you.

221
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,181
That's what I needed to know.

222
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,100
Professor Strange?

223
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,019
- Yes, Jim?
<i>- What you said about Lee,</i>

224
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,814
I should've gone after her?

225
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,816
Oh, no doubt.

226
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,696
Guilt has compelled you to sacrifice
your heart to your conscience,

227
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,448
but guilt is useless.

228
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,742
Love, Jim.

229
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,455
Love is our guide.

230
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,543
Time's up, I'm afraid.

231
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,087
In the spirit of intimacy and honesty,

232
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:20,176
I have been speaking about your life
as if it had a future,

233
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,012
and that is not so.

234
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,392
You have a few hours.

235
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,606
You have 30 seconds left.

236
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,691
<i>Who runs Wayne Enterprises?</i>

237
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,943
The Devil, maybe.
Is that the deal?

238
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,111
<i>Communists? Witches?</i>

239
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,114
No, there's some trick
behind his question. Some big secret.

240
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,824
I've worked for Wayne Enterprises
for 10 years.

241
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:44,992
There is no big secret.

242
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,911
The board of directors
runs Wayne Enterprises.

243
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,204
Fifteen seconds.

244
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,830
That can't be the answer, Lucius!

245
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,751
<i>- Ten seconds.</i>
- Give us more time!

246
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,086
- Five seconds!
- The board of directors.

247
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,052
Incorrect.

248
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,763
<i>Oh, what a shame.</i>

249
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,598
The correct answer is...

250
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,855
Sorry, fellas. You lose.

251
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:17,775
<i>And what happens to losers?</i>

252
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,318
Yowza!

253
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:23,113
<i>Death by poison gas.</i>

254
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,232
Jim. Jim.

255
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,944
- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,031
Are we alive?

257
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,574
So far, so good.

258
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,160
Had to be sure. Thought we were dead.

259
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,914
Wow. That was unpleasant.

260
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:00,377
How are things going for you?
We've had a hell of a time.

261
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,795
Same.

262
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,715
- You okay?
- A little groggy.

263
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,718
He drugged me. Made me talk.

264
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,721
- About Wayne Enterprises, right?
- About everything.

265
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:12,890
Bruce,

266
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,934
I never should have made that oath to you.

267
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,228
- That's not really--
- I was arrogant and naive,

268
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,980
and I'm sorry.

269
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,483
I've tried to do the right thing, but...

270
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,611
What a fool I've been.

271
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,404
Uh...

272
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,575
What kinda drugs did they give you?

273
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,912
Oh, well done, Ed. I'm impressed.

274
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,499
You're a shaman of sorts, a witch doctor.

275
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,293
So, just between us,
who does run Wayne Enterprises?

276
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:45,089
I could tell you,
but then I would have to lobotomize you.

277
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,966
Gotcha.

278
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,968
So, moving forward, sir,
I would be more than happy to help you

279
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,136
with any of your other cases.

280
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,972
You would be a wonderful addition
to my staff, Ed.

281
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,725
A wonderful addition,
if you were only sane.

282
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,812
- No, seriously.
- Yes, seriously.

283
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,271
You have been very useful,

284
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,066
and we arrogant physicians
have much to learn

285
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,443
from a mad man like you.

286
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,404
But not that much.

287
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,907
No, no, no. No!
You will not turn me into a crazy person!

288
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:13,117
No!

289
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,953
Madam, I bring good news.

290
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,707
Gordon and Wayne and Fox
know nothing but mundanities.

291
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,627
They have told no one the truth
because they have none of the truth.

292
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,051
Our secret is safe.

293
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,139
<i>Kill them all.</i>

294
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,142
<i>Then continue with the evacuation
of your test subjects.</i>

295
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,144
Yes, madam.

296
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,646
<i>The destruction of Indian Hill
will proceed as scheduled.</i>

297
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,899
<i>Releasing Galavan
was a grave error on your part.</i>

298
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:51,029
<i>No more of your patients will see
the light of day under any circumstances,</i>

299
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,656
<i>at any cost.</i>

300
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,660
I understand, madam.

301
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,628
These people to whom Strange is connected,

302
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,839
they must be pretty heavy
to make you back off.

303
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,092
Oh, they're heavy.

304
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,387
I don't want anything dangerous,
I just like being titillated.

305
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,431
Seriously, you don't wanna know.

306
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,767
Remember the time
you called me from the hospital

307
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,351
when you had Falcone on the gurney,

308
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,856
and the whole town and their uncle
were looking to kill you both?

309
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:31,361
- How could I forget?
- Remember what I said to you on the phone?

310
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,030
Remember what I said?

311
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,824
I forget.

312
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,952
- That's funny.
<i>- Gordon, you're back.</i>

313
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:42,122
What happened? Where's Master Bruce?
Where's Lucius?

314
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:44,708
Where are they? Have you seen them?

315
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,752
- Hey, Alfred, take it easy.
<i>- Where are they?</i>

316
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,130
Alfred. Alfred, relax.

317
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,550
Master Bruce and Lucius are, uh,
headed back to Wayne Manor.

318
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,511
Yeah, well, that's a load of old tosh,
for starters, innit?

319
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,678
I've just come back from there.

320
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,473
What can I tell you?
Maybe they stopped to get a snack.

321
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,726
- So? What about Strange?
- It's complicated.

322
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,728
Well, go on, then. What?

323
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,023
Complicated police business!

324
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,861
He's got a touch of the flu.

325
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,748
You.

326
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,758
- How you doing?
- Middling.

327
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,511
- What's your deal?
- Chillin'.

328
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,808
They're gonna blow this dump sky-high,
and the whole circus is moving upstate.

329
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,768
- When?
- Soon.

330
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:45,936
Like, an hour.

331
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,146
- Can you escape?
- Of course.

332
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,483
Firefly thinks I'm her sidekick,
so I got a trustee status.

333
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,651
Then please do so.

334
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,486
- Get out of here and call the police.
- I'll do what I like.

335
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:55,654
I led you into this mess,

336
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,907
I was self-righteous and arrogant
and manipulative.

337
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,118
- I used you, and I'm sorry.
- Like you can use me.

338
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,370
I got you wrapped around my pinkie.

339
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,123
Always have.

340
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,126
Be that as it may...

341
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,295
If you can escape, do it.

342
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,839
"Manipulative."

343
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:15,924
As if.

344
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,220
What'd she say?

345
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,806
She'll do what she likes.

346
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,477
And there's a bomb.

347
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,142
Hello, number 13.

348
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:08,685
Stay calm.

349
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,522
No one's going to hurt you.

350
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,025
It's time to go on a trip.

351
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,319
Give me your right arm.

352
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,207
Say my name.

353
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:31,917
Fish Mooney.

354
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:33,794
That's right.

355
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,509
- What's your name?
- Ethel Peabody.

356
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,721
Ethel, you seem sad

357
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,640
and anxious.

358
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,517
You got that right.

359
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:52,562
You let me out of here,
and I'll be your friend.

360
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,464
Oh, no, no, no.

361
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:30,350
Oh. Interesting.
Ms. Peabody, what are you doing?

362
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,478
- What she says.
- Why?

363
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,439
I don't know.

364
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,776
Ms. Mooney, you have special talents.

365
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:43,280
<i>Some form of psychotropic chemical agent
on your skin, I imagine.</i>

366
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,908
You are marvelous. Yes, truly marvelous.

367
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,661
- Always was.
- Indeed.

368
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:53,165
Would love to chat about me,
but we have a bus to catch.

369
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:56,293
Ah, no, Ms. Mooney,
if you and the others on that bus

370
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,504
were to appear in public,
you would cause a revolution.

371
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:00,881
<i>An apocalypse.</i>

372
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,467
I simply can't allow you
to just walk out of here.

373
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,470
- Watch me.
- No, please don't go.

374
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,931
Please, you're breaking my heart.
I love you like my own daughter.

375
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,141
No one could love you more,

376
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:14,227
but I will have to kill you
before I let you go.

377
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,022
Please choose life.

378
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:20,025
You would have made a great pimp.

379
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,278
No, no, no. No!

380
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,781
Bring him back.

381
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:38,335
Hugo, I order you to stop. Now.

382
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,130
Stop, now!

383
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:43,799
You hear me?

384
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:15,080
<i>Security systems activated.</i>

385
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:17,916
<i>Security systems activated.</i>

386
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:22,587
No!

387
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,722
I tried calling about 1,000 times.

388
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:34,391
Still no answer.

389
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,101
Strange has them, I'm positive.

390
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,687
Holy crap, are you still here?

391
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,898
I told you 1,000 times, Strange is clean.

392
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:43,900
You in charge of that, are you?

393
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:47,779
That's strange though, isn't it?
I mean, strange they're MIA.

394
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,072
Ah! That's funny.

395
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,408
- "Strange."
- "Funny"?

396
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:54,119
You know, maybe I should send
the Strike Force back into Arkham,

397
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,329
- to have a little look-see.
- No, no, no. You don't wanna do that.

398
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,040
Bad idea.
Trust me, that's a terrible idea.

399
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,251
How long you known me?

400
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:05,463
All right, if you're good,
I guess I'm good.

401
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,008
I don't know what's got to you, Gordon,
but you're just...

402
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,219
Weird.

403
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,387
Hey, Alfred.

404
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,891
- Miss Kean.
- How's the butlering business?

405
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,936
- To what do we owe the--
- Jimmy, my love.

406
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:23,106
I'm sure you're ever so busy,
but could we have a word in private?

407
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:27,611
You bet.

408
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,116
Well, you look terrible.

409
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,619
Hey, thanks, Barbara,
you look pretty good.

410
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,204
Shucks.

411
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,539
Question, what the hell's going on
down at Arkham?

412
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:44,794
Two questions back at you, gorgeous.
Why you askin', and what's in it for me?

413
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:48,381
I'm askin' because a dear friend of mine
wants to know the answer.

414
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,509
And what would you like
to be in it for you?

415
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,929
Hey, spring is here, baby.

416
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:57,933
- So, now you like me again?
- What's not to like?

417
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,144
- So, you've forgotten about Lee?
- "Lee"?

418
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,648
Lee Thompkins.

419
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:07,817
Screw that hoe.
Water under the bridge.

420
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:09,569
You're not Jim.

421
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,781
- Say what now?
- You're not Jim.

422
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,992
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, woman.

423
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,747
- Holy mother of saints!
- Holy cow!

424
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,842
Kill the captives. We have to go.

425
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,386
Whoa, whoa. Where are we going?

426
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:35,762
- What's the hurry?
- Silence.

427
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,223
Freeze, get it done.

428
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,351
- Jeez. Relax. What's with him?
- Quiet.

429
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:42,978
Quiet, yourself.

430
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:46,314
Why do you have to kill them?
Why are you so mean?

431
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:49,109
I knew I shouldn't have spared you.
Freeze.

432
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:50,402
Kill her.

433
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,281
- Wait a minute.
- I'm sorry, Firefly.

434
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,533
I told you she was an experiment.

435
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,535
But she is my friend, I need her.

436
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,206
We don't have time for this.

437
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,709
Please don't let him hurt me, Firefly.

438
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,837
<i>Please help me.</i>

439
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,005
Don't you dare.

440
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:16,011
Out of the way, Sparky.

441
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,889
- Make me.
- Firefly, no!

442
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,225
No!

443
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,743
What now?

444
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,537
Sounds like warfare.

445
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,667
What's going on?

446
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,669
Simple psychology.

447
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:52,172
Been waiting for the right moment.

448
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:55,967
You coming or what?

449
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,614
<i>Fifteen minutes to detonation.</i>

450
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,284
<i>Fifteen minutes to detonation.</i>

451
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:34,297
Strange.

452
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,341
Strange!

453
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,307
Wake up. Strange.

454
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,351
Strange.

455
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:59,656
Alpha and Charlie squads to Arkham.
Bravo and Delta to Indian Hill.

456
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:00,990
Move!

457
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,325
Hey, Penguin,

458
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:06,621
so it turns out
our Mr. Strange is a very bad man.

459
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,665
The police are on to him now.

460
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:12,836
They figure he's planning to run,
but he won't, thanks to me.

461
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:16,131
Thank you, Barbara. You have pleased me.

462
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,595
Saddle up, Butch.
We've got an old friend to catch.

463
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:30,019
Wake up, Strange. I know you're in there.

464
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:31,479
Wake up.

465
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:34,607
Oh, Gordon.

466
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,861
I surmise my plan must have gone awry.

467
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,028
You could say.

468
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,280
I'm gonna stand you up now,

469
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,657
and you're gonna give us
a tour of your secret lab.

470
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,492
- No.
- You don't have a choice.

471
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,413
- It's this way, right?
- Jim, we can't go down there.

472
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,708
I set a bomb, the lab is going to blow up.
We have to get out of here!

473
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,670
In 10 minutes, everything within
a quarter-mile radius will be dust.

474
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,880
That's madness.

475
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:00,925
If you want to live, which I do, frankly,
we had better leave.

476
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,802
We detected radioactive material
down there.

477
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,263
- You got it out first, right?
- There wasn't enough time.

478
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,182
They forced my hand.

479
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:11,311
But I calculated the chances
of a radioactive cloud as fairly low.

480
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,188
If you're wrong,
thousands of people could die.

481
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:17,400
Yes, yes, yes.
But paying that price will be better.

482
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,570
Releasing what's down there...

483
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:21,738
How do we shut it down?

484
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,364
The security walls are up,
the lab is sealed.

485
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:26,034
- There must be some way in.
- We have to go.

486
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,452
We have to leave now.

487
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,579
You tell me how to get that bomb
and shut it off,

488
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,414
or I'll batter you to death right here!

489
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,958
In which case, young man,

490
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,254
I suppose I will just have to die.

491
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,675
Wait, Nygma knows the way down there.

492
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,765
- Could use some help.
- Yep.

493
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:52,936
You two, you've got nine minutes.
Get as far away from here as you can.

494
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,395
- No.
- Go, go!

495
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:55,980
Lucius, this way.

496
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,570
Yes, of course I know how,

497
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,948
but what is with all the hoo-ha?
What is the rush here?

498
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,115
Just do it.

499
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,290
What do I get if I do it?

500
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:15,959
You get to live.

501
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,670
Fair enough.

502
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,467
<i>Security systems deactivated.</i>

503
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,138
<i>Security systems deactivated.</i>

504
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:42,068
You any good at defusing bombs?

505
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,529
I don't know yet. You?

506
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,578
<i>Two minutes to detonation.</i>

507
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:55,707
<i>Two minutes to detonation.</i>

508
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:19,188
Oh, my...

509
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,191
Got any ideas?

510
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,360
You got a knife?

511
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:26,988
No.

512
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:34,078
<i>We're on approach
to Arkham for patient evacuation.</i>

513
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:35,747
<i>We need that Bomb Squad ASAP.</i>

514
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:52,555
What now?

515
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,057
You're asking me?

516
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,812
How about we just pull all this stuff off
and see what happens?

517
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,440
There's no cutoff, bro, maybe.

518
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,359
Maybe, there's no tamper-proofing program.

519
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:05,610
Yeah.

520
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:07,570
Yeah.

521
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,326
No.

522
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,245
Water.

523
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,916
- Need water.
- Water.

524
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,547
What's going on? Hello!

525
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:28,049
Twenty-five seconds.

526
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:41,729
Fifteen seconds.

527
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:12,427
Please, I need water.

528
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:14,887
Water.

529
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,056
I need water.

530
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:48,212
Hello!

531
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:52,258
Hello!

532
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,511
Hello! Guys!

533
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:57,930
What's going on?

534
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,393
Hello!

535
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,022
Where are my people? Where are my people?

536
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:09,400
You don't understand.
We have to find my people.

537
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,904
There'll be... There'll be consequences.

538
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,825
You heroic son of a bitch!

539
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:19,702
A nuclear bomb? Huh?

540
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:22,497
- You'll never guess what took us so long.
- Problem.

541
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,709
Whatever was down there,
whoever was down there in Indian Hill,

542
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,211
they're not there anymore.

543
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:30,588
Couple of squad cars
are in pursuit of a bus

544
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,215
that left the Indian Hill's compound.

545
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:35,885
- That's got to be them!
- That bus cannot get away.

546
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:46,896
<i>Unit 12 in pursuit of Arkham bus
heading south along the D line.</i>

547
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,650
<i>Come in, Unit 12.</i>

548
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:55,112
<i>...squad, get ready!</i>

549
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:57,740
<i>Can't make any mistakes here.</i>

550
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,873
<i>Civilian traffic ahead. It's blocked in.</i>

551
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,516
Hold them at the cross street.

552
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,271
<i>Nothing. I'll check up ahead.</i>

553
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,566
<i>Car 32 to Captain Bullock,
heading east towards...</i>

554
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,526
- Damn, damn!
- What's on that bus, Jim?

555
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,778
- Tell me, what's on the bus?
- Monsters.

556
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,488
Come on. Monsters?

557
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:40,950
Hugo Strange would rather destroy
half the city than let them out.

558
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,285
And now, they're out.

559
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:46,956
Code Red, Code Red. All units,
to Penford Highway!

560
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:50,793
<i>All units be on the lookout for
the Indian Hill bus on Penford Highway.</i>

561
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,336
<i>Captain Bullock,
I got eyes on the bus.</i>

562
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:54,171
<i>Under the South Burnside Expressway.</i>

563
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:57,341
<i>Well, then stop the damn thing!
Don't let it get away!</i>

564
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,063
Come to mama!

565
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,033
Professor Strange!

566
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,535
Professor Strange!

567
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:08,788
Come out.

568
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,625
Strange, we need to talk.

569
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:16,587
You did a very bad thing to me.

570
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,215
And now, you're going to pay!

571
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:29,475
Impossible.

572
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:36,148
Nothing is impossible.

573
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,408
Holy...

574
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:50,079
- Bitch...
- No.

575
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:54,792
Hmm.

576
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:00,589
This city's in deep trouble
if we don't find that bus.

577
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,758
- So let's find it.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

578
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,928
I want squadrons at 20,
in these quadrants here.

579
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:08,139
I want choppers in the air.

580
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,433
I want TAC units on all...

581
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,101
Bruce.

582
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,233
I have to go.

583
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:23,279
I might not see you for a while,
but I'll try to stay in touch.

584
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,281
Where are you going?

585
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:26,907
I have to find Lee.

586
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:28,826
Right move, mate.

587
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,455
Do me a favor.

588
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,123
Say goodbye to Bullock for me.

589
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,459
I don't really want
the whole Celtic farewell.

590
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:38,461
<i>He's gonna have his hands full,</i>

591
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,047
but I think he can handle it.

592
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:43,424
Will do.

593
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,687
<i>Chocolates!</i>

594
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,274
Girls like chocolates.

595
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,485
I'll keep that in mind.

596
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:07,573
Well, there's a man who's
got his priorities straight.

597
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,785
The love of a good woman and all that.

598
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,623
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson, Master Bruce.

599
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:19,168
And that's the end of your adventures
with the police, eh?

600
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,631
There's a secret council, Alfred.

601
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,217
A secret council that
runs everything in Gotham.

602
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:27,760
Oh, bloody hell.

603
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,345
It's them that wanted me dead.

604
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:32,848
We're so close, Alfred.
We're so close to the ultimate truth.

605
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,435
- Oh, bloody hell.
- Hey, don't look at me.

606
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,817
Right.

607
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:44,819
Right.

608
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,321
<i>Jim, hey!</i>

609
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,365
Hey, where you going?

610
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:51,117
Hey.

611
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,660
We got monsters to find.

612
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:54,870
And you'll find 'em. I have to go.

613
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:56,831
But the city's in danger!

614
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,668
You got this, I know you do.
And I have more important things to do.

615
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,419
- And Harvey--
- Yeah?

616
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:04,421
You're the boss now.

617
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:06,966
Maybe get a haircut?

618
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:17,059
That's my car.

619
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:19,019
That's my car!

620
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:20,980
Hey! Jim!

621
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,537
<i>Help.</i>

622
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,330

Oh, those poor souls.

624
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:47,673
Hello? Hello?

625
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:07,818
Oh!

626
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:48,067
Thank you.
