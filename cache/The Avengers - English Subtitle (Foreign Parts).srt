1
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,578
This is not how I wanted 
this evening to go.

2
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:17,655
I know how you wanted
this evening to go.

3
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,064
Believe me, this is better.

4
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,068
Who are you working for?

5
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,829
Lermentov, yes?

6
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,457
Does he think...

7
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:32,534
...we have to go through him
to move our cargo?

8
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:38,384
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

9
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,461
Solohob...

10
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:43,313
...a bagman, a front.

11
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:49,645
Your outdated information betrays you.

12
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,816
The famous Black Widow...

13
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:59,922
...and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

14
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:03,868
You really think I'm pretty?

15
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,831
Tell Lermentov we don't need him...

16
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:12,710
...to move the tanks.

17
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,297
Tell him he is out.

18
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,040
Well...

19
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,297
It's for her.

20
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:37,994
You listen carefully.

21
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,190
Who are you?
Get out!

22
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,986
There is sickness here!

23
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,073
My father's not waking up!

24
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:51,283
He has a fever and he's moaning
but his eyes won't open.

25
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,819
Slow down.

26
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:55,063
My father...

27
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,034
Like them?
