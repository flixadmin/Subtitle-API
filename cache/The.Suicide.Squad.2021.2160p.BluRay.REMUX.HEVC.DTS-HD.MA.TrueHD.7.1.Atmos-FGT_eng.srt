1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,630
Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.

2
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:17,184
I hear the train a coming
it's rolling round the bend

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:21,396
And I ain't seen the sunshine
since I don't know when

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,985
I'm stuck in Folsom prison
and time keeps dragging on

5
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,153
But that train keeps a rolling
on down to San Antone

6
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,583
When I was just a baby
my mama told me "son"

7
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,629
"Always be a good boy
don't ever play with guns"

8
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:51,468
But I shot a man in Reno
just to watch him die

9
00:00:54,429 --> 00:01:00,227
When I hear that whistle blowing
I hang my head and cry

10
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,181
I got another 15.

11
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,892
Not today, you don't. You're up.

12
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,439
You know the deal.

13
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,775
Successfully complete the mission,
you get ten years off your sentence.

14
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,864
You fail to follow my orders in any way

15
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,784
and I detonate the explosive device
in the base of your skull.

16
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,951
Good dog.

17
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,787
We are a black ops unit.

18
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,415
Meaning, nothing you see here
ever happened.

19
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,416
Savant.

20
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,877
Your commanding officer
will be Colonel Rick Flag.

21
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,920
Or would you rather be called Durlin?

22
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,881
I'd rather not be called at all.

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,551
But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

24
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,640
Well, welcome to "anything."

25
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,896
So this is the famous Suicide Squad.

26
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,523
Well, we consider
that term degrading.

27
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,859
The official term is "Task Force X."

28
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,319
And love 'em or hate 'em,

29
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,113
these are your brothers and sisters
for the next few days.

30
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,826
Oh!

31
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,870
Whoa.

32
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,594
Captain Boomerang.

33
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,222
Blackguard.

34
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,516
Mongal.

35
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,434
Javelin.

36
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,396
T.D.K.

37
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,815
Weasel.

38
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,402
And, of course...

39
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,154
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two.

40
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,739
Hmm, good to know.

41
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,658
Flag.

42
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,743
Oh, sorry. Coming through.

43
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,786
Hey, Boomer.

44
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,469
What are you doing back
in prison, Haris?

45
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,498
I got road rage. In a bank.

46
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,792
Oh. So sorry. Coming through.

47
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,211
- Turn it around. There. No.
- There? Here?

48
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,547
Put it in there.
Now you're safe.

49
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,548
All right.

50
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,216
Thanks, man.

51
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,469
Prepare for liftoff.
And away we go.

52
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,353
- Harley and T.D.K...
- Digger.

53
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,789
...have they worked
together before?

54
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,814
Not yet. I'm excited.

55
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,898
What does
Savant do again?

56
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,066
It's Brian Durlin.

57
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,652
He's an expert in weapons
and hand-to-hand combat.

58
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,100
Yeah, well, I'm putting 20 on
him that he's gonna bite it.

59
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,573
Me too. And Weasel,

60
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,050
- Boomer and Mongal.
- Yeah, I think...

61
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,368
Is Mongal an alien
or some type of god?

62
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,245
- What are you doing?
- Oh. Hey.

63
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,389
Just making sure
everything was ready to go.

64
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,456
Good meeting, everybody.

65
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,291
Just our normal,
casual morning meeting.

66
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,810
Yeah, I just gotta, uh,
do this thing.

67
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,002
Nothing weird about it.

68
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,170
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

69
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,507
Flag.

70
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,110
Yeah, we're T-minus five
from the drop.

71
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,218
Get the whole team safely

72
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,595
to that beach, Colonel.

73
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,222
You will receive further orders
once there.

74
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,656
We're in a butcher's freezer, Haris,

75
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,076
surrounded by dead hogs
hanging on hooks.

76
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,536
Only they don't know it yet.

77
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,955
Leave him alone, Boomer.

78
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,333
What does T.D.K. stand for?

79
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,501
What?

80
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,128
Your name is T.D.K., correct?

81
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,463
Yeah.

82
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,548
And it stands for what?

83
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,675
It stands for me.

84
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,010
It's what a name is.

85
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,804
Your name is letters?

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,306
All names are letters, dickhead.

87
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,270
I love your accent.

88
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,564
American women all love accents.

89
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,359
We do. 'Cause we don't got none.

90
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,613
- Yo, is this a dog?
- What?

91
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,907
Is this thing a dog?

92
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,201
- A... A dog?
- Yes.

93
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,620
What kind of dog
do you think it is, mate?

94
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,787
I don't know, I'm not familiar
with all the breeds.

95
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,582
I'm gonna go with Afghan Hound.

96
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,793
Since when does an Afghan Hound
have bloody thumbs?

97
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,837
Oh, my God, is it a werewolf?

98
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,523
I've wanted to meet a werewolf forever.

99
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,399
- Yo, they sat me next to a werewolf?
- That's not right.

100
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,926
Yo, let me out.
I do not fuck with werewolves.

101
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,345
Hey, hey, he's not a werewolf, okay!

102
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,847
He's a weasel. He's harmless.

103
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,266
I mean, he's not harmless,
he's killed 27 children,

104
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,561
but, you know, we got him to...
I think he's agreed to do this.

105
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,022
Whatever the case,
just everyone get into position to drop.

106
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,292
Did anyone check
on whether Weasel could swim?

107
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,085
The Weasel is dead! I repeat,

108
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,087
the Weasel is dead.

109
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,923
Northeast, all clear.
Approach the shore.

110
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,090
Over.

111
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,176
Savant, hold your position.

112
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,053
Roger that.

113
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,518
Amateurs.

114
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,449
Waller, we're
on the beach and dry.

115
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,182
- Blackguard. Get down, you...
- Hey, guys!

116
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,994
- There's fucking soldiers everywhere!
- Hey.

117
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,477
You can come out now, it's just me.

118
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,062
What the fuck is Blackguard doing?

119
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,772
I'm the one who contacted you.

120
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,583
Is this what's supposed to happen?
What the fuck?

121
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,127
Blackguard, get back into your position.

122
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,153
Look, look. I brought everybody, look.

123
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,946
They're right behind me.

124
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,115
Whoa. Hey.

125
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,034
Hey, guys. Whoa.

126
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,745
We got a deal, right? Uh... Uh...

127
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,246
Waller, we're made.

128
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,956
I'm the one who called you.

129
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,505
Blackguard sold us out.

130
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,259
He contacted the fucking
Corto Maltese Army!

131
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,470
Waller, we need to retreat.

132
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,220
Negative, Flag.

133
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,598
The mission is too important.

134
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,974
This is a tough group.

135
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,267
- You can make it.
- Okey-doke.

136
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,911
Waller, with all due respect,
we're in the middle

137
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,103
of a goddamn... Harley, wait!

138
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,521
Whoo-hoo!

139
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,772
Zero-two-two-seven is wide open.

140
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,274
Colonel, dispatch
The Detachable Kid.

141
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,276
T.D.K., two o'clock!

142
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,447
T.D.K. is "The Detachable Kid"?

143
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,885
What the fuck?

144
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,513
I didn't pick the damn team!

145
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,724
Don't worry, Flag, I got the bird.

146
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,769
Mongal! Don't.

147
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,232
Huh?

148
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,161
Strewth!

149
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,541
Boomer!

150
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,406
Savant is off the rails.

151
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,491
Savant, turn back.

152
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,788
Savant.

153
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,877
Savant, I'm warning you,
this is desertion.

154
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,297
Savant!

155
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,841
This is your last chance.
Turn back around.

156
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,594
You are in violation of your agreement!

157
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,973
Oh, please! No.

158
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,395
Damn it.

159
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,826
How's Team Two holding up?

160
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,251
Team Two, check.
Set point bravo.

161
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,213
All troops on the south beach
are engaged.

162
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,049
Team Two is clear to go
on the north beach.

163
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,928
Congratulations, Bloodsport.

164
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,359
How'd you do it, Waller?

165
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,654
There's no soldiers out here
on patrol at all.

166
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,657
Let's just say they were distracted.

167
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,081
Teddy sniffing glue
he was twelve years old

168
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,292
Fell from the roof on East Two-nine

169
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,877
Cathy was eleven
when she pulled the plug

170
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,422
On twenty six reds and a bottle of wine

171
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,632
Bobby got leukemia, fourteen years old

172
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,552
He looked like sixty five when he died
He was a friend of mine

173
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,179
Those are people who died, died

174
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,724
Those are people who died, died

175
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,143
Those are people who died, died

176
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,353
Those are people who died, died

177
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,481
They were all my friends and just died

178
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,069
G-berg and Georgie
let their gimmicks go rotten

179
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,447
So they died of hepatitis
in upper Manhattan

180
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,199
Sly in Vietnam, bullet in the head

181
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,161
Bobby OD'd on Drano
on the night that he was wed

182
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,121
They were two more friends of mine

183
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,582
Two more friends that died

184
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,335
Those are people who died, died

185
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,962
Those are people who died, died

186
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,298
Those are people who died, died

187
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,925
Those are people who died, died

188
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,845
They were all my friends and they died

189
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,433
Mary took a dry dive from a hotel room

190
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,643
Bobby hung himself
from a cell in The Tombs

191
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,520
Judy jumped in front of a subway train

192
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,940
Eddie got slit in the jugular vein

193
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,610
And Eddie, I miss you
more than all the others

194
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,987
And I salute you brother

195
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,447
Those are people who died, died

196
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,968
I was not ready for the road

197
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:53,518
I was so discontent
to wear that heavy load

198
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,815
And so I got down on my knees

199
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,487
I made a sucker's prayer

200
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,365
A grim bode of baudelaire before

201
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,327
I wanna love somebody
but I don't know how

202
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,125
Oh, jeez.

203
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,584
Oh.

204
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,920
Here you go, champ.

205
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,340
I've been so long lonely
and it's getting me down

206
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,302
Excuse me.

207
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,849
Who the fuck is Bloodsport?

208
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,309
Robert Dubois.

209
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,603
A world-class marksman.

210
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,440
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

211
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,066
His father was a mercenary

212
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,153
who trained his son to kill
from the moment he was born.

213
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,780
He's in prison for putting
Superman in the ICU

214
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,615
with a kryptonite bullet.

215
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,244
- Dubois?
- Same answer as the last time.

216
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,662
Piss off.

217
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,001
I'm not joining your
goddamn Suicide Squad.

218
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,210
We'll see.

219
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,005
You have a visitor.

220
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,396
They said you got in trouble.

221
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,607
I stole.

222
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,983
You stole what?

223
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,904
- A style watch.
- A star latch?

224
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,033
A style watch.
You can watch TV on it.

225
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,960
Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?

226
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,453
I don't know.

227
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,055
Next time you want
to nick something,

228
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,164
you take a partner,

229
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,582
and they can be your lookout.

230
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,250
That's your advice?

231
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,709
Yeah.

232
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,337
- You're a terrible father.
- Hey,

233
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,064
I didn't ask to be a father
in the first place.

234
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,381
You make that perfectly clear.

235
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,966
Your mother sprung that one on me.

236
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,761
Well, she's not around anymore,
so you can lay off of her, okay?

237
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,095
Oh, I tried to lay off her,

238
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,899
but then she dragged out
the paternity test.

239
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,599
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

240
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,017
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

241
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,393
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

242
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,020
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

243
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,104
Fuck you!

244
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,108
I can't believe you don't care
that I stole, only that I got caught!

245
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,711
I don't only care that you got caught,

246
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,903
I care that you got caught

247
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,822
for stealing something as stupid
as a fucking TV watch!

248
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,116
It does other things too!

249
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,869
But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do! It's embarrassing!

250
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:21,290
No, what's fucking embarrassing
is having you as my father.

251
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,967
Yeah, well, I told you, Tyla,

252
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,886
when I came here that
any goodness I ever had in me

253
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,430
had been wrung out bare by my old man.

254
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,849
And I also told you to go out there
and do your own thing

255
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:43,271
and stay far away
from me or anyone like me, didn't I?

256
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,606
So, why are you here
when you and I both know

257
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,317
I have nothing good to offer you?

258
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,363
Because my court date is coming up,

259
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,534
and Miss Waller said
maybe you could help me out.

260
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,953
To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission,

261
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,139
you're gonna send
my 14-year-old daughter to prison?

262
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,163
No.

263
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,710
Your daughter is 16, Dubois.

264
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,604
- You're a real father of the year.
- Fine.

265
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,106
You know what,
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

266
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,649
'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

267
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,550
So, a year in juvie, no fucking problem.

268
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,178
Not juvie.
Being 16 in the state of Louisiana

269
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,806
means that under
the right circumstances,

270
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,558
she could be tried as an adult.

271
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,184
And, if convicted,

272
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,229
could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

273
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,107
And in here, well, you never know
what might happen

274
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,443
to a frail young thing like that.

275
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,153
Shames me to say

276
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,658
that we have the highest mortality rate
in the entire U.S. prison system.

277
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,245
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

278
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,372
You're threatening my fucking daughter!

279
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,082
I'm protecting this country.

280
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,084
- Everyone stand down.
- Miss Waller, I--

281
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,170
Stand down!

282
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,801
I wouldn't take such extreme measures...

283
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,678
Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

284
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,722
...if this mission
weren't more important

285
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,182
than you could possibly imagine.

286
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,558
Fuck your mission.

287
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,405
You have the military
experience necessary,

288
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,854
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

289
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,541
you have what it takes to be a leader.

290
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,232
No, I'm no fucking leader!

291
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,776
Then I'll make you one.

292
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,783
Are you in or out?

293
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,706
Good. Let's meet your team.

294
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,502
- Come on.
- Fuck me, man.

295
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,879
Let's go.

296
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,297
She was gonna kill his kid?

297
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,761
Each member
of the team is chosen

298
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,390
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

299
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,477
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

300
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,979
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

301
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,190
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

302
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,317
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

303
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,277
- Are you having a laugh?
- What?

304
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,172
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

305
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,699
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

306
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,865
But better.

307
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,095
- I always hit my targets dead center.
- I hit them more in the center.

308
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,721
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

309
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,288
- I use smaller bullets.
- What?

310
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,975
They go inside your bullet holes
without even touching the side.

311
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,627
Next up is King Shark.

312
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,628
Holy shit.

313
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,463
What the fuck?

314
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,215
Some people claim

315
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,301
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

316
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,429
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

317
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,638
Does it talk?

318
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,391
- Book read.
- Wow.

319
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,600
Book's upside-down.

320
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,284
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

321
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,690
So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

322
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:33,858
Be a mite careful,

323
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,317
as he's developed a taste

324
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,902
- for human meat.
- Huh?

325
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,321
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

326
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,866
Ratcatcher 2.

327
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,659
Settle down!

328
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,744
Ooh.

329
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,346
What, we couldn't afford Ratcatcher 1?

330
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,622
- He's dead.
- This is his daughter.

331
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,583
Cazo, will you be joining us?

332
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,668
I just woke up.

333
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,962
I don't function well
early in the morning.

334
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,423
My deepest apologies for disturbing you.

335
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,758
Hmm, it's all right.

336
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,844
Get your ass out here!

337
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,226
Millennials.

338
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:13,981
Oh, no way.

339
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,359
- That's not coming with us.
- She controls rats.

340
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,945
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

341
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,823
This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

342
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,786
I'm not shaking
the rat's hand.

343
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,332
And finally, we have Abner Krill.

344
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,167
What's that 'round his neck?

345
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,337
A power dampener.
They call him the Polka-Dot Man.

346
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,547
Polka-Dot Man.

347
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,217
What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

348
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,969
He does.

349
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,085
He throws polka dots at people.

350
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,681
Hey, Polka-Dot Man,

351
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,267
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

352
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,645
You fucking pussy!

353
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,148
These are soldiers?

354
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,817
We need to debrief.

355
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,743
Fuck.

356
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,037
Corto Maltese

357
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,791
is a small island nation
off the coast of South America.

358
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:18,128
Over the past 100 years, the country
has been ruled with an iron fist

359
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,713
by the Herrera family.

360
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,176
But, a week ago, this guy,

361
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,930
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

362
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,224
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

363
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,227
took control
of the Corto Maltese government

364
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,771
in a violent military coup.

365
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:39,650
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

366
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,570
Although the United States

367
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,406
did not condone
the excesses of the Herrera regime,

368
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,158
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

369
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,079
Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

370
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,873
So, you want us to kill Luna?

371
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,416
No.

372
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,376
This is Jotunheim.

373
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,298
A scientific experimentation facility
containing something known only

374
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,884
as Project Starfish.

375
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:10,264
Our intelligence sources tell us that
Starfish is extraterrestrial in origin.

376
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,766
In the hands of the Luna regime,

377
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:17,313
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

378
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,483
Your mission is to infiltrate Jotunheim

379
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,321
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

380
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,739
How are we supposed to get in?

381
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,991
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

382
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,952
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

383
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,830
After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

384
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,958
known as La Gatita Amable.

385
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,920
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

386
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,422
and he can get you into Jotunheim.

387
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,008
Any questions?

388
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,802
What is that?

389
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,805
That is an overhead projector.

390
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,307
Do you ever use it anymore?

391
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,808
No, not really.

392
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,769
So, why don't you just throw it away?

393
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:57,936
Peacemaker?

394
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,649
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

395
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,567
Think there's any connection?

396
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,820
No.

397
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,697
No...

398
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,864
Nanaue.

399
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,033
...connection.

400
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,117
Hand.

401
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,871
Yes, that is your hand, Nanaue,
very good.

402
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,376
We're all gonna die.

403
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,294
I hope so.

404
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,673
Oh, for fuck's sake.

405
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,323
Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

406
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,450
It's just a diversion, Bloodsport.

407
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,495
All right, we cut through the jungle
to get to Valle Del Mar.

408
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,455
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

409
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,665
That's the word.

410
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,418
How we getting in?
Especially with Charlie the Tuna here.

411
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,984
How the hell am I supposed to know?

412
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,212
You're the leader.

413
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,619
You're supposed to be decisive.

414
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,466
And I've decided that you should eat
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

415
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,759
You're being facetious.

416
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,862
But if this whole beach
was completely covered in dicks,

417
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,364
and somebody said
I had to eat every dick

418
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,699
until the beach was clean for liberty,

419
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,932
I would say no problemo.

420
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,019
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

421
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,664
- Who knows why madmen do what they do?
- Well, you know what I think?

422
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,107
I think liberty is just your excuse
to do whatever you want.

423
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:29,111
Whether that's to eat
a beach full of dicks or killing folk.

424
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,365
Oh, yeah?

425
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,618
At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

426
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,328
Oh, here we go.

427
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,165
There's something wrong with your skin.

428
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,624
It's just a rash.

429
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,959
That's a rash?

430
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,682
Oh, no.

431
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,563
You...

432
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,441
are the only one...

433
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:12,821
fit to carry my javelin.

434
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,290
Carry it for...

435
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,189
Carry it for who?

436
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,816
For what? What the heck?

437
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,342
Who am I supposed to carry it for?

438
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,655
This is so frustrating.

439
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,116
He just told me I have to carry
this javelin for a reason,

440
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,118
but he didn't say why!

441
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,957
Waller? Waller. Waller!

442
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,093
All right, we'll camp here,

443
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,220
and tomorrow we'll go
straight through to the city

444
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,556
to get to La Gatita Amable by nightfall.

445
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,295
What?

446
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,565
How deep of a sleeper are you?

447
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,652
I was having the most wonderful dream.

448
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,380
If it was you about to be eaten
by King Shark, then you're psychic.

449
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,240
I don't believe
he would do that.

450
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,492
He has very kind eyes.

451
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,081
Hungry.

452
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,124
You bastard!

453
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,961
Uh...

454
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,474
All right, calm down with the rats!

455
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,143
- What?
- I have a thing with rats.

456
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,229
- You have a thing with rats?
- Yes.

457
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,898
- And you're on a team with me?
- Not something I asked for!

458
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,795
What are you laughing at me for, man?
Why the fuck are you in your underwear?

459
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,195
Tighty-whities? Really?

460
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,822
- Now, that's just racist.
- No.

461
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,906
It's not racist.

462
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,284
- They're tighty-whities.
- Oh, come the fuck on.

463
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,786
Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

464
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,122
What?

465
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,331
You didn't tell me

466
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,417
you had a fear of rats, Dubois?

467
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,253
I'm an assassin!
Why would I share my liabilities?

468
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,672
For fuck's sake.

469
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:02,592
Aw. He's offering you a pretty leaf
to show you he means no harm.

470
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,079
Why the fuck would I want a leaf?

471
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,389
Just get the rats out of here!

472
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,231
- Oh, fuck's sake.
- Huh. Cool.

473
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,112
Hey, we gonna Kill
Megalodouche now, or what?

474
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,840
Nanaue's the strongest
member of your team.

475
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,907
You need him to get into Jotunheim.

476
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,469
Yeah, well, we can't function as a team
if we gotta watch our back

477
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,871
from one of our own
eating our bollocks.

478
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:36,752
Nanaue, would you eat your friends?

479
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,047
I no friends.

480
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,507
You have no friends?

481
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,597
If you did, would you eat them?

482
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,057
Yes.

483
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,022
No?

484
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,983
Then, can we be your friends?

485
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,319
Come on.

486
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,862
He's obviously lying.

487
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,493
If I die 'cause I gambled on love...

488
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,121
it will be a worthy death.

489
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,707
Friends.

490
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,592
You are a little idiot.

491
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:38,063
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
I'm good at my job.

492
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,147
I found him.

493
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,607
Check it out.

494
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,110
Look, right here, a mile north.

495
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,278
Task Force X,

496
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,072
you have an additional
mission directive.

497
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,450
We've located Colonel Rick Flag.
He's been taken by the enemy.

498
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,660
Rick Flag?

499
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:52,953
I know, you both served

500
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,747
on special forces in Qurac
that took down Avral Kaddam.

501
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,500
Flag was the one
who initially recommended you.

502
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,045
You had other operatives
in Corto Maltese and didn't tell us?

503
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,673
There was
no tactical advantage.

504
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,258
Now there is.

505
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,177
I've uploaded the location on your MTS.

506
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,014
Terminate his captors
with extreme prejudice.

507
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:18,186
Kill anyone you see.
These are dangerous people.

508
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,940
Recover Flag
before moving on to the city.

509
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,737
That's where they're holding Flag.

510
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,073
Nothing like a bloodbath
to start the day.

511
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,367
They call you Peacemaker?

512
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,327
I cherish peace with all my heart.

513
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,789
I don't care how many men, women,
and children I need to Kill to get it.

514
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,792
I thought
you were the crazy one.

515
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,627
I am.

516
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,254
All right.

517
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,672
Let's get it.

518
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,675
Boss.

519
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,386
Gracias.

520
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,693
No, no, no!

521
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:39,578
No, no, no!

522
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,186
Hmm?

523
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,567
Non-lethal.

524
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,818
You lose.

525
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,070
Exploding compression bullets.

526
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,409
No one likes a show-off.

527
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,162
Unless what they're showing off
is dope as fuck.

528
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,875
Fuck. That's true.

529
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,184
He does throw polka dots at people.

530
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,187
I'm sorry it's so... flamboyant.

531
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:50,023
It looks cool. I think.

532
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,652
I don't like to kill people, but if I
pretend they're my mom, it's easy.

533
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,403
T.M.I., mate.

534
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,455
Dubois?

535
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,499
Hey, Flag.

536
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,168
What the hell are you doing here?

537
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,380
Waller told us that you were...

538
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:14,923
Uh...

539
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,883
Are you drinking tea?

540
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,803
This is Sol Sorta, she's the leader
of the freedom fighters,

541
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,222
the resistance trying to
take down the current government.

542
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,932
They saved my life.

543
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,769
Oh, wow.

544
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,815
Why did my people not alert me
of your arrival?

545
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,295
- We didn't see any people.
- Yeah, I didn't see anybody on the way.

546
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,339
- There's no one out there.
- They were gone when we got here.

547
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,741
I turned them into my mother
in my head and killed them.

548
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:02,387
Typical Americans.
Just run in, guns blazing.

549
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,681
I know, it's just messed up.

550
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,642
- These guys, they're...
- What's this one do?

551
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:13,398
They're fucking idiots, but right now
our objectives align with yours.

552
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,235
If Jotunheim contains the technology
our intelligence says it does,

553
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,156
then it could be used on the people
of Corto Maltese as well as Americans.

554
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:26,327
That's why we need your help
to get into the city so we can stop 'em.

555
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,706
Is that rat waving at me?

556
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,588
It appears it is.

557
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,257
Why?

558
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,676
I'm gonna guess because it's friendly.

559
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,140
Luna and Suarez
murdered my entire family.

560
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,269
I'd make a deal with the Devil
to stop them.

561
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,692
Your people will have our help
getting to Valle Del Mar

562
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:02,155
to apprehend this Gaius Grieves.

563
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,629
Hey.

564
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,341
- What is this?
- You slaughtered my staff!

565
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,010
They were loyal to the Herreras.

566
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,471
Who are you loyal to, Thinker?

567
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,556
They call you "Thinker," yes?

568
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,435
All that shit in your face
is to make your brain good?

569
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,104
Yes, makes my brain good.

570
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,649
Are you being sarcastic with me?

571
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,693
- Hey! Hey.
- I shall do to you

572
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,654
- as we did to your employees.
- Hey. Mateo!

573
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,287
What is this?

574
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,958
Project Starfish.

575
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,502
It's been the primary focus
of my experiments here

576
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,380
for the past 30 years.

577
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:10,014
Here.
What... What is it doing here?

578
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,016
Oh!

579
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,185
It is having little babies.

580
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,354
Not progeny,

581
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,231
extensions of itself.

582
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,150
They take hosts,

583
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,988
and those hosts in turn
become part of the central being.

584
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,409
It feeds on their consciousnesses.

585
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,706
Grows larger, more powerful.

586
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,880
So...

587
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,468
Where is this Project Starfish now?

588
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,459
Marvelous idea, Presidente.

589
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,381
But as I've noted, I've been working
with the beast for 30 years.

590
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:30,011
And there's no one but me
capable of controlling it.

591
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,638
Well, then...

592
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,266
welcome to the team.

593
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,066
Sí, Camila.

594
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,692
Presidente.

595
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,491
You are making
a big mistake

596
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,575
throwing me down here!

597
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,035
I will be outta here soon enough

598
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,913
and I will kill every last one of you,

599
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,000
Colto Maltese-tezios. Maltese-els.

600
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,670
Matte-multoids. Colt-a-mutts?

601
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,422
Whatever you Mario Kart-racing
d-bags are called!

602
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:08,800
Please.

603
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:10,801
Put this on.

604
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,983
Oh, wow.

605
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,780
I'm a princess.

606
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,846
Señorita Quinn,

607
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,472
on behalf of the entire staff

608
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,184
of Our Honorable General
Presidente Silvio Eleuterio Luna,

609
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,511
it's a pleasure to serve you.

610
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,272
Gracias.

611
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,445
My mother said to count back again.

612
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,988
Ten, nine,

613
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,323
eight, seven, six,

614
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,743
five, four, three,

615
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:21,289
two, one. Hal
Coronel, beat that--

616
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:28,838
Oh.

617
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,466
Forgive my appearance, Señorita Quinn.

618
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:36,095
I have admired you from afar

619
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,890
for many years now.

620
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,183
Señorita.

621
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,560
Me?

622
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:46,189
You're a hero to me,
as well as to my people.

623
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,733
I think you might got me confused.

624
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,778
Harley Quinn's fire and rebellion
in the face of American oppression

625
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,988
is something to which
my entire country aspires.

626
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,448
Oh.

627
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,908
I have prepared lunch.

628
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,828
Would you be so kind as to join me?

629
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,083
I'm so kind, sure.

630
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,544
So if you're lonely

631
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:12,256
Why'd you say you're not lonely?

632
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,220
Oh, you're a silly girl
I know I heard it so

633
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:21,474
It's just like you to come and go

634
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,976
And know me
No, you don't even know me

635
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,565
You're so sweet to try

636
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,276
Oh my, you caught my eye

637
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,447
A girl like you's just irresistible

638
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,296
So if you're lonely

639
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,841
Why'd you say you're not lonely?

640
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,636
Oh, you're a silly girl

641
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,097
I know I heard it so

642
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,015
It's just like you to come and go

643
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,559
You want me to what?

644
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,104
To marry me.

645
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,022
You're joshing.

646
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,358
Might I be frank, Harley?

647
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,110
You might be.

648
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,822
Good, listen.

649
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,491
Since I took control,
the majority love me.

650
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,870
But some find me to be

651
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,622
an unacceptable leader.

652
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,667
What kinds of dicks
would find that?

653
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,836
Don't they know how awesome you are?

654
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,283
Have you shown them the birdies?

655
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,465
It may sound archaic to
someone from your part of the world,

656
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,051
but my people, the Corto Malteseans,

657
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,555
- they're very old-fashioned.
- Corto Malteseans, of course.

658
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,182
And I am a bachelor.

659
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,851
So they want you to get hitched?

660
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,228
My people say
you would make the perfect wife.

661
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,357
Because, you know,
you symbolize anti-American fervor.

662
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,776
Oh.

663
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,863
But I am a romantic, Harley.

664
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,700
I agreed to meet with you
just to appease them.

665
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,330
However, upon spending
the day with you,

666
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,709
I find myself hardly able
to think straight.

667
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:16,297
- You are perfect in every--
- You are so freaking hot.

668
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,265
So if you're lonely

669
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:30,186
Why'd you say you're not lonely?

670
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,730
You're so sweet to try

671
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,233
Oh my, you caught my eye

672
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:39,862
A girl like you's just irresistible

673
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,823
Harley Luna.

674
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,452
I like the ring of that.

675
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,812
That's Jotunheim?

676
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,819
Nazis came here seeking asylum
after World War ll.

677
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:26,492
They built Jotunheim to continue
their unorthodox experiments.

678
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:31,497
Until the Herrera family accepted
the bounty on the Nazis' heads

679
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,416
and killed them all.

680
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,582
Wowza.

681
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,461
Many years ago,
the rumors began of a beast.

682
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,216
These dark rumors helped
the Herrera family maintain power.

683
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,845
They would send their political enemies
and their families to the fortress,

684
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,346
never to return.

685
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,517
I have recently learned...

686
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,270
these were not rumors.

687
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:56,605
They were murdering thousands

688
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,401
in bizarre experiments
with this creature.

689
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,613
Well, it must be a big relief
to got it in your hands now, huh?

690
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,699
Absolutely.

691
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:11,454
Now, it is our enemies
who shall be fearful.

692
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:17,752
If anyone dares to say a negative word
about their new president today,

693
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:22,631
their parents, their children,
and anyone they ever loved

694
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:26,135
will be sent to Jotunheim
to feed the beast.

695
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,472
I'm sorry.

696
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,603
Recently, I made a promise to myself
that the next time I got a boyfriend,

697
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,564
I'd be on the lookout for red flags.
And if I saw any,

698
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,191
I would do the healthy thing

699
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,443
and I would murder him.

700
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:49,367
And killing kids?
Kind of a red flag.

701
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:51,994
I know, I know.

702
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,955
I know what you're trying to say.
"Harley, why not just leave?"

703
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,666
And I'd say, "Why are you
screaming at me? I'm not deaf.

704
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,085
I'm standing right here."

705
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,878
And then I'd say,

706
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:05,049
"When your taste in men
is as bad as mine,

707
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,344
they don't just go away quietly.

708
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:13,099
They slash your tires
and they kill your dogs and

709
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,935
tell you that the music you like
ain't real music at all."

710
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,479
And all the cruelty...

711
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,196
Tears you apart after a while.

712
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,585
You were real pretty and all,

713
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:47,633
and R.I.P. to that absolutely beautiful
monster between your legs, but...

714
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,302
all in all...

715
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,848
I think you're more pretty like this...

716
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:58,436
with all those rotten thoughts
emptied from your head.

717
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,190
I can't believe this thing had a bullet.

718
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:11,031
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

719
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,394
BRING ME THE HEADS
OF THE SUICIDE SQUAD

720
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,318
What the hell
are you doing?

721
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:33,489
We're tired, Colonel. We need a rest.

722
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,324
Goddamn hobbyists.

723
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:36,867
We cannot stop.

724
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,803
We need to hurry
if you're going to help my people.

725
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,996
Hey. We're not here to help your people.

726
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,998
But she's right, we gotta keep moving.

727
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,376
I carry friend?

728
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,711
It's okay, Nanaue.

729
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,550
It's happening to his face again.

730
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,218
- It's nothing, I slipped.
- Hey.

731
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:57,388
Norman Bates, if that shit's contagious,
we need to know.

732
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,431
It's not.

733
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,392
- What is it?
- It's a...

734
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,480
It's an interdimensional virus.

735
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,817
Fuck is that?

736
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,195
My mother was a scientist
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

737
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:16,156
and she was obsessed with turning me
and my brothers and sisters

738
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,825
into superheroes.

739
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:20,911
She infected me.

740
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,582
Now, if I don't, you know,
expel the dots twice a day...

741
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,625
Then what?

742
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,546
They'll eat me alive.

743
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,383
What happened to
your brothers and sisters?

744
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,678
Some lived.

745
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,471
Some...

746
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:42,849
died.

747
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:47,021
And your mom, where is she now?

748
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,193
Everywhere.

749
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,203
Okay. Let's move out.

750
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,874
Come on, we must hurry,
or we'll be late to meet my contact.

751
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,652
I heard the men saying something

752
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,429
The captains tell they pay you well

753
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,223
And they say they need sailing men to

754
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:29,813
Show the way and leave today
Was it you that said, how long?

755
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,400
How long?

756
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,734
Nom, nom!

757
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,240
Are you Milton?

758
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,993
Sí.

759
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,416
Milton will drive you through town

760
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,625
and to La Gatita Amable.

761
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:35,254
There are clothes in the boxes
for all of you so you can blend in.

762
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,048
That said, the walking tiburón

763
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,800
is gonna have to stay out of sight.

764
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,427
I wear disguise.

765
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,972
Oh, you're going to wear a disguise.

766
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,140
Si.

767
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,474
Hey, he's learning Spanish.

768
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,768
And what kind of disguise?

769
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,229
- Fake moustache.
- Oh.

770
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,232
Yeah, fake moustache
isn't gonna cut it, mate.

771
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,156
There's gonna be a lot of soldiers
watching Jotunheim.

772
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,284
- If they discover us there--
- Let's pray they do not,

773
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:06,452
or you will all be dead.

774
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,203
If they do,

775
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,456
that'll leave the palace vulnerable.

776
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:15,544
Luna and the other generals
will be left without protection.

777
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,637
You're a good man, Colonel Flag.

778
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,560
You still look exactly like yourself.

779
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,567
That's the worst fake moustache
I've ever seen.

780
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,859
And if you had fooled us,
we'd have to Kill you,

781
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,984
shark-shaped bloke with a moustache
creeping up on us like that.

782
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,527
Fuck!

783
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,363
You, you.

784
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:48,786
Aw.

785
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,413
He always wants
to be near you.

786
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,207
I think he senses good in you.

787
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,209
Yeah, there's no good in me.

788
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,590
Damn.

789
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,051
Supposed to play golf
with Senator Cray this weekend.

790
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,803
I'm gonna look a fool.

791
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,429
Waller, come in.

792
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:09,807
Ugh.

793
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:11,892
You missed.

794
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,853
- Waller, do you copy?
- We're losing connection.

795
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:17,356
Waller.

796
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,901
Fuck's sake.

797
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,694
- Task Force X.
- Waller.

798
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,904
You there?

799
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,906
The military must have put

800
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,158
signal jammers around the city.

801
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,953
Your comms are down,
but we can still activate the bombs,

802
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,039
not to mention what will happen
to your daughter.

803
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,249
So, no funny business.

804
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,792
Do you copy, Dubois?

805
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,210
Copy.

806
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,128
Fuck you!

807
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,590
Hey, uh, all that stuff
about his daughter,

808
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,301
you wouldn't really do that, right?

809
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,263
You don't know half
of what I would do, John.

810
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,784
What?

811
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,413
Why are you so afraid of rats?

812
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,543
Why are you so in love with them,
Ratcatcher 2?

813
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,087
You know what I think?

814
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,798
I think you have a serious case
of daddy issues.

815
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:28,427
I have no issues
with how much I loved my father.

816
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:39,396
Although he was a genius...

817
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:45,694
we lived homeless in the streets
of Portugal 'cause of his...

818
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,948
burdens.

819
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,370
He built the machines I employ today...

820
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,458
...and taught me
the secrets of calling the rats.

821
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,298
They brought us trinkets to live on.

822
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,886
And they kept us warm at night,
when we would have frozen.

823
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,808
- But eventually...
- Papa.

824
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:17,976
Papa, wake up.

825
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,978
...my father's burdens...

826
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,065
became too heavy to carry.

827
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,608
No.

828
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,609
No, Papa.

829
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:29,112
- And he was gone.
- Papa, wake up.

830
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,870
I took his machinery
and came to America.

831
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,664
That is the dream, right?

832
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,833
But I was arrested

833
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,212
for armed bank robbery,
do you believe it?

834
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,798
The state considered the rats a weapon.

835
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,386
What?

836
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,641
You remind me of my daughter...

837
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,310
the reason I'm here.

838
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,231
Why are you so afraid of rats?

839
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,733
My old man.

840
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,486
When I was a lad,

841
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,613
if I didn't finish a task right,

842
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,907
he would dole out the punishment.

843
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:19,997
And one day, he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

844
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,376
And it was full of starving rats.

845
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,630
As imperfect my father was...

846
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,469
he loved me.

847
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,641
I wish I could give that to you.

848
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,022
Don't you worry, yeah?

849
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,733
I'm gonna get you out of here alive.

850
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,736
I'm going to get you out of here alive.

851
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,038
Señores, this is the place.

852
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,481
So, when's this Thinker guy
supposed to be here?

853
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,087
Supposed to be
in the next few hours.

854
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,501
Looks like we gotta find
something to do

855
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,569
to pass the time.
Uh, miss?

856
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,529
How about some, uh...

857
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,656
What do you guys drink
around here, Fernet?

858
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,092
How about a round of Fernets
for the table.

859
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,117
- Comprende?
- Sí.

860
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:42,245
Hey, Pissmaker, we're on a mission.

861
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,665
Easy, Inspector Gadget.
A little drink never hurt nobody.

862
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,292
Except for the thousands of people

863
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,711
killed in drunk driving
accidents every year.

864
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,091
Come on, Dubois,
this could be our last drink.

865
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,259
Gracias.

866
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,427
Just one.

867
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,263
- You're gonna be that guy?
- I'm gonna be that guy.

868
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,557
Hey, chica.

869
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,060
Forgot the rat.

870
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,983
Here's to being alive in three hours.

871
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,153
I'll be alive. You speak for yourself.

872
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:30,001
There you go, there you go.

873
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,546
Don't give any more to Polka!

874
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,049
I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake

875
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:39,052
Cause I've been running
running, running all day

876
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:45,392
Long nights, no peace
I feel like everybody's eyes on me

877
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:48,520
I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake

878
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:51,815
Cause I've been running
running, running all day

879
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:58,363
Long nights, no peace
I feel like everybody's eyes on me

880
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,699
I can't sleep

881
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:05,805
Go. Go.

882
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,694
That is a gun.

883
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,196
So, smile.

884
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,284
We're old mates who are gonna
take a trip to Jotunheim.

885
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,080
Yup.

886
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:34,793
Even with my help,
you think you can get into Jotunheim?

887
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:38,004
Well, if we can't,
I've got a Great White out back

888
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,248
that's looking for some chum.

889
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,423
Now, come on.

890
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,135
All right...

891
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,930
nice and easy.

892
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:53,561
Oh, fuck.

893
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,833
No, no, no!

894
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,883
All right...

895
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,528
Take him out
through the back, all right.

896
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,305
Find my coordinates in the pad
and meet me in half an hour.

897
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,473
- What?
- Hey, did you hear what I said?

898
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,142
- Yes, but--
- Go.

899
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,853
Let's go.

900
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,566
Hey, calm down.

901
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,037
There's no need to disturb
everyone's night.

902
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,033
I'm right here,
I'm the one you're looking for.

903
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,198
Yep, us too.
We're his American companions.

904
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,408
What?

905
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,702
Ow!

906
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:59,127
- Come on. Go.
- He...

907
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,131
Oh, God.

908
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,508
Move it!

909
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,344
Come on!

910
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:09,803
Hey!

911
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,736
Your equipment manipulates
animal behavior, clever.

912
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,238
I'm working on something
similar with humans.

913
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,115
Be quiet, please.

914
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,450
You are perceivably panicked.

915
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,994
I'm guessing that you are not the alphas
of this battalion.

916
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:36,247
Do you want a dozen angry rodents
crawling up your ass?

917
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:38,725
My answer might not be what you expect.

918
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,170
Go, go!

919
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:49,677
I do not mind the rain sometimes

920
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,267
'Cause that's the only way
the roses bloom

921
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,395
I'm sorry for you.

922
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:03,191
But soon you will all be joining
your deranged compatriot, Harley Quinn.

923
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,985
Is Harley alive?

924
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,612
Not for long.

925
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:12,325
Mayor General Suarez can be rather harsh
when extracting information.

926
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:18,206
The feeling, it comes at a cost, oh my

927
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:24,045
My poor heart is
My only friend, only friend

928
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:29,717
And I've come to love a heavy sky
Heavy sky

929
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,970
Dim mak.

930
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,806
That's the Cantonese term for it.

931
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:36,933
In Japan, it's kyusho jitsu.

932
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,728
In English, it's simply the Death Touch,

933
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,274
how to kill a man
with a single blow.

934
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:48,361
Of course it's possible to kill a man
with a single blow.

935
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:54,075
But it's a matter of chance,
and cannot be wielded with certainty.

936
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,370
- That's what they say.
- They?

937
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,164
- Amateurs.
- On one?

938
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,415
One.

939
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,963
I don't smoke.

940
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:14,137
I do not mind the rain sometimes

941
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:48,773
All right.

942
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,652
Let's go to Jotunheim.

943
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,280
Nope.

944
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:58,074
There's something
we gotta take care of first.

945
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,200
What?

946
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:11,504
I ain't got nobody

947
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:16,259
Nobody cares for me
No--

948
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,978
I will ask again.

949
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:32,025
How many meta-power teammates
arrived with you to Corto Maltese?

950
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,236
Sixty-nine.

951
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,321
Sixty-nine?

952
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,907
How could you get 69 troops into the--

953
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:02,639
I'm so sad and lonely

954
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:11,230
Won't some sweet momma
Come and rescue me--

955
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:34,462
You gotta be kidding me.

956
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:35,981
You're gonna risk the entire mission

957
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,733
for a mental defective
dressed as a court jester.

958
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,818
This coming from a guy
that wears a toilet seat on his head.

959
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,945
- We don't leave one of our own behind.
- You're okay with this?

960
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,323
No, but I've been around Flag
when he's got a rag in his mouth.

961
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,015
- Best not to tug it.
- Motherfucker!

962
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,560
Hey, wake up, wake up.

963
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:50,812
All right, let's go.

964
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,085
All right,
we'll enter through the third floor,

965
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,361
go to the inner staircase,
and then down to the cellar

966
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,963
where they usually keep their detainees.

967
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,267
Hopefully, Harley's still alive.

968
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:04,409
It's not a toilet seat,
it's a beacon of freedom!

969
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,325
I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go

970
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:35,583
Paid for every dance
selling each romance

971
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,753
Ooh, what they're saying

972
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,674
There will come a day
and youth will pass away

973
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:46,427
What, what will they say about me

974
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:50,473
When the end comes I know
there's a just a gigolo's

975
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:53,392
Life goes on without me

976
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:57,939
I'm just a gigolo everywhere I go

977
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,779
Paid for every dance
selling each romance

978
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:07,990
Ooh, what they're saying

979
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:11,744
And there will come a day
and youth will pass away

980
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:15,081
What will they say about me

981
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:19,293
When the end comes I know
there's a just a gigolo's

982
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,670
Life goes on without me

983
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:29,637
'Cause I ain't got nobody

984
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:34,559
Oh and there's nobody that cares for me

985
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:38,271
There's nobody that cares for me

986
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:44,652
I'm so sad and lonely

987
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:45,935
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely

988
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,739
Won't some sweet mama

989
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,908
Come and take a chance with me

990
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,828
'Cause I ain't so bad

991
01:12:53,953 --> 01:13:00,418
Sing on, pretty love song
all of the time

992
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:05,256
She will only be, only be

993
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:15,725
I ain't got nobody

994
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:18,102
Oh and there's nobody that cares for me

995
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:24,775
There's nobody that cares for me

996
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,988
Nobody that cares for me

997
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,158
Nobody that cares for me

998
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:11,322
Hola.

999
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:22,625
Um...

1000
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,522
Ratatouille, what do you got?

1001
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,316
Third floor hallway's clear.

1002
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,151
Abner?

1003
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,946
There doesn't seem
to be any incoming traffic.

1004
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,156
Bird.

1005
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,618
Nanaue, stay off the comm.

1006
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,183
Colonel, I got a clean shot
on the only one in the office.

1007
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:04,709
Just give the word.

1008
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,136
Fire on three,

1009
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,513
- two--
- What are you guys doing?

1010
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:21,517
I... You.
We're here to save you.

1011
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:26,188
You were gonna... save me?

1012
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,899
It was a really good plan, too.

1013
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,736
Well, I can go back inside,
and you can still do it.

1014
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,362
That's patronizing.

1015
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,614
Yeah, no, it's not--

1016
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:39,535
Uh, what's with the javelin?

1017
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,120
I'm waiting for God to tell me.

1018
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,913
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

1019
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,875
Or Him. Or any of them, really.

1020
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,126
Okay.

1021
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:49,003
Okay.

1022
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,464
Are you two all right, yeah?

1023
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,066
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

1024
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:53,924
Harley Quinn.

1025
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,509
Bloodsport.

1026
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,225
All right, who ate
all the fucking empanadas?

1027
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,895
Mine were very good. I had the chicken.

1028
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,314
All right...

1029
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,150
here's the deal.
We fail the mission, you die.

1030
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:14,528
We find out any information
you give us is false, you die.

1031
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,865
If we find out you have
personalized license plates, you die.

1032
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,075
What? No.

1033
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,119
- If you mismatch blacks, you die.
- No.

1034
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:24,080
If you cough
without covering your mouth--

1035
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,457
Harley. Those last three aren't things.

1036
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,264
Although, probably
don't need to say this,

1037
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,044
but that isn't
an open invitation for you

1038
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,271
to cough without covering your mouth.

1039
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,148
All right, we're gonna need you
to drive the minibus,

1040
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,758
with all of us inside,
past the guards at the front gate.

1041
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,612
Once through the gate, we'll use you
to get through the retinal scanner.

1042
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,846
There are security cameras everywhere.

1043
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,640
They're being dealt with.

1044
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,569
We'll neutralize the soldiers there
and enter.

1045
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,239
Once we're inside,
we separate into teams.

1046
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:00,533
I am walking back and forth.

1047
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:01,699
Okay.

1048
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:04,023
You're gonna lead me and Ratcatcher 2
to Project Starfish.

1049
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:05,972
I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

1050
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,316
No, no, no,
you're coming with me.

1051
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,917
Our munitions expertise are needed
to place the explosives,

1052
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:13,546
starting at the first floor,
going all the way to the top.

1053
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,965
Once we're clear,
we blow the tits off that thing,

1054
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,424
and go home.

1055
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:19,802
This is suicide.

1056
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,804
Well, that's kind of our thing.

1057
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:23,681
Yeah.

1058
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,148
This is insane.

1059
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:14,273
Hey
Must be a devil between us

1060
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,859
Yeah, no.

1061
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:21,822
Whores at the door
Whore in my bed

1062
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,991
I love the rain.

1063
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,785
It's like angels are
splooging all over us.

1064
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,370
It's good for cover.

1065
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,080
Yep, that too.

1066
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,170
If you go, I will surely die

1067
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,381
We're chained

1068
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:42,218
We're chained

1069
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:47,431
We're chained

1070
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:49,183
We're chained

1071
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,602
We're chained

1072
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,313
We're chained

1073
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,232
We're chained

1074
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:59,068
We're chained

1075
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,612
We're chained

1076
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:03,572
We're chained

1077
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:06,659
We're chained

1078
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,741
You son of a bit--

1079
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:10,055
Input the emergency code. Now!

1080
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:12,349
Well, go on then!

1081
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:37,749
Yo!

1082
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,127
Okay, Pokey.

1083
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,670
You get a bomb,

1084
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:42,837
you get a bomb.

1085
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:44,816
Harley and I will meet you
up on the second floor.

1086
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,633
Yeah? All right.

1087
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,303
God damn it, Nanaue.

1088
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,972
No!

1089
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,682
Quit being a play baby.

1090
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:37,935
Peacemaker.

1091
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,479
It's actually very nice.

1092
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,356
Just put it against the wall.

1093
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,401
It looks nothing like me.

1094
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:46,985
Move. Move it.

1095
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,573
This way.

1096
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,095
Sí.

1097
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,645
Vámonos. Vámonos!

1098
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,105
Good God.

1099
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:06,773
If God existed,

1100
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:09,985
wouldn't this be proof
that he wasn't good at all?

1101
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:12,404
What the hell is this?

1102
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:15,199
I thought you were looking
for Project Starfish.

1103
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,161
You've brought us visitors,
have you, Grieves?

1104
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,747
Have you come to save me
from that madman?

1105
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:23,916
Thirty years he's kept me here.

1106
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,709
Tortured me.

1107
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:28,879
Had his way with me.

1108
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:10,295
I call it Starro the Conqueror.

1109
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:12,798
That's meant to be derisive.

1110
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:14,925
Sorry, old chum.

1111
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:17,928
These two are here to kill you.
It's out of my hands.

1112
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,888
We need to help these people.

1113
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:23,517
Impossible, dear.
They're corpses below those stars.

1114
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,435
Who are they?

1115
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:29,565
The fodder of powerful men
through every age.

1116
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:31,525
Dissidents,

1117
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,068
journalists,

1118
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,487
political rivals,

1119
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:38,156
and their loved ones.

1120
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:41,743
Oh, please,

1121
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:45,163
unclutch your fucking pearls, Flag.

1122
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,624
We serve the same master.

1123
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,335
We were sent here to stop you.

1124
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:51,503
Child,

1125
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:53,672
your government didn't send you here

1126
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:56,633
to protect the world
from alien technology.

1127
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,470
Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

1128
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:03,015
You're a goddamn liar.

1129
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:06,643
American goddamn astronauts
found Starro.

1130
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:09,938
Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.

1131
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:11,523
Although the Cold War was ended,

1132
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:16,111
your government saw the potential
in weaponizing such a powerful beast,

1133
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:21,283
but banish the thought of any such
experiments being held on American soil.

1134
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:26,830
Your people have always been squeamish
about the sacrifices necessary

1135
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,291
for scientific advancement.

1136
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:30,626
So,

1137
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,963
the United States made a secret deal
with the Corto Maltese government

1138
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,591
to conduct
their illegal experiments here

1139
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:38,842
in Jotunheim.

1140
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:41,178
And they hired me to oversee them.

1141
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:45,182
And now, because of
a run-of-the-mill fucking military coup,

1142
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:47,643
they're gonna destroy
30 years' worth of efforts.

1143
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,102
Yeah!

1144
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:50,979
You're the real victim here.

1145
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:54,000
The hell you doing here? You're supposed
to be upstairs planting explosives.

1146
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:55,817
I told you I didn't trust him.

1147
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,445
Your records are located
in those computers?

1148
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,575
Colonel, what are you doing?

1149
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:08,330
I joined the military to serve
my country, not to be its puppet.

1150
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:11,333
What are you doing?

1151
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:15,962
Who are you going
to show that to?

1152
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:19,216
The press.
Goddamn people deserve to know.

1153
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:21,027
I'm tired of covering up
their dirty little secrets.

1154
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:22,552
This time
these sons of bitches

1155
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:24,221
are gonna be held account--

1156
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:25,624
I can't let you do that, Colonel.

1157
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,349
- Excuse me?
- I'm truly sorry.

1158
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:30,370
Miss Waller charged me with making sure
those records don't leave this building.

1159
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:32,145
Of course, I shoulda known.

1160
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,648
Waller's always got a backup.

1161
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,566
Come on, man, this isn't personal.

1162
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:39,194
Holding a gun on me
is pretty fucking personal.

1163
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:41,613
What is that?

1164
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:43,824
I'm gonna need that drive, Colonel.

1165
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,577
Those morons set off
the explosives too early.

1166
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:48,787
Hand over the drive!

1167
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:51,373
Let's go, come on!

1168
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,999
They experimented on children.

1169
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:54,960
No one is saying
what they did was right.

1170
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:57,254
They experimented on children!

1171
01:26:57,421 --> 01:27:00,215
That information gets out,
it causes an international incident!

1172
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,676
Keeping the peace is worth any price,

1173
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,886
including the life
of a hero like yours, sir,

1174
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,221
so please...

1175
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,224
don't make me do this.

1176
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:49,848
What have you people done?

1177
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:07,657
Sebastian, come!

1178
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:45,654
Okay, we gotta calm down.
Let's all just... Let's talk about this.

1179
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,341
I understand where you're coming from.

1180
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:48,573
I crossed a line.

1181
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,283
Okay, I crossed a line!

1182
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,536
I realize that,
but I'm ready to change.

1183
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,538
I am ready to change.

1184
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:56,581
And I didn't mean to hurt you...

1185
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:48,652
You motherfucker.

1186
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:29,776
Peacemaker.

1187
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,154
What a joke.

1188
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:07,105
Cleo.

1189
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,483
Give me back the drive.

1190
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:34,424
I told you that information
can't get out. Fuck!

1191
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:38,303
So, okay, okay, destroy the hard drive.
Why Kill me?

1192
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:47,604
Because I'm thorough.

1193
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,024
Oh, my...

1194
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:52,859
Sorry, kid.

1195
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:54,486
No, no...

1196
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,538
All right, troops are coming.

1197
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:07,749
This floor, and then nine floors left.
Let's go!

1198
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,292
Come on!

1199
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:32,292
New dumb friends.

1200
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,473
Aw, fizzle sticks. Hold on.

1201
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:16,502
Has anyone got eyes or ears on any more?

1202
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:18,004
They killed Milton!

1203
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:21,883
Milton was still with us?

1204
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,730
- Where'd you think he was?
- I don't know.

1205
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,362
I thought he stayed back with the bus.

1206
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:26,429
What was Milton gonna do?

1207
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:27,847
He was helping us!

1208
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,017
- Who's Milton?
- What?

1209
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,852
I don't remember any Milton.

1210
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:36,314
Fuck! He has been with us
the whole time.

1211
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:37,857
Somebody named Milton

1212
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:40,693
- has been with us the whole time?
- Yes!

1213
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,504
I don't think so.
I think I would've noticed

1214
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:44,948
if a guy named Milton's been with us.

1215
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:46,532
It's not a very common name.

1216
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:49,244
I don't think
I've ever even met a Milton.

1217
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:51,246
Are you messing around right now?

1218
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:52,872
He was a really nice guy,

1219
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:55,416
and he sacrificed himself to help us.

1220
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,252
And now look at him.

1221
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:59,170
He's dead.

1222
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:05,551
Oh, that guy!
Milton, Milton.

1223
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,599
So, when did this great love affair
with Milton start?

1224
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,894
I liked him from the beginning, okay?
I just didn't say anything until--

1225
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:19,065
No!

1226
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,057
Harley! Give us a hand!

1227
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:26,025
Hey!

1228
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,913
Vamos. Vamos.

1229
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:23,833
Oh!

1230
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:15,676
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1231
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,640
Oh, fuck off!

1232
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,433
Oh.

1233
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:43,454
Sorry, kid.

1234
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:45,164
No, no, no.

1235
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:41,804
How?

1236
01:41:41,971 --> 01:41:43,681
Smaller bullets.

1237
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:50,938
He killed Colonel Flag.

1238
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:54,150
He wanted to share this with the press.

1239
01:41:54,317 --> 01:41:56,068
It's proof the American government

1240
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:58,904
was behind Project Starfish
the whole time.

1241
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:34,940
Whoa. Whoa.

1242
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:51,791
I think it's trying to get out.

1243
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:53,668
- What?
- Starro the--

1244
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:17,858
Whoa.

1245
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:29,138
Cover your faces!

1246
01:45:17,102 --> 01:45:18,103
Si.

1247
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:19,688
Si.

1248
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:54,765
- Whoa.
- What the fuck is that?

1249
01:45:54,849 --> 01:45:56,392
Uh... Hey, guys?

1250
01:45:59,144 --> 01:46:00,729
Oh, shit, there's...

1251
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:21,625
This city is mine.

1252
01:46:52,031 --> 01:46:55,159
Uh, Miss Waller,
I think the feed is back up.

1253
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:59,622
Oh, my God, Miss Waller!

1254
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:02,207
We've got a freaking kaiju
up in this shit!

1255
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:12,760
Task Force X, come in.

1256
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:14,386
Are you there?

1257
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,390
Uh-huh.

1258
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:19,767
Whatever signal jammers

1259
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,226
were blocking our communications

1260
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:23,204
must have been in the building
you just demolished.

1261
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:26,190
Yeah, well, we've got a mite issue
over here, Waller.

1262
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:28,484
It's Project Starfish, Miss Waller.

1263
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:29,944
It's headed towards the city,

1264
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:32,947
and I think it wants to feed
on as many people as it can.

1265
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:38,327
Not our problem.

1266
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:40,829
If you've destroyed Jotunheim
and the records within,

1267
01:47:40,913 --> 01:47:42,414
you've achieved the objective.

1268
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:45,084
Corto Maltese is no longer a U.S. ally.

1269
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:46,890
If anything,
the White House will consider

1270
01:47:46,961 --> 01:47:48,796
fomenting disruption in a hostile nation

1271
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:50,172
a positive development.

1272
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:25,207
You heard what she said.

1273
01:48:46,437 --> 01:48:47,438
Fuck.

1274
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:54,862
Bloodsport is off mission.

1275
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:56,113
What the...

1276
01:48:57,197 --> 01:48:58,824
She'll kill you, you know.

1277
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:00,200
That's her business.

1278
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:03,871
I knew Sebastian sensed good in you
for a reason.

1279
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:06,331
Just keep that fucking rat away from me.

1280
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:08,250
Ratcatcher is also off mission.

1281
01:49:08,751 --> 01:49:10,002
Bloodsport, Ratcatcher,

1282
01:49:10,169 --> 01:49:12,671
- turn around.
- Where go, friends?

1283
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,631
Nanaue!

1284
01:49:16,133 --> 01:49:18,635
I know what I'm carrying
the javelin for.

1285
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:30,314
Krill, turn around now!

1286
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:32,691
Turn back now, God damn it!

1287
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:36,612
- Open it.
- Miss Waller--

1288
01:49:36,779 --> 01:49:37,779
Open it!

1289
01:49:39,531 --> 01:49:41,200
What are you doing, Task Force X?

1290
01:49:46,455 --> 01:49:48,040
Fuck!

1291
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:51,877
Turn around now, God damn it!

1292
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:54,755
You dumb pieces of shit!

1293
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:56,215
Motherfuckers!

1294
01:49:57,758 --> 01:50:00,219
God damn it, Task Force X,
this is your last

1295
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:02,387
motherfucking warning!

1296
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:10,104
Oh, my God!
What the fuck did you do?

1297
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:13,107
All those people, John.

1298
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:15,234
Little kids.

1299
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:24,118
Task Force X, the creature is headed
to Calle Principal.

1300
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:25,452
Avoid Avenida Medrano,

1301
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:27,579
- there is a swarm of infected.
- Jesus.

1302
01:50:27,746 --> 01:50:31,333
So, your clearest path is Calle Aguero.

1303
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,294
Get on the satellite, Dale,
you fucking dickhead!

1304
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:35,879
Yes, ma'am.

1305
01:51:58,128 --> 01:51:59,421
Huh?

1306
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:06,553
Harley, take the high ground!

1307
01:52:12,893 --> 01:52:16,605
Nanaue! Monster is nom nom!

1308
01:52:16,772 --> 01:52:19,233
Monster nom nom?

1309
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:20,691
Yes!

1310
01:52:29,493 --> 01:52:31,662
Abner, do you see who that is?

1311
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:33,497
Huh?

1312
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:35,207
It's your mom!

1313
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:10,909
I'm a superhero!

1314
01:53:11,493 --> 01:53:13,662
I'm a motherfucking super--

1315
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:04,963
God!

1316
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:14,639
No! No!

1317
01:54:32,074 --> 01:54:33,367
Oh, no...

1318
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:43,627
This city

1319
01:54:43,794 --> 01:54:47,381
is mine!

1320
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:50,133
This city isn't yours.

1321
01:54:51,259 --> 01:54:53,762
This city isn't ours.

1322
01:54:54,346 --> 01:54:56,473
This city is theirs.

1323
01:55:00,477 --> 01:55:02,020
Oh, hell.

1324
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,226
Why rats, Papa?

1325
01:56:24,352 --> 01:56:28,482
Rats are the lowliest and most despised
of all creatures, my love.

1326
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:31,193
If they have purpose...

1327
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:34,529
so do we all.

1328
01:58:20,635 --> 01:58:22,804
I was happy,

1329
01:58:22,971 --> 01:58:27,475
floating, staring at the stars.

1330
01:59:01,009 --> 01:59:02,469
A group of escaped convicts

1331
01:59:02,552 --> 01:59:03,553
saved a city of millions

1332
01:59:03,637 --> 01:59:07,557
on the small island nation
of Corto Maltese today.

1333
01:59:07,724 --> 01:59:08,808
That's my dad.

1334
01:59:10,518 --> 01:59:11,770
Because of these people,

1335
01:59:11,936 --> 01:59:15,065
Corto Maltese will have
free democratic elections

1336
01:59:15,148 --> 01:59:17,942
- for the first time in 90 years.
- Viva

1337
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:20,945
Corto Maltese! Viva...

1338
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:23,323
Corto Maltese! Viva...

1339
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:25,575
Corto Maltese! Viva...

1340
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:28,244
- That's my dad.
- ...Corto Maltese! Viva...

1341
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:37,837
Yeah.

1342
01:59:40,507 --> 01:59:41,507
Yeah.

1343
01:59:42,717 --> 01:59:44,844
Oh, that's just a taste
of what's on that drive.

1344
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:47,305
I've uploaded it all to a secure server.

1345
01:59:48,264 --> 01:59:50,141
Now, if you kill any one of us,

1346
01:59:50,308 --> 01:59:52,310
or my daughter ever sees
the inside of a prison,

1347
01:59:52,477 --> 01:59:53,728
it goes public.

1348
01:59:53,895 --> 01:59:55,355
If we all go free,

1349
01:59:55,522 --> 01:59:57,440
it never has to see the light of day.

1350
01:59:59,067 --> 02:00:01,611
I told you
I'd make you a leader, Dubois.

1351
02:00:02,904 --> 02:00:04,280
You got a deal.

1352
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:25,552
Nanaue.

1353
02:00:41,484 --> 02:00:43,820
Look, I know Flag wanted
to give the drive to the press,

1354
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:47,574
but we just saved a whole bloody city.
We can't have it all.

1355
02:00:50,493 --> 02:00:51,661
Flag was my friend.

1356
02:00:51,828 --> 02:00:53,246
Mine too.

1357
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:56,916
And I haven't got many of those.

1358
02:00:59,210 --> 02:01:01,421
I could be your friend, Milton.

1359
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:02,922
Not my name.

1360
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:04,674
What?

1361
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:07,010
What are you talking about?
We just had a conversation

1362
02:01:07,093 --> 02:01:09,304
for, like, three hours
about how your name is Milton.

1363
02:01:09,471 --> 02:01:10,722
Didn't.

1364
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:12,182
Yes, we did.

1365
02:01:12,348 --> 02:01:14,392
No. Our ride's here.

1366
02:01:14,476 --> 02:01:16,269
Hmm.

1367
02:01:18,188 --> 02:01:19,439
Nom nom?

1368
02:01:19,606 --> 02:01:20,440
Really?

1369
02:01:20,607 --> 02:01:22,650
That is what you're
thinking about right now?

1370
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:25,111
No. That nom nom though.

1371
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:26,821
No, it's not nom nom.

1372
02:01:28,865 --> 02:01:30,200
No!

1373
02:01:40,835 --> 02:01:42,035
I don't care about a fancy car

1374
02:01:44,255 --> 02:01:46,758
Unless it's taking me to you

1375
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:51,221
And I don't care about how far you are

1376
02:01:51,638 --> 02:01:55,809
You know I'll always come through
for you

1377
02:02:09,197 --> 02:02:12,492
I don't wanna miss
another birthday party

1378
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:15,745
Or any day in between

1379
02:02:16,371 --> 02:02:19,874
I picture us holding hands
when we're older

1380
02:02:20,083 --> 02:02:22,585
Though it's probably just a dream

1381
02:02:22,669 --> 02:02:26,589
'Cause life is so busted

1382
02:02:26,673 --> 02:02:29,968
Life is so busted

1383
02:02:30,051 --> 02:02:33,763
My car is so busted

1384
02:02:33,847 --> 02:02:36,975
Life I'm so busted

1385
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:40,728
And I just wanted to be loved by you
by you

1386
02:02:42,605 --> 02:02:44,607
I just wanted to be loved by you, by you

1387
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:48,069
I just wanted to be loved by you

1388
02:03:50,089 --> 02:03:53,301
There's smoke in the sky again
So I'm getting high again

1389
02:03:53,384 --> 02:03:55,887
Take another hit to the diaphragm

1390
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,680
I never drew the diagram

1391
02:03:57,764 --> 02:04:01,476
How to deal with this shit
So I steal and lie again, whoa

1392
02:04:01,851 --> 02:04:03,770
You're my dream, you're my nightmare

1393
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:07,231
Life is a bitch, she don't fight fair
Leave you right there

1394
02:04:07,315 --> 02:04:10,109
I was hoping
that you'd notice my despair

1395
02:04:10,193 --> 02:04:13,154
Run away from the pain
I don't care, 'cause

1396
02:04:14,197 --> 02:04:18,952
First they incite the violence

1397
02:04:19,035 --> 02:04:24,624
Turn around and then
they invite the silence

1398
02:04:24,707 --> 02:04:30,838
Burn it down and I think I need
some guidance

1399
02:04:30,922 --> 02:04:33,383
The kids don't stand a chance

1400
02:04:33,675 --> 02:04:36,386
No, the kids don't stand a chance

1401
02:04:37,512 --> 02:04:40,974
Old man trouble back again
Fucking up my plans, like

1402
02:04:41,057 --> 02:04:43,351
Oh no! Oh no!

1403
02:04:43,434 --> 02:04:46,813
I'm back to the black again
Getting fucked up again

1404
02:04:46,896 --> 02:04:49,232
Oh no! Oh no!

1405
02:04:49,399 --> 02:04:52,694
Old man trouble back again
Thought I had the upper hand

1406
02:04:52,777 --> 02:04:55,321
Oh no! Oh no!

1407
02:04:55,405 --> 02:04:58,574
I'm back to the black again
Getting fucked up again

1408
02:04:58,658 --> 02:05:00,410
Oh no! Oh no!

1409
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:05,039
Now I drink, smoke
Whatever you selling, I'm a sick joke

1410
02:05:05,123 --> 02:05:07,917
My president's a felon
and I can't cope

1411
02:05:08,001 --> 02:05:09,377
I'm in love with the pain

1412
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:12,296
So I stick, poke with my kinfolk

1413
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:16,801
Gimme drink, smoke
Whatever you selling, I'm a sick joke

1414
02:05:16,884 --> 02:05:19,846
My president's a felon, and I can't cope

1415
02:05:19,929 --> 02:05:21,472
I'm in love with the pain

1416
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:24,559
We taking on the system
'cause it broke, woo!

1417
02:05:29,397 --> 02:05:30,773
Oh, no!

1418
02:05:30,857 --> 02:05:34,235
Old man trouble back again
Fucking up my plans, like

1419
02:05:34,318 --> 02:05:36,738
Oh no! Oh no!

1420
02:05:36,821 --> 02:05:40,199
I'm back to the black again
Getting fucked up again

1421
02:05:40,283 --> 02:05:42,660
Oh no! Oh no!

1422
02:05:42,744 --> 02:05:46,039
Old man trouble back again
Thought I had the upper hand

1423
02:05:46,122 --> 02:05:48,624
Oh no! Oh no!

1424
02:05:48,708 --> 02:05:51,961
I'm back to the black again
Getting fucked up again

1425
02:05:52,045 --> 02:05:54,380
Oh no! Oh no!

1426
02:10:53,971 --> 02:10:55,765
Said they found him in the rubble.

1427
02:10:55,931 --> 02:10:57,731
They were shocked
his heart was still beating.

1428
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:00,394
I wasn't certain how safe it was,
shipping him back here.

1429
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:03,689
But, if anything,
he's shown he's resilient.

1430
02:11:03,773 --> 02:11:07,485
It'll take some surgery, but eventually
we'll get him back up to speed.

1431
02:11:09,278 --> 02:11:11,072
You realize this is revenge, right?

1432
02:11:11,238 --> 02:11:12,656
Waller knows we double-crossed her,

1433
02:11:12,823 --> 02:11:16,118
and she's getting back at us
by saddling us with this douche bag.

1434
02:11:16,285 --> 02:11:17,370
Yep.

1435
02:11:17,661 --> 02:11:19,955
I heard he was sort of a hero
down in Corto Maltese.

1436
02:11:20,122 --> 02:11:22,291
Oh, is that what you heard?
Because not quite.

1437
02:11:24,335 --> 02:11:26,045
What do you guys
want him for?

1438
02:11:27,088 --> 02:11:30,341
Just to save the fucking world,
that's all.
