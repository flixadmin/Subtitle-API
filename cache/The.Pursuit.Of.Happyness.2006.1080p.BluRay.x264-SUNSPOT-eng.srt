1
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,559
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,080
All right, Dad.
Come on.

3
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,578
Should be here soon.

4
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:52,263
♪ Go marching in

5
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:55,004
♪ Oh, when the saints
Go marching... ♪

6
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:40,978
I think I should make a list.
Uh, what do mean?

7
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:43,580
For your birthday gifts?
Yeah.

8
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:46,333
Well, you know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

9
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:47,385
Yeah, I know.

10
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,170
Just to look at and study,

11
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:50,571
so I can choose better.

12
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:54,041
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

13
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:56,109
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

14
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,695
I think so.

15
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,885
All right.
That's good.

16
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,686
How you doing in here, man?

17
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,710
Okay.

18
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:15,762
Can we go to the park today?

19
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:16,797
After?

20
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:19,033
Um. No, I gotta
go to Oakland.

21
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:21,268
Well, uh...
maybe. We'll see.

22
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:22,609
Give me a kiss.

23
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:25,411
I'll talk to you later.

24
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:30,199
Excuse me.

25
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:33,397
Oh. Excuse me, uh...

26
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,871
when is, uh, somebody
gonna clean this off?

27
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:39,653
And... And...
And the Y?

28
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:41,439
The Y. We talked
about this.

29
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,990
It's an I in "happiness."

30
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:44,813
There's no Y in "happiness."
It's an I.

31
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,380
<i>I'm Chris Gardner.</i>

32
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:51,165
<i>I met my father
for the first time</i>

33
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,300
<i>when I was 28 years old.</i>

34
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,185
<i>And I made up my mind
as a young kid</i>

35
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,921
<i>that when I had children,</i>

36
00:04:56,945 --> 00:05:00,112
<i>my children were gonna know
who their father was.</i>

37
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,166
<i>This is part of my life story.</i>

38
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,665
<i>This part is called</i>

39
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,639
<i>"Riding the Bus."</i>

40
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:16,629
What's that?

41
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:20,261
It's a time machine, isn't it?

42
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:22,663
Seems like a time machine.

43
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:24,198
That seems like a time machine.

44
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:25,949
It's a time machine.
Take me with you.

45
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:27,668
<i>This machine...</i>

46
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,053
<i>This machine on my lap...</i>

47
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,221
This guy, he has a time machine.

48
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:33,407
He... He... He travels.
He travels in the past

49
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:34,491
with this machine and...

50
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,927
<i>it is not a time machine.</i>

51
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:40,348
<i>It's a portable
bone-density scanner.</i>

52
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:43,734
<i>A medical device
I sell for a living.</i>

53
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:46,570
Thank you for the opportunity
to... To discuss it with you.

54
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:48,573
I appreciate it.
We just don't need it, Chris.

55
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,541
It's unnecessary.
And expensive.

56
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:51,980
Well, maybe next...
Thank you.

57
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:57,497
<i>It gave a slightly denser
picture than an x-ray...</i>

58
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,038
<i>for twice the money.</i>

59
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:03,654
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

60
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,522
What happened?
Uh... No, nothing.

61
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:07,542
Look, I can't get
Christopher today.

62
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:08,943
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I need...

63
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,027
I'm back on at 7.

64
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:12,180
I know. I have got
to go to Oakland.

65
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,914
So I gotta get Christopher home,

66
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,332
feed him, bathe him,

67
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:18,970
get him in bed, and be back here by 7?
Yes.

68
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:20,454
And we got
the tax bill notice today.

69
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:21,972
What are you gonna do
about that?

70
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:23,313
Look. This is what
we gotta do.

71
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,747
<i>You see that car?</i>

72
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:32,700
<i>The one with the pretty
yellow shoe on it?</i>

73
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:34,285
<i>That's mine.</i>

74
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,453
<i>There's no parking
near hospitals.</i>

75
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:39,290
<i>That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.</i>

76
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:41,275
Thanks anyway.
Uh, very much.

77
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:43,165
Uh... Uh, maybe next quarter.
It's possible.

78
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:48,015
<i>I needed to sell at least
two scanners a month</i>

79
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,468
<i>for rent and daycare.</i>

80
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:53,053
<i>I'd have to sell one more</i>

81
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:56,629
<i>to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.</i>

82
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,488
<i>The problem is...</i>

83
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,307
<i>I haven't sold any for a while.</i>

84
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,590
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

85
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:15,448
Since birth?

86
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,831
What's that?
What?

87
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:22,633
What is this?

88
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:24,117
It's a gift for Christopher.

89
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:26,820
From who?
Cynthia from work.

90
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:28,405
It's for adults.
Chris can't use it.

91
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:30,141
She didn't know.

92
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,275
What are you supposed to

93
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:32,843
do with it?

94
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:35,702
Make every side the same color.

95
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,504
Did you pay the taxes?

96
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:42,625
No, I'm gonna have to,
uh, file an extension.

97
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:45,589
You already filed an extension.

98
00:07:45,613 --> 00:07:48,258
Yeah, well, I gotta
file another one.

99
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:49,810
That's...
It's $650.

100
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,150
I'll have it in the next month.

101
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:54,498
That means interest, right?

102
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:57,067
And a penalty?
Yeah, a little bit.

103
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:59,503
Look, why don't you
let me do this?

104
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:02,907
All right, just relax.
Okay?

105
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:04,675
Now, come here.
Calm down.

106
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:07,433
I have to go back to work.

107
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,370
Let's get ready for bed.

108
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:19,440
Hey, uh, put your plate
in the sink.

109
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,560
<i>A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for.</i>

110
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,862
<i>A comprehensive audit,
if you will,</i>

111
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:26,963
<i>of our economic condition.</i>

112
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:29,916
<i>You won't like it.
I didn't like it.</i>

113
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,768
<i>But we have to face the truth</i>

114
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,605
<i>and then go to work
to turn things around.</i>

115
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:36,439
<i>And make no mistake about it...</i>

116
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:38,608
<i>we can turn them around.</i>

117
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:41,862
<i>The federal budget
is out of control.</i>

118
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:45,449
<i>And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion</i>

119
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:46,867
<i>for this budget year</i>

120
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:49,086
<i>that ends September 30th.</i>

121
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,704
<i>That deficit is larger</i>

122
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:53,395
<i>than the entire
federal budget in 1957.</i>

123
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,294
<i>And so is the almost $80 billion</i>

124
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:02,232
<i>we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.</i>

125
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:04,969
<i>Twenty years ago, in 1960,</i>

126
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,587
<i>our federal government payroll</i>

127
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,093
<i>was less than $13 billion.</i>

128
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,242
<i>Today it is 75 billion.</i>

129
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:14,511
<i>During these 20 years,
our population</i>

130
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:18,337
<i>has only increased
by 23.3 percent...</i>

131
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:37,168
Woo! Man.

132
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:38,953
I got two questions for you:

133
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,110
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

134
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:44,842
I'm a stockbroker.

135
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,893
Stockbroker.
Oh, goodness.

136
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:49,063
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

137
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:50,280
You don't have to.

138
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:51,631
Had to be good with numbers

139
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:53,184
and good with people.

140
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,585
That's it.
Hey, you take care.

141
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,905
Hey. I'm gonna let you hang on
to my car for the weekend.

142
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,296
But I need it back for Monday.
Feed the meter.

143
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:10,038
<i>I still remember that moment.</i>

144
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:16,841
<i>They all looked so...</i>

145
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,997
<i>damn happy to me.</i>

146
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,591
<i>Why couldn't I look like that?</i>

147
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:47,604
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

148
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:50,958
I'm, uh, gonna stop by
a brokerage firm after work.

149
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:51,975
For what?

150
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,411
I wanna see about a job there.

151
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:56,185
Yeah? What job?

152
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,783
Uh, you know, when I...

153
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,401
When I was a kid,
I could go through a...

154
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:02,719
A math book in a week.

155
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:04,221
So I'm gonna go see about, uh,

156
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:05,872
a job they got down there.

157
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:07,057
Oh.

158
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,598
What job?

159
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,569
Stockbroker.

160
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,767
Stockbroker?

161
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,653

Don't talk to me

00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,460
Is it an adjective?

268

Uh, no. Actually,
it's a noun.

269
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,380
But it's not spelled right.

270
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:48,787
Is "fuck" spelled right?

271
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,368
Yeah, that's spelled right.

272
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:52,953
But that's not part
of the motto,

273
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:54,520
so you're not supposed
to learn that.

274
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:56,890
That's an adult word

Don't use that one, okay?

00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:11,893
"Hot Rod."

283
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,794
Did you have a nickname?
Yep.

284
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:20,663
What?
"Ten-Gallon Head."

285
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:21,714
Heh-heh.
What's that?

286
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:23,834
I grew up in Louisiana,
near Texas.

287
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:26,269
So everybody wears
cowboy hats. And a...

288
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:28,672
A ten-gallon's a big hat.

289

313

You late pay anyway.
You complain.

I complain.

315

00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:39,519
<i>and a hug.</i>

323
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,137
<i>I just had to show him</i>

324
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,756
<i>I was good with numbers
and good with people.</i>

325
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,492
Morning, Mr. Twistle.
Good morning.

326
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:47,343
Mr. Twistle. Chris Gardner.
Hi. Hi.

327
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:48,928
I wanted to
drop this off personally

328
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:50,112
and make your acquaintance.

329
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:51,714
I thought I'd catch you
on the way in.

330
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:54,050
I'd really love the opportunity
to sit and discuss

331
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:56,169
what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

332
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:57,487
We'll start with this, Chris,

333
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:59,155
and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

334
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,980
Yes, sir. You have a great day.
You too.

335
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:10,784
<i>Hey. Uh, yeah, how you doing?</i>

336
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:12,986
This is Chris Gardner
calling for Dr. Delsey.

337
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,489
Uh, yeah, look, I'm running
a little late for a sales call.

338
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:19,058
I was... I was wondering if...
Yeah, Osteo National.

339
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:21,945
Right. Uh, we can still...?
Half an hour?

340
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:25,036
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

341
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:37,615
Hey! Hey!

342
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,130
Hey!

343
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:42,532
<i>This part of my life...</i>

344
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:43,750
Wait!

345
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:45,607
<i>This part here...</i>

346
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:49,072
<i>it's called "Running."</i>

347
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:51,224
Hey! Hey!

348
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:52,531
Wait!

349
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,095
Hey! Wait!

350
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,832
<i>That was</i> my <i>stolen machine.</i>

351
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:01,289
<i>Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.</i>

352
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:04,003
<i>Which was unlikely...</i>

353
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:06,789
<i>because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.</i>

354
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:10,048
<i>I spent our entire life
savings on these things.</i>

355
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,596
<i>It was such
a revolutionary machine.</i>

356
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,666
Ooh.

357
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,951
Can you feel it, baby?

358
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:19,819
Oh, yeah. You got me
doing all the work.

359
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:22,922
<i>What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals</i>

360
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:25,780
<i>would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.</i>

361
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,870
<i>I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.</i>

362
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,002
<i>So if I lost one, it was like</i>

363
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:38,193
<i>losing a month's groceries.</i>

364
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:44,533
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

365
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:49,638
Hey! Get back here!

366
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:55,989
Hey, man, uh...

367
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:57,662
Uh, I... Uh...

368
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:01,983
Who's he?
He's that guy.

369
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:13,456
<i>Did you forget?</i>

370
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Forget what?

371
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,612
You're not supposed to
have any of those.

372
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:20,830
Yeah, I know.

373
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:22,921
You have two now.

374
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:34,800
Hey.

375
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:39,404
Hey, Mom.

376
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:46,406
<i>One...</i>

377
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,390
two...
Two.

378
00:22:47,414 --> 00:22:48,424
Three!

379
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:49,442
Whoo!

380
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:51,260
That's a basketball!

381
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:53,196
Hey, hey.
What do you mean?

382
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,047
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

383
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:56,265
This could be an ant farm.

384
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,885
This... This could be a...
A microscope or anything.

385
00:22:58,909 --> 00:22:59,919
No, it's not.

386
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,821
There, there.

387
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:04,078
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

388
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,715
That paper's a little heavy, huh?

389
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:15,807
Yeah, but I got it.

390
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:28,881
Yeah, you should've
seen me out there today. Uh...

391
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:31,501
Somebody, uh, stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down...

392
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:33,158
Whatever.

393
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:37,562
What?
Whatever, Chris.

394
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:40,743
What the hell
you got attitude about?

395
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:41,895
"Whatever" what?

396
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,713
Every day's got some damn story.

397
00:23:43,737 --> 00:23:45,381
Hey, hey, Roy.
Roy!

398
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:47,600
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

399
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:49,035
There's dust and shit all over.

400
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:50,486
I'm trying to keep
a clean house.

401
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,005
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second.

402
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:54,674
Listen.
Look, Linda. Relax.

403
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:56,576
We're gonna come out of this.

404
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,120
Everything is gonna
be fine, all right?

405
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:03,666
You said that before, when
I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

406
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,251
So you don't trust me now?

407
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:07,976
Whatever.
I don't care.

408
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:26,306
Taxi!
Mr. Twistle.

409
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,175
Yeah, hi.
Hi. Chris Gardner.

410
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:31,094
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

411
00:24:31,118 --> 00:24:33,262
I submitted an application
for the intern program

412
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:34,547
about a month ago,

413
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:36,482
and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

414
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:39,452
Listen, I'm going to
Noe Valley, Chris.

415
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:40,453
Uh, take care of yourself.

416
00:24:40,477 --> 00:24:42,522
Mr. Twistle.

417
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:45,057
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

418
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:47,132
Uh... how about
we share a ride?

419
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,552
All right, get in.
All right.

420
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:59,572
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor

421
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:02,575
who loved to play golf, hour...
Hours every day.

422
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:05,244
And... I would actually...

423
00:25:05,268 --> 00:25:07,347
perform medical procedures

424
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:08,798
when he'd leave me
in the office.

425
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:10,966
So... I'm... I'm used to
being in a position

426
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,192
where... Where I have to
make decisions and...

427
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:18,975
Mr. Twistle. Listen, this is...
This is a very important...

428
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:21,850
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh.
Th... This thing's impossible.

429
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:25,915
I can do it.
No, you can't. No one can.

430
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:28,868
That's bullshit.
No. I'm pretty sure I can do it.

431
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:30,370
Mm. No, you can't.

432
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:32,071
Let me see it.

433
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,961
Give it here.

434
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,160
Oh, yeah. Oh.

435
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:40,830
Wow, you... You, uh,
really messed it up.

436
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:42,382
Heh. Sorry.

437
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:46,519
Uh... it... It looks like it...
It, uh, works around a swivel,

438
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:49,639
so the center pieces never move.

439
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:51,441
So if it's yellow in the center,

440
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:52,858
that's the yellow side.
Right.

441
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:55,328
If it's red in the center,
that's the... red side.

442
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:57,263
Okay.
All right. So...

443
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,566
You... You can slow down.

444
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,317
Uh, listen, we can
drive around all day.

445
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:02,735
I don't believe you can do this.

446
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,320
Uh, yeah, I can.
No. No, you can't.

447
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:05,788
Yes, I can.
No, you can't.

448
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:07,962
I'm telling you,
no one can. It's tough.

449
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,249
See? That's all
I ever do.

450
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:13,552
Uh, uh, uh...

451
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:26,130
Y-you almost have this side.

452
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,434
Holy cow.

453
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:40,945
Oh. Oh, you almost
had that one.

454
00:26:42,297 --> 00:26:43,448
I'm gonna get it.

455
00:26:50,473 --> 00:26:52,607
Look at that.

456
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:17,232
You're almost there.

457
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:42,368
17.10.

458
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:43,774
Oh, this is me.

459
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:48,229
Good job.

460
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:50,676
Goodbye.

461
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,134
Yeah. I'll see...
See you soon.

462
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:57,600
Uh, where are you going, sir?

463
00:27:57,624 --> 00:27:59,235
Excuse me, sir.

464
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:00,820
Where are you going, please?

465
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:02,638
Uh... Um...

466
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:05,374
Uh, two...
A couple blocks.

467
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:07,193
Just, you know, flip around.

468
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:09,067
Okay.

469
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:53,373
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

470
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:54,774
Where are you going?!
Come here!

471
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,327
No! No!
No. No, no, no, no!

472
00:28:57,351 --> 00:28:59,963
Hey! You asshole. Give me
my money! Give me my money.

473
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:01,864
Please stop.
Please, please. Please!

474
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:02,815
Son of a bitch.

475
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,333
Please! He should've paid you!

476
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:05,852
He should've paid you!
Come here!

477
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,136
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,305
I'm so sorry.
Come here. I'll kick your ass!

479
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:11,558
I'm sorry!

480
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:12,880
Idiot.

481
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:24,804
I'll get you!

482
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:28,713
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

483
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:45,875
Hey!

484
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,828
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

485
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:50,401
Stop him!

486
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,324
Stop him!

487
00:30:02,297 --> 00:30:04,143
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

488
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:07,068
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

489
00:30:15,978 --> 00:30:16,978
No! No! No!

490
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:22,583
No!

491
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,702
<i>Hello?</i>

492
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:48,454
Hey. Yeah.

493
00:30:48,478 --> 00:30:50,423
Sorry... Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

494
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:52,508
<i>Chris. I missed my shift.</i>

495
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:54,843
Yeah, I... I know.
I'm sorry about that.

496
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:56,345
Look, um... I'm
on my way right now.

497
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:57,997
Are you all right
with Christopher?

498
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:00,933
<i>I'm leaving.
Chris, I'm leaving.</i>

499
00:31:00,957 --> 00:31:03,169
What?
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

500
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:07,557
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

501
00:31:07,581 --> 00:31:09,842
and we're gonna leave now.

502
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:11,277
<i>I'm gonna put the phone down...</i>

503
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:12,962
Linda. Wait a minute.
Hold it... Hold...

504
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:14,101
<i>We are leaving.</i>

505
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:22,438
<i>It was right then
that I started thinking</i>

506
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:25,692
<i>about Thomas Jefferson...</i>
Wait, wait!

507
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:27,876
<i>And the Declaration
of Independence...</i>

508
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,312
<i>and the part about
our right to life,</i>

509
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.</i>

510
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:36,035
<i>And I remember thinking:</i>

511
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,152
<i>How did he know...</i>

512
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:41,040
<i>to put the "pursuit"
part in there?</i>

513
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:42,758
<i>That maybe happiness
is something</i>

514
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:45,361
<i>that we can only pursue.</i>

515
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:49,115
<i>And maybe we can actually
never have it...</i>

516
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:50,783
<i>no matter what.</i>

517
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:52,923
<i>How did he know that?</i>

518
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,881
Linda. Linda.

519
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:35,361
Hello?
<i>Chris.</i>

520
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:38,347
Who is this?
<i>Jay Twistle.</i>

521
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:40,816
Uh... Hey.
<i>Dean Witter.</i>

522
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,785
Yeah, of course. Uh...
Uh... how are you?

523
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:46,155
<i>I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?</i>

524
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:47,606
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

525
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,709
<i>I'll tell you what.
Come on by day after tomorrow,</i>

526
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:50,993
<i>in the morning.</i>

527
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:52,961
<i>We're interviewing
for the internships.</i>

528
00:32:52,985 --> 00:32:54,096
<i>You got a pen and paper?</i>

529
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,815
Uh. Yes. Uh, yes, I do.

530
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,636
Um... Uh. Hold on one second.

531
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,510
<i>All right.</i>

532
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:08,343
<i>Hello?</i>

533
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:09,595
<i>Chris?</i>

534
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:11,347
Uh... Uh, go ahead. I have one.

535
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:13,015
<i>Write this number down
so you can call</i>

536
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,785
<i>my secretary, Janice, and she
can give you all the specifics.</i>

537
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,336
Yep.
<i>Okay, 415.</i>

538
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,487
415.

539
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:20,273
<i>864.
864.</i>

540
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:22,541
<i>0256.
0256.</i>

541
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:25,694
<i>Yeah, extension 4796.</i>
4796.

542
00:33:25,718 --> 00:33:30,149
<i>Right. Call her tomorrow.</i>
Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

543
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:31,684
<i>Okay, buddy.
All right, yes.</i>

544
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:34,187
Thank you very much.
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

545
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:37,740
864-0256.

546
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:41,065
4796. Janice.

547
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:46,148
Chris.
Hey.

548
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:48,901
Did you, uh...? Have you seen,
uh, Linda and Christopher?

549
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:50,385
No. You catch
the game last night?

550
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:52,688
No, no.
You didn't see that, 118-1... One...

551
00:33:52,712 --> 00:33:55,123
Excuse me, did, uh, Linda
and Christopher come in here?

552
00:33:55,147 --> 00:33:59,712
No, I haven't see them.
119-120. Double overtime.

553
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,430
Moons hits a three-pointer,
17 seconds left.

554
00:34:01,454 --> 00:34:03,015
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

555
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,833
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

556
00:34:04,857 --> 00:34:06,719
What's your problem
with numbers?

557
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:09,021
8642.

558
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:10,122
And you owe me money.
Yeah.

559
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:11,957
You owe me $14.

560
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:14,693
I'm gonna get that to you.

561
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,334
I need my money.
I need my money.

562
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,487
Fourteen's a number.

563
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:50,479
Hey. Don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

564
00:34:50,503 --> 00:34:51,847
Do you hear me?
Leave me alone!

565
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:53,666
Don't take my son away
from me again.

566
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,584
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

567
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:57,752
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

568
00:34:57,776 --> 00:34:59,455
Do you hear me?

569
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,939
Do you wanna leave?
Yeah.

570
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:02,913
You wanna leave?
Yes, I want to leave!

571
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,012
Get the hell out
of here, then, Linda.

572
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:08,597
Get the hell out of here.

573
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:10,031
Christopher's staying with me.

574
00:35:10,055 --> 00:35:12,351
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

575
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:15,871
You are so weak...
No. I am not happy anymore.

576
00:35:15,895 --> 00:35:18,690
I'm just not happy!
Then go get happy, Linda!

577
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:20,509
Just go get happy.

578
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:22,578
But Christopher's
living with me!

579
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:25,047
Stop!
Did you hear what I said?!

580
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:27,054
Christopher's living with me!

581
00:35:52,998 --> 00:35:56,044
Hey. Come... Come on.
Let's go.

582
00:35:56,068 --> 00:35:58,953
How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
Hi.

583
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:03,319
Where's Mom?

584
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:05,070
Look, just get...
Get your stuff.

585
00:36:05,094 --> 00:36:08,724
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

586
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:10,392
Uh... Yeah, I know.

587
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:13,696
Um... I talked to
Mom earlier.

588
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,652
Everything is fine, okay?

589
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:24,122
Where do I sleep tonight?

590
00:36:24,146 --> 00:36:26,459
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

591
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:29,328
Yeah.
All right. Because I'm happy.

592
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:31,564
And if you're happy
and I'm happy,

593
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:33,082
then that's a good thing, right?

594
00:36:33,106 --> 00:36:35,067
Yeah.
Yeah. All right.

595
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:37,336
You're s... You're
sleeping with me.

596
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,505
You're staying at home,
uh, where you...

597
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,374
Where you belong, all right?

598
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:42,430
Uh...

599
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:46,884
Come on.

600
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:57,728
Christopher.

601
00:37:15,697 --> 00:37:18,527
Hey. Listen, I need the rent.
Yeah.

602
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:19,712
I can't wait anymore.

603
00:37:19,736 --> 00:37:21,396
Yeah, uh... I'm good
for that, Charlie.

604
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,748
I'm gonna get it.

605
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:26,151
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

606
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:28,087
It's half what you pay here.

607
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:30,677
Listen, Chris. I need you
out of here in the morning.

608
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:34,994
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

609
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:36,278
I got painters coming in.

610
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:38,213
All right. All right, look.
I need more time.

611
00:37:38,237 --> 00:37:39,598
No.

612
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:41,416
All right...
I'll paint it myself.

613
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,652
All right, but I...
I just... I gotta have

614
00:37:43,676 --> 00:37:46,827
some more time...
I got my son up in here.

615
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:53,011
All right.

616
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:56,487
One week.
And you paint it.

Chris Gardner?

625
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:53,639
Uh, yeah.
What happened?

626
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:55,391
Payable to
the City of San Francisco.

627
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:57,592
Does it have to be the...
The full amount?

628
00:38:57,616 --> 00:38:59,411
Well, you gotta pay
each parking ticket.

629
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:01,046
Otherwise, you're staying.

630
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,019
This is all I got.

631
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:11,022
You verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

632
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:12,140
What?

633
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:14,632
Yeah, you gotta stay
until this thing clears.

634
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:18,096
No.

635
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,498
No, I... I can't... I can't
spend the night here.

636
00:39:20,522 --> 00:39:21,750
I... I have to
pick up my son.

637
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:23,452
You verify at
9:30 tomorrow.

638
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:26,321
Sir... I have a job interview
at Dean Witter

639
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:28,090
at 10:15
tomorrow morning.

640
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:29,875
I cannot stay...
9:30 tomorrow morning.

641
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:31,410
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

642
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:34,947
Is there anyone else who can...?
I take care of him.

643
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:38,188
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

644
00:39:41,977 --> 00:39:45,863
All right. Uh, can I make...
Have my phone call, please?

645
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,045
Hello.

646
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:51,046
<i>Hey.</i>

647
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,581
What do you want?

648
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:54,466
Um...

649
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,635
you gotta get Christopher, uh...

650
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:58,053
from daycare.

651
00:39:58,077 --> 00:39:59,077
I can't... Um...

652
00:40:00,312 --> 00:40:02,374
Just keep him
for the night, and I'm gonna...

653
00:40:02,398 --> 00:40:04,142
I... And, uh...
Just one night.

654
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,411
<i>What happened?</i>

655
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:10,099
I'll pick him up
from, uh, daycare... tomorrow.

656
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:11,650
I'm gonna go right...
You can just...

657
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:13,390
You can drop him off,
and I'll pick him up.

658
00:40:15,076 --> 00:40:16,472
No.

659
00:40:16,496 --> 00:40:18,357
<i>Come on, Linda.</i>

660
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:19,708
<i>Why you...?
Why you doing that?</i>

661
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:23,061
No. I wanna take him
to the park.

662
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:24,613
To Golden Gate...

663
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:26,170
after daycare tomorrow.

664
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:29,384
How is he?

665
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:30,769
He's fine.

666
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:34,489
All right, just... All right,
take him to the park... and...

667
00:40:34,513 --> 00:40:35,996
And... bring him back,
all right?

668
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:39,327
All right, just...

669
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:41,230
bring... Bring me my son back.

670
00:40:41,254 --> 00:40:44,065
<i>Okay?</i>

671
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:45,817
<i>Linda?</i>

672
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:47,808
I'll bring him back around 6.

673
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:51,140
All right. All right.

674
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:53,542
Uh... thank you.

675
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:55,059
Um...

676
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,245
All right.

677
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:57,269
Bye.

678
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:25,012
I'm okay?

679
00:41:59,231 --> 00:42:01,910
Excuse me. Excuse me.

680
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:03,316
Yes, I did.

681
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,794
Mr. Gardner.

682
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:22,803
This way.

683
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:26,039
It'll be right this way.

684
00:42:39,304 --> 00:42:40,554
What is the word on that one?

685
00:43:02,176 --> 00:43:03,210
Chris Gardner.

686
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:07,698
Chris Gardner.

687
00:43:08,783 --> 00:43:11,330
How are you?
Good morning.

688
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:13,014
Chris Gardner.

689
00:43:13,038 --> 00:43:15,283
Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

690
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:16,423
Chris Gardner.
Pleasure.

691
00:43:18,977 --> 00:43:21,006
I've been sitting there
for the last half hour

692
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,041
trying to come up with a story

693
00:43:23,065 --> 00:43:26,027
that would explain
my being here dressed...

694
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:27,579
like this.

695
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:29,781
And... And I wanted
to come up with a story

696
00:43:29,805 --> 00:43:31,783
that would demonstrate qualities

697
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:33,719
that I'm sure
you all admire here,

698
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:36,371
like... Like earnestness
or diligence.

699
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:39,057
And team-playing.
Something.

700
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:41,648
And I couldn't think...
of anything.

701
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:44,746
So the truth is...

702
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,533
I was arrested for failure
to pay parking tickets.

703
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:48,650
Parking tickets?

704
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:49,868
What?

705
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:52,471
And I ran all the way here
from the... The Polk Station,

706
00:43:52,495 --> 00:43:53,671
the police station.

707
00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:55,874
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

708
00:43:55,898 --> 00:43:59,093
I was, uh...
painting my apartment.

709
00:43:59,117 --> 00:44:00,200
Is it dry now?

710
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,398
Uh. I hope so.

711
00:44:03,422 --> 00:44:05,350
Jay says you're
pretty determined.

712
00:44:05,374 --> 00:44:07,919
Oh, he's been waiting outside
the front of the building

713
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:10,221
with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

714
00:44:10,245 --> 00:44:11,906
He said you're smart.

715
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,825
Well, I like to think so.

716
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,677
And you want to
learn this business?

717
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:17,028
Yes, sir, I wanna
learn this business.

718
00:44:17,052 --> 00:44:19,414
Have you already started
learning on your own?

719
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:21,266
Absolutely.

720
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,669
Jay?
Yes, sir.

721
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:25,887
How many times
have you seen Chris?

722
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:27,422
Yeah, I don't know.

723
00:44:27,446 --> 00:44:28,890
One too many, apparently.

724
00:44:28,914 --> 00:44:30,943
Was he ever dressed like this?

725
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:34,267
No. No. Jacket and tie.

726
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:39,067
First in your class in school?

727
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:41,019
High school?
Yes, sir.

728
00:44:41,043 --> 00:44:43,021
How many in the class?

729
00:44:43,045 --> 00:44:44,773
Uh, 12.

730
00:44:44,797 --> 00:44:45,797
It was a small town.

731
00:44:46,632 --> 00:44:47,825
I'll say.

732
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:50,245
But I was also first
in my radar class in...

733
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:53,637
In the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

734
00:44:56,006 --> 00:44:57,636
Can I say something?

735
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,888
Uh... Um... I'm
the type of person...

736
00:45:00,912 --> 00:45:04,342
if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer,

737
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:06,812
I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

738
00:45:06,836 --> 00:45:08,363
But I bet you what.

739
00:45:08,387 --> 00:45:10,415
I know how to find the answer.

740
00:45:10,439 --> 00:45:13,357
And I <i>will</i> find the answer.

741
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:16,293
Is that fair enough?

742
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:18,862
Chris.

743
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:21,693
What would you say

744
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:24,045
if a guy walked in
for an interview

745
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:26,247
without a shirt on...

746
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:27,682
and I hired him?

747
00:45:27,706 --> 00:45:28,755
What would you say?

748
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:36,596
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

749
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:52,758
Chris...

750
00:45:52,782 --> 00:45:54,943
I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man,

751
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,227
but you really pulled it off.

752
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:57,996
Thank you very much,
Mr. Twistle.

753
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,398
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

754
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:02,205
All right, so I'll
let you know, Jay.

755
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:06,271
You'll... "You'll let me know,
Jay"? What do you mean?

756
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:08,440
Yeah. I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime...

757
00:46:08,464 --> 00:46:10,742
What are you talking...?
You hounded me for this.

758
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:12,527
You stood here...

759
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:14,112
Listen. There's no salary.
No.

760
00:46:14,136 --> 00:46:15,313
I was not aware of that.

761
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:17,115
My circumstances
have changed some,

762
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:19,417
and I need to be certain
that I'll be...

763
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:21,392
All right. Okay.

764
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:26,107
Tonight.

765
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:29,795
I swear, I will fill
your spot. I promise.

766
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,897
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

767
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:35,150
Yes. An ass...

768
00:46:35,174 --> 00:46:36,151
A-hole.

769
00:46:36,175 --> 00:46:39,660
Yeah, an ass A-hole,
all the way.

770
00:46:42,564 --> 00:46:45,115
You are a piece of work.

771
00:46:46,184 --> 00:46:47,784

He's asleep.

801
00:48:22,732 --> 00:48:24,214
All right.

802
00:48:30,638 --> 00:48:32,473
Okay, baby.

803
00:48:45,085 --> 00:48:46,236
I got it.

804
00:48:51,793 --> 00:48:53,843
I'm going to New York.

805
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:01,535
Uh.

806
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:26,187
My sister's boyfriend...

807
00:49:26,211 --> 00:49:27,605
opened a restaurant,

808
00:49:27,629 --> 00:49:30,458
and they may have
a job for me there, so...

809
00:49:30,482 --> 00:49:32,949
I'm going to New York, Chris.

810
00:49:35,936 --> 00:49:37,954
Christopher's staying with me.

811
00:49:44,778 --> 00:49:47,809
I'm his mom. You know?

812
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:50,111
He should be with his mom.

813
00:49:50,135 --> 00:49:52,230
I should have him, right?

814
00:49:52,254 --> 00:49:54,321
You know you can't
take care of him.

815
00:50:03,064 --> 00:50:04,798
What are you gonna do for money?

816
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:08,346
I had an...

817
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,505
interview at Dean Witter
for... For an internship.

818
00:50:12,757 --> 00:50:14,286
And I got it.

819
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,026
So I'm gonna stand out
in my program.

820
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:20,842
Salesman to intern's backwards.

821
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,749
No, it's not.

822
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:26,019
I gotta go.

823
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,705
Tell him I love him, okay?

824
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:04,757
And...

825
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:13,260
I know you'll take care
of him, Chris.

826
00:51:13,284 --> 00:51:14,951
I know that.

827
00:51:57,394 --> 00:51:58,523
<i>Dean Witter.</i>
Yes, hi.

828
00:51:58,547 --> 00:51:59,940
Um...

829
00:51:59,964 --> 00:52:01,793
Yes, uh, I'd like to leave
a message for...

830
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:03,544
For Mr. Jay Twistle.

831
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:04,695
<i>Your name?</i>

832
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:06,831
Uh... Yeah, my name
is Chris Gardner.

833
00:52:06,855 --> 00:52:08,633
Uh... Uh, the message is:

834
00:52:08,657 --> 00:52:10,284
Thank you very much for...

835
00:52:10,308 --> 00:52:13,904
For inviting me
into the program.

836
00:52:13,928 --> 00:52:16,123
Uh, I really appreciate it,

837
00:52:16,147 --> 00:52:17,692
and...

838
00:52:17,716 --> 00:52:20,594
I'd be very pleased
to accept your invitation.

839
00:52:20,618 --> 00:52:22,730
<i>Is that all?</i>

840
00:52:22,754 --> 00:52:24,515
Yes, that's...
That's it.

841
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:26,451
<i>Okay.</i>
Thank you.

842
00:52:26,475 --> 00:52:28,024
<i>Bye.</i>

843
00:52:54,652 --> 00:52:56,113
Be careful with that.
What?

844
00:52:56,137 --> 00:52:57,887
Be care... Go ahead.

845
00:53:22,763 --> 00:53:24,358
Are we there?

846
00:53:24,382 --> 00:53:25,665
Yep.

847
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:41,092
Hey. You know
what today is?

848
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:42,577
Yeah.
What?

849
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:43,627
Saturday.

850
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:45,179
You know what
Saturday is, right?

851
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:47,181
Yeah.
What?

852
00:53:47,205 --> 00:53:48,766
Basketball.

853
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,535
You wanna go play
some basketball?

854
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,052
Okay.

855
00:53:52,076 --> 00:53:54,606
All right. Then we're gonna
go sell a bone density scanner.

856
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,890
How about that?

857
00:53:55,914 --> 00:53:57,575
Wanna do that?

858
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:58,599
No.

859
00:54:01,486 --> 00:54:02,619
Hey, Dad, I'm going pro.
Oh.

860
00:54:04,222 --> 00:54:06,100
I'm going pro.

861
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:07,452
Oh-ho!

862
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:08,986
Okay.

863
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,556
Yeah. I don't know,
you know.

864
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,159
Uh... you'll probably be
about as good as I was.

865
00:54:15,183 --> 00:54:16,928
That's kind of the way
it works, you know.

866
00:54:16,952 --> 00:54:18,279
And I... I was
below average.

867
00:54:18,303 --> 00:54:20,114
You know, so...
Whoa.

868
00:54:20,138 --> 00:54:22,383
So you'll probably
ultimately rank...

869
00:54:22,407 --> 00:54:24,118
somewhere around there,
you know, so...

870
00:54:24,142 --> 00:54:25,119
I really...

871
00:54:25,143 --> 00:54:26,521
You'll excel at a lot of things,

872
00:54:26,545 --> 00:54:27,555
just not this.

873
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:28,973
So I don't want you out here

874
00:54:28,997 --> 00:54:31,526
shooting this ball around
all day and night, all right?

875
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:32,577
All right.

876
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:34,383
Okay.

877
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:36,570
All right, go ahead.

878
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:02,529
Hey.

879
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:08,412
Don't ever let
somebody tell you...

880
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:10,270
you <i>can't</i> do something.

881
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:13,790
Not even me.

882
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:16,671
All right?

883
00:55:16,695 --> 00:55:18,623
All right.

884
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:21,326
You got a dream...

885
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,583
you gotta protect it.

886
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:26,498
People can't do something
themselves,

887
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:28,855
they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

888
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:35,806
If you want something,
go get it.

889
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,279
Period.

890
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:46,673
Let's go.

891
00:55:48,893 --> 00:55:52,539
Dad. Why did we move
to a motel?

892
00:55:52,563 --> 00:55:55,131
I told you. Because I'm...
I'm getting a better job.

893
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:58,062
You gotta trust me, all right?

894
00:55:58,086 --> 00:55:59,380
I trust you.

895
00:55:59,404 --> 00:56:01,504
All right, here. Come on,
come on. Come on. Keep up.

896
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:05,859
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

897
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,390
Dad. When's Mom
coming back?

898
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:11,959
I don't know, Christopher.

899
00:56:11,983 --> 00:56:14,095
Dad, listen to this.

900
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,748
One day, a man was
drowning in the water.

901
00:56:17,772 --> 00:56:20,451
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

902
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:22,987
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

903
00:56:23,011 --> 00:56:26,374
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

904
00:56:26,398 --> 00:56:28,943
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

905
00:56:28,967 --> 00:56:31,279
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

906
00:56:31,303 --> 00:56:34,715
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

907
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:37,757
And God said, "I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

908
00:56:39,544 --> 00:56:41,155
Do you like it?

909
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:43,880
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

910
00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:51,766
Oh. Thank you very much, sir.
Yes, sir.

911
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,601
You got the bill of sale here.
Yes.

912
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:55,185
All the information you'll need.

913
00:56:55,209 --> 00:56:57,038
Uh, thank you very much
for your business.

914
00:56:57,062 --> 00:56:58,572
Thank you.

915
00:56:58,596 --> 00:57:01,242
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 182, please.</i>

916
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:03,394
<i>One hundred, 200, 20, 40,</i>

917
00:57:03,418 --> 00:57:06,180
45, 46, 7, 8, 9, 10.

918
00:57:06,204 --> 00:57:07,620
Thank you.

919
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,368
Hey, you want one of those?

920
00:57:11,392 --> 00:57:12,986
No, it's okay.

921
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:16,324
Come on, you can
have one. Which one?

922
00:57:16,348 --> 00:57:18,026
You like that one? How much?

923
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:19,699
Twenty-five cents.

924
00:57:33,964 --> 00:57:38,963
<i>This part of my life
is called "Internship."</i>

925
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:41,415
The 1200 building is Medley
Industrial and Sanko Oil.

926
00:57:41,439 --> 00:57:43,884
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

927
00:57:43,908 --> 00:57:45,986
In a couple of weeks,
you'll get call sheets

928
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,038
with the phone numbers
of employees

929
00:57:48,062 --> 00:57:51,359
from every <i>Fortune 500</i> company
in the financial district.

930
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:54,361
You will be pooling
from 60 <i>Fortune</i> companies.

931
00:57:54,385 --> 00:57:57,314
You will mainly be
cold-calling potential clients.

932
00:57:57,338 --> 00:57:59,166
But if you have to
have lunch with them,

933
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,602
have breakfast with them,
even babysit for them,

934
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:02,970
you will do whatever it takes

935
00:58:02,994 --> 00:58:04,939
to familiarize them
with our packages.

936
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:07,024
We need you to match
their needs and goals

937
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:08,660
to one of our many
financial plans.

938
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:10,294
In essence...

939
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:12,297
you reel them in,

940
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:13,469
we'll cook the fish.

941
00:58:15,223 --> 00:58:17,335
Some of you guys are here
because you know somebody.

942
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,021
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

943
00:58:20,045 --> 00:58:22,774
But there's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

944
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:25,176
That person's gonna be
the guy...

945
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,661
who can turn this into this.

946
00:58:27,685 --> 00:58:31,182
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

947
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:33,851
You, you, help me
hand these out.

948
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:37,204
This is going to be your bible.

949
00:58:37,228 --> 00:58:39,206
You'll eat with it.
You'll drink with it.

950
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,624
<i>It was simple.</i>

951
00:58:40,648 --> 00:58:43,828
<i>X number of calls equals
X number of prospects.</i>

952
00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:47,314
<i>X number of prospects equals
X number of customers.</i>

953
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:50,468
<i>X number of customers equals
X number of dollars</i>

954
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:51,502
<i>in the company's pocket.</i>

955
00:58:51,526 --> 00:58:52,720
Your board exam.

956
00:58:52,744 --> 00:58:54,521
Last year, we had an intern

957
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:56,708
score a 96.4 percent

958
00:58:56,732 --> 00:58:58,776
on the written exam.

959
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,527
He wasn't chosen.

960
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:02,363
It's not a simple pass/fail.

961
00:59:02,387 --> 00:59:05,950
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

962
00:59:05,974 --> 00:59:07,857
Be safe. Score a hundred.

963
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:12,828
Okay. Let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

964
00:59:21,772 --> 00:59:23,650
Oh. Hey. Mr. Frohm.
Hi.

965
00:59:23,674 --> 00:59:24,869
Uh, Chris.

966
00:59:24,893 --> 00:59:26,220
Ah, Chris, how are you?

967
00:59:26,244 --> 00:59:27,271
I'm good. How you doing?

968
00:59:27,295 --> 00:59:29,122
Fine, thank you for asking.

969
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:31,592
Yeah, uh, first day in there.
It was, uh, exciting.

970
00:59:31,616 --> 00:59:33,894
You're not quitting on us yet, are you?
Oh, no.

971
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:35,930
No, sir. Ten-minute break.
Uh...

972
00:59:35,954 --> 00:59:37,214
Pop out, get a quick bite,

973
00:59:37,238 --> 00:59:38,932
and then back in there
for board prep.

974
00:59:38,956 --> 00:59:40,835
Oh, man, I remember mine.

975
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:43,570
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

976
00:59:43,594 --> 00:59:46,173
We didn't do world markets,
we didn't bother with taxes,

977
00:59:46,197 --> 00:59:48,092
and it was still
a pain in the ass.

978
00:59:48,116 --> 00:59:49,627
Funny what you remember.

979
00:59:49,651 --> 00:59:50,811
There was a beautiful girl

980
00:59:50,835 --> 00:59:52,162
in that class.

981
00:59:52,186 --> 00:59:54,715
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so...

982
00:59:54,739 --> 00:59:57,251
I've seen an old friend
of mine. Uh, do... Do you mind?

983
00:59:57,275 --> 00:59:58,469
No, go ahead.

984
00:59:58,493 --> 01:00:00,109
Uh, good talking to you, sir.

985
01:00:26,604 --> 01:00:28,087
Aah.

986
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,302
Hey, hey... Hey, asshole.
Yeah.

987
01:00:31,326 --> 01:00:32,592
Are you all right, asshole?

988
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:35,272
Are... Are you okay?

989
01:00:35,296 --> 01:00:36,841
I mean, what were you thinking?

990
01:00:36,865 --> 01:00:39,660
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

991
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:41,779
I'm trying to cross the street.

992
01:00:41,803 --> 01:00:43,030
Uh... you're all right?

993
01:00:43,054 --> 01:00:44,203
Yeah, yeah.

994
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,467
Where's my shoe?
What?

995
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:48,719
You knocked off my shoe!

996
01:00:48,743 --> 01:00:51,310
I don't know where your shoe is.

997
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:53,507
Where's my damn shoe?

998
01:00:53,531 --> 01:00:54,531
I don't know.

999
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:02,354
Hey.

1000
01:01:03,673 --> 01:01:05,686
Did you see it?
I lost my shoe.

1001
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:07,337
No, I'm sorry.

1002
01:01:07,361 --> 01:01:10,590
Hey. Hey. Where
are you going?

1003
01:01:10,614 --> 01:01:12,126
We should wait for the police.

1004
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:13,150
I gotta go to work.

1005
01:01:14,201 --> 01:01:16,163
Hey, you just got hit by a car.

1006
01:01:16,187 --> 01:01:18,365
Go to the hospital.

1007
01:01:18,389 --> 01:01:21,674
I'm in a competitive
internship at Dean Witter.

1008
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:34,499
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

1009
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:36,633
Oh. Yeah.
Thanks.

1010
01:01:36,657 --> 01:01:38,574
Thank you.
Yeah.

1011

01:01:47,418 --> 01:01:49,480
Yep. I know.

1014
01:01:49,504 --> 01:01:50,864
Wanna know what happened?

1015
01:01:50,888 --> 01:01:51,888
Yeah.

1016
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:54,735
I got hit by a car.

1017
01:01:54,759 --> 01:01:56,670
You got hit by a car?

1018
01:01:56,694 --> 01:01:58,021
Yep.

1019
01:01:58,045 --> 01:01:59,473
Where?

1020
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:01,608
Uh, just right by the office.

1021
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:03,260
No, where in your body?

1022
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:04,562
Like, the back of my legs.

1023
01:02:04,586 --> 01:02:05,846
Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.

1024
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:06,980
Goodbye.

1025
01:02:07,004 --> 01:02:08,131
Where you on the street?

1026
01:02:08,155 --> 01:02:10,301
Y-yeah. I was running
in the street.

1027
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:12,369
Don't do that.
You can get hurt.

1028
01:02:12,393 --> 01:02:15,706
Yeah, thanks.

1029
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,730
I'll remember that next time.

1030

<i>And here I was again.
Show up early.</i>

<i>While qualified persons...</i>

Yes, sir.

Just move it to the other side.
They're street sweeping.

1119
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,568
There's spaces.
Hang on to these.

1120
01:05:47,592 --> 01:05:49,319
I have backups in my desk.

1121
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:50,704
And you have to jimmy that.

1122
01:05:50,728 --> 01:05:51,605
Uh, uh... Jimmy what?!

1123
01:05:51,629 --> 01:05:53,190
You have to jimmy the key.

1124
01:05:53,214 --> 01:05:55,559
And the other doors
don't unlock.

1125
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:56,732
You have to jimmy it.

1126
01:06:14,117 --> 01:06:15,400
Come on. I'm jimmying it.

1127
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:20,088
Oh, no!

1128
01:06:21,558 --> 01:06:22,808
Come on, come on.

Just filling out a check.

1163
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:34,968
Paying some bills and a...

1164
01:08:34,992 --> 01:08:36,625
parking ticket.

1165
01:08:39,128 --> 01:08:41,492
We don't have a car anymore.

1166
01:08:41,516 --> 01:08:43,849
Yep. I know.

1167
01:08:45,352 --> 01:08:47,281
Oh, um...

1168
01:08:47,305 --> 01:08:50,567
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

1169
01:08:50,591 --> 01:08:53,203
A couple doctors' offices.
Well...

1170
01:08:53,227 --> 01:08:55,121
On sales calls, okay?

1171
01:08:55,145 --> 01:08:57,179
Okay.

1172
01:08:59,982 --> 01:09:01,895
Then, possibly...

1173
01:09:01,919 --> 01:09:04,164
we'll go to the football game.

1174
01:09:04,188 --> 01:09:05,165
Really?

1175
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:06,189
Uh, possibly.

1176
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:08,351
All right?

1177
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,153
All right.
Mm-hm.

1178
01:09:10,177 --> 01:09:11,460
Come on, finish up.

1179
01:09:12,612 --> 01:09:13,574
Are you sure?

1180
01:09:13,598 --> 01:09:14,758
I was...

1181
01:09:14,782 --> 01:09:15,782
Possibly.

1182
01:09:16,816 --> 01:09:18,000
Really?

1183
01:09:48,398 --> 01:09:50,677
Are you bringing it to the game?

1184
01:09:50,701 --> 01:09:53,180
Yeah. I don't...
I don't wanna leave it.

1185
01:09:53,204 --> 01:09:55,437
And maybe we're
going to the game.

1186
01:09:56,556 --> 01:09:57,634
All right.

1187
01:09:57,658 --> 01:09:59,236
Where are we going now?

1188
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:02,039
Uh, to see someone about my job.

1189
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:03,573
I don't understand.

1190
01:10:03,597 --> 01:10:05,025
You don't understand what?

1191
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:07,428
Are we going to the game?

1192
01:10:07,452 --> 01:10:09,846
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

1193
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:12,382
You know what "possibly" means?
Like probably.

1194
01:10:12,406 --> 01:10:14,984
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

1195
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:18,288
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

1196
01:10:18,312 --> 01:10:19,673
What does "probably" mean?

1197
01:10:19,697 --> 01:10:21,574
It means we have a good chance.

1198
01:10:21,598 --> 01:10:23,160
And what does "possibly" mean?

1199
01:10:23,184 --> 01:10:25,495
I <i>know</i> what it means.
What does it mean?

1200
01:10:25,519 --> 01:10:28,604
It means that we're <i>not</i>
going to the game.

1201
01:10:30,023 --> 01:10:31,985
How did you get so smart?

1202
01:10:32,009 --> 01:10:33,258
Cause you're smart.

1203
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:39,576
Are we there?

1204
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,283
Yeah.

1205
01:10:46,505 --> 01:10:47,835
Mr. Ribbon.

1206
01:10:47,859 --> 01:10:50,587
Yes?
How are you, sir? Chris Gardner.

1207
01:10:50,611 --> 01:10:51,588
Dean Witter.

1208
01:10:51,612 --> 01:10:53,123
Oh, hi. Hi.

1209
01:10:53,147 --> 01:10:54,507
This is my son, Christopher.

1210
01:10:54,531 --> 01:10:56,092
Hi.
Hey, Christopher.

1211
01:10:56,116 --> 01:10:57,577
W-w-what are you doing up here?

1212
01:10:57,601 --> 01:10:58,395
Uh, I came to apologize

1213
01:10:58,419 --> 01:11:00,413
for missing our appointment
the other day.

1214
01:11:00,437 --> 01:11:02,733
Oh, you didn't need to come up.
Oh, no. Actually,

1215
01:11:02,757 --> 01:11:03,716
we were in the neighborhood

1216
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:06,720
visiting a very close friend
of ours, and I-I just wanted

1217
01:11:06,744 --> 01:11:08,838
to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

1218
01:11:08,862 --> 01:11:10,290
I know you probably
waited for me.

1219
01:11:10,314 --> 01:11:11,408
Little bit.

1220
01:11:11,432 --> 01:11:12,425
I-I want you to know

1221
01:11:12,449 --> 01:11:14,278
that I <i>do not</i>
take that for granted.

1222
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:16,530
Oh, come on. W-what, uh...
What's that?

1223
01:11:16,554 --> 01:11:20,250
Oh, this... Uh, an Osteo
National bone-density scanner.

1224
01:11:20,274 --> 01:11:21,367
Oh.

1225
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:24,088
A company I bought into prior to
going to work at Witter.

1226
01:11:24,112 --> 01:11:25,438
I have a meeting after the game.

1227
01:11:25,462 --> 01:11:27,424
You guys are going to the game?
Oh, yeah.

1228
01:11:27,448 --> 01:11:28,842
Possibly.

1229
01:11:28,866 --> 01:11:30,126
Possibly.

1230
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,229
We're... We're going too.
I'm taking my son, Tim.

1231
01:11:32,253 --> 01:11:34,348
My 12-year-old.
We were just leaving. Tim!

1232
01:11:34,372 --> 01:11:36,116
Listen, we'll... We'll
get out of your way.

1233
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,768
Um, again, thank you very much,

1234
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,069
and I'm sorry
about the other day.

1235
01:11:39,093 --> 01:11:41,538
And I hope that we can
reschedule for later this week.

1236
01:11:41,562 --> 01:11:42,905
You got it.
Thank you very much, sir.

1237
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:45,142
All right.
You take care. Here, come on.

1238
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:46,810
Um. Say bye-bye, Chris.
Bye.

1239
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:48,562
Bye, Christopher.

1240
01:11:48,586 --> 01:11:50,246
Hey, you guys
wanna come with us?

1241
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,898
What, uh...?
To Candlestick?

1242
01:11:51,922 --> 01:11:53,250
We're going now.
Come with us.

1243
01:11:53,274 --> 01:11:54,367
Where are your seats?

1244
01:11:54,391 --> 01:11:57,121
Oh, we've...
We're... upper deck.

1245
01:11:57,145 --> 01:11:58,038
We got a box.
Come on.

1246
01:11:58,062 --> 01:11:59,289
You wanna sit in a box?

1247
01:11:59,313 --> 01:12:00,541
No.

1248
01:12:00,565 --> 01:12:01,525
Well...

1249
01:12:01,549 --> 01:12:03,043
It's not actually a box.

1250
01:12:03,067 --> 01:12:05,579
It's... It's, um...
a private section.

1251
01:12:05,603 --> 01:12:07,836
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

1252
01:12:09,139 --> 01:12:10,316
Okay.

1253
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,857
Okay. Kids in the back.

1254
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:15,622
Hey, why don't you just
put that in your car?

1255
01:12:15,646 --> 01:12:17,128
Um...

1256
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:19,910
Yeah, okay...
Uh, sure. Sure.

1257
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:21,595
We don't have a car.

1258
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:22,179
Ah!

1259
01:12:22,203 --> 01:12:24,431
Oh, my G...
What happened?

1260
01:12:24,455 --> 01:12:25,915
I think I got stung by a bee.

1261
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:28,152
You all right?
Oh. Yeah.

1262
01:12:28,176 --> 01:12:30,403
Goodness. I'm fine.
You're not allergic or anything?

1263
01:12:30,427 --> 01:12:31,588
No, no, no. Aah.

1264
01:12:31,612 --> 01:12:32,906
Where'd he get you?

1265
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:35,508
Just, like, right at the, uh,
back of my head. Aah.

1266
01:12:35,532 --> 01:12:38,028
Are you okay?
Uh, yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

1267
01:12:38,052 --> 01:12:40,046
Does it hurt?
Uh, Christopher, I'm fine.

1268
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:41,165
Let me see.

1269
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:44,401
Christopher. Sit back.
Sit back.

1270

And, uh, Mr. Ribbon,
I also wanna thank you

1290
01:13:37,361 --> 01:13:38,822
for giving me the opportunity

1291
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:40,623

over at Morgan Stanley.

1295
01:13:47,104 --> 01:13:49,282
And, uh, really, I think
you're gonna be blown away.

1296
01:13:49,306 --> 01:13:52,185

I mean, I like you, but...
there's not a chance

anytime soon, buddy.

1434
01:24:25,307 --> 01:24:26,986
Dad! Where are
we going?

1435
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:28,576
I don't know.

1436
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:46,238
It's not a time machine.

1437
01:24:46,262 --> 01:24:47,445
Dad.

1438
01:24:48,397 --> 01:24:50,009
It's not a time machine.

1439
01:24:50,033 --> 01:24:51,494
The guy said
it was a time machine.

1440
01:24:51,518 --> 01:24:53,463
It's not a time machine.
He was wrong.

1441
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:54,696
What guy?

1442
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,316
The guy.
He was at the park.

1443
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,839
He said it was a time machine.

1444
01:25:04,530 --> 01:25:05,930
Yes, it is.

1445
01:25:07,483 --> 01:25:09,217
No, it's not.

1446
01:25:11,153 --> 01:25:13,204
It is.
No, it's not.

1447
01:25:19,311 --> 01:25:22,813
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1448
01:25:27,019 --> 01:25:28,302
You wanna push it?

1449
01:25:32,774 --> 01:25:34,342
Okay.

1450
01:25:35,944 --> 01:25:37,611
Come on.

1451
01:25:39,098 --> 01:25:41,081
Come on, man.

1452
01:25:46,321 --> 01:25:47,650
Right here.

1453
01:25:47,674 --> 01:25:49,819
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1454
01:25:49,843 --> 01:25:51,988
I don't know.
Someplace from before.

1455
01:25:52,012 --> 01:25:53,823
You gotta close your eyes.

1456
01:25:53,847 --> 01:25:56,030
You close your eyes.
I wanna see.

1457
01:25:58,018 --> 01:26:00,267
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1458
01:26:06,092 --> 01:26:08,187
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1459
01:26:08,211 --> 01:26:11,145
It takes a few seconds.

1460
01:26:13,215 --> 01:26:15,310
Oh, my goodness.

1461
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:17,001
W... Open, open,
open!

1462
01:26:18,421 --> 01:26:20,466
Whoa.

1463
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:22,401
What is it?

1464
01:26:22,425 --> 01:26:23,402
Dinosaurs.

1465
01:26:23,426 --> 01:26:24,587
Where?

1466
01:26:24,611 --> 01:26:27,306
You don't see
all these dinosaurs?

1467
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:28,858
Look around.

1468
01:26:28,882 --> 01:26:30,693
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1469
01:26:30,717 --> 01:26:32,945
Wow.

1470
01:26:32,969 --> 01:26:33,679
Do you see 'em?

1471
01:26:33,703 --> 01:26:35,264
Yeah.

1472
01:26:35,288 --> 01:26:36,649
Wait. Come on,
come on, come on.

1473
01:26:36,673 --> 01:26:37,766
Wait... Watch out.

1474
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:39,284
What is it?
Don't step in the fire.

1475
01:26:39,308 --> 01:26:40,753
We're cavemen.

1476
01:26:40,777 --> 01:26:43,155
We need this fire,
'cause there's no electricity,

1477
01:26:43,179 --> 01:26:45,008
and it's cold out here, okay?

1478
01:26:45,032 --> 01:26:47,693
Watch out! Watch out!
Whoa! Oh, my good... A <i>T. rex.</i>

1479
01:26:47,717 --> 01:26:49,679
That's... Get your stuff.
Get your stuff.

1480
01:26:49,703 --> 01:26:51,381
Get... Get it...

1481
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:52,615
Get up here.

1482
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:53,983
We gotta find someplace safe.

1483
01:26:54,007 --> 01:26:55,134
Like what?

1484
01:26:55,158 --> 01:26:58,070
Um... we need a cave.

1485
01:26:58,094 --> 01:26:59,272
A cave?

1486
01:26:59,296 --> 01:27:00,889
We gotta find
a cave. Come on.

1487
01:27:00,913 --> 01:27:02,380
Okay.
Come on, come on.

1488
01:27:04,283 --> 01:27:06,529
Wait... Watch your
back! Look out.

1489
01:27:06,553 --> 01:27:08,714
Here it is. Here's
a cave. Come on.

1490
01:27:08,738 --> 01:27:10,816
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1491
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,834
Whoa.

1492
01:27:11,858 --> 01:27:13,319
Go ahead.
Get in.

1493
01:27:13,343 --> 01:27:15,176
Hurry, hurry. Hurry.

1494
01:27:18,814 --> 01:27:20,692
Are we safe?

1495
01:27:20,716 --> 01:27:22,917
Yeah, I think so.

1496
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:31,719
Hey.

1497
01:28:33,739 --> 01:28:35,601
How you doing? Jay?
I'm doing good.

1498
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:37,120
How you, uh, getting along?

1499
01:28:37,144 --> 01:28:38,104
Good. I'm good.

1500
01:28:38,128 --> 01:28:39,655
You doing good?

1501
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,646
How you doing?
I'm doing great.

1502
01:28:43,065 --> 01:28:45,110
Where you going?

1503
01:28:45,134 --> 01:28:47,051
Oh. Um...

1504
01:28:48,254 --> 01:28:49,982
I, uh... Sacramento.

1505
01:28:50,006 --> 01:28:51,166
'Cause, um...

1506
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:54,320
I'm trying to move
a couple guys that... From...

1507
01:28:54,344 --> 01:28:57,456
They're at... At PacBell, and I'm
trying to bring them over...

1508
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,858
Get them over to us.

1509
01:28:58,882 --> 01:29:01,010
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1510
01:29:01,034 --> 01:29:03,012
Awesome.

1511
01:29:03,036 --> 01:29:04,852
Hey, let 'em win a round.

1512
01:29:10,193 --> 01:29:12,204
Deborah. Someone's
asking for you.

1513
01:29:12,228 --> 01:29:13,889
Where?
He's outside.

1514
01:29:13,913 --> 01:29:15,463
Please come with me.

1515
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:24,883
Hi.

1516
01:29:24,907 --> 01:29:26,841
How you doing?
Um...

1517
01:29:28,226 --> 01:29:29,888
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

1518
01:29:29,912 --> 01:29:30,912
Um...

1519
01:29:32,448 --> 01:29:34,177
We need a room.

1520
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:35,211
Um...

1521
01:29:35,235 --> 01:29:37,029
Just until I can...

1522
01:29:37,053 --> 01:29:38,397
fix this and sell it.

1523
01:29:38,421 --> 01:29:40,900
There's just some glasswork.
Let me stop you right there.

1524
01:29:40,924 --> 01:29:43,302
I wish I could help you...
This is my son, Christopher.

1525
01:29:43,326 --> 01:29:45,121
He's 5 years old.

1526
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:46,238
Hi, baby.

1527
01:29:46,262 --> 01:29:47,523
We need someplace to stay.

1528
01:29:47,547 --> 01:29:49,374
Okay. And I would
love to help you,

1529
01:29:49,398 --> 01:29:51,043
but we don't take men here.

1530
01:29:51,067 --> 01:29:52,494
It's only women and children.

1531
01:29:52,518 --> 01:29:53,796
Now, he can stay here,

1532
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:55,848
but you have to find
someplace else to go.

1533
01:29:55,872 --> 01:29:57,433
We gotta stay together.

1534
01:29:57,457 --> 01:29:58,817
We got... We... We're...

1535
01:29:58,841 --> 01:30:00,920
Okay. Okay, listen.
You gotta have someplace...

1536
01:30:00,944 --> 01:30:04,156
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1537
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:05,907
So you hurry up,
'cause there's a line.

1538
01:30:05,931 --> 01:30:07,226
Where is it?
Where? Come on.

1539
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:08,816
E-E-Ellis and Jones.

1540
01:30:44,486 --> 01:30:46,698
Hey! Hey, everybody.

1541
01:30:46,722 --> 01:30:50,035
We have four spots left,
and that's all.

1542
01:30:50,059 --> 01:30:51,503
Man.

1543
01:30:51,527 --> 01:30:53,623
Hey. Come on, man.

1544
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:54,740
Come on.
Come on, what?

1545
01:30:54,764 --> 01:30:56,808
Hey, that's my spot.
Back up.

1546
01:30:56,832 --> 01:30:58,982
Come on, don't do this to me. Don't...
Back up!

1547
01:31:01,554 --> 01:31:03,549
Dad! Dad!

1548
01:31:03,573 --> 01:31:05,885
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1549
01:31:05,909 --> 01:31:07,669
Stop! Stop!
Come here! Come here!

1550
01:31:07,693 --> 01:31:10,273
Get out of the line,
both of you. Both of you.

1551
01:31:10,297 --> 01:31:12,992
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be here on time.

1552
01:31:13,016 --> 01:31:15,227
I got here on time.
I was in line.

1553
01:31:15,251 --> 01:31:17,196
I came from work, I got my son.

1554
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,932
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1555
01:31:19,956 --> 01:31:21,984
He sliced in front
of him in line.

1556
01:31:22,008 --> 01:31:22,652
Who did?

1557
01:31:22,676 --> 01:31:24,302
He did.
He did.

1558
01:31:24,326 --> 01:31:25,821
Come on.
Come on, Rodney.

1559
01:31:25,845 --> 01:31:27,962
Come on. Let's go.
Get out of line.

1560
01:31:38,089 --> 01:31:39,339
That's it.
No more.

1561
01:31:47,115 --> 01:31:48,511
What's your favorite color?

1562
01:31:48,535 --> 01:31:50,246
Green.

1563
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:51,730
Green?
Mm-hm.

1564
01:31:51,754 --> 01:31:53,382
What do you like that's green?

1565
01:31:53,406 --> 01:31:54,917
Trees.

1566
01:31:54,941 --> 01:31:55,935
Trees.

1567
01:31:55,959 --> 01:31:58,153
What else?

1568
01:31:58,177 --> 01:31:59,359
Holly.

1569
01:32:01,397 --> 01:32:03,542
Holly. What's holly?

1570
01:32:03,566 --> 01:32:05,728
The Christmas stuff.

1571
01:32:05,752 --> 01:32:07,451
Ah. Christmas
stuff.

1572
01:32:08,903 --> 01:32:10,655
What's that?

1573
01:32:13,892 --> 01:32:16,743
I guess they want us
to go to sleep.

1574
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:24,113
There you go.

1575
01:32:24,137 --> 01:32:25,364
We gotta...

1576
01:32:25,388 --> 01:32:28,751
make sure Captain America's
warm in there.

1577
01:32:28,775 --> 01:32:30,703
Can he breathe?

1578
01:32:30,727 --> 01:32:31,993
He's good?
Yeah.

1579
01:32:33,428 --> 01:32:35,591
I gotta go work on the scanner...
Don't go.

1580
01:32:35,615 --> 01:32:39,011
No, no, no. I'm gonna be...
I'll be right outside the door.

1581
01:32:39,035 --> 01:32:41,480
All right? I'm just...
I'm gonna be right there...

1582
01:32:41,504 --> 01:32:43,349
I'll leave the door open
a little bit.

1583
01:32:43,373 --> 01:32:46,552
And I'll be able to
hear you if you call me.

1584
01:32:46,576 --> 01:32:48,993
I wanna go home.

1585
01:32:51,162 --> 01:32:53,275
But... that's why
I gotta, uh,

1586
01:32:53,299 --> 01:32:55,143
work on the scanner.

1587
01:32:55,167 --> 01:32:57,796
All right?

1588
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,965
I'm gonna go
out there. Um...

1589
01:32:59,989 --> 01:33:03,068
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1590
01:33:03,092 --> 01:33:04,420
And...

1591
01:33:04,444 --> 01:33:06,321
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1592
01:33:06,345 --> 01:33:07,923
All right?

1593
01:33:07,947 --> 01:33:09,425
All right.

1594
01:33:09,449 --> 01:33:11,960

All right.
Give me a kiss.

1602
01:33:30,018 --> 01:33:31,051
Mwah.

1603
01:33:40,562 --> 01:33:42,057
I'll just be a little
while, okay?

1604
01:33:42,081 --> 01:33:43,709
All right.

1605
01:33:43,733 --> 01:33:45,127
I'll be right here.

1606

Okay.

1608
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,048
Yeah.

1609
01:33:49,072 --> 01:33:50,749
Can you hear me?
Yeah.

1610
01:33:50,773 --> 01:33:52,473
Do you trust me?
Yeah.

1611
01:34:40,589 --> 01:34:42,334
Yeah.
Like that?

1612
01:34:42,358 --> 01:34:43,602
Yeah. Put that one...

1613
01:34:43,626 --> 01:34:44,691
Then you go like that.

1614
01:34:46,229 --> 01:34:47,522
Is that okay?

1615
01:34:47,546 --> 01:34:49,958
I don't know.
What do you think?

1616
01:34:49,982 --> 01:34:50,982
It's good.

1617
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:54,451
Let's go.
Get your stuff.

1618
01:34:55,637 --> 01:34:57,266
Hey, why don't you leave it?

1619
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,950
We can't.

1620
01:34:58,974 --> 01:35:01,287
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1621
01:35:01,311 --> 01:35:02,459
Go.

1622
01:35:08,216 --> 01:35:09,778
Hey, Chris.

1623
01:35:09,802 --> 01:35:11,497
Hey. Good morning,
Mr. Frakesh.

1624
01:35:11,521 --> 01:35:13,086
What's up?

1625
01:35:14,138 --> 01:35:15,501
Work trip.

1626
01:35:15,525 --> 01:35:17,969
Your wife, Martha,
works at PacBell also, correct?

1627
01:35:17,993 --> 01:35:20,306
Yes, she does.
And you guys are both looking

1628
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:21,690
to retire at about
the same time?

1629
01:35:21,714 --> 01:35:23,909
We'd like to retire and
maintain the same lifestyle

1630
01:35:23,933 --> 01:35:26,111
without paying a lot of taxes.
So basically,

1631
01:35:26,135 --> 01:35:28,613
you don't want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1632
01:35:28,637 --> 01:35:29,864
Nobody's.

1633
01:35:29,888 --> 01:35:31,934

1756
01:43:37,475 --> 01:43:39,204
Don't... Don't even...

1757
01:43:39,228 --> 01:43:41,261
think something like that.

1758
01:43:43,114 --> 01:43:45,393
Mom left because of Mom.

1759
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:47,896
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1760
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,720
Okay.

1761
01:44:00,181 --> 01:44:02,432
You're a good papa.

1762
01:44:09,957 --> 01:44:11,291
All right, go to sleep.

1763
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:15,778
I love you.
I love you too.

1764
01:45:12,253 --> 01:45:14,587
So far so good, Chris.

1765
01:45:20,327 --> 01:45:23,074
It works.
All right. Thank you very much.

1766

<i>Two hundred and fifty dollars.

1768
01:45:31,723 --> 01:45:34,424
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1769
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,572
Anything else?
No. This is good.

1770
01:45:37,596 --> 01:45:39,023
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1771
01:45:39,047 --> 01:45:40,291
You ready?
Yup.

1772
01:45:40,315 --> 01:45:41,364
Bye.

1773
01:45:42,833 --> 01:45:44,946
Are we going to
the church place?

1774
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:48,649
No.
Where are we going then?

1775
01:45:48,673 --> 01:45:51,486
Probably stay at a hotel.
A hotel?

1776
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:52,670
Well, just for the night.

1777
01:45:52,694 --> 01:45:55,690
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1778
01:45:55,714 --> 01:45:57,642
Hm.
No, thank you.

1779
01:45:57,666 --> 01:46:00,362
Ever?
I-I hope not.

1780
01:46:00,386 --> 01:46:02,046
Why not?

1781
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:05,049
Well, 'cause some things are fun
the first time you do 'em,

1782
01:46:05,073 --> 01:46:07,585
and then not so much the next.

1783
01:46:07,609 --> 01:46:10,872
Like the bus?
Yeah. Like the bus.

1784
01:46:10,896 --> 01:46:14,464
<i>I'm sorry.

<i>Just Christopher and me.</i>

1796
01:46:52,587 --> 01:46:55,133
Did you see me?
Yep.

1797
01:46:55,157 --> 01:46:58,469
<i>Far away from...

1798

01:47:07,786 --> 01:47:09,664
Chris, thank you very much.
Thank you, Dean.

1802
01:47:09,688 --> 01:47:12,300
Take care, Chris.
Hey, you made the right moves here.

1803
01:47:12,324 --> 01:47:13,840
Thanks, Chris.

1804
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:18,857

1809

Hey, Chris.

1810
01:47:40,635 --> 01:47:41,796
Hey.

1811
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:44,632
How are you doing, Jay?
I'm doing fine.

1812
01:47:44,656 --> 01:47:46,967
Rumor has it you signed
31 accounts for us

1813
01:47:46,991 --> 01:47:48,987
from Pacific Bell.

1814
01:47:49,011 --> 01:47:50,405
Yeah, I, uh...

1815
01:47:50,429 --> 01:47:52,273
met some guys at a ball game,

1816
01:47:52,297 --> 01:47:53,958
got some cards
I've been working.

1817
01:47:53,982 --> 01:47:56,382
I guess.

1818
01:47:59,253 --> 01:48:01,666
So... one more day.

1819
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:03,835
Getting nervous?

1820
01:48:03,859 --> 01:48:06,337
No, I'm... I'm okay.
Yeah?

1821
01:48:06,361 --> 01:48:08,707
Listen, whatever happens...

1822
01:48:08,731 --> 01:48:11,308
you've done
a fantastic job, Chris.

1823
01:48:11,332 --> 01:48:13,128
I mean that.

1824
01:48:13,152 --> 01:48:15,384
Take care of yourself.

1825
01:48:30,636 --> 01:48:34,015
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1826
01:48:34,039 --> 01:48:36,117
Yes, sir. Just, uh, calling
to thank you very much

1827
01:48:36,141 --> 01:48:39,253
for your support
at last month's seminar.

1828
01:48:39,277 --> 01:48:41,323
Uh... Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely.

1829
01:48:41,347 --> 01:48:42,347
Yes, sir.

1830
01:48:43,414 --> 01:48:45,243
No, sir, that's it.

1831
01:48:45,267 --> 01:48:47,450
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.

1832
01:48:49,053 --> 01:48:50,448
Chris.

1833
01:48:50,472 --> 01:48:51,988
Come.

1834
01:49:19,266 --> 01:49:22,552
Hi, Chris.
Mr. Frohm. Good to see you.

1835
01:49:23,437 --> 01:49:25,867
Nice shirt.
Heh. Thank you, sir.

1836
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:27,318
Chris.
Hi, Jay.

1837
01:49:27,342 --> 01:49:28,652
Chris.

1838
01:49:28,676 --> 01:49:31,845
Chris. Sit down,
please.

1839
01:49:34,481 --> 01:49:36,043
I thought I'd, uh...

1840
01:49:36,067 --> 01:49:37,845
wear a shirt today.

1841
01:49:37,869 --> 01:49:40,981
Um... you know,
being the last day and all.

1842
01:49:41,005 --> 01:49:42,133
Well, thank you.

1843
01:49:42,157 --> 01:49:44,669
Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1844
01:49:44,693 --> 01:49:47,188
But, um...

1845
01:49:47,212 --> 01:49:50,174
wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1846
01:49:50,198 --> 01:49:53,478
Because tomorrow is going
to be your first day.

1847
01:49:53,502 --> 01:49:57,454
If you'd like to
work here as a broker.

1848
01:49:58,372 --> 01:50:00,769
Would you like that, Chris?

1849
01:50:00,793 --> 01:50:02,937
Yes, sir.

1850
01:50:02,961 --> 01:50:05,562
Good. We couldn't
be happier.

1851
01:50:07,349 --> 01:50:08,842
So...

1852
01:50:08,866 --> 01:50:10,099
welcome.

1853
01:50:12,303 --> 01:50:14,282
Was it as easy as it looked?

1854
01:50:14,306 --> 01:50:17,601
No, sir. No.
No, sir, it wasn't.

1855
01:50:17,625 --> 01:50:19,170
Well...

1856
01:50:19,194 --> 01:50:22,362
Good luck, Chris.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1857
01:50:26,333 --> 01:50:28,513
Welcome, sir.

1858
01:50:28,537 --> 01:50:30,470
Oh, Chris.

1859
01:50:32,773 --> 01:50:35,007
I almost forgot.

1860
01:50:37,246 --> 01:50:38,545
