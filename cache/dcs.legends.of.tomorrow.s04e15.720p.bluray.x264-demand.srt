00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,256
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,430
It's a dragon egg.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,880
<i>You're possessed.</i>

4
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:06,839
Ray's gone.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,840
I've taken over his body.

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,720
<i>If Neron wanted John dead,
he would have killed him on the spot.</i>

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,496
<i>I need you
to open up a doorway to Hell.</i>

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,910
<i>It's to bring someone here
from the other side.</i>

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,920
<i>Tabitha.</i>

10
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,913
I'm sorry, it wasn't me.
It was my nipple.

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,160
Save me.

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,310
As you wish.

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,155
I'm not leaving Mona behind.

14
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,074
Do you really think that
everyone in Hell deserves to be there?

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,152
This is your opportunity
to make things right.

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm gonna save Ray.

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,558
Honey, time to go!

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,071
Come on, honey.
Let's go, we're gonna be late.

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,436
Zari, you better not
be eating the halva.

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,910
No, Mommy.

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,797
Zari <i>jaan.</i>

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,957
Dessert is not for after breakfast.

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,710
What?

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,200
It's only a kick.

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,116
Behrad must be anxious to meet you.

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,599
Now go put your shoes on
so I can take you to school.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,591
<i>Violent people
are pouring into our country.</i>

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,040
<i>Illegal immigrants, terrorists,</i>

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,150
<i>meta-humans.</i>

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,797
<i>Politicians promise to keep you safe,</i>

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,240
<i>but they've been hiding the truth.</i>

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,359
<i>There's a dangerous new threat
already within our borders.</i>

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,719
<i>Hi, I'm Ray Palmer.</i>

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,078
<i>Yes, that Ray Palmer,</i>

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,753
<i>former CEO of Palmer Tech.</i>

36
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,360
<i>And I'm here to warn you</i>

37
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,195
<i>that creatures once thought only
in legends and fairy tales are real.</i>

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,069
<i>Yes, folks,</i>

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,231
<i>monsters are real
and they walk amongst us.</i>

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,799
<i>And they will stop at nothing
until they destroy humankind.</i>

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,080
<i>Interested in learning more?</i>

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,629
<i>Then join me at PalmerX 2019</i>

43
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,996
<i>where "The power is
in the palm-er of your hands."</i>

44
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,151
I don't care Neron's wearing
my best friend's face,

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,913
- I want to punch him.
- Get in line.

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,835
Ogres are big softies.
That one wouldn't even hurt a fly.

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,912
Neron's been a step ahead of us
for too long.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
We need to play offense.

49
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,517
- Agreed.
- I'm sorry, what are we agreeing to?

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,354
It's time for us to fight back.

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,759
We're retaking the Bureau.

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,232
Gideon, pull up the blueprints
of the Bureau

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,800
and start fabricating an arsenal.

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,840
Right away, Captain.

55
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,641
Look, Gary has bonded
with the Fairy Godmother

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,157
and while he might be an idiot,
she is not to be underestimated.

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,000
Mick, Nate, you think
you can handle Tabitha?

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Granny is dead.

59
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,471
Good. Ava and I will handle Neron.

60
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,789
Yeah. I want a crack at him.

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,720
It's my Bureau
he's running his operation from.

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,950
Not to be a buzzkill,

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,760
but even John and Nora
couldn't out-magic Neron.

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
- I just felt a kick.
- Oh, I wanna feel...

65
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,736
Right now the smart play
would be just to bide our time.

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,400
Wait for John-o to return
with Ray's soul.

67
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,736
Shockingly, I agree with Charlie.
I love you little Wicksty...

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,479
- Oh, I felt it.
- I told you just...

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,553
Okay. Can you guys stop being
dragon baby-crazy right now?

70
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,793
Look, this commercial is proof
that Neron is up to something big.

71
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,475
And we need to stop him
before it's too late.

72
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,554
Captain, I have an incoming
communication from Nora Darhk.

73
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Put her on.

74
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
<i>Sara?</i>

75
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,320
<i>Talk to me. What's your status?</i>

76
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,872
I'm tired of skulking around air ducts.

77
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm going after Mona.

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're gearing up for an assault.

79
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
<i>Hold your position.</i>

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,920
Hey.

81
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,760
Too late.

82
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:30,355
- Wait. Where's Gary?
- In Ava's office.

83
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,479
Getting real comfortable.

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,880
Mmm.

85
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,678
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

86
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,153
Yes, my pet.

87
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,232
I want to dig deeper on my next wish.

88
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,436
Excellent idea.

89
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,874
What do you have in mind?

90
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,350
Well...

91
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,397
We've already redecorated my office.

92
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,078
I now have three nipples,
because a spare never hurts. And...

93
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,551
Perhaps you could make a wish
regarding the Legends.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,560
You want me to wish something for them?

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,672
I'm talking about revenge.

96
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,080
Oh.

97
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:06,515
They lied to you, Gary.

98
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,599
Promised you could be an Interim Legend.

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,675
One wish, and you can send them
all to Hell with John Constantine.

100
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,560
Speaking of John,
you think he's all right?

101
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,549
That warlock sent thousands of demons
to rot in the pits.

102
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,750
I think he's well and truly
screwed, dearie.

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Does this mean we're straight?

104
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,600
I got a more important
collection to make.

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,274
Who is that guy?

106
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,431
That, my friend, is John Constantine.

107
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,629
In the flesh.

108
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
Congratulations, Mona.

109
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,520
I have selected you
for a very special assignment.

110
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,080
That's okay, Ne-Ray.

111
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,590
Can I call you that?

112
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
I'm okay here.

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,076
You see, before Nate's father
decided he wanted to be PT Barnum,

114
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,310
we were working together.

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,836
Training monsters to do our bidding.

116
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,155
Actually, I worked extensively
with your dear friend, Konane.

117
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,359
I mean,
your dead friend Konane.

118
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,754
I found Mona.

119
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Hurry.

120
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Copy that.

121
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:49,915
This seems like overkill.

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,995
The Legends never included me
in their pizza parties.

123
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,476
Or asked me to play
<i>Dungeons & Dragons.</i>

124
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,313
Make them suffer, Gary.

125
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,476
I can make them do whatever you want.

126
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,233
I just wanted to be part of the team.

127
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,357
Soon as Ava opens the portal,

128
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,996
we go in firing.

129
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,514
Time to burn some freaks.

130
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,069
I wish...

131
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,519
Opening a portal in three, two, one...

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,352
Welcome to book club.

133
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,600
Why, you little...

134
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,480
I'd be careful how you speak
to my charge.

135
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,870
Gary, why are you doing this?

136
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,111
Because I would like to discuss

137
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,910
<i>The Collector.</i>

138
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,918
Forget the book, Gary.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,456
You helped a demon
take control of the Bureau.

140
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,840
What happened to the Bureau Creed?

141
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,078
Oh, I could ask the same about you.

142
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,072
Article 27. Hmm?

143
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,516
"A supervisor must never
show favoritism."

144
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,592
You started a book club
with another employee.

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,750
Gary.

146
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,116
Mona is being tortured right now.

147
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,638
Neron said he's trying
to protect humans from monsters.

148
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,593
You saw Mona gnaw off my nip!

149
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,796
She did you a favor.

150
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
Okay. Um...

151
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,236
Maybe we should just reschedule
until after we've read the book.

152
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,796
Oh, Fairy Godmother...

153
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,956
Oh, no.

154
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,236
Wait.

155
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
That book was terrible.

156
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Oh, my head.

157
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,589
That's the spirit.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,992
<i>Sara, Ava. Come in.
Where are you guys?</i>

159
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,479
Hey, Nate, can't talk right now.

160
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,434
Are you talking to Nate on comms?

161
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,836
Tell him I say hi.

162
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,794
Gary says hi.

163
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,712
And we're at book club.

164
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,314
Move on to Plan B.

165
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
What's Plan B?

166
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,600
I only listen for my name.

167
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,639
I assume it's like Plan A
but, you know, with less people.

168
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,197
Well, without the captain and the clone,
the Bureau's a suicide mission.

169
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,556
Mick's right.

170
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,400
We need to sneak into PalmerX.

171
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,517
Do some recon,
find out what Neron's up to.

172
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,919
Now that sounds like a Plan Z.

173
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Hey, baby.

174
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,636
Hey.

175
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,473
You looking for a good time, handsome?

176
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,136
I'm always looking
for a good time, love.

177
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,358
But, uh, regrettably,
my time here is limited.

178
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,840
Maybe you can help me.

179
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,038
I'm looking for a broker
in the soul trade,

180
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,554
he goes by the name of Masher.

181
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,400
I might know something.

182
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,793
Well, this here is holy water.

183
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,958
Now, you can use this
to burn the skin off

184
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,554
any demon tosser who messes with you.

185
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,950
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

186
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,710
Masher likes to hang out at
the strip club after trading's done...

187
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
John.

188
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,240
How do you know my name?

189
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Oh, I know who you are.

190
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,469
Half of demonkind
is searching for John Constantine.

191
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,272
- The holy water?
- Oh, this?

192
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,597
No, this is just whiskey, love.

193
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,554
Sure, our protagonist
was keeping people hostage,

194
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,271
but that's only because
he never received love as a child.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,390
They don't want you
in their book club, Gary.

196
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,233
Doesn't that make you angry?

197
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,313
Make a wish and they will pay.

198
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
You're right.

199
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
They don't want
to spend time with Gary Green,

200
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,554
the lowly Time Bureau agent.

201
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,118
But they would love
to spend time with Gary Green,

202
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,110
Captain of the <i>Waverider!</i>

203
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,476
Welcome aboard, Captain Green.

204
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,196
Thanks.

205
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,840
I have no quarrel with you, dear.

206
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,199
You didn't send me to Hell
like John Constantine and the Legends.

207
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,879
Yes, I was in Hell for 327 years.

208
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,640
And what was my crime?

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,918
I sprinkled a little magic over Salem,

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,357
trying to help a girl
whose mother was accused of witchcraft.

211
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,510
Okay.

212
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,156
Well, you're out now, why help Neron?

213
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,753
Neron rescued me in Hell,

214
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,830
and what can I say,

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,319
true love bloomed.

216
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,793
I know what you're thinking,

217
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,678
he's so much older than me.

218
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,675
Sometimes you have to look past age.

219
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,074
You know, in another life,

220
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,153
I think you and I
could have been friends.

221
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,519
- Toodles.
- Wait, what...

222
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,556
Ray.

223
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,631
Without all of the idiotic tendencies.

224
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,477
Make a move on me and Mona dies.

225
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,153
Ray is good and strong.
He can fight his way back from Hell.

226
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,039
Who do you think
is having a worse time in Hell?

227
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,600
Ray or your father?

228
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,552
Turns out Daddy Dearest isn't so tough.

229
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,878
I hear Damien Darhk is going
stark raving mad in the pits.

230
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,316
Why am I here?

231
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,757
Well, you and John tried to kill me.
Nearly did.

232
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,034
If the doofus in the skin-suit
I'm wearing hadn't have interrupted,

233
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,600
I'd have been obliterated.

234
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,278
I spent many nights just dreaming
about how I was going to get my revenge.

235
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,396
And then it came to me.

236
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,110
What better punishment
than making you sit front row

237
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,999
to all of the fear and rage
I'm about to unleash on the earth.

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,198
All while in the body
of the man you love.

239
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,556
Now...

240
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,116
Smile for the cameras.

241
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,656
Are monsters real?

242
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,360
What's tonight all about?

243
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,400
All of your questions
will be answered soon.

244
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,437
- Oh. Excuse me.
- What's wrong with you?

245
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,136
Well, you know, a room full of people
fearful of magical creatures,

246
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,072
just makes me a little fearful,
all right?

247
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,840
The worst part is,
Ray loves tech events.

248
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,634
Good evening, DC,
and welcome to PalmerX 2019.

249
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,711
Now, you're all probably wondering,

250
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,474
what in the heck is Ray Palmer
doing back in the public eye?

251
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,910
Well, folks,

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,596
for the past two years,
I have been hunting magical creatures.

253
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Hang with me here.

254
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,752
I've created an exosuit
capable of combating

255
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,230
the most ferocious of their kind.

256
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,549
What a douche.

257
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,869
But I can't do it alone.

258
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,230
I need your help.

259
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,752
I need you to help me
find these creatures.

260
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,072
Creatures that may be hiding
right here, amongst us.

261
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,790
Now, everyone,
take out your smartphones.

262
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,600
Better be Palmer Tech.

263
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,792
I've created a small, simple app
that will change the world.

264
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,077
And I want you all
to download it right now.

265
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,113
The app is called EYES.

266
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,556
Now, on EYES,

267
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,554
you will be able to share real-time,
lifesaving monster sightings.

268
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Share them.

269
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,473
And I will be there to save you.

270
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Remember,

271
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,437
the power is in
the palm-er of your hands.

272
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,355
You really expect us
to believe monsters exist?

273
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,837
I thought you were
going to offer us proof.

274
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,952
Thank you, Cindy.
You're absolutely right.

275
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,954
Here is your proof.

276
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,436
Now,

277
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,672
this may look like a helpless hipster
who should be working at a bookstore.

278
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,910
But believe me,

279
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,200
she's something
altogether more dangerous.

280
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,874
- Masher.
- John.

281
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,038
Yeah, all right. Keep your hair on.
No need to tell the whole bloody club.

282
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,016
Oh, buddy, now I know
you're out of your mind.

283
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,120
What are you doing in Hell?

284
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,873
I'm here to save a friend,

285
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,633
his soul belongs to Neron.

286
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,674
Cheers, love. He's paying.

287
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,680
Nobody gets into Neron's soul vault
without his say-so.

288
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,035
Except the triumvirate.

289
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,576
And I have a plan to deal with them.

290
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,360
But first, there's a hunch
I need to confirm.

291
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,639
What's Neron trading at?

292
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,150
He's steady.

293
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,800
But I'll let you in on a little secret,

294
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,474
his stock is about to rise.

295
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,520
I'm talking a massive
soul collection on Earth.

296
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
You know what that means?

297
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,400
Neron is finally making his play
for the throne of Hell.

298
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,873
Oh, cheers, Masher, I can use that.

299
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,236
Be careful, John,

300
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,154
not every demon you sent to Hell
is as forgiving as I am.

301
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,038
Yeah. Don't I know it.

302
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,955
You're dead, demon hunter.

303
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,917
I was gonna be a demon proctologist
but the pay wasn't as good.

304
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Hold him.

305
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
Oh!

306
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,669
Oh, Calibraxis.

307
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,080
You're looking good, mate.

308
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
You grow your beard?

309
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,475
John Constantine.

310
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,880
I'm really going to enjoy
watching you breathe your last.

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,639
I invoke a parley.

312
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,997
I demand to speak to the triumvirate.

313
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,959
I'm a demon, not a pirate, John.

314
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,993
I thought you understood the rules.

315
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,072
Well, you little maggot...

316
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,556
As long as I'm alive,

317
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,680
then the triumvirate can pass me around
like a little sparrow amongst the cats.

318
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,759
But as soon I die, you dim-witted dick,

319
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,151
then my soul belongs to Neron.

320
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,755
And then the triumvirate lose out
on all the tasty little bits

321
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,600
of torture that they have
got planned for me.

322
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,835
So you have got two choices.

323
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,320
You can either kill me

324
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,120
and royally piss off
the old bags that run this place.

325
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,352
Or take me to speak
with the triumvirate.

326
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,440
I'm detecting a fugitive alert...
Stop it.

327
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,199
At the Inquisition, Captain Green.

328
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,192
Oh. I don't do torture.

329
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,716
He could have fooled me.

330
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,280
Hey. Play nice.

331
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,837
We have to distract Gary
while the B team is plan B-ing.

332
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,359
Would a fairy at the
<i>Great British Bake Off</i> suit your fancy?

333
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,950
Shall we, uh...

334
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,512
Keep calm and pastry on?

335
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,712
I'll plot a course, Captain.

336
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Get it?

337
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,390
Keep calm and pastry on?

338
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,355
- Good one, Cap. Good one.
- Hilarious.

339
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,272
Thanks, guys. Thanks. Yeah.

340
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,996
Take a good long look at her.

341
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,880
Mona Wu.

342
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,634
You saw her on the street,
you wouldn't think twice.

343
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,576
Come on, Mona.
Don't give him what he wants.

344
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,832
But she has a strange
and violent condition,

345
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,197
brought about when she fell in love
with a repulsive creature.

346
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,957
I feel like a bridge scene
should have more people.

347
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,670
Oh. No, we love
three-people bridge scenes.

348
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,896
Yeah, otherwise we'd just end up
standing around all day.

349
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,360
Oh, that's why Mick's always grumpy.

350
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Come on, Mona,

351
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,398
I promised these fine people a show.

352
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,040
Let's not keep them waiting.

353
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Shift now.

354
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,516
Or end up dead like Konane.

355
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,438
Folks, proof
of the world's very first werewolf!

356
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,936
That's what we're missing.

357
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,155
The boys!

358
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,834
- No.
- Yeah.

359
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Fairy Godmother.

360
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
- Z.
- Nate.

361
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,315
She made him disappear!

362
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,836
Well, well, well.

363
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,390
What do we have here?

364
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,310
More magic in the audience?

365
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,150
She's one of them.

366
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
He's right.

367
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
I am.

368
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,996
She's a witch.

369
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,640
Witch. Witch.

370
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,200
Witch. Witch. Witch.

371
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,513
Witch. Witch. Witch. Witch. Witch.

372
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,520
Don't worry, folks.

373
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:07,071
The witch won't get far, not as long as
everyone downloads the EYES app.

374
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,840
Share your sightings.

375
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,110
We'll find the witch.

376
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,795
It's only a matter of time.

377
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,720
Sara? You guys okay?

378
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,029
Yeah, we're fine.

379
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,077
As long as we keep placating Gary.

380
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,119
I guess Charlie and Z are our last hope.

381
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,759
Great, we're toast!

382
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,236
Welcome to Hell.

383
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,920
Good evening, this is
your captain speaking.

384
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,437
- Just...
- What?

385
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,113
We'll be cruising at a high altitude

386
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,715
on our way to save
a bake-off in Britain.

387
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,800
Whoo!

388
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:48,801
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

389
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,394
Gary, is that the Kid Steel costume?

390
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
Uh-huh.

391
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,516
You likey?

392
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,559
Why would anyone wish to be a sidekick?

393
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,636
Close your legs.

394
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,790
Oh, he's such an idiot.

395
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,200
What?

396
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,438
Nothing.
They're just teasing you.

397
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,400
- Oh.
- You're my Gare-Bear.

398
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,360
We're gonna have so much fun.

399
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Okay.

400
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,913
Hashtag-Eyes-app is trending on Twitter

401
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,471
below Kanye's surprise album
and a cat getting a bath.

402
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,433
Mmm. How many downloads?

403
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,314
Only 2,000, Mr. Palmer.

404
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,591
The news cycle is so fast these days,
it's hard to cut through all the noise.

405
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,674
But a monster attack on the capital
will dominate the headlines for weeks.

406
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
And then what?

407
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,397
More people will download some app?

408
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,509
That's your big plan?

409
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,796
Why, yes it is.

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,920
Ah.

411
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:41,957
My love.

412
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,075
Would you please
escort our guest to a cell?

413
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,834
Let's go, dearie.

414
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,831
Neron didn't say which
containment cell to put you in.

415
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,160
Why are you helping me?

416
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,913
Because you're a fellow witch.

417
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,757
And I think we can help each other.

418
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,750
Mona.

419
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,676
How do you feel?

420
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,435
I've been better.

421
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,238
Remember, I'm just
a "Fairy Godmother" away.

422
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,237
Trust me, we'll be safe here.

423
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,629
Where are we?

424
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,554
My childhood home.

425
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,918
I thought you grew up
in a dystopian city, Z.

426
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
You had a pool?

427
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,880
In a couple years, A.R.G.U.S. will use
people's growing fear of meta-humans

428
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,280
to seize control.

429
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,160
Of course, it didn't help
that we were Muslim.

430
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,159
We were forced to move
to a ghetto district in 2021.

431
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,239
Humans are so easy to manipulate.

432
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,997
I mean, you just show them
a scary ogre or a dangerous meta,

433
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,434
and they just go barmy.

434
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,435
I haven't even been able
to get into this EYES app yet

435
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,120
because the terms of service
are so long.

436
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,720
No one bothers reading those.

437
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,696
It's a demon app.
I'm gonna read the fine print.

438
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,154
Can't believe it's just us left.

439
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,240
I mean, you and I both knew
from the start

440
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
that it was madness to storm the Bureau.

441
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
Oh, my God.

442
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
What?

443
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Z?

444
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,839
In New Orleans,

445
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,560
John said Neron needed
more souls to take over Hell.

446
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Here it says

447
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,960
What, you're saying that anyone who
downloads the app is going to Hell?

448
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Yeah.

449
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Oh, that is mental.

450
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,072
This little fairy was causing quite
the fray around the souffle.

451
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,960
I think I know just
the place for you, madam.

452
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,040
I can't take it anymore.

453
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,590
I'm gonna kill him.

454
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,354
Hey, Z, Charlie.
Please tell me you have something.

455
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,194
Well, we figured out Neron's app
is a way to collect souls.

456
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,194
- That's crazy.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

457
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,159
It gets crazier. To drum up fear
and increase downloads of his app,

458
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,149
we think he may be planning
a monster attack.

459
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,833
Okay. We'll, we'll stall Gary.

460
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,960
But you gotta get every single one of
those monsters out of the Time Bureau.

461
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,160
I was afraid you were going to say that.

462
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,115
Who you talking to, Sara?

463
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
What?

464
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,559
Gary. Baby, Bobby, bubelah...

465
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,715
There's a whole big world of problems.

466
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,231
You know, Neron
and your Fairy Godmother,

467
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,496
they're not really your friends.

468
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,194
But do you know who your friends are?

469
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,510
These guys.

470
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Huh?

471
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,755
Are you trying to schmooze me?

472
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,990
Feels good, right?

473
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,157
Uh, actually, it feels a little false.

474
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Gary.

475
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,439
You are our friend.

476
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,631
I mean, would we lie
to an Interim Legend?

477
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,199
Ah, you see, that's just it,
because I'm not an Interim Legend.

478
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,432
You just promised me that
to use me as bait.

479
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,816
You know what, Gary.
It's a little hard to feel sorry for you

480
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,240
when you're holding us all hostage.

481
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,640
You're not getting it.

482
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,232
This whole time Tabitha's been
trying to use me to hurt you.

483
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,671
All I wished was for us to hang out.

484
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,834
I was trying to protect you.

485
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,113
I get it. I'm not cool.

486
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,594
But I don't deserve
to be treated like a joke.

487
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,070
So now...

488
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,514
Now, the joke's on you.

489
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,240
What's he doing?

490
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,799
Oh, Fairy Godmother!

491
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,154
Yes, my pet?

492
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,354
Mick thinks he's a tough guy.

493
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,270
But I think he's a big baby.

494
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
And Nate,

495
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,952
who's never been bullied
a day in his life.

496
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,240
Welcome to my high school years.

497
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,076
And Sara and Ava,

498
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,677
the cool girl and the class president.

499
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,793
You know what I want you to do for me?

500
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Dance.

501
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,793
Five, six, seven, eight.

502
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Faster.

503
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,554
Gary, stop it.

504
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,556
Faster.

505
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,800
Charlie, I get that you're scared,
but the team is counting on us.

506
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
I'm not scared.

507
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:20,537
It's just breaking the monsters out
of the prison is a multiple person job.

508
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,074
You can be multiple people.

509
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,594
Look, Z. Yeah, I can for a second.

510
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,319
And you what? It takes its toll.

511
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,280
I could end up back in prison
or even worse, dead.

512
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,477
When A.R.G.U.S. came for my family,
my brother, Behrad, told me to run.

513
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
And I did.

514
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,673
I've never forgiven myself.

515
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,430
You won't either.

516
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,196
We can't change my family's future,
but we can save their present.

517
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,817
Zari <i>jaan,</i> make sure you take
your shoes off before you go in.

518
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
I know.

519
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:48,841
Charlie?

520
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,196
If I die, I'm gonna
come back and haunt you.

521
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,799
I would love a ghost friend.

522
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Come on.

523
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Cool.

524
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,714
Greetings, Satan.

525
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,033
First of the fallen.

526
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,551
It's been a long time, John.

527
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Belial.

528
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,432
We've been looking forward
to hearing the bunk you're peddling.

529
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,479
And Beelzebub.

530
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,680
Not as popular, but you were
always my personal favorite.

531
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,593
This is a waste of our time.

532
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,656
I take it you've noticed

533
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,798
a certain demon's stock
has been on the rise?

534
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,754
Neron's been doing very well
for himself.

535
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,111
Neron is trying to take control of Hell.

536
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,795
And let me assure you,

537
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,917
his method for collecting souls,

538
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,913
it won't be
to sign on the dotted line in blood.

539
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,235
He's, uh, young,
by your standards at least.

540
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,479
And let's just say,
he means to disrupt the system.

541
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,120
If we interfere with Neron,
we'll look weak.

542
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
Well, that's precisely
where I come in, Bubby.

543
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,069
And what do you want in exchange?

544
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,157
Not your own soul, I hope.

545
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,634
I'm here for the soul of Raymond Palmer.

546
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,154
You let us two leave Hell,

547
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,118
and I pledge to you
that I will dedicate

548
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,477
all of my crafty and wicked ways
to thwarting Neron

549
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,199
and securing your reign.

550
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,429
Are you really here for Raymond Palmer?

551
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,680
We thought there was another.

552
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,637
A young girl whose life you destroyed.

553
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,196
Astra.

554
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,272
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want to be too greedy.

555
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,153
But yeah, I'll take them both.

556
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,716
Both of them?

557
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,880
That is greedy.

558
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,351
But if you were to choose...

559
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,796
Well, then that's a different matter.

560
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
John!

561
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,156
Help me.

562
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,234
John. You're here.

563
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,120
You gotta get me back to Earth.

564
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,479
Please, John, they're hurting me.

565
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,752
Make up your mind, John.

566
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,398
This offer won't last.

567
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,356
John?

568
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Astra.

569
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,877
It's following me. Make it go away.

570
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,550
Come here. I've got you.

571
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,676
You can't have her!

572
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,077
You can't save her.

573
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,431
You can't have her!
You can't have her!

574
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,920
John, get me out of here!

575
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
I'm sorry.

576
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,400
I choose...

577
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,595
Astra Logue.

578
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,635
Stick to the plan, Charlie.

579
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,435
You mean the plan where I need to
rely on my shoddy shapeshifting

580
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,440
to portal creatures
one by one out of their cells

581
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
and onto the <i>Waverider,</i>

582
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,439
where Gary may or may not
wish them to kingdom come.

583
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,074
Yup, that plan.

584
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,480
This isn't you, Gary.

585
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,553
Why are you being so cruel?

586
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Please.

587
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,279
Stop. You're killing them.

588
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,272
I don't do mime, dearie.

589
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,073
Just stop. Everything.

590
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,152
As you wish.

591
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,632
Mona. Hey, wake up.

592
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,633
Hey, Nora.

593
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,116
Hey.

594
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,038
You're still here?

595
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,795
Book club forever.

596
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,153
Book club forever.

597
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,116
Oh, Fairy Godmother!

598
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Uh...

599
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,279
I have to pop off for a second, Gary.

600
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,796
I thought we were
gonna play <i>Settlers of Catan</i> later.

601
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,554
Don't be silly.

602
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,959
We're not friends.

603
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
Oh.

604
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,594
I'm so sorry, Gary.

605
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,875
I took you for granted.

606
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,358
I never, ever should have
let you do my dry cleaning

607
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,113
or work overtime without pay.

608
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,032
I mean, that's illegal, anyway.

609
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
I'm so sorry.

610
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,034
I still want to kill you.

611
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,711
Gary, when Rip
first recruited the Legends,

612
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,759
he picked the people
that were insignificant to history.

613
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,951
The original losers.

614
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,040
You don't have to be cool
to be a Legend.

615
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,835
And maybe we forgot that
somewhere along the way.

616
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,116
But you're one of us.

617
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,270
Now, come on, Gary.

618
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,752
Ray and Constantine are both
stuck in Hell and you can help them.

619
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,715
Just use your Fairy Godmother
powers for good.

620
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Save her.

621
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,840
Sadly, my hands are tied.

622
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,237
But if you become
Mona's Fairy Godmother,

623
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,359
she could wish to be healed.

624
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,676
How do I do that?

625
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,515
If another witch takes the wand...

626
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,112
You'll take my curse,

627
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,517
but with it, all of my power.

628
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,756
Nora...

629
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,273
Nora. No.

630
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
No.

631
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
It worked.

632
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,673
Quick, Mona, make a wish.

633
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Well...

634
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,040
Uh, Fairy God Nora.

635
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,191
I wish to be safe on the <i>Waverider.</i>

636
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,640
Oh!

637
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:34,519
How I've missed me.

638
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,476
Sadly for you,

639
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,231
when you took on
the wand's power and responsibility,

640
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,551
you also took on its charge.

641
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,555
- Gary?
- I'm afraid so.

642
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:49,511
Fairy Godmothers are prisoners.

643
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,951
Their magic is dependent on
whiny humans and their petty demands.

644
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,549
You lied!

645
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,594
Obviously.

646
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Toodles.

647
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:17,115
Excuse me.

648
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,116
- Marilyn Monroe?
- Well, yes.

649
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,835
I seem to have gotten a little lost.

650
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,039
Can you help me get back home?

651
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,915
Of course, ma'am.

652
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,551
Let me just program in the year.

653
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,271
Ah. Yeah. Uh...

654
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,600
Thanks.

655
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:48,239
Oh, my love, my love.

656
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,838
Still no luck with Nora?

657
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,990
No.

658
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,393
Well, she'll take your curse soon.

659
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,676
After all, you are very convincing.

660
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,874
Well, I better head back.

661
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,270
Evil deeds to do, and all that.

662
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,474
Well, that was bloody close.

663
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
<i>I'm at the first cell.</i>

664
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,190
<i>Anytime now, Z.</i>

665
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,272
Okay. Just give me one second.

666
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,593
The public doesn't always know
what's best for them.

667
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,320
So, tonight, we'll release the Minotaur,

668
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,869
and scare them
into accepting our protection.

669
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,874
It is done, <i>mon amour.</i>

670
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
How do I look?

671
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
You were just...

672
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,114
No, the shapeshifter.

673
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,076
Can someone sound the alarm?

674
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,593
Charlie, Tabitha and Neron
are on to you.

675
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,630
Yeah, I figured.

676
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,955
You need to get out now.

677
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,149
Open all the doors.

678
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,469
Turn off the force fields.

679
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,950
I'm not leaving.

680
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,358
Are you waiting for an invitation?

681
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,994
It's a bloody jailbreak!

682
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,354
I mean, there are pros to trusting
your apologies are sincere, and cons.

683
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:45,631
Maybe I'll make a list.

684
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,910
Gary, Gary, just...

685
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,516
Go with your heart.

686
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,709
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

687
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,360
- Nora.
- Oh.

688
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,991
Go find John and help him
rescue Ray from Hell.

689
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Oh, fiddlesticks.

690
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:02,197
- Wait!
- Wait, Gary!

691
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,272
Gary, you dick.

692
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,959
Come on, you lot. Get a move on.

693
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,633
You don't have to tell me twice.

694
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,240
Faster, Sassy!

695
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,872
You all right, little one?

696
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,360
Oi, Ogre, catch.

697
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,071
- Charlie, you're out of time.
- Z. Get out of here.

698
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,396
See you on the other side.

699
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,949
<i>I'm going after Mona.</i>

700
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,990
Mona.

701
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:47,319
Come on, love.
Let's get you out of here.

702
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,352
Oh, I hate shapeshifters.
Break her neck.

703
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,839
Patience, <i>mon amour.</i>

704
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Get Mona.

705
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
No.

706
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,156
Looks like things ain't going so well
for you, Neron.

707
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,358
You wanted a monster to attack DC.

708
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,080
Now, you have every single monster.

709
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
In one.

710
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,116
You promised you'd take me to see Astra.

711
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,395
Patience, John.

712
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,152
I made a pledge to you,

713
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,800
and I expect you
to keep your end of the bargain.

714
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,952
What the hell are you playing at?

715
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,036
John.

716
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,600
John, is it really you?

717
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Yes.

718
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,559
Yes, Astra, love. It's me.
It's me. It's Johnny.

719
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,310
Thank God.

720
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,469
God?

721
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,117
You know better than to thank him.

722
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Astra?

723
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,550
John is here to take you back to Earth.

724
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,309
You're welcome to go.

725
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,909
Yeah. It's all right, love. It's me.

726
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,070
No.

727
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Wait.

728
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,790
Hold on.

729
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,069
What do you mean "no"?

730
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,720
Looks like the deal is null and void.

731
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,392
Neron is a thorn in our side, John.

732
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,395
But torturing you

733
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,720
is too much fun.

734
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,230
John?

735
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,076
It's following me.

736
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,920
Make it go away.

737
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,436
Please.

738
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,195
John. Get me out of here.

739
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,229
Astra, love.

740
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,075
This isn't you.

741
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,913
No. Of course it is.

742
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,471
Or would you rather
I stayed that terrified little girl,

743
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,519
crying and waiting
for you to come and rescue me?

744
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,270
I would have been waiting a long time.

745
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,912
I'm so, so sorry, love.

746
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,837
But this place, it's twisted you.

747
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,555
If anything,

748
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,119
it's made me more like you.

749
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,235
Right, John?

750
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,549
You're not like me.

751
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,080
You're not.

752
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,035
You chose wrong.

753
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,799
You should have saved your friend.

754
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,916
Hey! Watch it.

755
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,154
Back off, freak.

756
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,192
It's like a demented Noah's Ark.

757
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,480
What about Charlie?

758
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,875
It's my fault. I'm the one that
convinced her to risk everything.

759
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,679
Hey. Don't go down that road.

760
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,757
- We'll do what we always do.
- Yeah?

761
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,913
Forming stupid Beebos?

762
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,399
Hey. Where you going?

763
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,436
Well, after everything,

764
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,800
I just figured you wouldn't
wanna have me around anymore.

765
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,673
It's all hands on deck, Gary.

766
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,999
Yeah. We're gonna need
all our friends to defeat Neron.

767
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,915
Aye, aye.

768
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,476
You all right?

769
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Not really.

770
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,159
I'm glad you and Wicksty are okay.

771
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,030
What happened?

772
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,390
Oh, my God.

773
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Hi.

774
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,394
My name is Zari.
