1
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
(HORSE WHINNIES)

2
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,175
SOLDIER 1: Hold that wagon!

3
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,067
You've just won the biggest prize
in the world.

4
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,194
What could you possibly have
to be upset about?

5
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,948
Come on, you can tell me.

6
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,826
Queen of Thorns
give you one last prick in the balls

7
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,244
before saying goodbye?

8
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,872
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

9
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,999
BRONN: There is no more High Septon.

10
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,251
No, there isn't, is there?

11
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,629
There is still
the question of my prize.

12
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,092
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

13
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,594
It's not a castle.

14
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,556
How 'bout that one? It's available.

15
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,766
You don't want Highgarden.

16
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,727
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

17
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,645
Daenerys Targaryen could come
and take it back

18
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:07,855
the day after you move in.

19
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,150
Besides, think of the upkeep.

20
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,278
The more you own,
the more it weighs you down.

21
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,072
Oh, is that why
you're so fucking glum, hey?

22
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,241
All your new riches weighing you down?

23
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,160
SOLDIER 2: Move up!

24
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,246
JAIME: They're not mine.
This all belongs to the Iron Bank.

25
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,084
See? We pay our debts.

26
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,002
Right. Just not to me.

27
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,632
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of

28
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,009
whatever nameless shit heap
you're from,

29
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:41,347
with a saddlebag full of gold,
complaining about not getting paid.

30
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,140
When we win this war,

31
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,227
all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms
will be yours to choose from,

32
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,937
with no one left
to take them away from you.

33
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,232
Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign
will be quiet and peaceable.

34
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,026
- Stranger things have happened.
- Like what?

35
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,031
The granaries are being emptied,
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

36
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:00,116
The current harvest?

37
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,452
We have teams of men collecting it,
from all the farms in the Reach.

38
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,746
Ser Bronn,
will you accompany the Tarlys

39
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,040
and help them accelerate this process?

40
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:10,084
I'm not much for shoveling wheat.

41
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:15,381
No, but motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over their harvest...

42
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,174
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

43
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,138
- My lord.
- My lord.

44
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,641
My lord.

45
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,446
TYCHO: I must say,
I don't think the Iron Bank

46
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:43,075
has ever had a debt of this magnitude
repaid in a single installment.

47
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:47,329
I always considered your father
a very effective and efficient man,

48
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:50,749
but you appear to be
redefining those terms entirely.

49
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,960
You're too kind, my lord.

50
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,297
I am neither kind nor a lord,
Your Grace.

51
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,550
I am merely an instrument
of the institution I represent.

52
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,053
Its well-being is a matter of
arithmetic, not sentiment.

53
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:06,223
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

54
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,685
- The gold...
- Is on its way.

55
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,771
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

56
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,567
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

57
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,111
They've grown rather fond of
your interest payments.

58
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:22,364
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

59
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:27,620
Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance
in some current venture.

60
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,788
My only venture at this moment is

61
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,124
reestablishing control
over this continent

62
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,293
and every person on it.

63
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,379
I see a great deal of potential
in that venture.

64
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,467
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

65
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,551
It will, indeed.

66
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,804
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

67
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,350
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to
the Golden Company in Essos.

68
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,434
I know them well.

69
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,020
They have helped us recover
significant sums

70
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,773
from parties
who'd fallen into deep arrears.

71
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,775
That's good to hear.

72
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,070
I, too, would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

73
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:07,660
Rest assured, Your Grace, you can
count on the Iron Bank's support.

74
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,746
As soon as the gold arrives.

75
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,834
LITTLEFINGER: This is for you.

76
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,551
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

77
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,553
but your mother fought him off.

78
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,856
The other dagger,
the one that took her life,

79
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,279
I would have stopped that dagger
with my own heart, if I could have.

80
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,950
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

81
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,870
But I am here for her now.

82
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:57,334
To do what she would have done.
To protect her children.

83
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:05,926
Anything I can do for you, Brandon,
you need only ask.

84
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,639
Do you know who this belonged to?

85
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,474
No.

86
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,938
That very question was what started
the War of the Five Kings.

87
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,526
In a way, that dagger
made you what you are today.

88
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,739
Forced from your home, driven out
to the wilds beyond the Wall.

89
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,493
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

90
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,214
To go through all of that
and make your way home again,

91
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:49,553
only to find such chaos in the world,
I can only imagine...

92
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,847
Chaos is a ladder.

93
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,353
(DOOR OPENS)

94
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:03,901
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

95
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,779
I'm sorry to have disturbed you,
Lord Stark.

96
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,405
I'm not Lord Stark.

97
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,168
What's that?

98
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,381
Maester Wolkan built it for me
so I can move around more easily.

99
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,882
It's a very good idea.

100
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,136
You're leaving.

101
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,016
I don't want to leave you. But when...

102
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,687
When they come,
I need to be with my family.

103
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,650
You're safe.
Well, safe as anyone can be now.

104
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,111
You don't need me anymore.

105
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,572
No, I don't.

106
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,161
That's all you've got to say?

107
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,206
Thank you.

108
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,667
"Thank you"?

109
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,336
For helping me.

110
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:11,009
My brother died for you.
Hodor and Summer died for you.

111
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,470
I almost died for you.

112
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,977
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

113
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,647
Not anymore.

114
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,194
I remember what it felt like
to be Brandon Stark.

115
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,781
But I remember so much else now.

116
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,457
(VOICE BREAKING)
You died in that cave.

117
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:23,957
SOLDIER 1: I did. The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

118
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,375
SOLDIER 2:
The only thing in the kitchen

119
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,252
that you've put
your cock in is the liver.

120
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,715
'Ey up. Where you going?

121
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,092
In there. I live here.

122
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,013
- Fuck off.
- I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

123
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,600
(LAUGHS AND SNORTS)

124
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,519
Arya Stark's dead.

125
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,190
Send for Maester Luwin,
or Ser Rodrik.

126
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,274
They'll tell you who I am.

127
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,443
There's no Rodrik here.

128
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,153
Maester's named Wolkan.

129
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,532
Go ask Jon Snow then,
the King in the North.

130
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,951
- He's my brother.
- He's 1,000 miles away.

131
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,745
Look, it's cold and we're busy,

132
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,997
so, you know, best fuck off.

133
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,207
Mmm.

134
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,001
If Jon's gone,
who's in charge of Winterfell?

135
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:13,048
The Lady of Winterfell? Lady Stark?

136
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,758
- Which Lady Stark?
- SOLDIER 2: You tell us.

137
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,635
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

138
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,474
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

139
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,435
Lady Sansa is too busy
to waste her breath on you.

140
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,603
Just like us.

141
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,357
So, for the last time, fuck off.
(GRUNTS)

142
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,281
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

143
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,951
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

144
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,788
But if I am, and Sansa finds out
you turned me away...

145
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:58,093
Right, you sit there.
Right there. Don't move.

146
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,097
Right, go tell Lady Stark,
I'll watch her.

147
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,641
SOLDIER 2: I ain't telling Lady Stark.
You can tell her.

148
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,643
SOLDIER 1: Why me?

149
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,087
- You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

150
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,840
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you
right in the fucking face,

151
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,425
as hard as I can.

152
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,102
SOLDIER 1: We told her to wait.

153
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,104
We were standing
right next to her, and...

154
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,315
SOLDIER 2: And when we'd turned
around, she'd gone, my lady.

155
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,942
She was nothing.
Some winter town girl.

156
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,403
- Comes in asking for Ser Rodrik...
- Rodrik, yeah.

157

- And Maester Luwin.
- Luwin, yeah.

158
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:03,575
And don't trouble yourself over it,
my lady. We'll find her.

159
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,162
You don't have to.
I know where she is.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

161
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,847
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

162
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,559
Yes.

163
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,829
You shouldn't have
run from the guards.

164
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,374
I didn't run. You need better guards.

166
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,217
It suits you. Lady Stark.

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,679
- Jon left you in charge?
- He did.

168
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,600
I hope he comes back soon.

169
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,060
I remember how happy he was to see me.

170
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:15,439
When he sees you,
his heart will probably stop.

It doesn't look like him.

Should've been carved by someone
who knew his face.

174

Everyone who knew his face is dead.

We're not.

They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?

177
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,806
- I wish I had.
- Hmm.

178
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:54,895
Me, too. I was angry
when I heard someone else had done it.

However long my list got,
he was always first.

How did you get back to Winterfell?

183
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,212
It's a long story.
I imagine yours is, too.

184
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:24,216
Yes. Not a very pleasant one.

Mine neither.

186
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:34,851
- But our stories aren't over yet.
- No, they're not.

Arya...

188
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,281
Bran's home, too.

189
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:27,946
You came home.

190
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,795
I saw you at the Crossroads.

191
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,259
- You saw me?
- I see quite a lot now.

192
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:53,013
Bran has visions.

193
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,266
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

194
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,478
- So did I.
- Why would you go back there?

195
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,190
Cersei's on her list of names.

196
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,453
Who else is on your list?

197
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,330
Most of them are dead already.

198
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,345
- Where did you get this?
- Littlefinger gave it to me.

199
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,890
Littlefinger? He's here?

200
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,558
He has declared for House Stark.

201
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,895
- Why would he give you a dagger?
- He thought I'd want it.

202
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,606
- Why?
- Because it was meant to kill me.

203
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,778
The cutthroat. After your fall?

204
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,364
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

205
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,533
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

206
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,660
He's not a generous man.

207

He wouldn't give you anything

208

unless he thought
he was getting something back.

209

It doesn't matter.

What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

I don't want it.

Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.

213
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,639
It's wasted on a cripple.

214
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,760
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

215
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,263
You kept your vow.

before we start hacking it to bits.

Well, this is it. All we'll ever need.

There is something else
I want to show you, Your Grace.

231
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,924
The Children of the Forest made these.

232

When?

A very long time ago.

They were right here,
standing where we're standing.

235

Before there were Targaryens or Starks
or Lannisters.

00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,074
Maybe even before there were men.

No.

238

They were here together,

Doing what? Fighting each other?

240
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,859
They fought together,
against their common enemy.

241
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,239
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

242

Together.

243
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:52,372

if we're going to survive.

'Cause the enemy is real.
It's always been real.

without my armies and my dragons?

Not after everything they've suffered.

251
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,354
They will if their king does.

252
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,609
They chose you to lead them.

253
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,486
They chose you to protect them.

00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:10,074
Isn't their survival more important
than your pride?

All my allies are gone.

I've been sitting here on this island.

from the Reach.

It's still the right plan.

The right plan?

Your strategy has lost us Dorne,
the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

If I've underestimated our enemies...

you made something impossible happen.

Maybe that helps them believe that

Of course.

Is the custom different in Naath?

345

We don't have marriage in Naath,

doesn't exist.

Oh, I'm sorry.

If I may, how did a slave girl come to
advise Daenerys Targaryen?
