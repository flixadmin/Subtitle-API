1
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:19,399
<i>Next, please.</i>

2
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:21,341
Come on, come on.

3
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,041
Next.

4
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:24,406
Name.

5
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:26,343
Gus Gorman.

6
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:36,524
Ah, yes. August Gorman.

7
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:38,958
Have you looked for work this week?

8
00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:41,893
- Yes.
- What kind?

9
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:47,070
- Kitchen technician.
- Dishwasher. Any luck?

10
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:48,873
No, but...

11
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:52,804
According to our records,
you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.

12
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,137
No, it's 35.

13
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,245
Not counting this week.

14
00:00:56,447 --> 00:01:00,816
You secured employment in June as a
messenger and were discharged after...

15
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,783
...one day for...
- No, they said I lost it.

16
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,082
I did not lose it!
It was stolen by a pickpocket.

17
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,657
A television set?

18
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:12,522
It was a teeny tiny, teeny weensy
Japanese television set.

19
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:17,667
The other employment you found was
in a fast-food joint, which lasted...

20
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,200
...28 minutes?

21
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,103
That's some kind of record.
Talk about fast.

22
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:26,801
Those people are crazy. They expect
you to learn that stuff in one day.

23
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:30,970
"Hold the lettuce. Hold the ketchup.
Can I have some sauce, please?"

24
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:33,707
- Mr. Gorman...
- "Two buns. No buns. Some cheese."

25
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:37,417
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis
is generous to a fault but...

26
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:40,916
- I'm not the fault!
- 36 weeks of chronic unemployment.

27
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,219
36 weeks of living off the taxes
of hard-working citizens.

28
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:47,694
- You know what you are?
- Don't call me a bum, I'm not a bum!

29
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:53,535
You are, I was about to say,
no longer eligible.

30
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:55,571
- Well, look...
- Next.

31
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,866
What about this week?
I need this week!

32
00:01:58,376 --> 00:01:59,308
Next.

33
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:01,269
You mean, that's it?

34
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:03,477
"Finished," like "over"?

35
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:08,478
Next.

36
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,949
"Next" as in "bye."

37
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:12,951
Next!

38
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:17,052
Name.

39
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:20,764
Excuse me, brother,
can I have a light?

40
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,693
- How you doing, Alex?
- Hi, Jimmy.

41
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:52,642
Excuse me.

42
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,324
Say thank you.

43
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,677
Way to go, Superman!

44
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:48,584
<i>Your drink is on its way.</i>

45
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:51,288
Sir.

46
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:53,019
Excuse me...

47
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:59,731
...but what if you want to program two
bilateral coordinates at once?

48
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,962
You can't do that. It's impossible.

49
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,868
- But if you can't...
- Oh, no.

50
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:08,102
Computer technology is very advanced,
young lady, but it can't do that.

51
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:11,281
But if you think we can't
do it that way...

52
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,620
Good Lord.

53
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:21,657
How did you do that?

54
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:25,420
I don't know. I just did it.

55
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,939
- Who's this?
- That's him, Ross Webster.

56
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,143
They presented him with
the Humanitarian of the Year award.

57
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:52,083
He is good-looking.

58
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,223
Because I gave him f.2 at a 50th.

59
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:56,188
One thing I don't understand...

60
00:08:56,394 --> 00:09:00,728
...the point of the story Lois wrote
is how Ross got this great honor...

61
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:04,492
...and you bring me one picture of him
and 15 pictures of her.

62
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:07,330
- Who is she?
- Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's...

63
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:10,200
She's just Webster's.
Let's leave it at that.

64
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:13,036
- Who's this other woman?
- His sister, Vera Webster.

65
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:14,541
- Picture looks fuzzy.
- What?

66
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:18,476
The picture's fine, Chief.
She looks like that in real life.

67
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,917
- She's VP of WEBSCOE Industries.
- I really don't understand you.

68
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,385
A boring banquet and you bring me
3,000 boring pictures.

69
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:29,684
Yet Superman saves a man from
drowning on Third Avenue...

70
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:32,727
...while you just stand there and
you don't bring me one picture!

71
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,954
Chief, I didn't have
my camera with me.

72
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:39,535
A photographer eats with his camera.
A photographer sleeps with his camera.

73
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:42,171
- I'm glad I'm a writer.
- Mr. White, please.

74
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,536
It's time for you to draw this month's
winning JINGO number.

75
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:48,439
Prize is an all-expenses trip
to South America.

76
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,274
- Why the idiot in circulation...
- Good morning.

77
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:53,507
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy.

78
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,480
You've got mustard on your lapel.

79
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,677
Mr. White, I hate to interrupt...

80
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,152
I'm busy.
I got a paper to get out here.

81
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,382
It'll never replace
the printing press.

82
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:05,585
- What's the number, Mr. White?
- 53.

83
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,794
- Mr. White...
- 53!

84
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:13,435
- Mr. White...
- You need to pull three more numbers.

85
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:16,367
I promised I'd call them back today.
What do you think?

86
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,570
- Well, I don't know, Kent...
- I think it'd make a terrific story.

87
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,404
What's a terrific story?

88
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:25,980
Kent's been invited
to his high school reunion.

89
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,975
- Say.
- Yeah.

90
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:29,982
Could we have the next number?

91
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:32,621
It's practically an American ritual.
Right, Jimmy?

92
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:36,725
I don't know. Most of the people
I know are still in high school.

93
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,295
33.

94
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,263
What I thought this story
would be about...

95
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,095
33.

96
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:50,164
- Is how the typical small town's
changed in the last 15 years.

97
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:51,500
Take me, for example:

98
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,406
Can I go back to middle America
now as a Metropolis sophisticate?

99
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,548
I'm really excited about this.
I was looking around...

100
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:01,217
...in my closet last night...

101
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:05,252
...and even found
my old high school sweater.

102
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:09,651
- Smallville.
- Mr. White.

103
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,352
Can I go ahead and
make my travel plan?

104
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:13,996
Same question about mine.

105
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,665
Tell your people the prodigal son and
his photographer are coming home.

106
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,700
Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. White.

107
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:25,838
It isn't easy for me to lose
one of my best reporters.

108
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:28,409
- That's okay.
- You deserve the vacation, Lois.

109
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:29,840
Thank you.

110
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:33,949
Lois, are you going someplace?

111
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:38,814
Clark, you know some people get to go
all the way to Smallville...

112
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:42,789
...and then there are others of us
who have to go to Bermuda.

113
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:44,057
Golly.

114
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:45,862
Bye.

115
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:51,690
- Have fun.
- Mr. White, the next number, please.

116
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:54,837
Well, I guess I better be going too.

117
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:58,468
So I'll be going.

118
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:02,601
Bye.

119
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,510
Could we get a computer to do this?

120
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,501
Hey, what is this?

121
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,540
First paycheck.

122
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:38,243
This is the first rip-off, man!
Supposed to get 225 a week, right?

123
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:41,680
This says, "$143.80."
How am I supposed to live on that?

124
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:45,286
State tax, federal tax,
social security tax...

125
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:48,014
So you still get some money
when you hit 65.

126
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,420
So I'm getting money when I... 65?

127
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:51,923
I want mine now!

128
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:56,623
I want to enjoy it while I'm young.
Get up and get down. Boogie.

129
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:02,902
Actually, it's probably more like
$143.80 and one half cent.

130
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:07,476
There are always fractions left over,
but big corporations round it down.

131
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:10,374
What do I do with half a cent?
Buy a thoroughbred mouse?

132
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:12,479
Everybody loses those fractions?

133
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:15,447
They don't lose them.
Can't lose what you never got.

134
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,847
Then what happens?
The company gets them?

135
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:22,685
They can't be bothered collecting that
from your paycheck any more than you.

136
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,325
Then what happens to them?

137
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:29,021
Well, they're just floating around
out there. The computers know where.

138
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,723
How many sugars?

139
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,800
One and a half.

140
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:41,804
It's quitting time. You coming?

141
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:46,745
Yeah. No, actually I got some
stuff to finish up so...

142
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:51,785
Working overtime, huh? What are you
doing, buddy? Looking for a raise?

143
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:55,023
Yeah, looking for a raise.

144
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:33,487
You bet.

145
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:43,333
But my Uncle Al on my father's side,
he won't eat her stuffing.

146
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,204
He says it should be on the outside
of the turkey but she puts it inside.

147
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:52,576
Aunt Helen's my father's half sister.
I told you that, right?

148
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:53,909
Yeah.

149
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:55,745
- And anyway...
- Hey, hey.

150
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:58,087
- Look at that.
- Wow!

151
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,268
Okay, your choice:
Turn back or pull over till it's over.

152
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,870
- How long?
- Can't tell with these fires.

153
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:19,236
I mean, that fire...
That's spreading like wildfire.

154
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:20,910
It's just a building burning.

155
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:23,409
It's not just a building.
It's a chemical plant.

156
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:27,179
You know what I mean.
It's like... It's like chemicals.

157
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:32,014
If that stuff goes up in smoke,
it'll be a hairy time around here.

158
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:34,921
- Clark.
- Yeah.

159
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,457
I want you to keep them distracted.

160
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:38,753
What are you doing?

161
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:42,022
What am I doing?
Remember what the chief said?

162
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,427
Photographer always
goes after a story.

163
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:46,159
That could be dangerous.

164
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,431
Danger goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.

165
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,501
Help me!

166
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:30,206
Help me!

167
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,449
- How can I help?
- Get this man a helmet.

168
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:38,848
- Oh, it's you.
- How bad is it?

169
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:43,425
It's a nightmare. Everything's either
explosive or flammable or worse.

170
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,690
- Get the ladder truck.
- It won't reach.

171
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,095
My God, they're trapped!

172
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:55,669
What's he gonna do?
Fly them down one at a time?

173
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,052
Let's go! Everybody, down there!
Move it!

174
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,818
Come on! Hurry up!

175
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:19,120
There you go.

176
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,898
Right down there. Take it easy.

177
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:28,968
All right. Everybody down there!

178
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:07,736
Get out.
I'll show you the quickest way.

179
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:10,038
Look after the others.
I can't leave here.

180
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,475
- Why not?
- I have to look after those.

181
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:14,241
That's concentrated Beltric acid.

182
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,511
If it heats up over 180 degrees,
we've got a crisis...

183
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,053
...that'll make this fire
seem like a picnic.

184
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:21,315
What does it do?

185
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,356
As long as it remains stable,
it's just ordinary acid.

186
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:28,026
But if it begins to heat up,
it'll turn volatile.

187
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:31,462
You'll get a great cloud of smoke
that'll eat through anything.

188
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:34,228
Steel, concrete, anything.

189
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:46,876
Who the hell is that?

190
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,885
- Hey, you! Get off of there!
- Just gonna get a couple more shots.

191
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:11,471
Tell them to bring their hoses
back here! Quickly!

192
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:15,569
Help!

193
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:17,641
Help!

194
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,915
Help me!

195
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:24,243
Help! Somebody help me!

196
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:26,814
- Help!
- It's all right.

197
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,685
- Superman! My leg.
- I got you. Take it easy.

198
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,588
We'll go nice and easy.

199
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,595
Okay, I'm sorry.
All right? Here we go.

200
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,696
Medics! Over here, please.

201
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:44,433
That's it. Here you go.

202
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,199
Go easy. It's the left leg.

203
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:48,976
- Camera.
- Yeah.

204
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:52,506
It's a clean break across the fibula.

205
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,610
- My camera.
- Sorry, Jimmy. You'll be okay.

206
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:02,683
Get the fire out! Or there'll be
a cloud of acid all over the East.

207
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,190
- Christ, the pump house is gone!
- What?

208
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,890
- The pump house!
- We've lost the water pressure!

209
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,401
- We've got to have water!
- How?

210
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:18,472
Lake Comooga's five miles away!
We'd need a five-mile hose!

211
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,734
- Where's this lake?
- That way.

212
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:33,082
- Tell them it's hopeless.
- We had an adequate water supply.

213
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:35,315
Water!

214
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,491
I tell you, that man's a miracle!

215
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,786
Carol, you got gorgeous!

216
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,942
Look at you.

217
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:45,449
That was against Mid-City.
I'll never forget it.

218
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,619
Fourth quarter, score was tied...

219
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,556
...we're back at the 25 yard line.

220
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:55,026
Coach sends in play,
Right Flanker Option.

221
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:07,136
You really have grown, Clark.

222
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,175
You look very well, Miss Bannister.

223
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:14,146
I can't complain. I take the stairs
a little slow and I have these spells.

224
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:16,885
But really, I can't complain.

225
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,821
<i>Lana?</i>

226
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,048
<i>Clark?</i>

227
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,191
Would you excuse me? There's
someone I'd like to say hello to.

228
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:34,797
Lana?

229
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:39,335
- Lana Lang? It's great to see you.
- Clark.

230
00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:44,078
- You look wonderful.
- Me? No, you look... Wow!

231
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:47,250
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- I can manage.

232
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:54,017
First time you've come back
since your mom passed away.

233
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,124
Yeah. I'm sorry.

234
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,222
I heard that you and...

235
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:03,529
...Donald split up.
- Did you eat yet?

236
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,791
No.

237
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:07,763
Beg your pardon. Excuse me. Sorry.

238
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:13,404
- That's not right.
- No?

239
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,078
You're right about Donald and me...
Hold that.

240
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,337
Oh, sure.

241
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:21,583
- Hi, Kent.
- Oh.

242
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:24,215
Hi. How you doing?

243
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm sorry. I'm going nuts.

244
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:33,561
- Clark.
- Yeah.

245
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,591
Lana.

246
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:37,793
Uh-oh.

247
00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:40,094
Hey, sweet.

248
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,631
Here I am.

249
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:46,970
Remember when you were prom queen?
All us guys were waiting for a dance?

250
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:50,237
There's only one guy on your
dance card now. Good old...

251
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,846
Brad Wilson.

252
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,883
- Hi, Brad.
- Hi, Kent.

253
00:24:55,218 --> 00:24:56,947
Long time no see.

254
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:59,053
You know, see, see, see?

255
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:02,248
- Come on, Lana.
- No, I can't.

256
00:25:02,692 --> 00:25:03,920
Clark already asked me.

257
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,617
- I did?
- Yeah.

258
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:06,659
Excuse me.

259
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,596
Lana, I haven't danced...

260
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:57,209
Ah, Gorman.
Another week, another check.

261
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:04,052
Don't you have another one for me?
I put in a voucher for expenses.

262
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:05,551
What?

263
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,916
Yeah, yeah.

264
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,420
Here you go.

265
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,813
Thanks for helping me out.

266
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,710
A lot of guys would like
to be where I am.

267
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:43,255
You'd be surprised at how many offers
I didn't get. Even Brad didn't stay.

268
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,021
- It really isn't easy.
- The streamers? You just pull.

269
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:49,754
No, not streamers. Everything.

270
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:52,298
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just that...

271
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:55,471
...I don't know why, I just feel
like I can talk to you.

272
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:56,669
What?

273
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:59,205
I feel like I can talk to you!

274
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:01,734
- You can?
- Yes.

275
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:03,913
- You know something, Lana?
- What?

276
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,314
I always...

277
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:09,780
I always wished that you would.

278
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:11,920
I mean, even back in high school.

279
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:14,749
- Remember when you were...
- Queen of the prom.

280
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:18,384
Three years after the royal wedding,
the king abdicated.

281
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,085
Isn't that terrible?

282
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:24,494
- Yeah, sure is.
- There's a ton of potato salad left.

283
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:27,335
You know what the problem is?

284
00:27:28,404 --> 00:27:30,269
Don't know, too much mayonnaise?

285
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:33,237
Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would that be the problem?

286
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,276
No, the problem is,
why do I stay in Smallville?

287
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,242
I've asked myself that.

288
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:42,975
Do you know how lucky you are to live
in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.

289
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:47,350
- Well, you could...
- Easy to say. What about Ricky?

290
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:48,421
Ricky?

291
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,887
My little boy.

292
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:52,419
- You? Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

293
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:57,157
At least here we have a house and
I've got a job that pays the bills.

294
00:27:57,367 --> 00:28:00,859
Except for last winter when
the fuel bills kept going up and up.

295
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:04,302
Yeah. Even had to pawn
my diamond ring then.

296
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:05,936
That's a shame.

297
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:15,344
You never got married?

298
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,047
- Me?
- Yeah.

299
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:20,989
Well, I was...

300
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,982
No. Not...

301
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,070
Years later you can look at
someone and think...

302
00:28:36,306 --> 00:28:39,036
..."Well, I guess that's
the one that got away."

303
00:28:43,947 --> 00:28:47,508
Give me that again, old buddy.
Run it by me just one more time.

304
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:50,208
- $85,000.
- Missing.

305
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,947
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
Stolen from the firm.

306
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:55,351
By whom?

307
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,049
That's what I want to know.
By whom? Whom?

308
00:28:58,294 --> 00:28:59,886
Vera, get ahold of yourself.

309
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:02,162
Nobody else ever will.

310
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:04,025
I don't know.

311
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:05,200
Whom?

312
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:07,562
In the old days, it was simple.

313
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,104
We kept books, we knew what was
going in and what was paid out.

314
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:13,969
If somebody wanted to rob you...

315
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,678
...they'd use a gun and say,
"Stick 'em up."

316
00:29:16,913 --> 00:29:20,007
Now they get blasted computers
to do their dirty work.

317
00:29:20,617 --> 00:29:23,484
My friend, you are yesterday.

318
00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:26,553
Whoever pulled this caper,
is tomorrow.

319
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:30,852
Mr. Webster,
it's time for your massage.

320
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,721
Bubba, can she burst in...

321
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:36,693
Now, now, Vera. Simpson,
you know my psychic nutritionist?

322
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:41,029
- Hello.
- We are trying to hold a meeting here.

323
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:45,298
Why don't you hold your breath
instead? Maybe you'll turn blue.

324
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:48,773
- Improvement.
- I'm about to take a human life.

325
00:29:48,978 --> 00:29:52,106
Simpson, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

326
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:58,744
- Mouths closed. Ears open.
- She's a big pig.

327
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:02,049
I can't have anyone with me
who isn't with me.

328
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:03,791
Now, girls.

329
00:30:04,227 --> 00:30:05,057
Simpson.

330
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:07,495
Well, old chum. What now?

331
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:10,393
Kiss the 85 thou goodbye?

332
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,400
Keep on paying the thief his salary
until he shakes the money tree again?

333
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,698
- He's bound to slip sooner or later.
- Why?

334
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:20,239
That's what they always say
in the movies.

335
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,934
He won't slip up at all.
No, not at all.

336
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:25,774
He'll keep quietly taking
the bread from our mouths.

337
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:30,214
He'll keep a low profile and won't do
a thing to call attention to himself.

338
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,823
Unless, of course, he is
a complete and utter moron.

339
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:54,205
I'll go first. Andrew.

340
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,846
- I'll pick Chris.
- You feel good? You feel ready?

341
00:30:58,081 --> 00:30:59,378
Ricky, your shoe.

342
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:02,813
- You mean, we've gotta take Ricky?
- You guys lost the toss.

343
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,180
All right, come on Ricky.

344
00:31:05,388 --> 00:31:07,322
- Wait, wait...
- Come on, good luck.

345
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,291
- I just can't stand this.
- Oh, Lana. It'll be okay.

346
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,792
I know, I was a late bloomer myself.

347
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:18,660
It's not just that he's small, he's
the only kid in town without a father.

348
00:31:19,102 --> 00:31:23,505
Oh, look. Stewed to the gills
in the middle of the afternoon.

349
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:25,799
- I only had chocolate milk.
- No, him.

350
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:27,475
Hey, sweet thing.

351
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:29,912
Little kid getting hassled, huh?

352
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,038
- Kent, you still here?
- I seem to be, Brad.

353
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:35,945
All he needs is a few pointers
from the old champ here.

354
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,947
I won the all-country bowling trophy
two years in a row.

355
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:40,179
I didn't know that.

356
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:42,857
Yeah. Natural athlete
can play any sport.

357
00:31:43,993 --> 00:31:46,860
- It's all right. It'll be okay.
- He'll make it worse.

358
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:55,293
You watch, he'll get a spare.

359
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:56,605
Come on, Ricky.

360
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:00,271
Kid, you're holding it all wrong.

361
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:04,142
- Let old Brad show you how it's done.
- Brad.

362
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:09,108
Excuse me. Say, Brad, I think maybe
he'll be better off doing it his way.

363
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:12,845
For a guy lucky to be waterboy,
you've got a big mouth.

364
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:16,316
I don't think he needs a lesson
in front of the other kids.

365
00:32:16,526 --> 00:32:20,462
- He needs a man to show him.
- He's doing just fine. Excuse me.

366
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:23,629
Here you go, Ricky.

367
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,768
And give it your best shot.
Okay? There you go.

368
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:30,433
Sorry.

369
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:47,921
Gesundheit.

370
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:49,250
Thank you.

371
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:54,558
Hey, Gus, the boss wants to see you.

372
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,324
He can see me all right.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

373
00:32:57,533 --> 00:33:00,969
No, not that boss. The boss.

374
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:03,605
You mean, the boss...

375
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:05,296
...wants to see me?

376
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:08,602
Oh, my God,
why would he want to see me?

377
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:10,005
I mean...

378
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,612
Why would the boss want to see me?

379
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:16,545
There's no reason.

380
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,344
Then why'd he?
Oh, I know!

381
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:22,615
It's my suggestion for
the volleyball uniforms.

382
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:24,053
That's it.

383
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,836
Ross the boss. Ross the boss.
The boss!

384
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:42,869
Be calm. Be cool. Be collected.

385
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:50,575
Mr. Webster? Mr. Webster?

386
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,419
Mr. Webster, I did not...
Mr. Webster.

387
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,883
Mr. August Gorman?

388
00:33:57,093 --> 00:33:58,253
August Gorman here.

389
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:02,989
I know you're a man of compassion,
and I don't want to go to jail...

390
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:05,190
...because they have
robbers and rapists...

391
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:07,767
I just want to ask you one question.

392
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,734
You've been a naughty guy,
haven't you?

393
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,339
Come on, admit it, now.

394
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:15,066
You've been a little bit naughty,
haven't you?

395
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:18,042
- I was kind of...
- That's all right. I understand.

396
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:21,410
I can...
What do the young folks say today?

397
00:34:21,617 --> 00:34:24,279
"Dig where you're coming from,
brother."

398
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:27,320
You want to be rich, right?

399
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:31,050
I was born rich. Never worn
the same pair of socks twice.

400
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,750
What do you do with your socks?

401
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:36,830
They're laundered and sent to
some charitable institution, I think.

402
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,230
I don't know.
Maybe they turn them into rags...

403
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:41,869
...or pen-wipers or something.

404
00:34:42,071 --> 00:34:43,732
Or maybe socks.

405
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,670
Yes! That never occurred to me.

406
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:50,676
Gus, you know something?
You're a genius.

407
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:54,542
A naughty genius, but what the hell?
Nobody's perfect. Cheers.

408
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,776
Because of the half-cent thing
with the computers.

409
00:34:57,987 --> 00:35:00,888
No, no, because computers rule
the world today.

410
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,753
The fellow that can fool the computers
can rule the world himself.

411
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,220
I've been searching for somebody
who can make these machines do...

412
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:11,764
...what they're not supposed to.
Get my drift?

413
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:13,362
Yes!

414
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:18,837
Webscoe, the Webscoe industrial
complex, is a family-owned cartel.

415
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,906
Some magnesium here,
some zinc there.

416
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,078
Railroads, farm machinery.
You follow?

417
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:24,769
I follow you, sir.

418
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,176
Gus, do you know what I want now?

419
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:28,315
I want coffee.

420
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,246
Black, cream, sugar, or?

421
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:32,512
No, you don't seem to understand.

422
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:36,158
Under different company names,
I control the price of coffee beans...

423
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,489
...in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia,
Jamaica and the Republic of Gabon.

424
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:44,462
But I've got a problem and I think
maybe you can help me.

425
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:48,626
One country won't play ball with me.
You know how that can bug a guy.

426
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:51,102
That could bug...
What country?

427
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:53,567
Colombia.

428
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,674
Colombia?

429
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:57,903
Colombia has two import and exports,
and one of them's coffee.

430
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,743
And I've tried to reason with them.
Believe me, I've tried.

431
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,079
But this one miserable,
pissant little country...

432
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:09,553
...has the gall to think it can
dictate the economy of an open market.

433
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:13,457
Gus, my friend...

434
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:17,094
...we're going to teach them
a lesson, aren't we?

435
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,967
Destroy the entire
Colombian coffee crop...

436
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,695
...right down to the last bean.

437
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:26,101
- The last bean, we are.
- Right.

438
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:29,709
But you got so much...

439
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:32,540
A wise man once said, I think
it was Attila the Hun:

440
00:36:32,748 --> 00:36:35,342
"It is not enough that I succeed.

441
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:38,486
Everyone else must fail."

442
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:40,244
Seems fair.

443
00:36:40,556 --> 00:36:41,989
- Gus.
- What?

444
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:45,888
You are going to do this for me.

445
00:36:48,464 --> 00:36:50,625
- How?
- The weather.

446
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,028
You didn't say your mom was here.

447
00:36:53,235 --> 00:36:56,170
I'm his sister. His baby sister.

448
00:36:56,372 --> 00:36:59,398
Gus, tell me, have you ever
heard of Vulcan?

449
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,040
Hi, Ms. Vulcan.

450
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:03,973
Vulcan is the weather satellite
our government put up...

451
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,545
...to monitor the weather.

452
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:09,980
But if somebody were to reprogram it,
it could do much more.

453
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,813
It could make weather.

454
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,511
Storms and floods.

455
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:15,485
Blizzards, heat waves.

456
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,851
How do you do that?

457
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:20,558
Like everything else
in the 20th century, Gus.

458
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:22,253
You push buttons.

459
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:27,096
- There you go.
- It's the first time I won anything.

460
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:28,531
You won my hand, Maury.

461
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:31,570
But this is the first time
I won anything valuable.

462
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:33,401
Let's get one with the sombreros.

463
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:37,010
Mr. White, you'll be in this,
handing them their plane tickets.

464
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,545
- Why do I have to do this?
- Why do I have to do this?

465
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:43,149
You're lucky I didn't fire you.
I get a chance at exclusive photos...

466
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:45,013
...of history's biggest
factory fire.

467
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,917
He comes home with a broken leg
and 12 melted rolls of film.

468
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:49,557
It was hot.

469
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:51,885
Smile, Mr. White.

470
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:55,692
South America!
I can't believe my luck!

471
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:58,967
See, if you don't want them
to trace it back...

472
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,228
...you've gotta punch in
to some little rinky-dink outfit...

473
00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:04,872
...that has a little
Mickey Mouse computer...

474
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,043
Someplace you can sneak into, right?

475
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,404
Somebody could...

476
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:13,639
Someplace where nobody knows him
so they can't connect him with us.

477
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:15,817
Webscoe has 112 subsidiaries.

478
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:18,987
They're all linked into
the central computer system.

479
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:20,780
How about someplace...

480
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:22,816
...small?

481
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:29,454
Whoa, there. This is Smallville.
We'll have a five-minute stop here.

482
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,491
Mind your step.

483
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,463
Watch your step, please.

484
00:38:34,203 --> 00:38:35,170
Thanks, Selma.

485
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:37,839
Thanks a lot, Lana.
Have a good day, now.

486
00:38:42,077 --> 00:38:43,601
Let me help you, Lana.

487
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:47,176
I'm sorry.

488
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:52,251
- Thanks, Clark.
- Sit down, Buster. Good boy.

489
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:54,945
Come on, Buster, sit down.
Good boy.

490
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:57,057
You all set? Great.

491
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,868
I'm not saying another word.

492
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:13,535
That's it.

493
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:19,176
Jesus Christ!

494
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,879
Don't they have picnics in Metropolis,
Mr. Kent?

495
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:29,023
Well, not quite like this, Ricky.

496
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:31,193
- Mom and I do this all the time.
- You do?

497
00:39:31,393 --> 00:39:34,362
- I'll help you.
- Stay close by and be careful, okay?

498
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:35,860
Okay, Mom.

499
00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:39,432
Come on, Buster. Let's find you
a rabbit. Come on. Rabbit.

500
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:41,569
This is so nice for him.

501
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,137
It's even nicer when there's
a man around, which isn't that often.

502
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,673
- There's a lot of choices.
- The good ones are married.

503
00:39:47,876 --> 00:39:50,401
So Brad thinks he's
God's gift to women.

504
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,072
He won't take no for an answer,
but he's the only one asking.

505
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:56,911
No, Lana, I meant
there's a lot of choices here.

506
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,644
This is really quite some picnic.
There's...

507
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:01,753
...some of that.

508
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:04,455
Green stuff.

509
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:07,588
Hey, pâté.

510
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:12,332
Boy, this pâté is really unusual.

511
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,166
I didn't make any...
Oh, Clark.

512
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,635
That's Buster's dog food.

513
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,030
- It's good.
- Don't eat it!

514
00:40:20,242 --> 00:40:21,607
What time's the dog eat?

515
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,675
- This is nice.
- Here.

516
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,403
It's all right, Lana.

517
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:28,210
Thanks.

518
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:31,919
Hey, where you going?
Come on!

519
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:34,021
Buster, stop messing about!

520
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:38,916
- How much longer?
- I thought...

521
00:40:39,128 --> 00:40:41,926
- Sorry. No, go ahead.
- You.

522
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:50,268
I was just thinking that...

523
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:53,441
...somebody like you could do
really well in Metropolis.

524
00:40:53,976 --> 00:40:58,310
I have to face it. I'm not gonna
find what I want in Smallville anymore.

525
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:04,580
Could I make it in Metropolis?
What would I do when I got there?

526
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,078
Call me.

527
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,259
- No, I wouldn't want to call you.
- You don't want to call?

528
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,794
Yes, I want to call you, but I
wouldn't want to be a nuisance to you.

529
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:18,926
I don't think you could ever
be a nuisance to me.

530
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:22,998
Clark, may I tell you something?

531
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:28,442
My oil pan is leaking.

532
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:36,180
There's something dripping.

533
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:37,943
- Can I help?
- No, thanks.

534
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:41,955
With all the car trouble I have,
I studied up on auto repair.

535
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:44,048
Look at this.

536
00:41:44,993 --> 00:41:46,551
Oh, boy.

537
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:16,582
I think I'll just go see
if Ricky's all right. You okay?

538
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:07,032
Gosh, is he all right?

539
00:43:19,354 --> 00:43:20,878
Superman?

540
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:22,420
That's me.

541
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,191
Mom! Mom!

542
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:33,032
There you go. He's all right,
but have a doctor check him.

543
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,964
Thank you.

544
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,604
- I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
- Nice to meet you.

545
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:38,966
And this is Clark.

546
00:43:39,174 --> 00:43:42,041
I really have to be going.
So long, Ricky. Bye.

547
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,879
We were flying, Mom!

548
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,514
What were you doing, anyway?

549
00:43:47,716 --> 00:43:49,445
I was looking for Buster.

550
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:52,080
I found him!

551
00:43:53,355 --> 00:43:54,822
Come on, boy. That's it.

552
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,651
Mr. Kent, Superman was here!

553
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,953
- What?
- Yes, he really was.

554
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:02,421
Aren't you excited?

555
00:44:02,631 --> 00:44:05,691
I'm from Metropolis.
I see Superman every day.

556
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:08,893
You do? Could you get me
his autograph?

557
00:44:11,473 --> 00:44:15,375
I don't know. If I had a nickel
for every time some little kid...

558
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,731
Yeah? What do you want?

559
00:44:39,935 --> 00:44:41,664
We're in big trouble, aren't we?

560
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,701
- What?
- We're in big trouble.

561
00:44:43,906 --> 00:44:45,396
First, they lost the invoice.

562
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:49,236
When they found it, they realized
they came up short on a few items.

563
00:44:49,444 --> 00:44:53,642
So I rented a car because I missed the
plane from Cleveland. 4:00, you know.

564
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:57,347
And a flat tire on the highway.
What a kicker.

565
00:44:57,553 --> 00:45:00,681
Had to fix it myself
with these little pinkies.

566
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:05,456
And I figured your boss was gonna be
real peeved, you know what I mean?

567
00:45:05,827 --> 00:45:06,816
What do you mean?

568
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:09,725
He is going to hang our butts
against the wall.

569
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:12,792
He wanted this special order
installed...

570
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,595
...in his office by tomorrow morning.

571
00:45:15,804 --> 00:45:18,034
So let me in because
I gotta set it up tonight.

572
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,502
Get all what set up?

573
00:45:29,651 --> 00:45:33,348
Pal, you are a real lifesaver.
I mean, a real lifesaver.

574
00:45:33,555 --> 00:45:35,750
- Which way's the office?
- Straight ahead.

575
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:38,620
- Follow me.
- I'm right behind you.

576
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:42,820
Not bad. It's pretty good.

577
00:45:43,832 --> 00:45:46,130
You know what's wrong with
this Singapore... wing?

578
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:50,066
Sling! Singapore Sling.

579
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:52,536
What's wrong with it?

580
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:54,606
There's not enough vodka in it.

581
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,438
There's no vodka in it!

582
00:45:57,646 --> 00:46:00,171
What did I tell you?
Put some vodka in it.

583
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,180
What did you... you know?

584
00:46:09,424 --> 00:46:12,154
Here. There's vodka in it now, buddy.

585
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:17,420
Yeah, perfect.

586
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:20,734
- You never do pass out, do you?
- Nope.

587
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:26,335
Never.

588
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:29,368
Job well done, buddy.

589
00:46:29,778 --> 00:46:32,110
You thought I was drunk too,
didn't you?

590
00:46:32,814 --> 00:46:33,781
Fooled you.

591
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:36,507
Get the keys, get the keys.

592
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:03,006
Hello, baby!

593
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,269
How's the little baby?

594
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:11,149
All right, let's get down to it.
Let's do it.

595
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:15,948
One, two, button your shoe.

596
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:36,407
"Both keys at the same time"?

597
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:52,421
Wait. Wait a minute.

598
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,424
Think you've won, don't you?

599
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:58,058
The Philly Flash!

600
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,943
Okay, ready?

601
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,011
One, two, three!

602
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:09,354
We'll see what we'll see.

603
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,363
Come on, please.

604
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:34,501
There it is!

605
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:36,198
Hello! Now...

606
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,105
...getting down to business.

607
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,081
I am a genius.

608
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:46,245
I am a...

609
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:56,860
Longitude...

610
00:51:57,064 --> 00:51:59,862
...and the other thing.
Latitude, right?

611
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:19,650
Oh, look, Maury.
A native wedding.

612
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:47,772
<i>No one said at the Daily Planet
that this is the rainy season!</i>

613
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:28,813
<i>Meteorologists are baffled by
the tornado and rainstorms...</i>

614
00:53:29,022 --> 00:53:31,820
<i>... that struck Colombia
this afternoon...</i>

615
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:36,553
<i>... threatening to destroy its entire
coffee crop for the next five years.</i>

616
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:38,390
<i>Gale force winds up to...</i>

617
00:53:38,598 --> 00:53:41,692
...an incredible 250 miles an hour
lashed the countryside...

618
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:46,605
...while 12 inches of rainfall have
already been recorded in just one day.

619
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:51,540
<i>A spokesman for the Department of
Meteorology said, this was, I quote:</i>

620
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:55,442
<i>"The most awesome display of
natural forces since Noah's ark. "</i>

621
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,482
If I laugh any harder,
I'll split my sides!

622
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:01,779
<i>- To defy all laws of
weather systems known to science.</i>

623
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:06,016
What a shame.

624
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:10,521
Poor little Colombia. Well...

625
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,233
I'm gonna get you for that,
you big silly!

626
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:27,345
Bubba, do you realize
what we're onto?

627
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:29,105
Do I?

628
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:32,410
Every time a drunk sobers up,
he'll drink Webster coffee.

629
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:34,610
Why stop at coffee?

630
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:38,719
A cup of coffee gets the world
off to work in the morning.

631
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:41,018
But what keeps the world working?

632
00:54:41,895 --> 00:54:42,884
Diet soda?

633
00:54:44,164 --> 00:54:46,257
Vera, you mean?
You mean?

634
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:48,866
Today, coffee.

635
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:50,593
Tomorrow...

636
00:54:50,804 --> 00:54:51,634
...the oil!

637
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:53,931
- Oil?
- If Gus can push the right buttons...

638
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,166
I can have it all.
Holy cats!

639
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,969
All the oil.

640
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:00,373
All the pumps.

641
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,013
All the tankers.

642
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,773
This is some nifty idea, Vera.

643
00:55:03,984 --> 00:55:05,645
- Boss?
- Very nifty.

644
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:08,320
- Just the man I want to see.
- It's not my fault.

645
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,217
Isn't it neat? There...

646
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:12,321
- What's not your fault?
- Superman.

647
00:55:13,026 --> 00:55:15,620
How was I to know he'd start
doing his thing...

648
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:17,888
...when you started doing your thing?

649
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:20,862
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talk?

650
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,968
It was just on television, man.
Didn't you see it?

651
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,535
Don't call me "man."

652
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,003
I just saw Colombia bite the dust.

653
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:32,440
You didn't see the man come flying
out of the sky? It was him!

654
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:35,176
With his cape flapping in the...

655
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:41,580
His cape was flapping in the wind!

656
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:44,052
He was flying! He was great!

657
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,054
He was just flying around...

658
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:49,693
<i>His cape was blowing in the wind.
It looked like a flag!</i>

659
00:55:50,897 --> 00:55:53,832
And he landed right in the middle
of this big plantation!

660
00:55:56,169 --> 00:55:59,400
And he checked everything out
with his x-ray vision.

661
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:04,134
And then he put these laser beams
out of his eyes onto everything.

662
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,503
<i>Straight-out laser points.</i>

663
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,011
<i>Dried up everything!</i>

664
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,682
Just like that!

665
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:13,944
Dried it up,
like the machines in the men's rooms.

666
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:15,121
You know what I mean?

667
00:56:15,322 --> 00:56:17,620
Hot air comes out when you put
your hands under.

668
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:19,485
Sometimes they don't work.

669
00:56:19,693 --> 00:56:20,990
But Superman's works!

670
00:56:21,194 --> 00:56:24,220
You think he stood around
to take bows? Not this man.

671
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:27,025
No, sir. He flies off again!

672
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,667
Then he saw what
really caused the trouble.

673
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:31,632
He flew into the tornado...

674
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:35,467
...went down to the bottom of it,
and turned it upside down!

675
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:39,076
<i>He made the little end on top
and the big end on the bottom!</i>

676
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,679
I was gonna go crazy!

677
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,043
Big end was on the bottom.

678
00:56:49,956 --> 00:56:52,424
Mr. Ross, it was...
The big...

679
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:56,490
Superman's bad.

680
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,997
I'll say he was.

681
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,394
I mean, he was bad!

682
00:57:01,701 --> 00:57:02,759
No.

683
00:57:06,373 --> 00:57:07,738
Here, let me help.

684
00:57:07,941 --> 00:57:11,274
- The perfect plan. Foolproof!
- And we were the fools.

685
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:15,278
It's not my fault.
I did what I was supposed to do.

686
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:19,445
He ruined it.
That lousy do-gooder ruined it.

687
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:25,584
Now that he's pulled off this stunt,
he'll try and ruin my oil scheme too.

688
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,289
- I've got to get rid of him.
- How?

689
00:57:29,496 --> 00:57:31,555
Shoot him?
You know about him and bullets.

690
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:34,033
- Kryptonite.
- What?

691
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,769
Or krypton-ham, or krypton-heimer?

692
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:42,267
I forget what you call it,
but it's stuff that can hurt Superman.

693
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:45,308
- How do you know?
- I know a few things.

694
00:57:45,512 --> 00:57:47,036
I know,
from the graffiti I saw.

695
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:48,612
Wait a second.

696
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:49,975
She's right.

697
00:57:50,183 --> 00:57:53,380
I remember reading about it
in an interview with him.

698
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:54,814
Where is it from?

699
00:57:55,021 --> 00:57:57,285
The planet Superman came from:
Krypton.

700
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,923
Where is Krypton?

701
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,422
It's nowhere.

702
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:02,254
It blew up in space, years ago.

703
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:05,954
They sent Superman here from there
when he was just a baby.
