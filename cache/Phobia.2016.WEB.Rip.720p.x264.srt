1
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:51,528
2.. 5..7.. 10 minutes.. he continued to stare.

2
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,740
I ignored him at first but then I went to the table..

3
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,908
...and I said, any problem, sir?

4
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,869
I'm very sorry.

5
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,705
You look like someone I know, he replied

6
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,832
I was going to walk away..

7
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,709
...but he was a 70 year old man.

8
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,169
Horny uncle!

9
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,882
Anyway, so I had to ask him whom did I look like.

10
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,092
Any guesses on his reply?

11
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,635
His mother?

12
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,429
His daughter.

13
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,390
His 8th grade biology teacher.

14
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,225
Don't try to fit in your fantasy here.

15
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,062
She was so hot, Mrs. Matthews.. I promise. Oh my god!

16
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,191
He said I look like his dog.

17
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,529
What? I'm serious!

18
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,657
I'm serious. His dog was called Princess.

19
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,617
That's a terrible name.

20
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,327
Forget the name, listen to the story.

21
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,205
I said, you made fun of me, uncle. Can I go home now?

22
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,583
He said, please listen to me.

23
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,129
Princess died in a car accident in 1985.

24
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,175
She freed herself and ran into an oncoming car.

25
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,637
The car ran over her and by the time he reached there, she was dead.

26
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,764
She was dead. Her throat was crushed.

27
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,600
This happened on 17th June, 1985.

28
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,185
- You're joking.
- No.

29
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,104
That's my birthdate.

30
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,647
- No..
- Yeah!

31
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,401
And it gets stranger because I have a birth mark on my neck.

32
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,527
Lying!

33
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,029
I have a birth mark on my neck.

34
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:17,948
See!

35
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,288
Very funny.

36
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,333
Shaan.. I'm sorry.

37
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,753
Shaan.. Shaan!

38
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,428
Gulp it down, you'll feel better.

39
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,351
What happened?

40
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,480
Half of the critics hadn't Even arrived, you should've waited.

41
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,316
I don't know why but I suddenly felt so weird.

42
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:38,028
I saw something that wasn't actually there, but it felt so real.

43
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,071
I don't understand what you are saying, Mehak

44
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,573
I don't know.

45
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,409
- You're okay now, right?
- Yes.

46
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,037
Because everyone really liked your work.

47
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,538
- You think?
- Yes.

48
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,793
Stop, pull over.

49
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,965
Come up.

50
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,425
Why?

51
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,137
We'll have a drink, listen to some music.

52
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,680
You know..

53
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,849
Just because it happened once after getting drunk..

54
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,643
...doesn't mean it's gonna happen every time.

55
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,237
You know what, I don't know about your past life..

56
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,533
But in this life you definitely are.. a princess

57
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,661
Bye-bye.

58
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,789
- Bye!
- Goodnight.

59
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,790
Goodnight.

60
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,573
Hello.. madam?

61
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,544
Oh my God!

62
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,880
- Ma'am, are you ok?
- Ma'am, are you ok?

63
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,799
- Get some water!
- What happened?

64
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,676
- She's bleeding!
- Get some water.

65
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,344
- What happened?
- Have you found any ID?

66
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,276
Mehak, open your mouth. Show your tongue.

67
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,821
Hold my hand. You're in a hospital, I'm a doctor. Just relax.

68
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,949
Show your tongue. Calm down. You're in hospital. Open your eyes.

69
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,536
Open your eyes.

70
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,322
C'mon, Mehak. The doctor has been waiting for long.

71
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,459
I was six and you were around three years old.

72
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,795
Do you remember the terrace on our Jammu home?

73
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,923
I was spinning you around in circles..

74
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,133
...when you suddenly slipped out of my hand.

75
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,260
You fell to the ground floor.

76
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,430
Do you remember that song that dad sang to calm you down..

77
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,418
Relax, Mehak. You can't step out right..

78
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,880
...that's why I've brought the outside world to you here.

79
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,133
Oh my god!

80
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,345
This is virtual therapy.

81
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:42,100
For people like you. Go on, walk ahead.

82
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,691
Very good, Mehak.

83
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,068
Do you like shopping?

84
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,613
Anusha told me that you always did the grocery shopping.

85
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,783
C'mon, Mehak, keep going.

86
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,956
That's good, Mehak. So what do you feel like buying today?

87
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,875
Buy me a chocolate, aunty.

88
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,793
Yes, pick up a chocolate for Joey.

89
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,171
- You can do it, Mehak.
- The biscuit ones.

90
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,632
Biscuit chocolate, c'mon Mehak.

91
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,343
Where's the chocolate?

92
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,137
There are people there.

93
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,180
- Please.. please..
- No, no.

94
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,267
Please don't touch it. Mehak. Please don't touch it.

95
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,685
Keep going.

96
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,938
You're almost there, Mehak. Relax.

97
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,358
Look for the chocolate.

98
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,195
You can do it, Mehak.

99
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,158
Be brave. Very good.

100
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,623
- She hit me.
- Who hit you?

101
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,833
- Relax.. relax..
- She hit me! She hit me!

102
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,085
Relax. Mehak! Mehak!

103
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,463
- Mummy!
- She hit me!

104
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,756
- Calm down.
- Mummy!

105
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,966
- Relax, relax.
- Don't touch me!

106
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,385
Mehak!

107
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,807
- What happened to aunty?
- Nothing.

108
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,853
Go, get your drawing book.

109
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,862
I'm sorry, Anusha. Mehak suffers from Agoraphobia.

110
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,492
She has a deep-seated fear of the outside world.

111
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,578
She's not being difficult, she's just unwell.

112
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,791
If not treated, Mehak can become completely unstable.

113
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,795
She is certain that if she steps out of the house..

114
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,713
She will be made to experience the same horror she went through that
night.

115
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,216
But that taxi driver is in prison.

116
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,134
Mehak knows that very well.

117
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,469
He can't do anything now.

118
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,097
What happened that night? It's not like she was raped!

119
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:55,817
I understand, Anusha. If you want, you can admit her to the clinic.

120
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,778
- There is a good clinic in Byculla..
- Just a second, doctor.

121
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,824
There's no need to put Mehak in an institution. And please, she's
not crazy.

122
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,416
Take it.

123
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,919
Thanks.

124
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,558
I don't want to talk, I just need some time.

125
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,811
Do you know how long its been since you stepped out of this house?

126
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,354
- Two weeks.
- Two?

127
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,357
- Four.
- Yes, four weeks.

128
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,151
Not four weeks, but four months.

129
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,112
That's true.

130
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,908
What crap!

131
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,495
Mehak, I have other responsibilities as well.

132
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,747
Did you see Joey today?

133
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,832
He gets so frightened seeing you that he can't sleep at night.

134
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,293
Then why do you call that therapist home?

135
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,337
What have I done? It's always my fault!

136
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,716
He is a five year old kid, don't you feel he deserves some normalcy?

137
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,927
Are you blaming me for that?

138
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,639
- If he wants normalcy, take him to his father.
- Mehak.

139
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,642
Her kid gets screwed up, is it my responsibility?

140
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,436
Mehak, it's not necessary to involve him.

141
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,646
And I'm just talking about Joey, let's just stay there.

142
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,149
- What happened last week? Tell him.
- Get lost seriously.

143
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,359
Joey returns from school and rings the doorbell.

144
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,862
But he isn't able to get into the house. Why?

145
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,655
- I wanna know that.
- How many times will she say that!

146
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,782
- Exactly!
- She's said it thrice already!

147
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,534
I'll say it again and again, the kid stood on the street for four
hours.

148
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,161
Why couldn't he get into the house?

149
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,748
Because you couldn't go upto the door and let him in.

150
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:34,791
- Yes.
- Yes, so?

151
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,919
- I said I'm sorry.
- What if something had happened to the kid?

152
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,673
- I'm sorry.
- What do I do?

153
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,802
What do I do? Quit my job?

154
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:50,515
Shall I shop for normalcy from that virtual supermarket for you?

155
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,516
What do you want?

156
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,935
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

157
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,520
You want to send me to an institution!

158
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,646
- I don't want to send you to an institution..
- Shut up!

159
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,356
I heard you.

160
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,649
- What did you hear?
- Mehak.

161
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,692
I'm feeling dizzy.

162
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,321
Ok.. calm down.. sit down.

163
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,781
Sit down.

164
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,866
Look, Mehak.

165
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,661
You can't throw me out of my own house.

166
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,288
- This house belongs to me too.
- Of course, Mehak.

167
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,706
It'll always be your house.

168
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,042
I'm just telling you that..

169
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,169
Mehak?

170
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,261
Anusha, be strong. We need to do this.

171
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,847
I don't know if we're doing the right thing.

172
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,266
Anu, I'm taking responsibility.

173
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,771
Trust me, she'll become fine in a new place. Away from you guys.

174
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,575
Jiya?

175
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,334
Jiya?

176
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,963
Jiya!

177
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,801
Oh!

178
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,596
Hi, ma'am - Go!

179
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,973
- Who are you?
- I didn't do anything.

180
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,685
Mehak.. please.. calm down.

181
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,437
Relax.

182
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,481
- It's me.
- Where were you?

183
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,321
I can't.. I can't move.

184
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,697
You got scared.

185
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,116
Who are you? How did you get in?

186
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,284
The door was open.

187
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,121
I'm Manu. Manu Malhotra, your next-door neighbour.

188
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,206
I stay in 602.

189
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,541
I'm so sorry if I frightened you.

190
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,877
- I thought that Jiya was back.
- Jiya?

191
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,879
Jiya is my friend.

192
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,173
- Manu, actually we've just moved in. Let us settle down first.
- Of course.

193
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,674
- If you need anything.
- Sure.

194
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,426
- Please don't hesitate, I'm just a doorbell away.
- Thank you.

195
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,677
- Shall I make tea for you?
- No.

196
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,221
Water..

197
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,931
- I'll give it, thank you.
- I want water.

198
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,059
- How about coffee..
- No, Thanks, Manu.

199
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,439
- He's laughing.
- I didn't arrange the welcome party.

200
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,690
Where's the house?

201
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,358
This is going to be your house for sometime now.

202
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,484
100 years later?

203
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,573
You are very young.

204
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:15,659
This is my friend's house, it's been lying vacant.

205
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,787
We can stay here as long as we want.

206
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,499
- We?
- You, of course. C'mon, get up now.

207
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,794
- Come.
- Get up. Do this, do that.

208
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,796
I've asked Anu for some time..

209
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,881
...because there's no point sending you to a clinic.

210
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,176
Being independent again will help you face this problem. Really.

211
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:35,930
Will you give it a try?

212
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,357
Best keep this one closed.

213
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,909
The bedroom has such a nice view.

214
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,079
- Shaan, please close it.
- No, you need vitamin D.

215
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,875
Who does this belong to?

216
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,463
The house belongs to my friend but he had rented it out to a girl
named Jiya.

217
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,257
Some of her clothes and stuff might be lying around.

218
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,633
Throw away whatever you don't need.

219
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,219
- What if she comes back for it?
- She won't.

220
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
What?

221
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,598
She didn't pay the rent, didn't come to collect her deposit.

222
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,392
Maybe she skipped town.

223
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,280
Sorry, chips.

224
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,659
Shall we clean up the place?

225
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,537
I'll do it. Don't you have to go to work?

226
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,873
I thought I'll take my Diwali leave from today itself.

227
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,041
No need, Shaan.

228
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,335
I'll take some time out of my busy schedule.

229
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,756
- How much is the rent?
- Don't worry about that.

230
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,678
Get well soon, start painting and you can pay me back, ok?

231
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,722
What did you and Anusha put in my coffee?

232
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,183
You thought I'll not come to know.

233
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,518
Would you've agreed if I had asked directly?

234
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,357
If my motor skills don't come back. I'm not talking to you again.

235
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,027
You should go now.

236
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,279
Don't forget your medicines.

237
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,927
"This girl is going to drive me crazy"

238
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,421
Hello?

239
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,186
Don't need

240
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:27,878
Don't need.

241
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,869
- Hi, it's me. Open up.
- Wait a second!

242
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,833
- I'm opening, but count to ten before you step in. Ok?
- Yeah, ok.

243
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,334
- Huh?
- Yeah!

244
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,335
Ok.

245
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,634
Shall I come in?

246
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,070
What are you doing?

247
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,655
Nothing.

248
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,832
Hey, dance with me, c'mon.

249
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,167
- C'mon.
- No, thanks.

250
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,168
C'mon!

251
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,546
- What are you doing? Let me eat.
- C'mon, play along.

252
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,342
Ok, fine. I'll watch you dance. Shaan's got talent - M, c'mon!

253
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,224
It's ok.. it's ok.

254
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,184
It's ok.

255
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:35,876
Chemist, grocer, milkman, I'm leaving all their cards here.

256
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,545
- I'll find you a maid.
- I don't need a maid.

257
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,964
Ok, no maid.

258
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,469
Anyway, why would you need a maid, when..

259
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,346
I'm there.

260
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,185
I'm 100% going to get well

261
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,645
Of course, what goes down must come up.

262
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,522
It's a law of physics.
- you got it all wrong

263
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,648
No, I'm telling the truth.

264
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,110
Many famous entertainers, actors,

265
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,529
...philosophers suffered from agoraphobia.

266
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,865
Barbara Streisand, singer.

267
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,368
Kim Basinger, actress. Even Freud..

268
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,578
Not one of them is Indian?

269
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,207
- What can I do if you've a phobia of white people!
- You're still doing this.

270
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,292
I have a phobia of capsicum, what can I do!

271
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,339
Have you heard of Paula Dean? Even she had a problem stepping out of
her home.

272
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,716
She started cooking from home and is now famous..

273
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,134
...for cooking on TV.

274
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,844
And I've brought all your things.

275
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,096
Sit at home and paint.

276
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,264
I'm trying but I'm not being able to paint.

277
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,349
You've to be more positive.

278
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,809
It's a mental block, it'll go away.

279
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,519
- Just try harder.
- Why don't you try that?

280
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,196
Happy? And you have so many offers.

281
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,948
Just think about it.

282
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,086
Did you check my mails?

283
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,923
- No, the page was open so I Just happened glance through.
- What the hell!

284
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,801
- Mehak, please relax.
- Don't ask me to relax because I don't like that.

285
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,344
If I look through your personal things..

286
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,846
...how'd you like it?
- Mehak, what are you doing?

287
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:11,680
Where are you going?

288
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,973
Nowhere. I thought I'll stay the night.

289
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,224
...it's a new place, that's all.

290
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,145
What did you think?

291
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,188
What exactly did you think?

292
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,358
Mehak is crazy..

293
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,944
Dance with her, feed her, give her some attention and then this!

294
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,404
Where will she run away to?

295
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,239
- She can't even step out of the house. Get out of my house!
- Mehak!

296
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,449
- Relax, you're just losing it..
- You ask me to relax one more time..

297
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,618
...and I'll cut your tongue out!
- Mehak, there are three rooms in this house.

298
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,203
You can sleep there and I can sleep here.

299
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,788
Do I have to tell you this, you retard!

300
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,874
Control that crazy mind of yours.

301
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,376
I'm just sick of this.

302
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,216
Who is that for?

303
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,719
Who are the condoms for?

304
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,720
You don't know her.

305
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:55,974
Don't come back here again.

306
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,518
This isn't your house, Don't forget that.

307
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,243
Thanks.

308
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,704
Because I'm leaving?

309
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,208
I'm sorry.

310
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,301
If you feel bad, I can stop seeing her.

311
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,178
It's not serious.

312
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,558
- Hmm..Can you throw the garbage on your way out?
- What?!

313
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,395
No, Mehak. I won't dispose your garbage, That's the least you can do
for yourself.

314
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,521
You don't want to help me?

315
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,898
- That's what I'm doing.
- Get lost!

316
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,488
Disposing the garbage is no big deal.

317
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,741
First he says it's my house and then he says it isn't!

318
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,166
You are so swee..

319
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,459
Who are you?

320
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,253
Hormoz!

321
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,295
Send him out.

322
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:09,088
Who?

323
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:12,801
How many times have I told you not let hormoz hide in your place!

324
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,843
There's nobody here.

325
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,972
- Hormoz!
- Oh god!

326
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,099
There's nobody here.

327
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,311
You've come back?

328
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,147
He'll kill you this time.

329
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,958
Is hormoz in there?

330
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,294
Do you have a fan at home?

331
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:49,838
Yes, I do.

332
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,966
Then did you check on top of it? He must be sitting on it and moving
in circles.

333
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,718
Are you teasing me?

334
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,722
- You think this is a joke?
- No, I think it's really late, babe.

335
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,738
Three times one equals three.

336
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:04,866
Three times two equals six.

337
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,161
Three times three equals nine.

338
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:12,040
Three times four equals twelve.

339
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,792
Three times five equals fifteen.

340
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,129
Three times six equals eighteen.

341
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,758
Three times seven equals twenty-one.

342
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,178
Three times eight equals twenty-four.

343
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:30,058
Three times nine equals twenty-seven.

344
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:44,113
Oh no! Oh god! I'm so sorry.

345
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,657
Sorry!

346
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,201
Sorry!

347
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,662
Sorry!

348
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,875
I'm just.. a little..

349
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,593
You're welcome.

350
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,805
Thank you.

351
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,808
Anu, pick up.

352
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,727
Just because I didn't answer your call, you are not answering mine?

353
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:20,233
But you know what? I just went out and disposed of the garbage
myself.

354
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,193
Please call me.

355
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,279
Bye.

356
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,864
Captain Nichani is just horrible.

357
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,659
Each time I ask him what the temperature outside is..

358
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:33,121
...before landing he looks at my boobs and says, 36.

359
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,041
If Manu finds out about this, he'll flip out and kill me.

360
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,231
- Hey M!
- There's a cat in my bedroom.

361
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,026
- And where are you?
- In the bedroom.

362
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,654
I'm not sure whether it's actually there or not.

363
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,573
What do you mean?

364
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,243
Shaan, there's something wrong with the house. I'm seeing things.

365
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,831
Mehak, make some noise. If the cat isn't deaf, it'll run away.

366
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,750
What if it doesn't?

367
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,793
Then I'll come running to you.

368
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,588
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

369
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,964
- Of course, you are.
- Ok.

370
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,597
Hey, it ran! It was really a cat!

371
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,809
Kitty?

372
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,188
Kitty!

373
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,859
Go.. go!

374
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,029
Hey, go!

375
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,785
Go, kitty!

376
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,675
Hi.

377
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,219
Are you ok?

378
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,515
I'm ok.

379
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,600
Are you sure?

380
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,311
- Are you fine?
- What?

381
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,855
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

382
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,191
Do you need some help?

383
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,240
I can call the..

384
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,491
No, it's fine.

385
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,963
Are you alright? You just fell down.

386
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,631
Come inside and sit.

387
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,801
No, I'm waiting for my dad.

388
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,637
I forgot the house keys and he's at work.

389
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,889
I'm fine outside.

390
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,807
No, no, you can come inside and sit.

391
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,852
I'm Nikki, by the way.

392
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,856
Namaste, my name is Nikki.

393
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,609
- Mehak.
- Hi Mehak.

394
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,861
Are you sure you're fine?

395
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,031
There's someone in my room.

396
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,160
Someone you know, right?

397
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,123
Someone whom you know?

398
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,250
No, actually it's a cat.

399
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,294
Cat?

400
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,214
You are so frightened by a cat?

401
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:15,051
I'm very scared of cats, please come. Please..

402
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,052
Of course.

403
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,558
Black cat with yellow eyes, isn't it?

404
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,937
Must be Gul aunty's cat. She wanders about the building.

405
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,522
Comes in through the window.

406
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,107
Give me a spoon and plate.

407
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,108
What?

408
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,819
The hunters in the jungles..

409
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,614
...make noise to lure the tigers out, so they can shoot them.

410
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,867
I hate hunters, but I love tigers.

411
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,371
Ready?

412
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,140
- Why did you scream?
- Why did you scream?

413
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,184
Because you screamed.

414
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,353
There's a spider inside.

415
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,461
There's nobody in the bathroom.

416
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,089
Nobody?

417
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,216
There's nobody in the cupboard either.

418
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,263
But, there's a spider under the bed. Eww..

419
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,851
What happened? You look like as if you saw a ghost!

420
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,235
I'm glad to have met you.

421
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,071
Actually, I don't have too many friends and everyone calls me a
freak.

422
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,781
But you're a step ahead of me.

423
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,201
- I have agoraphobia.
- Agoraphobia?

424
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,494
How exotic!

425
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,788
- Can you please get the ice?
- Yes.

426
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,131
So basically, you can never visit the Taj Mahal, right?

427
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,843
Forget the Taj Mahal, I can't even visit the Gateway of India.

428
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,599
You've come to the right place.

429
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,393
This building is filled with crazy people.

430
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:34,315
Manu, always keeps smiling. The creepiest smile ever.

431
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:37,818
Gul aunty keeps looking for her husband Hormaz all day.

432
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,945
She has a husband?

433
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,571
I've never seen him.

434
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,199
Who knows whether he actually Exists..

435
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,910
And now you, welcome.

436
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,704
This 'Taj Mahal' phobia of yours..

437
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,123
Did you always have it or..

438
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,169
I'm an artist, I used to paint.

439
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,838
- Are you serious?
- Jiya used to live here, right?

440
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,966
- Yes.
- You knew her as well?

441
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,550
Of course.

442
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,219
She was so weird.

443
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,263
Very weird. She and Manu were a couple.

444
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,348
This Manu?

445
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,933
Romeo and Juliet style..

446
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:12,853
The noises from their house Sounded more like Cain and abel.

447
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,607
Screaming, shouting all the time.

448
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,234
I heard that she disappeared.

449
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,736
I heard that she Disappeared all of a sudden.

450
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,946
That Manu is..

451
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,573
One minute, sorry.

452
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,325
- Where are you?
- Dad?

453
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,828
I'm in the neighbour's house.

454
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,913
I'm coming, bye.

455
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,832
- I'm so sorry; I've got to go.
- What happened?

456
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,334
That Manu is a weirdo. Nice meeting you.

457
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,837
I'll see you soon. I'll catch up with you later.

458
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,040
Excuse me.

459
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,047
Oh shit!

460
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,634
Hello? Did you get hurt?

461
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,931
Ma'am! I'm terribly sorry.

462
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,726
Are you hurt? I'm coming.

463
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,811
No, I'm fine. I'm ok.

464
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,646
Thank god.

465
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,940
Should I come over and repair your wall?

466
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,816
It'll only take a few minutes.

467
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,234
No, not required.

468
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,862
These buildings look good from outside.

469
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,864
But they are completely rotten from inside.

470
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,658
- Are you alright, ma'am?
- I'm fine, ok.

471
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,786
Sometimes I am afraid of Manu.

472
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,330
Today again he hit me.

473
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,958
He threw a ketch-up bottle at me.

474
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,961
The mirror behind me shattered.

475
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:45,214
7 years of bad luck. But I was so turned on.

476
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,590
He wants babies.

477
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,093
But I don't want to.. Want it.

478
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,804
When I refused..

479
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,891
...he held my hand so hard that the marks never left.

480
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,643
His grip is like iron.

481
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,230
We're engaged.

482
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,066
He made me wear his grandpa's old ring..

483
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,818
...and said, 'Chotu, we were engaged'.

484
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,319
Ring my foot!

485
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,532
I'm in love with a crazy man, but I'm the bigger idiot.

486
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,535
I need to leave but he won't let me. Help me God.

487
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,246
M!

488
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,058
Hey, Princess. It's me.

489
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,570
M, the food is getting cold. Come.

490
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,793
M!

491
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,633
Do you know which Indian celebrity is Agoraphobic?

492
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,428
I'm coming in.

493
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,264
Mehak!

494
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,731
Mehak, are you inside?

495
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,945
M!

496
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,544
M?

497
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:36,547
M, are you ok?

498
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,715
Mehak!

499
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:44,972
M!

500
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,421
M?

501
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:53,165
Now whatever you see will be recorded here.

502
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,375
You still don't believe me?

503
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,086
What proof do you have that Jiya is dead?

504
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,797
For all you know, she is out there, dancing in some night club as we
speak.

505
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,424
- Living her life.
- Rubbish.

506
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,469
She used to live here earlier, And Now she doesn't.

507
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,179
That's it, you had a panic attack.

508
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,765
No, she's dead.

509
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:13,477
- What did you see?
- Shaan, I told you.

510
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,273
She was lying there in a pool of blood.

511
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,109
Someone had attacked her.

512
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,781
Nikki, go and open the door.

513
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:35,082
- Hi, is Mehak there?
- Yes, Nikki.

514
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,083
Mehak!

515
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,002
Hi, happy Diwali. I'm Nikki.

516
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,671
How did you like my knocks?

517
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,214
Three knocks means it's me.

518
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,299
Because you panic on hearing the doorbell.

519
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,010
And what's with all the cameras?

520
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,720
So much for a cat?

521
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,473
No, the other thing..

522
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,225
Ghost?

523
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:56,061
Hey, hello.. no ghosts here, these cameras are for security
purposes.

524
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,980
Anyway, we were talking about something important..

525
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,356
...so you can come back later.

526
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,859
I just thought you wanted company.

527
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,572
Come back later for some cold coffee..

528
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:07,781
...when he's not around.

529
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,700
Is she even old enough to drink coffee?

530
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,494
Excuse me, I'm in college. I'm studying Political science.

531
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:16,081
Wow, good for you. Don't you have homework to finish?

532
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,584
Ok, uncle.

533
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:22,629
I'll come back.

534
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,548
Namaste!

535
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,447
I want to go home.

536
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,366
It's just been two days, Mehak.

537
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,161
It's a new place. It takes time getting used to.

538
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:55,912
It's not about getting used to.

539
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,250
I am afraid of stepping out and now I'm afraid of staying in.

540
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,380
Where do I go?

541
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:07,966
Come here.

542
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:09,468
Come here.

543
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,190
Shaan.

544
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,985
Shaan!

545
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:47,858
Shaan!

546
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,616
Mehak. Mehak. - It's Shaan!

547
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:31,419
There's nobody, Mehak.

548
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,214
Only you and me.

549
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,142
Mehak, ghosts are not real.

550
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,021
Whatever you saw was just your imagination.

551
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:56,528
There's a conflict between reality and fantasy within you.

552
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,155
Please remember.

553
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:02,200
If you don't confront this fear..

554
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,327
...then it'll keep growing like this.

555
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,583
You'll have to face this phobia, Mehak.

556
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,086
We'll help you.

557
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,382
If you want, you can get out of this situation.

558
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,677
Don't you want to be free of this phobia?

559
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,685
Good.

560
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,188
Then..

561
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:35,525
You'll have to trust me.

562
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:38,528
- No..
- C'mon, Mehak.

563
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:51,666
Ok.

564
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,711
Where do you want to go shopping?

565
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,054
Mehak, you've done this before. Remember?

566
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,182
This is virtual reality.

567
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:10,185
Nobody will harm you, don't be afraid.

568
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:12,604
Keep walking.

569
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,651
If you like a shop, walk in.

570
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,364
Very good, Mehak.

571
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,912
Ok, go in.

572
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,083
Great.

573
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:39,673
Excellent.

574
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,677
No, no.. don't go there, Mehak. Turn back.

575
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,315
Anu..

576
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,651
Anu?

577
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,113
- Anu!
- Mehak!

578
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,199
C'mon, let's go home.

579
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,909
Anu is not in the mall.

580
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,452
What's going on, doc?

581
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,748
This is showing something else.

582
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,502
Mehak, where are you?

583
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,503
Anu..

584
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,439
Oh god!

585
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,902
- Get me out!
- M, it's not real, relax.

586
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,280
- Get me out!
- Mehak, don't panic. We're here.

587
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,952
Mehak, calm down.

588
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,330
Calm down, Mehak!

589
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,831
- Mehak!
- Get me out!

590
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,041
Get me out!

591
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,461
Mehak, what have you done!

592
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,629
Psycho!

593
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,175
C'mon, we've to take you to the hospital.

594
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,575
Mehak is not Getting any better, Shaan.

595
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,661
She has gone mad.

596
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,247
Admit her to a clinic.

597
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,457
Lock her up.

598
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,127
Lock her up.

599
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:24,838
Lock her up.

600
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,348
Hello, this is the Khurana's residence.

601
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,184
There's nobody at home right now, so please leave a message. Thank
you.

602
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,187
Hello, my name is Mehak.

603
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,440
I want to talk to you about Jiya.

604
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,443
So please call me back.

605
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,238
Actually..

606
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:18,284
I know what happened to her.

607
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:22,747
I live in the place where Jiya died.

608
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:27,961
So, I think she's trying to tell me something.

609
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,638
Call me urgently for Jiya's sake.

610
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:46,771
I'm sorry, Jiya.

611
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,653
I shouldn't have killed you.

612
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,532
Please forgive me Jiya..

613
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,151
Jiya was killed with this.

614
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,363
With this drawing?

615
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,323
No, Nikki, with the blade cutter.

616
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,951
Do you know who it belongs to?

617
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,163
Weird Manu?

618
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,666
Not weird, he has crossed the line.

619
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,878
Did Jiya tell you all of this?

620
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,215
She showed it to me.

621
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,385
So, you know something must have happened between her and Manu..

622
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:24,470
...and then Manu killed Jiya.

623
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:28,266
He's a bit psycho Romeo type.. but he's no murderer.

624
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,309
I'll prove it to you.

625
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,479
He still has the bladecutter. I saw it.

626
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,814
We'll give it to the cops.

627
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:38,484
Jiya's blood stains will surely be found in the forensic tests.

628
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,530
Nikki, you've to help me.

629
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,032
I've to prove myself that I'm not..

630
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,368
Genuinely cuckoo.

631
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:58,838
Go, home.

632
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,513
Mehak.

633
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,183
It's ok, I'll help you.

634
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,059
Tell me what to do.

635
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,857
Manu goes to the jogger's park every evening.

636
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,859
He's the president of sunset laughter club there.

637
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:20,860
How do you know?

638
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:22,612
My dad's a member.

639
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:27,325
Anyway, he leaves the spare house keys outside in the planter.

640
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:30,495
As soon as he leaves for the park, we'll go in and get the
bladecutter.

641
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,065
Where has he kept Jiya's body?

642
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:02,860
Buried her in the walls of the house?

643
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:04,946
He's an architect.

644
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,532
He'd surely know how to hide a body behind walls.

645
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,202
No wonder he's renovating the house by himself.

646
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,958
Your boyfriend hasn't come today?

647
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,627
Shaan isn't my boyfriend.

648
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,379
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

649
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,506
If you say so.

650
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,133
Isn't he a bit possessive?

651
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,343
He cares for me.

652
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,179
We're very good friends.

653
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:32,557
He's leaving.

654
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,656
I can't step out.

655
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,577
Ok, you watch the tv and call me if a problem arises.

656
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:53,744
Ok.

657
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,580
I don't have your number.

658
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:58,457
Oh, Catch this.

659
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,126
Ok.

660
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,128
Ok.

661
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,297
Throw me yours.

662
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,382
- I'll call myself.
- Ok.

663
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:07,383
Be careful.

664
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:16,309
My god, this place is a mess! Can you see it?

665
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,310
Yes.

666
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:22,148
He has broken the entire house down.

667
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:28,029
There's a really bad stench in here, Mehak..and I know it's not just
paint.

668
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,199
I swear if something jumps at me, you better..

669
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,659
Hey, what happened?

670
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,662
- I thought someone was standing behind me.
- Please.

671
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,456
But I'm ok now.

672
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,585
See this, the cement is still wet.

673
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,295
He could have buried her in the wall.

674
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,132
I'm going to the next room now.

675
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:52,595
And the Manu horror show continues.

676
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,477
Oh my god, he plays with a doll!

677
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,187
Does he play dollhouse games?

678
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,859
Mehak, meet Jiya.

679
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,111
Jiya, meet Mehak.

680
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,868
Nikki, he's here.

681
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:17,453
What?! Stall him.

682
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,040
I don't know, do something.

683
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,299
Oh, he's inside, Nikki.

684
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:33,177
I couldn't help you, sorry.

685
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,804
If he catches me, I'm dead.

686
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:37,515
Nikki, hide under the bed, quickly!

687
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,407
Yuck!

688
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,744
I've officially seen everything.

689
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,055
Nikki!

690
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:21,225
Nikki.

691
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,936
Manu!

692
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,274
Manu!

693
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,110
Manu!

694
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,238
Malhotra!

695
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,241
Malhotra!

696
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,493
Hi. Happy Diwali.

697
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,330
Go inside.

698
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,750
Repair my wall.

699
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,462
Can I.. I'm a bit tied up, can I do it tomorrow?

700
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,422
No, no.. - no Tomorrow?

701
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:53,883
I've been waiting so long.. Malhotra..

702
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,678
Please repair the wall now.. It's just a 2 mm hole.

703
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,430
I'll fix it tomorrow, I'm a bit busy.

704
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,515
You told me you would do it, you promised..

705
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,268
Please fix the hole, it's causing me a lot of trouble.

706
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,604
Please fix it-I'll just get my toolkit.

707
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:09,064
No, no, not required.

708
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,402
It's not required, please.

709
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,447
Not required.. Malhotra!

710
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:17,948
Thank you.

711
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:19,742
Did the entire wall come down?

712
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:23,954
No, no. That.. I was having a problem..

713
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,289
I'm coming.

714
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:29,126
You go to the room, please, I'll come.

715
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:32,755
In the first place, it shouldn't have happened, you know. I'm an
architect.

716
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:37,384
I'm getting a bit late for my laughter club, but it's alright. Two
minutes.

717
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,305
- Are you coming?
- I'm coming.

718
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,433
- This room, right?
- Yes, that room.

719
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,185
I know the bedroom.

720
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:47,937
Come.

721
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:01,450
By the way, it's Diwali today, what are you doing in the evening?

722
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:05,579
Why don't you join us?

723
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,749
We'll burst some crackers in the building compound.

724
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,668
Everybody will be there, it'll be fun.

725
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:20,761
Why are you so stressed?

726
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,058
I used to be very stressed also.

727
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,770
But laughter therapy has helped me a lot.

728
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:32,731
Shall I teach you a technique?

729
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,359
It's called the Milkshake Technique.

730
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,780
Imagine two glasses in your hands..

731
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,088
Why don't you join me?

732
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:24,950
I had bought this for Jiya.

733
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,953
On our anniversary.

734
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:34,543
She was so beautiful.

735
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:39,673
Baby

736
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,149
Hello! Ma'am.

737
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,068
Open the door please.

738
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,115
Open the door!

739
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,743
Stop that!

740
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:09,954
Open the door!

741
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:12,414
I won't open it, I know what you did to Jiya.

742
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,167
- What did I do?
- I'm getting the police to get you arrested.

743
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:19,088
- What?
- Oh thank god!

744
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,175
Listen, we've to go.

745
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:24,301
What did you do?

746
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,886
- By god, I'm getting angry now.
- That's Malhotra, forget him.

747
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:27,763
- NIki is in there..
- Open the door.

748
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:30,599
- Mehak, open the door.
- You don't understand!

749
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,768
- Wait, Shaan. You can't take a risk.
- Open the door.

750
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,269
Mehak, you can't do this.

751
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,271
- M..
- You don't know..

752
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:39,400
Stop, please. Ok?

753
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,151
Dead!

754
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:43,195
We're dead!

755
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:45,864
I'm so sorry, Manu.

756
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,284
Hold him!

757
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,619
Why did you lock me in?

758
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,247
Why did you lock me in?

759
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,665
You know Jiya?

760
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,583
I know what you did to Jiya!

761
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:57,543
- What did I do?
- You tell me.

762
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:58,877
You tell me what did I do!

763
01:19:58,877 --> 01:19:59,878
No, You tell me first!

764
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,255
What's wrong with her?

765
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:03,841
- Where's Nikki?
- What are you saying?

766
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:05,217
What were you saying about Jiya?

767
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,177
- Where's Nikki?
- Don't change the topic.

768
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:08,470
What were you saying about Jiya?

769
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,972
But where's Nikki?

770
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,181
She needs help.

771
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:12,558
He's a murder.

772
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:14,393
M, for god's sake! Manu, she doesn't mean it.

773
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:15,394
- You..
- Why?

774
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:16,687
- I'm telling you all.
- Stop it!

775
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:18,772
Manu, you gotta go.

776
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:20,482
Manu, you gotta go home.

777
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:23,027
She's confused, she thinks you're someone else.

778
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,653
Please go home, I'll come and explain later.

779
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:25,654
Manu, you gotta go.

780
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,448
Manu, just go.

781
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,492
Don't let him go.

782
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:33,495
I'll come back later for my toolkit.

783
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:49,803
Mehak.

784
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:55,184
If something happens, it's your responsibility.

785
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:13,410
What the hell happened! Where were you?

786
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,037
Relax, mom!

787
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,581
There was a whole nest of spiders under Manu's bed.

788
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:18,874
So I panicked.

789
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:21,251
And you should charge your phone.

790
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,962
Anyway, look what I found.

791
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,299
Unbelievable!

792
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:28,967
Wow!

793
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,220
Even I have this.

794
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,472
Does that make me a murderer too?

795
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:34,389
Maybe.

796
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:38,143
Mehak, I told you to please tell this girl to leave.

797
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,354
Listen, Mehak can have friends other than you as well.

798
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,396
Stop getting so J.

799
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,315
Do you want to put this girl in trouble again?

800
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,026
If you suffer a panic attack, what will she do?

801
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:48,403
Listen, you don't need to worry about me.

802
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,364
- I can take care of myself. I'm a black belt.
- Right.

803
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,199
And Mehak can never harm me.

804
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:54,743
What if Malhotra files a police complaint against you?

805
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,036
You broke into his house.

806
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,205
He won't do that, he's guilty.

807
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:00,833
Oh Mehak, please! This is madness.

808
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,876
Why aren't you helping us?

809
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,964
Now Jiya will help us out.

810
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:08,590
What?!

811
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:13,554
Ok, it's written here that to get in touch with the dead.

812
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:18,267
To make contact, you've to be in the same place where she died.

813
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:19,810
Check.

814
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,312
And it's written that you need..

815
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,565
...to be in possession of something that belonged to her.

816
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,109
We have Jiya's clothes. Check.

817
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,821
Why are we doing this in the bathroom?

818
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:34,616
- Mehak said that Jiya died in here.
- Right.

819
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:37,953
Mehak..

820
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:40,664
No Nikki, that's Jiya. Can't you tell?

821
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:45,586
Sorry.

822
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:01,351
Jiya, we come in peace. We mean no harm.

823
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:05,355
We're here to listen and help you move on.

824
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:10,027
Jiya, we come in peace. We mean no harm.

825
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,530
Please talk to us.

826
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:19,411
Maybe Jiya isn't in a mood to talk.

827
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,623
That's because your energy is very negative.

828
01:23:22,623 --> 01:23:23,874
Sure, its always my fault..

829
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:25,667
Please keep quiet.

830
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,212
We'll try again.

831
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:34,134
Jiya, please talk to me.

832
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,804
What happened to you in this house?

833
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,767
We're here to help you. Please talk to us

834
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:45,103
Where are you..

835
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:29,648
What the hell!

836
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:34,528
- Jiya tell us who killed you?
- What nonsense! Who are you people?

837
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:37,531
What's all this? Have you all gone mad?

838
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:38,615
You're alive?

839
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,033
Of course, I'm alive.

840
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:42,411
- You're supposed to be dead.
- What?!

841
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:45,289
Why is she wearing my uniform?

842
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:49,459
- And you have my ring.
- Sorry.. I'm Shaan, I can explain.

843
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,545
Please explain, Shaan.

844
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,966
Actually, I can't explain but..

845
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,092
What?

846
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:01,471
Did you call up my parents?

847
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:04,224
Huh! Are you mad?

848
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:08,186
Do you know how troubled my parents were after hearing your message?

849
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,897
Who does such a thing!

850
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:14,067
'I know who killed your daughter.' Manu made you say that?

851
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,902
No, We thought Manu murdered you.

852
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,156
- I've overheard your fights..
- Shut up, you nosey rat! I'm gonna kill Manu!

853
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,929
- Jiya, you're back!
- Get off me! Stay away from me, you sicko!

854
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,556
Don't you understand it's over?

855
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,641
I don't want your grandma's rotten ring!

856
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,852
- Stay away or I'll call the cops.
- Jiya..

857
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:50,687
- Jiya, it's for you.
- I don't want it.

858
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,230
What did you tell them about us?

859
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:53,774
Don't listen to them.

860
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:55,650
They're all mental. I love you.

861
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,651
- No, you don't.
- Please come back.

862
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:57,861
You hit me. - I'm sorry.

863
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,571
- Please calm down.
- No, I won't.

864
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,656
Sorry, I shouldn't have hit you.

865
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,158
Too late for-sorry now.

866
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,911
You know, I've done an advanced course in laughter therapy.

867
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:08,497
Shut up!

868
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:10,916
- I don't get angry anymore, see.
- Shut up!

869
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:15,462
What do you want? You want to continue flying?

870
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:18,256
No problem. You don't want to marry me? No problem.

871
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,175
You don't want kids? No problem.

872
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,344
You want to work with other guys?

873
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:24,888
No problem.

874
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,932
You don't want this ring now? Ok.

875
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,810
I'll put it in my pocket. I'll try later.

876
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:33,146
I love you, baby. Just come back.

877
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,357
Get off! What are you doing?

878
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:37,442
Please.. please, I'm sorry.

879
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:39,945
I won't be stupid again. Come back, please.

880
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,780
I hate you.

881
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:42,781
I know.

882
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:52,332
- If you laugh again, I'll slap you.
- I won't laugh.

883
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:07,055
I have seen her in the bathroom, Shaan.

884
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:09,349
In the bedroom.

885
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:11,852
All over the house.

886
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:14,187
But she's alive.

887
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,816
Why don't you say something?

888
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:19,276
Mehak, I believe in you.

889
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,069
There's definitely something wrong with this house.

890
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,029
Maybe it wasn't runaway Jiya but..

891
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:25,490
...how do we now communicate with the real ghost?

892
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:29,035
- We don't even have their clothes.
- Go home, Nikki. That's enough!

893
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,164
Go home.

894
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:35,667
And thank you for everything.

895
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:36,918
Hey, what thank you?

896
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,087
Say that when we catch the ghost.

897
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:40,422
Happy Diwali.

898
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,558
Are you going to send me to mental hospital now?

899
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,186
What?!

900
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,313
No, M, never.

901
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:05,822
I've never seen a more stronger girl than you all my life.

902
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:11,244
You will be fine, I promise, just don't give up.

903
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:20,504
Reality or imagination..

904
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:24,674
Right or wrong, I can't tell difference.

905
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:28,345
I'm crazy.

906
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:31,973
- Please go.
- I'm not going anywhere, Mehak.

907
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,226
I love you.

908
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:36,853
I've always loved you.

909
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:44,778
I'm so sorry.

910
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,110
I hate your hands.

911
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:30,532
Your touch disgusts me.

912
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,744
Your hands are dirty..

913
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:43,962
...ugly

914
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:53,221
You've lost your mind.

915
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,641
Not me.

916
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:01,563
You need treatment, not me.

917
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,110
Scoundrel..

918
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:10,864
- How dare you stare at me!
- M?

919
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:17,245
Who gave you the right to touch me?

920
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,957
It's you who stinks

921
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:33,928
Because you're rotten.

922
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:39,142
I'm not wrong, you are.

923
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,062
Wicked.

924
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:46,483
Evil. Filthy.

925
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,238
Sick.

926
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:55,909
Why did you do it?

927
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:57,869
- What did you gain?
- Will you stop it?

928
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,955
- Do you know whom you're talking to?
- I'm talking to you, Shaan.

929
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:03,917
You just don't understand me!

930
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:09,172
You tell me to be brave.

931
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,217
Go out. Go where?

932
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:17,263
You told me, I wasn't raped.

933
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:21,226
Should I have been raped?- Enough!

934
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:25,313
If you touch me again, I'll call the cops.

935
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,233
- Go ahead, call them over.
- You are Disgusting!

936
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:30,443
The more people see this drama, the better it will be

937
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:34,114
I took you as my friend and what did you do the moment you got a
chance!

938
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:36,032
How are you any different from him?

939
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:37,909
How dare you say that!

940
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,035
What about all the stress you've been..

941
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,245
...putting me through over the past three years?

942
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:42,288
We're friends today, lovers tomorrow, who knows what we are the day
after!

943
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,790
Make up your bloody mind!

944
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,960
I've done so much for you.

945
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,253
I'm going to call Anu.

946
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:50,171
I'm talking to you, you freak.

947
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,758
M.. M..

948
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:57,178
M, please.. that's enough!

949
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:17,615
Oh god!

950
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:19,951
M..

951
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,957
I'm sorry, M. Are you hurt? Let me check

952
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:28,084
- Stop it.
- Help!

953
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,169
Get away from me!

954
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:32,130
M..

955
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:33,423
Oh my god!

956
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,051
Oh my god!

957
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,307
Stay away from me!

958
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,851
I'm not mad, you'll kill me.

959
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,437
It wasn't Jiya, it was me. I was seeing myself. I won't let you kill
me.

960
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:48,646
What are you saying, Mehak?

961
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:50,648
Drop that blade, you'll hurt yourself.

962
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:52,275
I saw all of this!

963
01:32:56,446 --> 01:32:58,072
Drop the blade, M!

964
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:00,784
- No.
- M, drop the blade.

965
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,638
Look at me.

966
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:36,152
Look at me.

967
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:40,281
M, I'm going to take you to the hospital. Look at me.

968
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,284
M..

969
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,501
Let's..

970
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:53,753
The ice box..

971
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,466
I'll be right back..wait..

972
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:40,735
- Hi, Mehak was..
- Nikki, do you know what time it is?

973
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:43,529
- I know, sorry but I got a call from Mehak.
- She's sleeping.

974
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:46,449
I just thought it's something urgent.

975
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:49,077
It's alright, she's sleeping. I'm here, go home.

976
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,496
Just tell her..

977
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:53,164
What was that?

978
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,502
Maybe the cat entered.

979
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:01,255
Cat? Gul aunty's cat is back?

980
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,840
She keeps coming in through the window.

981
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,384
Yes, I have to go now..

982
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,389
Nikki, go home.

983
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:10,431
- What's that?
- Over here.

984
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:11,683
What? - On your...

985
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:12,850
It's nothing, Nikki. Go home.

986
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:15,687
- No, I have to meet Mehak.
- I'm telling you she's sleeping. Go home.

987
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,146
I don't believe you, Shaan.

988
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,147
What do you mean you don't believe me?

989
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:20,525
- She's sleeping, I can't wake her up.
- I'm not going.

990
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,068
- If she's sleeping, wake her up.
- Just relax.

991
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:23,319
- Nikki..
- I won't leave without meeting her.

992
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:25,113
Have you lost it? Don't you understand?

993
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,532
- Nikki, get out.
- Not without meeting..

994
01:36:29,075 --> 01:36:30,451
- Mehak!
- Nikki!

995
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,752
- What have you done?
- I haven't done anything, Nikki.

996
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,754
- She fell in the bathroom.
- Liar!

997
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,339
I swear, Nikki. I'm not lying.

998
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:45,049
It was an accident, I swear.

999
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,093
Mehak, I'm calling my dad.

1000
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,220
Everything will be fine.

1001
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:52,849
- Nikki, listen to me.
- No.

1002
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:54,559
- It was an accident, I swear.
- No.

1003
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:55,893
No! - Give me the phone.

1004
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:58,354
- Give me the phone! Let go!
- No!

1005
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:01,899
Leave it! Let me call the ambulance.

1006
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:11,034
Stop it!

1007
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:17,874
No, no.. Nikki.. Nikki!

1008
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:21,252
Nikki, wake up!

1009
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:23,755
Mehak, she's alive. We need to take her to the hospital.

1010
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:25,214
Mehak?

1011
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:27,759
Mehak?

1012
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:42,857
Mehak..

1013
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:35,743
Mehak! Hey!

1014
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:38,371
Mehak, open the door.

1015
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:40,832
Mehak, open the door.

1016
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:45,253
Mehak, open the door. What are you doing?!

1017
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:47,421
Why are you afraid of me, Mehak?

1018
01:38:49,465 --> 01:38:50,925
Why are you running away from me?

1019
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:54,137
Your fight is not with me, Mehak.

1020
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:56,389
It's with your self.

1021
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:00,476
I know you're standing outside, Mehak.

1022
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:06,566
I won't do anything now.

1023
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:10,236
I'm tired.

1024
01:39:12,155 --> 01:39:14,073
I'm so tired.

1025
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,633
You need to get to the hospital, princess.

1026
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:38,681
And your finger's in the freezer.

1027
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:57,241
Ma'am, I'm calling from B-603, Overlook Apartments.

1028
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:58,284
Malad East.

1029
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:01,913
I need an ambulance, it's a medical emergency.
