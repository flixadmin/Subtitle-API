1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,953
<i>- Previously on</i> Gotham...
- I saw a vision

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,679
<i>of a cataclysmic event.</i>

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,952
<i>We will create
a legacy in this city.</i>

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,353
I think you could be so strong.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,749
He sees it, too.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,317
Jeremiah escaped.
He's got Bruce.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,517
<i>I have bombs planted
around the city.</i>

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,593
<i>I know seeing is believing, and
I do want you to believe me,</i>

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
so...

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,336
<i>Now, the governor's
declared the city off-limits</i>

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,113
<i>until the situation
can be evaluated.</i>

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,320
- In two hours, this city's gonna be a battleground.
- Well, I'm not leaving.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,040
<i>Gotham is soon
to be each man for himself,</i>

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,515
<i>a more savage place.</i>

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,797
What should I do with you?

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,311
You took away
the one person I love,

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,956
so I took the one person
you love.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,790
Out of this
crucible of blood

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,395
will rise the dark knight
that your city needs.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,995
Gotham falls.
We rise.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,995
<i>♪ We'll meet again ♪</i>

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,956
<i>♪ Don't know where ♪</i>

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,232
<i>♪ Don't know when ♪</i>

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,031
<i>♪ But I know we'll meet again ♪</i>

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,231
<i>♪ Some sunny day. ♪</i>

26
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,833
Fire on my command!

27
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,270
For Gotham.

28
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,600
<i>Listen, Gordon.</i>

29
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,753
<i>Your people decided to ignore
evacuation orders...</i>

30
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,960
No, no, no, no, no.

31
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,520
It is clear you
don't understand.

32
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,478
<i>What's to understand,
Mr. Gordon?</i>

33
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,233
<i>I'm afraid you
are not making your...</i>

34
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,840
For the last time,

35
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,439
after the bridges blew
and the government

36
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,432
declared Gotham off-limits,

37
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,713
the city was up for grabs.

38
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,996
Given over to criminals
and murderers.

39
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,992
Now, territory is controlled
by whoever has

40
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,958
enough power to hold it.

41
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,513
I mean, we have Penguin
in City Hall, for God's sakes.

42
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,195
<i>He raided the armory
and stockpiled weapons,</i>

43
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,399
<i>then repurposed a factory
to manufacture ammunition.</i>

44
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,639
<i>It's made him unassailable.</i>

45
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,157
<i>Barbara and the Sirens control
an area around their club.</i>

46
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,955
<i>It's the only place in Gotham
not suffering for food,</i>

47
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
<i>or booze.</i>

48
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,190
<i>Barbara trades mainly
in information.</i>

49
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,799
Just be gone by midnight.

50
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,356
<i>It's women only, but men can
buy windows of time.</i>

51
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,200
It's two minutes past
pumpkin time, sweetheart.

52
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,589
- Wait.
<i>- Word is...</i>

53
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,311
<i>...she enforces her rule
with an iron hand.</i>

54
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,433
To the west is Jonathan Crane,

55
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
the Scarecrow.

56
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,990
Victor Fries is further north
and warring with Firefly.

57
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,160
And to date, there have been
no confirmed sightings

58
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,834
of Jeremiah Valeska.

59
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,510
Then there's us.

60
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,150
GCPD controls a ten-block area
around the precinct,

61
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,392
<i>where we feed and protect
150 civilians.</i>

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>That number could grow
as who knows how many others</i>

63
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,793
<i>are trapped around the city.</i>

64
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,496
<i>These are people
who couldn't get out</i>

65
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,920
<i>when the city was abandoned.</i>

66
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,231
<i>The poor, the sick,
whole families.</i>

67
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,840
<i>The government has a duty.</i>

68
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,876
You have a duty to help them.

69
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,076
<i>Mr. Gordon...</i>

70
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,669
Captain Gordon.

71
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,275
<i>We've been over this
time and time again.</i>

72
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,671
<i>No one is allowed in or out
of Gotham.</i>

73
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,639
People we are protecting
are not criminals.

74
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,880
<i>And anyone who stayed
after the evacuation order</i>

75
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,072
<i>is no longer
the government's responsibility.</i>

76
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,072
We are surrounded
by hostile forces.

77
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,118
We are running out of food,
ammunition.

78
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,431
There are children here.
You have to evacuate them.

79
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,320
<i>A committee is being formed</i>

80
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,756
<i>regarding the situation
in Gotham.</i>

81
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Committee.

82
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,629
At least let us
resupply ourselves.

83
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,317
<i>We understand the situation.</i>

84
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
You don't understand.

85
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,936
If you did,
you would do something.

86
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,235
Just say we're on our own.

87
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,277
Paralysis aside,
we need to operate

88
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,955
before her spine collapses
upon itself.

89
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,953
In truth, she should have
been evacuated.

90
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,976
Yeah, well, we tried
to get her out

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,593
the night that everything
went to hell.

92
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,993
And then they blew
the bloody bridges.

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,954
Can you operate here?

94
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,153
I don't think
we have a choice.

95
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Selina?

96
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,790
The doctor wants to operate.

97
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Fine.

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,870
Whatever.

99
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,109
I'm gonna be here
the whole time.

100
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,559
Enough!

101
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,596
You cops are getting fat

102
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,080
while the rest of us
are starving!

103
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,356
That's right.

104
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,040
While the rest of us
are starving!

105
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,880
You hungry? Yeah?

106
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,816
- The cops get more!
- I got something you can chew on.

107
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,035
Harvey, Harvey!
May I? May I?

108
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,318
Everyone. Sir?

109
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,552
Everyone gets the same share, police and civilians alike.

110
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,838
If we start handing out more,
the supplies will not last.

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,674
You're lying.
He's lying!

112
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
The cops get more.

113
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,519
- You shut up!
- That's enough!

114
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,231
You don't like the rules, leave.

115
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,239
I'm just saying...

116
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,675
Say it walking, putz.

117
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Come on!

118
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
You look well fed!

119
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Let's go.

120
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,896
Hey, come on, listen up.

121
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,879
Move it out of here.

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Move it.

123
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,316
So, how we doing?

124
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,199
Well, we got a month
of food left.

125
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,192
Less if refugees keep coming.

126
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,231
What'd the Department
of Douchebaggery say?

127
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
<i>Same as always.</i>

128
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Not sending any help.

129
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Not letting anyone leave.

130
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
- I had to try.
- I swear to God,

131
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,397
I am never paying taxes again.

132
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,909
And if people ask?

133
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Tell 'em sooner or later,

134
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,993
the government will do
the right thing.

135
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,320
Rebuild the bridges,
take back the city.

136
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,789
Just have to be patient.

137
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,270
And the truth?
We're on our own.

138
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,360
The truth is we have
no idea what might happen.

139
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,269
And our job is
to keep ourselves...

140
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,833
and everyone else alive.

141
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,401
<i>We're down to our last
rounds of ammo. What if...</i>

142
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,472
Penguin or someone else
decides to make a move?

143
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,313
We're sitting ducks here, man.

144
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
<i>Okay.</i>

145
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,520
Where was I?

146
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,030
Happened again.

147
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,193
This time, woke up on a rooftop.

148
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,960
Same thing.

149
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
No idea how I got there

150
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,240
or what happened
during the preceding hours.

151
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,240
Show yourself.

152
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,876
I know it's you
inside there, Ed.

153
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,234
Show yourself.

154
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,836
Idiot Ed still won't appear.

155
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,950
Coward.

156
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
But I know it's him controlling
me when I'm sleeping.

157
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Why?

158
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,598
What is he doing?

159
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,675
You know, you could get someone
else to turn on the spotlight.

160
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,879
I like doing it.

161
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,736
Because it reminds people
that even in darkness,

162
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
there is light.

163
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,434
And it reminds me.

164
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,639
We're low on supplies.

165
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,314
Government won't evac,
won't send in help.

166
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,354
It doesn't make sense.

167
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,075
I imagine, from where they sit,

168
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,630
it's pretty easy to ignore
people's suffering.

169
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,600
I gave Lucius permission to raid
the Wayne Enterprises R & D lab

170
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,233
for whatever he could scavenge.

171
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,736
He's working on night vision
goggles for your men.

172
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,638
- It's not much.
- Everything helps.

173
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,034
Bruce, we stayed because people
here still here need protection.

174
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,634
That hasn't changed.

175
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,920
I should go.

176
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,319
The doctor's worried Selina's
condition is getting worse.

177
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,720
They're going
to operate.

178
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,239
Let me know how it goes.

179
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,879
Are you sorry you stayed?

180
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
No.

181
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
You?

182
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,316
Hell no.

183
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,115
Mr. Cobblepot
offers a thousand rounds

184
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,034
of freshly minted
nine-millimeter stock

185
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,715
for a thousand pounds

186
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,149
of grade-A steak.

187
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,074
Hmm, so what we're hearing
is true.

188
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,751
Cupboard's a bit bare
in Penguinland?

189
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,274
Absolutely not.

190
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,430
Mr. Cobblepot just had
a hankering for red meat.

191
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,314
Ugh, please. Ozzie wants
to get fat on rib eye

192
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,916
while his minions starve.
Shocker.

193
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,349
I have a question.

194
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,958
Why hasn't your boss left his
citadel since the bridges blew?

195
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,952
He scared I'm gonna
stick him in the throat?

196
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
Tabby's still raw
from when Penguin

197
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,320
murdered Butch
right in front of her,

198
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,159
so it'll have to be
2,000 rounds.

199
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,232
Barbara, we're not giving
that bastard anything.

200
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,157
Exactly. We're trading
for something we need.

201
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,590
No.

202
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,239
Honey, no one is asking you

203
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,914
to forget what happened,

204
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,994
but how do we protect the women
who come in here every day

205
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,480
looking for safety?

206
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,434
We need this.

207
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,193
Penguin's time will come.

208
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,710
I promise.

209
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,355
He's gonna regret
giving me this.

210
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,232
Better make it 3,000 rounds.

211
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,354
Something's out there.

212
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,400
There. See? The shadow moved.

213
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,631
It's just a shadow, man.

214
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,395
No. Something's out there.

215
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,999
There. See?

216
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Hey, you okay?

217
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
You okay?

218
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,312
Would you like me
to make it stop?

219
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,799
Yes.

220
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,434
Open this door.

221
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,754
No, no, no!
Don't open the gate!

222
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,360
Split up. Take what we came for.

223
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,235
Kill whoever stands in your way.

224
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,077
Show these fools
the face of fear.

225
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,794
These here are
the weak points.

226
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,920
Reinforce all barriers
that front Penguin's territory.

227
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,150
I want to be ready.

228
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,670
What the hell?

229
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,156
Find Lucius.

230
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,233
Tell him to meet me
at the generator.

231
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,035
Lights are out everywhere.

232
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,736
Well, don't you worry,
Master Bruce.

233
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,433
Clinic's got its own
backup generator.

234
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,479
You see?

235
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,517
Everything's shipshape
and Bristol fashion.

236
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
No.

237
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Something's wrong.

238
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,712
Men in the basement.

239
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,480
They're stealing
all the medicine.

240
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,876
Alfred,
stay with Selina.

241
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,936
Of course, but you
can't go down there.

242
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,280
It's gonna be pitch black.
Gonna need a torch or something.

243
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,314
Lucius gave me
something better.

244
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,114
Careful.

245
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,677
I know what
you're thinking, Captain.

246
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,359
I have so few
bullets.

247
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,878
Do I spend one on him?

248
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,509
Is it worth it?

249
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,633
I already know it's not.

250
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,515
My other question is:

251
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,956
Why are you here?
It's not to steal the generator.

252
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,237
Why would I
want light?

253
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,909
Fear lives in darkness.

254
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,957
So what then?
You came for our supplies?

255
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,196
Exactly so.

256
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,154
But since I'm here,
I'll also take your life.

257
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,872
It's been a while since you
tasted my toxin, Captain.

258
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,959
What are you scared of now?

259
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Not you.

260
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,760
Hey! Hey!

261
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,833
Hey!

262
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,560
They got the beans.

263
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,280
Go. The lights are back up.

264
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,470
Go! Move! Go!

265
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,955
Did... did you hear that?

266
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,956
Hello?

267
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,230
Scag?

268
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,354
Hey... hey, guys?

269
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,390
Scag?

270
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,599
Hey, guys, this isn't...
this isn't funny.

271
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,839
Go back! Go back!

272
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,998
First their government
abandons them,

273
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,120
and then some freak
dressed like a scarecrow

274
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,436
steals their grub.

275
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,000
I'd be pissed, too.

276
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
So where are we?

277
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,436
At current consumption,

278
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,193
we've got a week of food.

279
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,750
Go to half rations.

280
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,440
We're already at half rations.

281
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,270
Cut 'em again.

282
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,715
The people won't be happy.

283
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,434
I haven't been happy
in ten years.

284
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,000
At least they'll be alive.

285
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,470
All right, that buys us
two weeks. Then what?

286
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,999
Jim, at this point,

287
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,656
the bastards across the
river are gonna have to

288
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,433
- step up and help.
- Why start now?

289
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
They haven't before.

290
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,512
For the love of God, we...
because we stayed

291
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,114
to do the job
they wouldn't.

292
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,437
Huh? And now they're just
gonna sit back and watch

293
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,319
while we starve or
tear ourselves apart?

294
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,576
Because that's
what's gonna happen.

295
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,636
I know, Harv.

296
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,920
But right now, we have to tell
these people something.

297
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,514
Tell them
help is coming.

298
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,709
I'll fly in supplies.

299
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,356
We tried that.

300
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,273
We couldn't even get
permission to take off.

301
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,000
Zero tolerance.
Nothing in or out.

302
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
Well, I'm not
asking for permission.

303
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
It's ready.

304
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,456
Alfred's already radioed
to have it delivered

305
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,596
from our
east bay hangar.

306
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,000
We can have a supply chopper
here within hours.

307
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,874
Man, it is nice to have
a billionaire around.

308
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Even if it succeeds,

309
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,360
the government's
gonna find out.

310
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,800
It's a one-time solution.

311
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,237
Scarecrow's men
didn't just take food.

312
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,358
They stole medicine
from the clinic.

313
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,839
There are people in pain.

314
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,271
Harvey, tell the people
help is on the way.

315
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
You got it.

316
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
How's Selina?

317
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,200
She's strong.

318
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,000
She'll pull through.

319
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,080
Doc says the surgery
was a success.

320
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,030
My spine's not gonna
turn to jelly.

321
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,951
Still never be able
to walk again, so...

322
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,754
that's a bummer.

323
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,397
There's limited resources here.

324
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,790
But there's hope
once we join the mainland.

325
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Gee.

326
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,311
For a second there,
I was worried.

327
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,071
Selina, I know you're in pain.

328
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,472
Some medicine is on its way.

329
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,239
You know what's funny?

330
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,710
Jeremiah shot me to get to you.

331
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,277
After all the things
I've done...

332
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,596
...what did me in
was being your friend.

333
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,756
I just wish
Jeremiah killed me.

334
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
Doctors can't help her.

335
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,000
She needs the witch.

336
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,270
Thank you.

337
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,875
How's the mood?

338
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,360
They're hanging
in there.

339
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,393
They love their
Jim Gordon.

340
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,237
But if that chopper
doesn't come, it'll be bad.

341
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,150
It'll come.

342
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,435
Feels good.

343
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,839
Missing something, though.

344
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,719
Put a knife on it.

345
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,555
Another shutdown at the factory.

346
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,397
A worker fell
into a hydraulic press.

347
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,836
It appears
he passed out from hunger.

348
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,194
Sir, I worry if we don't
increase the food allowance...

349
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,279
Mr. Penn,

350
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,079
I feel for all
of our workers.

351
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,558
But I cannot give
what I do not have.

352
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,593
Overcooked!

353
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,679
Edward.

354
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,480
Such a good boy.

355
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,320
Quality at the factory
is also suffering.

356
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,911
- More misfires...
- Nonsense.

357
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,560
Our rounds
are fine.

358
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,713
And now you've upset Edward.

359
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,949
As you see,

360
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,834
more misfires.

361
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,754
- Sir, if we don't give better quality...
- Shut up.

362
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Sir?

363
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,193
- Sir?
- Shh, shut up!

364
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Shut up.

365
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,550
Do you hear that?

366
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,999
You said yourself, Penguin has
locked himself in City Hall

367
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,992
- with a small army.
- I know that.

368
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,117
- And I know you miss Butch.
- Do you?

369
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,232
Because he only
did it to hurt me.

370
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,279
That's why I have
to make it right.

371
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,796
And how are you gonna do that
and not get killed?

372
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,240
I need you, too.

373
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,399
Tabby, you hear me?

374
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,720
Is that a chopper?

375
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,316
There it is.

376
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,595
This is Bruce Wayne.

377
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,797
I'm at the GCPD.
We can see you.

378
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,433
<i>Copy that, Mr. Wayne.</i>

379
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,319
<i>We'll meet you
at the rendezvous point.</i>

380
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,395
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

381
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,016
<i>We've been hit!
We're going down hard.</i>

382
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,056
- Harvey, the chopper went down.
<i>- Mayday! Mayday!</i>

383
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,400
Get a team together now.

384
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,916
<i>Brace for impact.
We're going down.</i>

385
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,355
Oh, my God.

386
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,870
Chopper went down
in Lo Boyz territory.

387
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,032
I expect we'll have to fight
our way in and out.

388
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,316
I know it's a lot to ask,

389
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,040
but without those
supplies, we're done.

390
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,096
Can we get some more ammo?
We're running dry down here.

391
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,952
Be happy you got what you got,
and get in.

392
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,077
Alfred, I expected
to see Bruce here,

393
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,456
- wanting to come along.
- Well, you'd think, wouldn't you?

394
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,994
I mean, his chopper, his pilots.

395
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,856
Maybe he thought
you wouldn't allow it.

396
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,757
Just keep an eye on things
while I'm gone.

397
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,669
Hello.

398
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,158
The Lo Boyz, is it?

399
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,273
I suspect you know who I am.

400
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,479
This ain't your turf, bird man.

401
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,040
Be that as it may,

402
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,271
I'm here to claim that.

403
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,029
Like hell.

404
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,120
Get it in the truck.

405
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,955
Oswald!

406
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,670
Jim.

407
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,516
I thought you might show up.

408
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,160
It is so good to
see you, old friend.

409
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,595
How are you faring
in these troubled times?

410
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,311
Tell your men to step away
from the chopper.

411
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,513
Sorry. Mouths to feed.

412
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,511
And you know all
about that, don't you?

413
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,230
I hear you are up

414
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,596
to your ears in refugees.

415
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,156
We're protecting children,
families.

416
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,674
We need those supplies.

417
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,118
You shouldn't have
shot it down, Oswald.

418
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,956
You think I did this?

419
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,520
No, no, no, no, no.

420
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,635
That would mean that I knew
a chopper was coming,

421
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,996
which I did not.
I mean, don't get me wrong,

422
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,360
we're still taking everything,

423
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,955
but I did not fire the shot.

424
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,270
It was an RPG.

425
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,159
Who else has that kind
of firepower?

426
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,276
Fair point.

427
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,639
But if it was me,

428
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,760
wouldn't I just admit it?

429
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,153
I mean,

430
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,437
it's not like
I'm going to be arrested.

431
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,595
Then who was it?

432
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,870
No idea.

433
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,231
Now, nice as it was catching up,

434
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,119
it's time you skedaddle.

435
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,954
While you can.

436
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,117
We are, uh, kind of
outgunned here, partner.

437
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,316
Listen to Harvey.

438
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,879
After all we have been through,

439
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,157
do not make me kill you.

440
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,554
Not like this.

441
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,271
- You should've stayed home.
- Listen to me.

442
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,431
I know you're upset about Butch.

443
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,976
He thought
you were his friend!

444
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,832
- I was his friend!
- Liar!

445
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,277
You put a knife in
my mother's back.

446
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,915
His blood is on your hands!

447
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,711
You really think that I expected
to come here and walk away?

448
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,936
Jim, are you just
going to let her

449
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,713
kill me like this in cold blood?

450
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,153
Jim, listen to me.
You are not the only one

451
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,520
keeping Gotham from the abyss.

452
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,239
I am! I provide stability!

453
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,399
I may have pulled the trigger,

454
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,151
but you killed Butch.

455
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,679
Shut up and die.

456
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,277
Now, if that was
one of my bullets,

457
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,831
I will certainly be having
a word with my foreman.

458
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,039
Unacceptable!

459
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,870
Say hello to Butch.

460
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,073
<i>No...!</i>

461
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,040
Barbara...

462
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,435
don't...

463
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,836
- I'm out.
- Me, too.

464
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Uh-oh, Jim!

465
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,271
Sounding a little quiet
over there!

466
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,194
What the hell do we do now?

467
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,550
I know, I shouldn't
be here. But look.

468
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,150
Penguin had a truck out back.
I took these.

469
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
And there's more.

470
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,234
I could kiss you, kid.

471
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,551
For the record,
this is not

472
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,034
how I wanted things to go.

473
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,356
You son of a bitch.

474
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,038
I will rip out your heart!

475
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,760
Quiet. Now, that is exactly
the kind of talk

476
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,394
that's gonna force my hand.

477
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,873
But for old time's sake,
I will give you a chance.

478
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,758
Can we move past this?

479
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,951
Say the whole Tabitha-Butch
chapter is over?

480
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,398
I am gonna feed your guts

481
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,080
to the rats,

482
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,517
you beaky-nosed freak!

483
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,715
So, no.

484
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,999
What's the plan, boss?

485
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,750
Cover me.

486
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,795
Oswald!

487
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,714
I want to make a deal.

488
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,511
A deal, Jim?

489
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,754
We split whatever's
in the chopper 50-50...

490
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,993
...and you let Barbara go.

491
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
No.

492
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,320
He does not get to limp
out of here alive!

493
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,549
Shh!

494
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,993
I got a deal for you, Jim.

495
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,633
She dies, I take everything,
and you go home and reflect

496
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,553
long and hard

497
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,279
on my generosity.

498
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,960
And if I say no?

499
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,599
What happens
when the government finds out

500
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,355
you murdered the only cops
left in Gotham?

501
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,634
Nothing.

502
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,440
Jim, as far as
I can tell,

503
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,798
you have nothing to offer,
and you're out of ammo.

504
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,356
Not anymore.

505
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,536
Truth is, I was never
gonna make that deal.

506
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,677
I need all those supplies.
Load up!

507
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,032
<i>We got it.
Here we go, people.</i>

508
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,715
<i>- Heads up.
- Finally, here we are.</i>

509
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,120
You think Penguin's
gonna pull through?

510
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,674
Cockroaches are hard to kill.

511
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,576
But at least he'll be
out of commission for a while.

512
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,640
You had him
dead to rights.

513
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,120
You could've put
him down for good.

514
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,157
Yeah, shot a man
without warning.

515
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,096
Three months ago, I would've
lost my badge for that.

516
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,280
Three months ago, we weren't
fighting for our survival.

517
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,920
You think it didn't
cross my mind?

518
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,680
I know what
we're up against, Harvey.

519
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
No one is coming to help.

520
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,040
Then why didn't you
do us all a favor

521
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,072
and put that murdering
son of a bitch in a hole?

522
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,837
You want rules for this game?
I'll tell you.

523
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,151
I'll make it simple, okay?
You win or you die.

524
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,913
Next time, shoot to kill.

525
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Everything all right?

526
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,436
No, but we're alive,

527
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,080
so that's something. What's up?

528
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,896
The-the medicine's just
been taken to the clinic.

529
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,560
- I need to check on Selina.
- Yeah, sure.

530
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
I'll get you a ride.

531
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,951
- Hey! Let me know how she is.
- All right.

532
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,909
And, Bruce?

533
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,471
Next time you want
to help, just ask.

534
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,394
You've earned a place here.

535
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,153
<i>Captain Gordon?</i>

536
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,319
<i>Hello?
Captain Gordon, come in.</i>

537
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,755
<i>Captain Gordon, do you read me?</i>

538
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,995
<i>Hello? Come in.</i>

539
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,431
This is James Gordon.
Who am I speaking to?

540
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,999
<i>A friend who wants you to know</i>

541
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,640
<i>you have allies
across the river.</i>

542
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,674
<i>We will find a way to help you.</i>

543
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
And who are you?

544
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,950
Get out of here!

545
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,756
Really?

546
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,636
A dumpster?

547
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,995
Okay.

548
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,280
What are you doing to me?!

549
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,319
Show yourself!

550
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,311
What is happening to me?

551
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,713
I promise...

552
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,671
if it's the last thing I do...

553
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,430
I will kill him!

554
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,992
Aah! My leg!

555
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,831
He shot my leg!
I just fixed this!

556
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,469
Mr. Cobblepot, if you
could hold still, I...

557
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Put out the word.

558
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:47,429
100,000 rounds of ammunition
to whoever kills Jim Gordon.

559
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,712
I want his head.

560
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,000
No!

561
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,560
No!

562
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:32,755
- Selina.
- Help!

563
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,673
Let me go!

564
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,433
- Selina. Selina.
- Let me go!

565
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,875
Selina...

566
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,560
You can't do this. Please.

567
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,280
I have no reason to...

568
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
I can't...

569
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,076
You should've just let me do it.

570
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Let her do what?

571
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,190
What happened?

572
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,752
She was trying to
kill herself.

573
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,391
I'll get restraints
for when she wakes.

574
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,795
I told you,
you want to cure her,

575
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,793
you have to go to the witch.

576
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,717
And where do I find this witch?

577
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,634
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

578
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Thank you very much.

579
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,190
Saint Jim of Gotham.
All right.

580
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,079
Hey. Every new refugee
who comes in, I want questioned.

581
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,993
I need information
on Jeremiah Valeska.

582
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,296
I haven't heard
that clown's name

583
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,879
in three months. Why now?

584
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,949
Just call it a hunch.

585
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,955
Well, rather than a week
of food, we've got six weeks.

586
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,270
It's not a lot.

587
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,920
Yeah, but it's
better than we were.

588
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,270
Don't give up hope.

589
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,590
<i>Captain Gordon!</i>

590
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,950
Captain Gordon!

591
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,555
What's going on?

592
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,680
I was on duty

593
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,040
at the Thompson
Street barricade.

594
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,833
He just appeared.

595
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,679
He said he needed to see you.

596
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,350
What happened, son?

597
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,036
Where'd you come from?

598
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,040
Past the train station.

599
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,736
That's on
the other side of town.

600
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,896
This kid must've
made it through

601
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,639
half a dozen sectors
to get here.

602
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,753
My brothers and sisters.

603
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,276
They're killing us.

604
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Who is?

605
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,199
You have to help us.

606
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
Whoa, whoa.

607
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,720
Get him to the clinic.

608
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,957
I know you're all asking,
why are we still here

609
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,191
when our own government
won't help us?

610
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,560
It's simple.

611
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,676
We're supposed to be giving
these people hope.

612
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,599
Hope that if they're in danger,
someone will come.

613
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,679
We will come.

614
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,480
Suit up!
