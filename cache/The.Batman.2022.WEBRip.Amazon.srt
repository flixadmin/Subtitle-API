 <i>-Richie, Glen.</i>
-[Richie] <i>Hey.</i>

709
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:48,795
That's half the DA's office.

[Gil] <i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

711
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:51,841
-Hi.
-That's Cheri. Don't mind her,

712
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,191
she's just taking a break.

713
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:55,410
Drowning our sorrows.

[Selina] <i>Uh, no, I'm good.</i> 
<i>But you enjoy.</i>

[music continues on speakers]

717
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,417
 <i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

718
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:03,810
 <i>I got a lot on my shoulders</i>

719
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:04,985
 <i>with that psycho</i> 
<i>running around.</i>

720
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:06,073
He's wasted.

721
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,814
No shit.

722
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:10,251
[chuckles] <i>I like this girl.</i>

723
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:11,861
Oh, hey, I like you, too!

724
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,302
 <i>I mean, this Riddler,</i>

725
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:18,738
 <i>he's going after the most</i> 
<i>powerful people in the city.</i>

726
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,218
 <i>He knows so much.</i>

727
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:21,567
[Travis] <i>He doesn't</i> 
<i>know shit, man.</i>

728
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:22,960
[Gil] <i>What are you</i>

729
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,396
 <i>Yeah, he does!</i> 
<i>What about that rat...</i>

730
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:26,050
[Richie] <i>Hey, hey,</i> 
<i>Gil, come on.</i>

731
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,703
-Hey. The rat.
-[Richie] <i>Think maybe you had</i>

732
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:28,661
 <i>-a little too much. Slow down.</i>
-Ask him about the rat.

733
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:32,491
[Selina] <i>Hey,</i> 
<i>what's this about a rat?</i>

734
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:37,452
[inhales deeply]

735
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:44,851
 <i>I mean,</i>

736
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:49,029
 <i>there was a rat.</i> 
<i>We had an informant.</i>

737
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,553
 <i>We had big-time information</i> 
<i>on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

738
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,251
 <i>That's how we got him out of</i> 
<i>the drops business.</i>

739
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:54,948
He's talking about
the Maroni case.

740
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:58,734
 <i>But if this guy knows,</i> 
<i>it's gonna come out.</i>

741
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:00,301
 <i>And when it does,</i>

742
00:50:00,388 --> 00:50:01,259
 <i>this whole city's</i>

743
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,174
 <i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

744
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:04,784
 <i>This is</i>

 <i>that got that Russian girl</i> 
<i>disappeared.</i>

746
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,788
What do you know about that?

00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,138
 <i>-Does anybody want a drink?</i>
-[Gil] <i>I want a drink.</i>

748
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:12,444
Keep him talking.

749
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:17,753
 <i>-Wait, where are you going?</i>
-She knows Annika.

750
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,277
No, stay on the DA.

751
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:21,235
I told you
I'm looking for my friend.

752
00:50:23,237 --> 00:50:24,412
Where's Annika?

753
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:25,848
Out of my face.
I don't know you.

754
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:27,154
Yeah, but you know her.
Who took her?

755
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,677
What have you heard?
Is she okay?

756

00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:33,204
[man] Hey,
what's the problem, ladies?

759
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:36,163
[Carla] There's no problem.
It's just girl talk.

 <i>Let's keep it festive</i>

761

 <i>Hey.</i>

763
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:47,435
Hey.

764
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:50,656
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

765
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:53,137
How you been?

766
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,184
Yeah, I've been okay.

 <i>I was just, um...</i>

768
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,756
I was just headed back
upstairs.

769
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:05,540
Mm. Well,

 <i>don't be a stranger.</i>

771
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:24,777
-You know Carmine Falcone.
-I told you it's a mob spot.

772
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:26,431
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

 <i>I don't have a relationship</i> 
<i>with him, okay?</i>

774
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:29,825
Well, that's not

808
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:40,973
[Batman] What do you know
about a confidential informant

809
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,279
in the Maroni case?

810
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,110
Yeah, sure, there was.

811
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:50,852
That's the rat
we're looking for.

812
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:53,333
Somehow
Riddler knows who he is.

813
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,467
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

814
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:58,120
Where are you getting this?

815
00:54:58,207 --> 00:55:00,819
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

816
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:04,039
Gil's very nervous.

817
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:06,651
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

818
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:08,609
I worked that case.

819
00:55:08,696 --> 00:55:11,960
-Riddler's not after you.
-How do you know?

820
00:55:12,047 --> 00:55:13,397
You're not corrupt.

Colson's dirty?

822
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:24,016
Maybe I, uh...

823
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:27,367
I go after him. Lean on him
to give up the rat.

824
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:28,847
It's too dangerous.

825
00:55:28,934 --> 00:55:31,458
They made a secret deal
with this guy.

826
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:33,373
Who knows how many people
it touches.

827
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:37,812
Politicians. Police.
The courts.

828
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,945
It could tear
the whole city apart.

829
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:42,034
[Gordon] Jesus,
this is a powder keg.

I'm not so sure.

846
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,548
Looks like you upset her.

847

Shall I take this
as a good sign?

848
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:21,987
-What?
-Your attire.

849
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:24,076
Is Bruce Wayne
making an actual appearance?

850
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:26,165
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

851
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:29,864
Serial killers like to follow
reactions to their crimes.

852
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,518
Riddler might not
be able to resist.

853
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:34,173
Oh, that reminds me.

854
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,828
I've taken the liberty
of doing a little work

855
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:38,656
on this latest cipher.

856
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:40,614
The one from the rat maze.

857
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:44,009
I'm afraid his Spanish
is not perfect,

858
00:56:44,096 --> 00:56:45,924
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

859

"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

"Rat with wings"?

862
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:53,888
It's slang for "pigeon."

863
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:55,281
Does that mean anything
to you?

864
00:56:55,368 --> 00:56:56,456
Yeah.

865
00:56:57,979 --> 00:56:59,546

-I couldn't find them.

Well, you can't
go out like that.

your cufflinks.

Hey, watch it, fellas.

You got the prince

Some event, huh?

899

Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

903
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:26,780
Why? 'Cause your father
ain't around?

904
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:29,609
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:31,306
Wow, is that right?

906
00:59:31,393 --> 00:59:34,222
His father saved my life.

Right here.

I couldn't go to no hospital,

909

I remember your face.

914
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:58,725
You don't think that meant
something, he did that?

915
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:00,858
It meant he took
the Hippocratic oath.

916
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,774
"Hippocratic oath."

917
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:08,039

Your father should have known

1740
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:13,242
that Falcone would do anything

1741
01:49:13,329 --> 01:49:16,332
to finally have something
on him that he could use.

1742
01:49:16,419 --> 01:49:18,160
That's who Falcone is.

1743
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:22,860
And that was
your father's mistake.

1744
01:49:22,947 --> 01:49:24,862
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1745
01:49:24,949 --> 01:49:28,518
your father was distraught.

1746
01:49:28,605 --> 01:49:31,782
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1747
01:49:31,869 --> 01:49:34,002
that he would confess
everything.

1748
01:49:35,525 --> 01:49:37,527
And that night,

1749
01:49:37,614 --> 01:49:40,312
your father and your mother

1750
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:41,531
were killed.

1751
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:45,666
[soft music playing]

1752
01:49:47,015 --> 01:49:48,669
It was Falcone?

1753
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:54,718
[smacks lips]

1754
01:49:54,805 --> 01:49:56,851
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1755
01:50:01,682 --> 01:50:05,207
Or maybe it was some
random thug on the street

1756
01:50:05,294 --> 01:50:06,730
who needed money, got scared,

1757
01:50:06,817 --> 01:50:08,166
and pulled the trigger
too fast.

1758
01:50:08,253 --> 01:50:11,300
If you don't think
I've spent every day

1759
01:50:11,387 --> 01:50:13,302
searching for that answer...

1760
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:19,569
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1761
01:50:19,656 --> 01:50:21,527
I know you always
blamed yourself.

1762
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:24,008
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1763
01:50:26,228 --> 01:50:28,447
I could see the fear
in your eyes,

1764
01:50:29,884 --> 01:50:32,364
but I didn't know how to help.

1765
01:50:32,451 --> 01:50:36,151
I could teach you
how to fight, [sighs]

1766
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:38,893
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1767
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:40,764
You needed a father.

1768
01:50:42,766 --> 01:50:45,160
And all you had was me.

1769
01:50:47,553 --> 01:50:48,729
I'm sorry.

1770
01:50:50,513 --> 01:50:52,428
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1771
01:50:59,217 --> 01:51:00,305
God.

1772
01:51:03,395 --> 01:51:07,661
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1773
01:51:10,489 --> 01:51:12,535
I thought
I'd mastered all that.

1774
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:20,238
I mean,

1775
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,589
I'm not afraid to die.

1776
01:51:25,374 --> 01:51:27,681
I realize now
there's something

1777
01:51:28,856 --> 01:51:30,684
I haven't got past.

1778
01:51:31,641 --> 01:51:33,382
This fear...

1779
01:51:35,906 --> 01:51:38,779
of ever going through
any of that again.

1780
01:51:43,087 --> 01:51:45,220
Of losing somebody
I care about.

1781
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,936
[soft music continues]

1784

Hey.

1785
01:52:37,141 --> 01:52:39,709
I saw the signal.
That's not you?

1786
01:52:39,796 --> 01:52:41,580
I thought it was you.

1787
01:52:45,802 --> 01:52:47,151
[both grunting]

1788
01:52:54,550 --> 01:52:56,073
-I found him!
-I see that.

1789
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:57,771
He had my shit and my phone.

1790
01:52:57,858 --> 01:52:59,424
She left a message
the night they took her.

1791
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:01,731
-She called me...
-Gordon! Help me out, man!

1792
01:53:01,818 --> 01:53:03,254
She got my gun!

1793
01:53:03,341 --> 01:53:04,690
[grunts]

1794
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:07,650
-Shut up!
-Put the gun down.

1795
01:53:07,737 --> 01:53:10,218
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

[Kenzie] <i>I'm...</i> 
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1803
01:53:28,279 --> 01:53:29,454
[Annika tearfully] 
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1804
01:53:29,541 --> 01:53:31,152
 <i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1805
01:53:31,239 --> 01:53:33,589
[Falcone] <i>Hey, don't be scared.</i> 
<i>Come here.</i>

1806
01:53:35,547 --> 01:53:38,376
 <i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1807
01:53:38,463 --> 01:53:40,988
 <i>-What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
-[Annika] <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1808
01:53:41,075 --> 01:53:43,991
[Falcone] <i>Don liked to talk.</i> 
<i>I know that.</i>

1809
01:53:44,078 --> 01:53:47,255
 <i>Especially to pretty girls</i> 
<i>like you.</i>

1810
01:53:47,342 --> 01:53:49,953
 <i>That's why I made him</i> 
<i>take your passport,</i>

1811
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,913
 <i>until we could have</i> 
<i>this little conversation.</i>

1812
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,698
[Annika] <i>All I want to do</i> 
<i>is get out of here, okay?</i>

1813
01:53:55,785 --> 01:53:57,395
 <i>You'll never hear from me</i> 
<i>again, nobody will.</i>

1814
01:53:57,482 --> 01:53:59,267
 <i>Please, please...</i>

1815
01:53:59,354 --> 01:54:01,791
[Falcone] <i>We're gonna get you</i> 
<i>out of here, I promise.</i>

1816
01:54:01,878 --> 01:54:05,447
 <i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1817
01:54:05,534 --> 01:54:07,579
 <i>-What did he tell you?</i>
-[Annika] <i>He...</i>

1818
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:11,757
 <i>He just said they all made</i> 
<i>a deal with you.</i>

1819
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:14,935
[Falcone] <i>Oh. Hmm.</i> 
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1820
01:54:15,022 --> 01:54:16,327
 <i>The deal.</i>

1821
01:54:16,414 --> 01:54:18,112
[Annika] <i>He said</i>

1822
01:54:18,199 --> 01:54:21,332
 <i>you gave some information</i> 
<i>on some drops thing,</i>

1823
01:54:21,419 --> 01:54:24,161
 <i>and that's how</i> 
<i>he became mayor.</i>

1824

 <i>He said you were</i>

1825
01:54:26,642 --> 01:54:27,773
[Falcone] <i>Right.</i>

1826

 <i>Rata Alada.</i>

A falcon has wings, too.

1836
01:55:04,158 --> 01:55:05,942
Falcone is the rat?

1837
01:55:16,953 --> 01:55:20,652
Falcone works for you guys?

1838
01:55:20,739 --> 01:55:23,264
The mayor? The DA?

1839
01:55:26,354 --> 01:55:27,921
No. [breathing shakily]

1840
01:55:30,488 --> 01:55:31,750
We work for him.

1841
01:55:32,751 --> 01:55:34,014
Everybody does.

1842
01:55:34,101 --> 01:55:35,189
How?

1843
01:55:35,276 --> 01:55:37,495
Through Renewal.

1844
01:55:37,582 --> 01:55:38,975
Renewal is everything.

1845
01:55:39,062 --> 01:55:40,846
-The Renewal Fund?
-[Kenzie] Yeah.

1846
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,239
After Thomas Wayne died,

1847
01:55:42,326 --> 01:55:44,763
they all went after it
like vultures.

1848
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:48,463
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1849
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:50,595
It was perfect
for making bribes,

1850
01:55:50,682 --> 01:55:52,119
laundering money.

1851
01:55:52,206 --> 01:55:53,859
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1852
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:55,731
Everybody got a piece.

1853
01:55:55,818 --> 01:55:57,646
But Falcone wanted more.

1854
01:55:59,691 --> 01:56:02,825
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1855
01:56:04,174 --> 01:56:06,785
He'd rat out
his drops operation,

1856
01:56:06,872 --> 01:56:09,658
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1857
01:56:09,745 --> 01:56:12,139
then install them all
as his puppets.

1858
01:56:12,226 --> 01:56:14,706
You think this goddamn
election matters?

1859
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:19,102
Falcone's the mayor.

1860
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:21,670
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1861
01:56:21,757 --> 01:56:23,759
Come on, Vengeance.

1862
01:56:23,846 --> 01:56:26,283
Let's go kill
that son of a bitch.

1863
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:27,632

Let's finish this.

We'll get him.

1867

-But not that way.
-There is no other way!

1868
01:56:34,291 --> 01:56:37,381
-He owns the city!
-Cross that line,

1869
01:56:37,468 --> 01:56:39,383
you'll become just like him.

1870

Listen to me.

01:56:41,081 --> 01:56:42,952
Don't throw your life away.

Don't worry, honey.

1873
01:56:53,919 --> 01:56:55,356

[Gordon] She won't
get out of there alive.

we may never find the Riddler.

-I have to stop her.
-Don't you mean "we"?

I gotta do this my way.

1880

And then what?

1881
01:57:20,729 --> 01:57:22,861
We do what Riddler said.

1882
01:57:22,948 --> 01:57:24,515

I'd like to come up?

you could help me find her...
