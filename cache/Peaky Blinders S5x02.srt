1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,718
In New York City, at 6am,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,196
the Wall Street Stock Exchange crashed.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,233
I told Michael on Friday
this was going to happen.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,476
We were most definitely on board.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,350
But you have to listen
to the voices that you hear.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,715
My name is Mosley. Oswald Mosley.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,353
Yeah, I know who you are.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,357
You have come to my attention.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,913
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the London Times.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,919
Ten years ago, I was a journalist
on the Birmingham Evening Mail.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,838
Course, working in that city,

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,951
it was impossible not to know your name.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,720
And your...reputation.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,878
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,152
Is it evolution or revolution?

16
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,355
Dad! There's a phone call for you!

17
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,673
Dad! There's a phone call for you!

18
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,195
Charlie!

19
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,031
Charlie! Wait!

20
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,355
Charlie!

21
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,396
Giddy-up, horsey, giddy-up!

22
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,194
- Dad, there's a phone call for you.
- Good boy.

23
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,072
Good boy.

24
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,157
Will you go back to the house?

25
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,351
And, er, whoever's calling,

26
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,994
the operator will have their number,

27
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,077
and I'lWl call them back, eh?

28
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,715
Oh, look, Charlie.

29
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,513
You must have violin practice.

30
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,039
It's Mrs Milligan.

31
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,150
Go on.

32
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,629
And, Charlie!

33
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,149
Charlie, you play loudly.

34
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,998
You might hear some bangs.

35
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,394
Go on.

36
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,393
Mr Shelby?

37
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,591
Maggie, yeah, it's me.

38
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,916
- Yes, Mr Shelby.
- I just missed a call.

39
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,314
Where was it from?

40
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,033
Belfast.

41
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,471
Belfast. Where in Belfast?

42
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,591
Um, I'm not sure.

43
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,438
Do you have the number?

44
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,959
Yeah.

45
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,953
Yeah, can you put me through?

46
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,269
<i>Tommy, don't believe...</i>

47
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,911
Mr Shelby.

48
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,519
My name is Captain Swing,

49
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,472
calling from the occupied Six Counties.

50
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,069
And there are some people
from the other side

51
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,511
of our neat little city
that want you dead.

52
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,477
You should also know that this boy,
this Michael, your kin,

53
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,195
was in his cabin
aboard the SS Monroe in Belfast dock,

54
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,914
making deals with the very men
who want you dead.

55
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,950
Tommy, they're lying!

56
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,550
Now, if you want, we can put
a bullet in his head here and now...

57
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,677
...or we can send him home,
and you can deal with him,

58
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,593
Send him home.

59
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,553
Very well, Mr Shelby.

60
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,878
But be informed that this kin of yours
was talking to representatives

61
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,152
from the County Tyrone and Glasgow UVF

62
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,191
about how they'd divide up
the English racetracks

63
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,870
- after they'd blown away your legs.
- Tommy, they're lying!

64
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,470
And may I ask...

65
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,512
...why you are doing me this favour?

66
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,949
Because, Mr Shelby,

67
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,879
we've been informed
by people at the very highest level

68
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,833
that, since your conversion to socialism,

69
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,395
you are now on the side of the angels.

70
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,638
And angels can be useful to us.

71
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,909
Come.

72
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,835
Mr Shelby, the violin teacher
wants to know what all those bangs were.

73
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,280
Fireworks.

74
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,038
Was trying them out for Saturday.

75
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,073
You promised the doctor
not until after dark.

76
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,192
Oh, it's pretty dark, Frances.

77
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,914
Also,

78
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,317
will Mrs Shelby and Ruby be home
for dinner tonight?

79
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,714
I don't know.

80
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,155
Dad?

81
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,436
I've learned something this morning.

82
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,959
Have you?

83
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,069
So have I.

84
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,754
And what have you learned, my boy?

85
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,798
Let's get this over with.
I've got a train to catch.

86
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,797
Go get your train, Tom.
I can deal with this.

87
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,910
Oi.

88
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,714
Get it!

89
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,838
Go home.

90
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,794
Come here, you.

91
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,036
Put this on.

92
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,674
There you go.
Look at that, it looks great on you.

93
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,473
Wrap up warm.

94
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,869
Wake up.

95
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,151
Rise and shine.

96
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,270
What are you doing here?

97
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,391
Wasting our fucking time on you.

98
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,393
Sit down, Finn.

99
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,557
Sit down.

100
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,789
What do I have to do...

101
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,196
...to make you fucking listen to me?

102
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,312
You took a bullet.

103
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,829
You've been running around the streets
with a fucking gun in your hand.

104
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,559
Somebody has to.

105
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,549
Finn, we've got people
for that kind of work.

106
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,310
Soldiers. Captains and corporals.

107
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,714
Well, then, what am I?

108
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,315
"What am I?" Jesus Christ.

109
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,592
Yeah, what am I, Tom, huh?

110
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,472
I'm the brother you never got round to.

111
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,989
You're a general, Finn.

112
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,269
You understand?

113
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,597
You're a fucking Shelby,
so you're a general.

114
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,714
When did you last see a general
anywhere near the blood and the puke, eh?

115
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,276
He's fucking right.

116
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,152
That's what you are.

117
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,669
So on your feet, soldier.

118
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,393
Come on, on your feet.

119
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,114
I thought you just said I was a general.

120
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,878
I did just say you were.

121
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,354
So get on your fucking feet!

122
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,153
Arthur...

123
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,556
Finn. Finn.

124
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,795
Look at this.

125
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,914
This is the bullet
that Aberama Gold cut from you.

126
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,475
First and last.

127
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,349
First and last.

128
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,674
Don't lose it.

129
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,679
Go and clean up, put some clothes on.

130
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,438
A nice suit.

131
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,949
I've got some trouble
that'll keep you out of trouble.

132
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,075
- Oh, and, erm, Tom...
- Yeah?

133
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,599
...while you're here,

134
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,950
erm, I've met this girl

135
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,196
- and I'd like to get married.
- Fuck off. Go, get dressed.

136
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,310
Go on, move.

137
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,669
Go!

138
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,837
Finn, this girl you're trying to impress,

139
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,359
tell me about her.

140
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,799
She likes the life.

141
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,036
She likes the life, eh?

142
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,480
Well, find one that hates it.

143
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,638
Look at him, that's what he did.
Now he's chairman of the board.

144
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,674
Go on. Hurry up.

145
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,835
Arthur?

146
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,510
Lizzie and Ruby, are they still at yours?

147
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,437
Yes, Tom, they're still there.

148
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,074
She's coming home today, she said, so...

149
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,599
...she'll be home later.

150
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,354
Hm. Has she been talking about me?

151
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,313
I mean, they talk a lot,
you know what women are like.

152
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,319
The kitchen and, you know,
kids running around.

153
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,431
I...I don't pay 'em no mind, Tom.

154
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,437
- I don't listen to 'em 'alf the time.
- Yeah.

155
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,114
Well, everything she says is true.

156
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,554
Well...

157
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,115
...you like the life, Tommy.

158
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,197
I don't like the fucking life.

159
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,038
I don't like the fucking life,

160
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,436
I don't like
that Michael is coming back today.

161
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,116
Train arrives from Liverpool at three.

162
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,514
Polly will be there.

163
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,755
Take a weapon.

164
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,076
Tell Moss to clear the station of coppers.

165
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,429
You hear me?

166
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,595
Yes, sir.

167
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,758
Hey, Tommy.

168
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,437
I heard 'em say one thing, though.

169
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,951
Just talking, you know,
they were saying that, er,

170
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,550
you...you don't sleep or something.

171
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,159
You can't sleep.

172
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,392
When I do sleep, I dream.

173
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,469
And in my dream,
someone wants my crown.

174
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,955
I think it might be Michael.

175
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,912
Call me at three.

176
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,036
Arthur, I'm gonna put
that bullet on a necklace

177
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,355
and wear it as a reminder.

178
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,879
Arthur?

179
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,355
- I heard you.
- You got trouble for me, then?

180
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,959
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

181
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,640
Mr Shelby,
the...the police are here to see you.

182
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,159
Police aren't allowed in here.

183
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,272
Er, he's not in uniform
and said it's very unofficial.

184
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,314
Afternoon. Someone get you some tea?

185
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,760
No, I'm fine, Mr Shelby.

186
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,154
- This won't take long.
- Good.

187
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,117
You've got five minutes.

188
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,677
Mr Shelby,
there was a shooting two days ago.

189
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,518
A man died.

190
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,039
It was a murder.

191
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,195
In Maida Vale.

192
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,710
Of all places.

193
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,318
- His name was Levitt.
- Uh-huh.

194
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,513
He was a journalist.

195
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,352
The night before he was shot,
he came here to see you.

196
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,838
We found a Commons pass
and your name in his diary.

197
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,352
I was wondering
what his business here was.

198
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,829
And I'm wondering...

199
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,957
...what your business here is.

200
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,593
According to his diary,
you knew him from Birmingham.

201
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,949
What's your name?

202
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,275
Stacker.

203
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,198
Stacker. OK.

204
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,792
Mr Shelby, Mr Levitt was a queer.

205
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,911
Some may think
it was one of his queer friends...

206
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,599
Mr Stacker,

207
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,270
I get the feeling that,
with a little provocation,

208
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,232
you could be very persistent.

209
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,556
Only within my remit.

210
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,956
Well, your Chief Constable Wyatt,

211
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,550
he has clear views about persistence,
which he has shared with me.

212
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,715
Mr Shelby...

213
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,470
He likes persistence, as do I.
And thoroughness.

214
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,829
But not frivolity.

215
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,550
A man who walks in the park with other men
dies in Maida Vale.

216
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,796
And you come to me?

217
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,719
As well as his diary,
we have his notebook.

218
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,034
Your time's up, Mr Stacker.

219
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,549
Thank you.

220
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,715
Hello, Mum.

221
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,919
This is Gina.

222
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,519
Gina Gray.

223
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,072
The captain married us on board.

224
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,718
She's my wife, Mum. At least look at her.

225
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,549
Tommy said to ask you
to tell me the truth.

226
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,234
We've been travelling for 15 days,
Mrs Gray.

227
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,759
Maybe we could talk about this
at another time.

228
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,790
Yes.

229
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,194
Let's go home and we can talk.

230
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,678
You have no home
until you tell me the truth.

231
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,234
Here?

232
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,271
Yeah.

233
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,274
Michael!

234
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,434
Hello, love.

235
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,992
Welcome to Birmingham, eh?

236
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,158
Michael?

237
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,835
OK.

238
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,196
Our ship docked at Belfast.

239
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,913
I was then taken off the ship by two men.

240
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,950
At gunpoint.

241
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,117
I'm speaking to my son.

242
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,389
Fuck you.

243
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,593
Fuck you too, Arthur.

244
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,271
This is my fucking wife.
I bring her home... To this?

245
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,356
Come on, Gina.

246
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,160
Well, where are you going now, eh? Hmm?

247
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,998
Introduce me at least.

248
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,316
- Excuse me.
- Look at this.

249
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,351
Look at this.

250
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,391
This is it, Gina.

251
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,672
This is my fucking people.

252
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,950
Do you want to know the truth, Arthur?

253
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,434
Do you want to know the truth, Mum?

254
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,033
I did not betray my fucking family!

255
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,391
Now, Mum...

256
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,875
...] want to go home.

257
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,593
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

258
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,435
Was that Tommy's orders, then, was it?

259
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,712
See, the Midland Hotel
is Tommy's little kingdom.

260
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,118
Where all the porters keep an eye,

261
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,710
where all the telephone exchange girls
are reporting on my calls.

262
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,109
Yeah, well, why don't you think of it
like, er, quarantine, Michael, eh?

263
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,710
We'll treat you like a fucking dog, hmm?

264
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,879
Smelly one.

265
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,274
Stinking one.

266
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,990
Until we know you're clean, hmm?

267
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,077
Fuck you, Arthur.

268
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,998
Stand aside, Arthur.

269
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,679
No, Poll.

270
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,595
Come on, baby.

271
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,438
Forget about 'em.

272
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,632
Go and phone Tommy, tell him.

273
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,479
Polly says Michael's telling the truth.

274
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,114
It's all right. Forget about 'em.

275
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,230
All right, Poll.

276
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,871
Nice coat.

277
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,798
What are you like? Camel, right?

278
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,678
Welcome to the family, Gina Gray.

279
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,549
I applaud the attempt by Mr Rowley
in the Education Bill

280
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,479
to raise the school leaving age to 15.

281
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,352
I also support...

282
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,514
...as regards means-testing of any kind,

283
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,233
- we are the people...
- Yeah!

284
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,318
- ...we've had enough.
- Yeah!

285
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,432
"We are the people,
and we've had enough.”

286
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,278
I move in favour of the amendment.

287
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,235
Mr Shelby.

288
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,311
I must say,
you sing like a songbird in the House.

289
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,116
And who is this pretty finch?

290
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,150
My sister.

291
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,315
Who's pregnant.

292
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,589
And dangerous.

293
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,280
Oh, we adore dangerous.

294
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,799
Who's we?

295
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,230
It's a collective noun,

296
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,513
in this case describing a group of people
who are impatient and young and,

297
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,075
as I have said, adore dangerous.

298
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,111
Mr Shelby, you had a horse of that name.

299
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,634
Whiskey. Irish.

300
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,149
Give him one from my bottle.

301
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,590
And one for myself.
In fact, bring the bottle.

302
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,716
And the lady?

303
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,353
Isn't thirsty.

304
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,118
How do you know about the horse?

305
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,037
We have a mutual acquaintance.

306
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,235
May Carleton.

307
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,149
When I asked about you, she said,
"Oh, my goodness, where do I begin?"

308
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,949
And why were you asking after me?

309
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,515
Because, as I have said,

310
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,472
I adore dangerous.

311
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,233
And where did she begin?

312
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,273
You know, I was rather hoping
we might have this meeting alone.

313
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,835
My sister is my political adviser.

314
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,316
And my advice just now was,
"Don't meet Mr Mosley."

315
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,238
Because I am dangerous?

316
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,237
No.

317
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,000
What is it you are impatient for,
Mr Mosley?

318
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,829
I'm impatient for my fucking whiskey.

319
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,629
Bennett!

320
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,911
May Carleton spoke about you

321
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,795
the way I imagine one might
about a party they barely remember,

322
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,719
where you crash the car
into the dovecote

323
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,196
and live on champagne and cocaine
for three whole days.

324
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,833
You know, that kind of party.

325
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,997
Only three days?

326
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,631
My sister advised against meeting you

327
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,197
because it appears
you are moving away from the party...

328
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,791
...in a different direction.

329
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,116
And which direction is that?

330
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,356
Towards fascism.

331
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,633
"We are the people,
and we have had enough.”

332
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,278
I thought that was excellent.

333
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,916
In which direction are you heading,
Mr Shelby?

334
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,759
I am my own revolution.

335
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,554
And you prefer Irish to Scotch.

336
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,709
As do 1.

337
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,720
Like all things regarding Ireland,
it is...complex.

338
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,875
Yes?

339
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,793
Where do you stand
on the Irish question, Mr Shelby?

340
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,639
Never been asked it.

341
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,956
Then perhaps it's time you were.

342
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,870
Tommy, I am the people,
and I have had enough.

343
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,560
We are looking for someone
to begin a dialogue...

344
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,956
...with certain elements in Belfast

345
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,913
with whom
we don't officially have any dealings.

346
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,476
I'll be too busy singing in the House.

347
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,716
It would involve a promotion.

348
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,751
Junior Minister to the Duchy of Lancaster.

349
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,558
Birmingham is my concern.

350
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,629
Ireland bores me.
Thanks for the whiskey, Mr Mosley.

351
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,636
What the fuck was that about?

352
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,798
Ireland. It's been Ireland's day
all fucking day long.

353
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,830
What do you mean?

354
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,555
Ada, go home and start calling
anyone who had dealings

355
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,149
with Shelby Company Limited
while you were in Boston.

356
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,429
Ask them about Michael.

357
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,191
Ask them what about him?

358
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,596
Who he's been seeing,
who he's been meeting,

359
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,394
- what deals he's made.
- Why?

360
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,071
Ask 'em especially about people
he's met from Glasgow or Belfast.

361
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,556
Tommy,
why don't you come back with me, eh?

362
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,557
You can play chess with Karl.

363
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,512
I'll make some calls,
you can listen in.

364
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,596
Drive home tomorrow.

365
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,314
That bastard starts talking
about Irish whiskey.

366
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,669
The fuck does he know? Eh?

367
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,633
More than me, Tommy.
What are you talking about?

368
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,912
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

369
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,236
My chair. My throne.

370
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,919
People thinking I'm gonna fall,

371
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,429
they start behaving
in a different way around you.

372
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,914
Who thinks that?

373
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,190
They start to circle.

374
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,311
Who's going to take the throne, eh?

375
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,750
Linda, she wants some for Arthur,

376
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,315
Aberama Gold, people in the north,
Michael...

377
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,192
Just go home, make some calls.

378
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,197
Protestants are coming, I think.

379
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,311
I need to get back to Birmingham.

380
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,833
Polly.

381
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,439
Are you armed?

382
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,711
Yeah.

383
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,035
Yeah.

384
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,470
Would you please consider
putting your weapons behind the bar

385
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,989
in case feelings begin to run high?

386
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,679
Behind the bar, Poll, eh?

387
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,718
Behind my own bar, yeah?

388
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,635
I prefer it there.

389
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,038
Thomas?

390
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,032
I had a dream...

391
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,596
...about a black cat last night, Poll.

392
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,916
A black cat dream
means there is a traitor close by.

393
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,678
It was you who taught me that.

394
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,189
Black cat can mean lots of things.

395
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,755
Can mean you're hurting yourself.

396
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,995
Betraying yourself.

397
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,676
Are you seeing things, Thomas?

398
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,195
Yes, I am.

399
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,429
Yes, I am. Very clearly.

400
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,958
Coming from every fucking direction.

401
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,310
Tommy.

402
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,677
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.

403
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,229
I would also like to, er, say something.

404
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,874
- Sit down, Michael.
- I betrayed you.

405
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,640
- Michael.
- But only in my heart.

406
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,433
There was a time,

407
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,994
in America,

408
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,430
and there was a lot of money in that bank.

409
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,676
And I wondered
if I could...I could leave,

410
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,711
move to California.

411
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,831
Someone said I should invest in pictures.

412
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,235
Hollywood.

413
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,914
But Gina stopped me.

414
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,198
- Gina said...
- I told you to sit down, Michael.

415
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,995
Now, tell me...

416
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,876
...what happened on that ship

417
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,718
in Belfast harbour.

418
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,911
On the journey back from New York,
we got married.

419
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,792
But we needed to find a witness.

420
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,115
A purser.

421
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,639
He was from Belfast.

422
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,830
We got friendly.

423
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,155
What happened when the ship docked?

424
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,117
This purser had friends who ran
a whiskey distillery in County Tyrone.

425
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,595
They wanted a way
of getting their stuff into America.

426
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,360
So I said, "OK, invite them aboard."

427
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,757
When they came in, I realised
that they didn't make whiskey.

428
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,712
They were Scottish. From Glasgow.

429
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,400
Couldn't understood
a fucking word they were saying.

430
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,034
They started swearing,

431
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,753
so I asked Gina to leave.

432
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,753
That was when they started talking
about you, Tom.

433
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,350
They said that Tommy Shelby
was a spent force,

434
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,676
that politics had got to him...

435
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,998
...that he was spent in the head,

436
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,680
that now was a good time to move in

437
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,791
and did I want to be part of it.

438
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,480
They knew about the money we lost
in America.

439
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,113
They said that you were going to blame me.

440
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,595
That you had a bullet with my name on it.

441
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,559
What did you say, Michael?

442
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,000
I didn't have time to say anything.

443
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,038
Coppers came on board.

444
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,434
Well, I thought they were coppers.

445
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,709
They, er...

446
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,759
They were IRA.

447
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,029
Exactly.

448
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,793
And the first men from Glasgow?

449
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,629
The IRA commander said the men
from Glasgow were called Billy Boys.

450
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,039
Fucking Billy Boys.

451
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,197
I don't know who the fuck Billy Boys are.

452
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:53,032
They run every man in every coalmine,
on every shipyard east of Glasgow.

453
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,119
Ties with Belfast, UVF.

454
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,072
Protestant razor gang.

455
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,033
They also dabble in politics.

456
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,472
You know, muscle for fascist rallies.

457
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,274
But you did no deal, Michael?

458
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,391
You didn't even know who they were?

459
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,239
I was too busy looking forward
to giving you the good news.

460
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,675
The reason Gina and I got married
on the ship was because Gina is pregnant.

461
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,037
You're going to be a grandmother.

462
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,754
OK, Michael.

463
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,714
I believe you.

464
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,160
Welcome home.

465
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,510
Congratulations.

466
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,637
Just remember...

467
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,231
Your unborn child has witnessed
what you said.

468
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,795
- Thomas!
- And it will be born according to...

469
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,910
You fuck!

470
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,396
Where the fuck are you going, hmm?

471
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,431
Are you fucking mad, hmm?

472
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,915
- You are free to fucking leave, Michael.
- You fucking bastard.

473
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,236
But you're not free, Michael, are you?

474
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,076
You lost this company a lot of money.

475
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,520
I told you to sell...

476
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,680
...but you held on,

477
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,510
and now I want you to pay me back
what you owe me.

478
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,793
There is work you can do,
there are risks you can take.

479
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,831
We were close before.

480
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,792
Now I want you closer still.

481
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,157
Michael, honey.

482
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,194
Look at your cousin.

483
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,794
He's in trouble, huh?

484
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,560
He needs you.

485
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,271
Come on, baby, let's go.

486
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,599
Fucking cheek of her, eh?

487
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,631
Mad Dog Jimmy.

488
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,831
Coming south.

489
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,113
Not so mad any more.

490
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,277
He's got friends in high places
these days.

491
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,590
Black cat dream is never wrong, brother.

492
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,190
Drop the peashooter, son.

493
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,112
A broken broom stops
all Gypsy curses, Mr Gold.

494
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,798
Who the fuck are you?

495
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,797
Did you not hear my song?

496
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,436
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.

497
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,398
And me?

498
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,195
I'm Jimmy.

499
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,994
Ah, fuck, fuck.

500
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,315
Good.

501
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,909
Mouth broke, so you can't talk.

502
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,509
But you don't need to.

503
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,359
Your body will be the lesson.

504
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,680
You work in a particular capacity
for Mr Thomas Shelby, OBE.

505
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,120
Am I right?

506
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,035
I heard you're a fighter.

507
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,030
The best.

508
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,394
But your fighting days are over.

509
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,595
Because I need Mr Shelby to understand...

510
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,997
...that his best...

511
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,432
...is not...good enough.

512
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,270
Bonnie!

513
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,870
Farewell, fighter boy. You died well.

514
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,391
Bonnie...

515
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,113
Bonnie!

516
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,390
Tell Tommy Shelby
it's time to fucking share.

517
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,553
We'll take all the tracks out
as far as Nottingham.

518
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,512
We'll take Cheltenham as well.

519
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,073
Otherwise, it will be Thomas Shelby
who's crucified,

520
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,794
and there will be no resurrection.

521
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,113
Come on, boys.

522
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,713
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to
take a short break. Thank you.

523
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,952
Yeah. Good man.

524
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,556
Beautiful, Billy, beautiful.
Really nice. Really nice.

525
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,231
Really meaningful, you know?
A heartfelt song.

526
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,079
I like it. I really do.

527
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,273
Boys, this here is Billy Grade.

528
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,999
Man I was telling you about, son.

529
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,430
- Billy, this here's my kid brother, Finn.
- Hey.

530
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,759
Have a drink, Billy.

531
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,154
I can't, my voice is...

532
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,590
Drink, Bill.

533
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,949
Yeah.

534
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,229
Yeah.

535
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,232
You boys won't remember...

536
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,240
...but I remember when Billy here
made a living on the football pitch.

537
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,869
Oh, yeah, that was a long time ago,
Mr Shelby.

538
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,513
- Yeah, what a left foot, eh?
- Yeah.

539
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,950
And then what? Manager, right? Hmm?

540
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,640
Well, yeah, and now I'm a singer.

541
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,909
Are you?

542
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,915
Every football team in England
knows Billy Grade.

543
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,795
And he knows a few people, too.
Don't you, Bill, eh? Hmm?

544
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,150
- One or two.
- Useful.

545
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,675
Very useful.

546
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,791
But what do you do, Bill, eh?

547
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,271
You're in here, singing -
or whatever the fuck you call it -

548
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,631
in shit-hole pubs in Birmingham.

549
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,876
It's no way to make a living, boys.

550
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,156
- Degrading.
- I love it.

551
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,430
I really do, I love it.

552
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,797
And thank you, by the way,
for inviting me here tonight.

553
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,479
I really appreciate it,
so thank you very much.

554
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,034
Don't thank me.

555
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,071
I didn't invite you here to sing.

556
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,592
If I wanted to listen to music,
I'd buy an Al Jolson record. Hmm?

557
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,870
That's what I'd do.

558
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,310
Real singer, you know?

559
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,919
Melody.

560
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,838
Tune.

561
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,639
So what is it that you want...exactly?

562
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,154
Finn will explain
the nature of my proposition.

563
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,791
You'll listen to him, won't you, Bill, eh?

564
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,639
- You'll be attentive, won't you?
- Yeah, of course, course.

565
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,670
Because Isiah here,

566
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,111
he'll show you the fucking consequences
if you don't.

567
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,829
All right?

568
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,196
I'll leave you with the bottle, hmm?

569
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,271
What proposition?

570
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,313
Right, what I want from you, Billy,

571
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,150
is for you to write down
a name and a number

572
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,920
next to every one of those football teams,
yeah?

573
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,713
- Why?
- Why?

574
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,797
People like to bet on those kind of things
these days.

575
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,036
- We are a gambling enterprise.
- I know who you are.

576
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,915
To fix a horse race,
you give the outsider a bit of cocaine.

577
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,792
- Jesus!
- To fix a football match,

578
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,275
you give the goalkeeper £20.

579
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,559
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Billy.

580
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,991
What have you got there?

581
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,880
I've written a letter.

582
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,874
Who for?

583
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,752
For you.

584
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,917
And Lizzie's written one to Tommy.

585
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,989
Well...

586
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,440
...can I read it?

587
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,959
It's not finished yet.

588
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,430
I'm getting rid of the parts
I wrote when I was drunk.

589
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,071
By the way, I've stopped drinking.

590
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,033
And your bottles of snow
I poured down the lavatory.

591
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,312
When I was drunk, I was too hard on you.

592
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,953
It's...it's not your fault.

593
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,514
So...

594
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,432
That letter's about me, is it?

595
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,630
Yeah.

596
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,718
And about me.

597
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,871
About the future. About the company.

598
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,990
Lizzie and I...

599
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,238
Sat here and made things worse
the last few hours, hmm?

600
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,351
Yeah, and we've come up with a plan.

601
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,517
Oh, you've come up with a plan, eh?

602
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,234
Lizzie says Tommy won't live
two more years if he carries on like this.

603
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,270
He's gone too far.

604
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,959
Is that what Lizzie says, hmm?

605
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,229
Really now?

606
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,000
Well, how far has he gone, hmm, Linda?
How far?

607
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,316
He's lost all the legitimate money
in America.

608
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,670
No. No, that was Michael.

609
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,679
He's fixing races. He's fixing football.

610
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,713
Following the financial crisis,
the Shelby Company Limited

611
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,037
has to find other sources of cash income.

612
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,833
Tommy went into Chinatown.

613
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,430
He's selling out the Communists
to the British intelligence.

614
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,313
And all the time, every day,
he gets more and more famous.

615
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,635
But that's OK.

616
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,910
Because if anyone puts
two and two together...

617
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,235
That wasn't us.

618
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,919
It's not fucking us!

619
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,793
It's going to blow up, Arthur!
It can't sustain.

620
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,275
- You know it.
- Oh, yeah? And what do you know, eh?

621
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,959
You've worked it all out.

622
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,117
You and fucking Lizzie, eh?

623
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,835
Got it all planned out, is that right?

624
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,031
And I tell you,

625
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,119
all you're gonna do
is you're gonna be the good fucking wife.

626
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,914
Yeah, like the perfect couple.

627
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,031
We'll go upstairs, hmm?

628
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,754
We'll go upstairs.

629
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,394
Yeah, make love, hmm?

630
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,510
I spent my day writing two letters
and deciding which one to give.

631
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,432
Looks like I'll have to give
the other one.

632
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,474
What other one?

633
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,437
What fucking other one?!

634
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,999
What did you do with my letter?

635
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,429
I burnt it.

636
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,669
So did Arthur.

637
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,354
- Did you read it first?
- Yes.

638
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,834
That's more than Arthur did.

639
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,717
Didn't help that you can't fucking spell.

640
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,953
I left school too early.

641
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,197
Did you read the bit about the lawyers?

642
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,469
Do you want to fuck?

643
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,035
Didn't think so.

644
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,318
- You don't want to eat?
- No.

645
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,840
- You've got calls?
- Yeah.

646
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,677
It's Ruby's birthday today, Tommy.

647
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,953
Do you know why I took her to Arthur's?

648
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,832
Because she said she's scared of you.

649
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,359
When she knows you're not coming home,
she's a different kid.

650
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,993
But I've bought a cake.

651
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,349
And I want you there.

652
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,749
We're in the drawing room.

653
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,310
Lizzie...

654
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,160
I'minaroom...

655
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,597
...and they're coming at me.

656
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,478
It's OK. I want 'em to.

657
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,033
Last thing I want is silence.

658
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,918
Standing up there, in silence,

659
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,360
and someone Says...

660
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,675
..."Sorry about all that noise.

661
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,236
"Sorry about all that...dust.

662
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,351
"Sorry about all that mud.

663
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,517
"And all that fucking blood."

664
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,390
And you say, "Don't be sorry.

665
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,511
"Don't be sorry. It's all I can do now."

666
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,116
You want me to write this down?

667
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,837
Do you want me
to write you a fucking letter?

668
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,518
Me and Arthur can't write it down...

669
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,310
...cos they haven't invented
the fucking words.

670
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,396
We don't have the fucking words.

671
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,114
And the worst thing is...

672
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,753
...could've stayed at school.

673
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,151
But we volunteered.

674
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,316
Still don't have the fucking words.

675
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,517
Should you choose to depart, Tommy,

676
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,916
either by your own hand
or someone else"s,

677
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,600
the person who would take your place
is me.

678
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,029
Legally.

679
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,798
Financially.

680
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,990
Everything.

681
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,038
I need to know there'll be something left.

682
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,392
Well, you know, Lizzie, in my head,
I still pay you for it, so...

683
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,273
...good luck with me.

684
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,513
I have business.

685
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,077
Yeah, I wanna ask you some questions...

686
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,430
...about the night you met Michael Gray.

687
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,353
Make a wish.

688
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,073
Yeah!

689
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,271
OK, kids, come on, let's go to bed.
Quickly.

690
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,799
- Why?
- Who's coming?

691
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,117
That's the thing, Charles, we don't know.
We never know.

692
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,549
Tommy!

693
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,357
- Get out of the fucking car.
- Don't!

694
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,075
Get out of the fucking car now,
or I'll open fire!

695
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,877
If you're looking for traitors,

696
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,198
there's one...with his ribs mashed up.

697
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,438
The man's gone fucking mad, Tom!

698
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,597
You did this?

699
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,677
With one arm and a hammer.

700
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,549
And a mighty pain...and a mighty fury!

701
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,919
They killed him.

702
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,235
My son!

703
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,756
They shot him and they put him
up on a fucking cross,

704
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,553
and he's fucking dead!

705
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,920
Who did?

706
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,231
Only Johnny Dogs and his kin knew
where we were camped.

707
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,920
No, Tom. No.
I swear to God, I never told a soul.

708
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,554
- Get the fuck away!
- I never told a fucking soul.

709
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,433
How could you fucking do this?!
My fucking son!

710
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,073
They fucking took him from me!

711
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,591
My only...son!

712
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,869
Johnny!

713
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,559
Tommy!

714
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,432
Your shoulder is shattered.

715
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,870
If you don't get it fixed,
you'll lose your arm.

716
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,435
He's gone! Fucking killed him!

717
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,473
Fucking son! My own fucking kin!

718
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,954
Listen to me!

719
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,392
How can a one-armed man
avenge the death of his son, eh?

720
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,310
They crucified my son...

721
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,709
...for you.

722
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,433
Get away from my house! All of you!

723
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,235
Get away from my child!

724
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,670
This is my house.

725
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,950
And I don't want you back.

726
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,151
I don't want you back!

727
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,318
If you want to take on the Billy Boys,

728
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,510
you need me alive.

729
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,996
Everyone fucking needs me.

730
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,871
Call an ambulance,

731
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,674
or a man will lose his arm.

732
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,119
Come on, Johnny.

733
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,470
Come on.

734
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,150
Tom...

735
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,557
I'm no black cat, Tom.

736
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,512
I know, Johnny. I know.

737
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,913
In all the world, of all of the people,

738
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,951
you alone I know I can trust.
