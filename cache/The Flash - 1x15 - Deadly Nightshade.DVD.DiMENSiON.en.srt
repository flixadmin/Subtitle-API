1
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,895
Sing it, comrades.

2
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:44,133
Brothers and sisters,
the revolution will be televised.

3
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,541
<i>Since the weekend kidnapping</i>
<i>of heiress Felicia Kane...</i>

4
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,584
<i>... by the so-called</i>
<i>Libertarian People's Army...</i>

5
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,855
Shut up! I wanna hear this.

6
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,251
- <i>to no avail.</i>

7
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,451
<i>The manhunt funded in part</i>
<i>by her newspaper magnate grandfather.</i>

8
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,524
So, what do you think of that,
bourgeois tramp?

9
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,129
Instead of blowing all that dough
on a manhunt...

10
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,826
...your family should be ready
to pay for you back now.

11
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,972
In one piece.

12
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,143
- <i>Central City Police.</i>
- Lt. Garfield, please.

13
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,111
<i>It's a call for you, Lt. Garfield.</i>

14
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,012
This is the call we've been
waiting for. Let's nail this.

15
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,777
- You ready?
- Just keep him talking.

16
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,887
We need time to run the trace.

17
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,450
- This is Garfield.
- Hello again.

18
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,024
So here's the deal.

19
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,287
Three million dollars.

20
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:41,366
Small bills. And freedom for our comrades
held as political prisoners.

21
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,001
"Political prisoners."

22
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,796
Three of these guys held up
a laundromat.

23
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,036
Let me speak to Felicia.

24
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,643
Let's cut to the chase, Warren.

25
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,871
If this deb's not worth the cash
to mumsie and popsie now...

26
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,644
...let's see how they feel about her
after we ship her back to you in pieces.

27
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,921
Okay. No pieces.
Slow down, Steve. Slow down.

28
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,226
Fear me, death merchants.

29
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,332
What the hell are you?

30
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,531
Justice.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,839
What the hell is going on there?

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,921
- Mendez, where's my trace?
- Got it. Got it.

33
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,717
It's on the 400 block
of Ramoca and Burrough.

34
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,794
I want squad cars there now,
damn it. Let's go.

35
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,822
Come on, come on!

36
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,853
Relax, Ms. Kane.

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,658
There will be someone here to help you.

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,262
Get...! Get away...!

39
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,408
Who could have done this?

40
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,753
I'm Dr. Rebecca Frost.
I have an appointment.

41
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,861
- Oh, I'm sorry. After you.
- No. After you.

42
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,970
Well, I'm in here.

43
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,637
Small world. So am I.

44
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,679
Yes, I know we can't have this kind
of bloodshed in our city.

45
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,041
Yes, ma'am. I'm on it.

46
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,480
Allen, Dr. Frost.

47
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,089
Dr. Rebecca Frost,
Felicia Kane's psychiatrist? Barry Allen.

48
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,251
- Lieutenant.
- Do you have those test results for me?

49
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,464
No positive I.D.
Ballistics says the shells are untraceable.

50
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,429
Our killer knows
where to buy his toys.

51
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,433
Excuse me. If you don't mind,
I have a busy schedule.

52
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,900
The hospital says Ms. Kane
is no longer in shock.

53
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,803
Why can't we talk to her?

54
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,068
My patient's been through
a major trauma.

55
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,872
First the kidnapping,
then the murder of her abductors.

56
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:52,641
The only coherent thing she said so far
is "the Flash." Repeatedly.

57
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,815
Well, I'm sure the Flash is no killer.

58
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,046
The Flash is a masked vigilante.

59
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,357
Probably an unstable personality.

60
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,250
I don't buy it.

61
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,959
The Flash has never shown
any homicidal tendencies.

62
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,325
He's saved a few lives,
including my own.

63
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,194
What do you know about the Flash?

64
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,495
Nothing. That's what
makes him dangerous.

65
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,035
He's helped this city.

66
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,230
It's no big shock
the police envy the Flash.

67
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,672
He's free of the bureaucratic restraints
that hold you in check.

68
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,874
With all due respect, Dr. Frost...

69
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,344
...as soon as Ms. Kane is lucid,
you let me know.

70
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,608
She's our only witness.

71
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,320
You'll hear from me.

72
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,389
It's nice to see the police
are so compassionate.

73
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,464
Joe Kline, voice of the city.
My guests today...

74
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:48,630
...psychiatrist Rebecca Frost
and radical lawyer Chesley Keefe...

75
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,709
...who represents what's left
of the Libertarian People's Army.

76
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,571
Our topic, the aftermath
of the Felicia Kane kidnapping.

77
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,682
Dr. Frost, is it really possible
that the Flash...

78
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,977
...is responsible for the massacre
of the LPA?

79
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,186
I believe he's lost his capacity
to tell right from wrong.

80
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,722
Come on.

81
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,486
The Flash is clearly a tool
of Felicia's father...

82
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,653
...unhappy that his daughter had joined
my clients' cause.

83
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,459
My patient was kidnapped
and brutally assaulted...

84
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,226
...by your so-called People's Army.

85
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,098
She joined the People's Army
of her own free will...

86
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,365
...guilt-ridden that her family
had raped the working classes.

87
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,111
You're overlooking
the possibility the Flash saved her life.

88
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,805
<i>Whatever his extraordinary speed...</i>

89
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,941
<i>... the Flash is playing out</i>
<i>a macho adolescent fantasy.</i>

90
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,781
Oh, boy.

91
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,658
<i>With all its problems, does Central City</i>
<i>really need a self-appointed...</i>

92
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,058
<i>... guardian angel?</i>
<i>A masked man...</i>

93
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,230
<i>... who should be under observation,</i>
<i>not on the streets.</i>

94
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,698
- Overeducated twit!
- Yeah, what is this?

95
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,830
Just when I thought
I was starting to get respect...

96
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,270
...suddenly I'm a killer,
a psychotic time bomb?

97
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,932
Why, because she said so?

98
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,442
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

99
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,047
Barry, it's only TV. Bad TV.

100
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,750
She's no more than
a rich girl's overpaid therapist...

101
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,783
...rattling her saber for the clientele.

102
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,445
"Macho, adolescent fantasy."

103
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:14,753
Psychobabble buzzwords.
Barry, you shouldn't let it bother you.

104
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,861
I know, I know. I shouldn't.

105
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,731
But you never knew me
before the accident.

106
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,799
I always finished second.
Second to Dad, second to Jay.

107
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,667
I was always in their shadow.

108
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,136
That has nothing to do
with your being the Flash.

109
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:32,675
Well, now, wait. Maybe it has everything
to do with it.

110
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,773
Now no one can keep up with me.

111
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,278
I used to haunt the lab.

112
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,974
It was the only place I was in control.

113
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,445
Now it feels cramped... confined.

114
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,820
I have this overwhelming need
for space, for speed.

115
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,561
The accident changed me.

116
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,490
Maybe more than I know.

117
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:01,063
But I do not lie awake at night
wondering if I'm gonna lose control.

118
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,303
I don't lose sleep over that either, Barry.

119
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,805
But I have to admit...

120
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:10,108
...I can never fully understand
what it is like to do the things you do.

121
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,647
But there is someone who does know.

122
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,111
Maybe you should talk to Dr. Powell.

123
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,683
The Nightshade?

124
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,297
Whatever did you hope
to accomplish with that...

125
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:39,034
...that performance on Joe Kline's show?

126
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,646
I thought I might be a voice
of reason, Dr. Powell.

127
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,442
This vigilante thing is a real problem.

128
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,878
I'm simply asking you to be careful.

129
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,612
As a member of my staff...

130
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:54,852
...your media profile reflects
on the hospital, for better or worse.

131
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:03,899
- How's Ms. Kane?
- She's coming along. Slowly.

132
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,433
Yes?

133
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,467
I was in town, I figured I'd drop off
the foundation check personally.

134
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,202
Thank you.

135
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,538
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

136
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,513
- No, Curt. How was Munich?
- The usual.

137
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,812
Closed a few trade deals,
picked up a few pointers.

138
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,252
Curtis Bohannan, Dr. Rebecca Frost.

139
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,792
As in the Bohannan psychiatric wing,
or the Bohannan scandal?

140
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,394
Both, I'm afraid.

141
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,830
Despite his blue blood, Dad was quite
the mobster in the '50s.

142
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,126
Made a lot of money
hurting a lot of people.

143
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,665
The psychiatric wing
is one way I've tried...

144
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,934
...to make amends
for Dad's indiscretions.

145
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,443
Well, on behalf of the department,
thank you.

146
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,078
I saw you on the Kline show.
I think you're wrong.

147
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,151
The Flash didn't slaughter the LPA.

148
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,914
I'm with you there, Curt.
The Flash is no killer.

149
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,024
Are you saying the Flash
isn't a borderline case?

150
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,821
I'm saying there are more ways
to look at the world than your own.

151
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,487
I don't understand
how two civilized adults...

152
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,033
...can condone the acts of vigilantism
committed by the Flash.

153
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,129
Oh, God...

154
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,705
I completely forgot about my 3:00.

155
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,141
Dr. Frost...

156
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,239
...are you free for dinner sometime?
- Oh, thank you, no.

157
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,348
I'm much too busy right now.

158
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,184
Well, you can't fault me for trying.

159
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,012
Later, Des.

160
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,923
<i>Is this Dr. Powell?</i>

161
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,925
- Yeah, it's Powell.
- <i>Dr. Powell, it's the Flash.</i>

162
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,663
Funny you should call just now.

163
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,801
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>
<i>Where can we meet?</i>

164
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,731
- Same place.
- <i>What time?</i>

165
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,270
- You name the time, I'll be there.
- <i>Eight p.m.</i>

166
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,373
- <i>We have a lot to talk about.</i>
- All right.

167
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,839
<i>So, folks, it seems a distinct and</i>
<i>disappointing possibility that the Flash...</i>

168
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,749
<i>... has crossed the line from masked</i>
<i>adventurer to executioner.</i>

169
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,049
- <i>And given the good he's done the city</i>...
- No.

170
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:14,532
- <i>the Flash has crossed the line</i>
<i>from masked adventurer to executioner.</i>

171
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,029
It wasn't the Flash.

172
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,603
I rid this city of those parasites.

173
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,108
<i>WCCN.</i>

174
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,738
I'm the man who cleansed the streets
of the Libertarian People's Army.

175
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,449
- I want to speak with Mr. Kline.
- <i>You and every other lunatic in town.</i>

176
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,021
<i>You wanna leave a number</i>
<i>or the name of the dog</i>...<i>?</i>

177
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,714
No, you buffoon.

178
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,793
If you value your job, you won't
let Kline know it was you...

179
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,260
...that wouldn't put me through.

180
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,262
I'll get to you, Kline.

181
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,070
And then you'll listen.

182
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,327
Must you do that?

183
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,757
I need to talk.

184
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,091
Yeah, you sounded concerned...

185
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,390
...Barry.

186
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,795
You don't seem surprised.

187
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,734
Not really. I always suspected
you were the Flash.

188
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,307
I'm flattered that you trust me this much.

189
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,670
You saved my life.

190
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,741
And you're the only other person I know
who wears the mask.

191
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,851
Oh, no. Wore. I came out of retirement
for that Ghost business.

192
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,954
Thought I was 25 again.

193
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,085
No...

194
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,053
Nightshade is ancient history.

195
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,527
- Nostalgia didn't bring you here.
- Dr. Powell...

196
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,059
...is Rebecca Frost right?

197
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,426
Am I wrong to put myself
outside the law?

198
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,198
Rebecca is well intentioned...

199
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,342
...but sometimes she can be
a real pain in the butt.

200
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,042
This is for you.
I stopped at the market.

201
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,815
I know how you get...

202
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,248
...and I don't keep
a well-stocked fridge anymore.

203
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,077
Thanks.

204
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,718
I mean, how sane can I be...

205
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,387
...you know, running around
playing guardian angel?

206
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:30,123
As long as you're questioning
your sanity, you still have it.

207
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:36,033
The problem with wearing the mask is,
it's easy to lose your identity.

208
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:40,174
You think you're invincible,
that you can get away with anything.

209
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,678
- Including murder.
- But you used tranquilizer darts.

210
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,216
I never set myself up as judge,
jury and executioner.

211
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,080
Corny as it sounds,
I still believe in the system.

212
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,487
Same here.

213
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,057
Unlike whoever took down the LPA.

214
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,626
Well, I have to find the killer.
Are you with me?

215
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,663
No. I'm too old for this.

216
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:08,273
But I have been on the case
since Rebecca was on the Kline show.

217
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,442
Felicia's dad is rich enough
to have hired his own people...

218
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,238
...to look for his daughter.
Real professionals.

219
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:19,612
Then again, the LPA killing
might have nothing to do with the Kanes.

220
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,987
I'll check the dives,
talk to my street contacts...

221
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,523
...see if anyone's been out
recruiting hit men.

222
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,533
Boy, let me tell you, Johnny...

223
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,039
...this is my kind of place.

224
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,944
If anybody ever told
me that Double-decker Johnny...

225
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,910
...had gone straight,
I'd laugh right in their face.

226
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,415
Swear to God, boss.
I am a solid citizen.

227
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,576
This whole joint
is a hundred percent legit.

228
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,518
You realize everyone had you
figured for running this joint.

229
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,024
That was Boss Bohannan's territory.
I just worked for him.

230
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,287
Ran his numbers racket, stuff like that.

231
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,158
Until Nightshade busted us up.

232
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,597
Guys like him and the Flash are always
ruining it for guys like us.

233
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,959
To you.

234
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,476
- Double-decker Johnny?
- Yeah. That's me.

235
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,078
Your crimes have finally
caught up with you.

236
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:27,583
Hey, I did my 20 years.
You got some beef, let's talk it over.

237
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,984
The highway to hell is paved with talk.

238
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,420
Actions speak louder than words.

239
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,465
Johnny!

240
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,600
They shot Johnny. Get an ambulance.

241
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:54,178
Help, somebody! They killed Johnny.
For God's sake, please, quick!

242
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,744
<i>Central's criminal community spent</i>

Don't any of you ever knock?

Sorry. I was in the building.

246
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,656
Forensics in the Double-decker killing.
The slugs match the LPA massacre.

247
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,554
If only I had been there
a moment sooner.

248
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,458
It stinks sometimes, knowing
that you can't save everyone.

- Much better. Thank you.
- Good.

263
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,288
Have you spoken with the police yet?

264
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,448
She wasn't ready.
I think in a few days...

265
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,060
It wasn't the Flash. It wasn't.

266
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,829
It was something else.

267
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,532
It was horrible.

268
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,501
All in black, with glowing red eyes.

269
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,469
And the guns.

270
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,903
And the blood.
Everybody's dead.

271
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,669
- It's okay.
- Everybody's dead.

272
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,368
It's okay.

273
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,344
Why don't we go back
to your room, okay?

274
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,949
Let's go. Come on.

275
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,646
First the Flash, now this Nightshade.

276
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,652
These masked men are turning
this city into a war zone.

277
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:40,708
- Sorry.
- No, it's me, really.

278
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,671
Work has made me crazy lately.

279
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,315
Yeah.

"<i>Love's Smoldering Flames</i>"?

281
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,918
Nice cover.

282
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,214
So, what brings you back?

283
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,586
Just can't get enough of us
law-and-order types?

284
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,422
Chief Cooper asked me
to come in as psychiatric advisor...

285
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,530
...on this deadly Nightshade case.

286
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,861
I specialize in sociopathic disorders.
Thank you.

287
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,436
So I guess that Nightshade video proves
that you're wrong about the Flash.

288
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,368
Are you the public defender too?

289
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,440
Look, the Flash may be innocent,
but that doesn't mean he's not disturbed.

290
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,875
I've always thought of him
as a concerned citizen.

291
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,642
- Excuse me, I have an appointment.
- And I've got a job to do.

292
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,882
What?

293
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,819
- What?
- You two make an interesting couple.

294
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,421
Stop.

295
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,829
- What are you doing?
- Some mobster's...

296
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,668
...using the name of Nightshade
to justify a bloodbath.

297
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,570
I've gotta clear my name.

298
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,843
I know how you feel,
but I can handle it.

299
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,412
Nope. This is my fight now.

300
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,708
This deadly Nightshade taints my past.

301
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,978
The police have an APB out
for the Nightshade.

302
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,554
They don't know it's an imposter.
They're after you.

303
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,248
You coming?

304
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,196
Thursday the 14th.

305
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,341
Begin recording now.

306
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:54,338
I have taken measures to prepare
for battle with the Flash...

307
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,447
...should such a time come.

308
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:01,074
Central City has become an abyss
of darkness and fear...

309
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,355
...under the heel of a criminal horde.

310
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:09,655
The first Nightshade delivered justice
to gangland.

311
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,156
I will pay for my father's sins.

312
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,296
I will hunt down the jackals...

313
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,131
...hiding in the ivory towers
of the constitution.

314
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,008
The hucksters
who let the guilty run free.

315
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,827
Next time just tell me
where we're headed.

316
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,226
The hell with that.

317
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,134
Then you'd end up beating me here.

318
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:54,671
When I go to this much trouble,
I wanna get my money's worth.

319
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:58,674
How do you suppose the Double-decker
Johnny killing figures into all this?

320
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,072
I'm not sure.

321
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,975
I nailed him in that west side
real estate scam back in the '50s...

322
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,879
...when I took down Derek Bohannan
and his gang.

323
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,282
I used to have a stoolie
that hung out here...

324
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,820
...by the name of Fosnight.

325
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,753
I'll go around back.

326
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,824
To Johnny!

327
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,963
Yeah, poor Johnny.
He straightens out and gets this.

328
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,430
- It ain't the old days.
- No kidding.

329
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,867
That Nightshade's nuts, walking in here
and doing John like that.

330
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,666
You got that right, Pearl.
We're all afraid to work.

331
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:35,001
Until this Nightshade's history again,
I ain't even gonna jaywalk.

332
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,111
I want answers!

333
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,782
And I need them now.

334
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,289
You look like my second husband. Eddie.

335
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,125
Only naked.

336
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,259
I said I want answers.

337
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,656
Relax. You're the least of our worries.

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,060
Nightshade's popped half a dozen
small-timers last week.

339
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,802
I hope you're here
to protect us from him.

340
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,067
- This killer's an imposter.
- That's right.

341
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,205
No need for protection from me,
Pearl.

342
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,073
Not from the original.

343
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,647
We're all too old
to be adversaries anymore.

344
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,883
Let it be. Fosnight.

345
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,418
Long time since I brought you down.

346
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,660
Short conning for Gorilla
out of Hell Town.

347
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,290
Yeah. Took one of your tranq bullets.

348
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,860
I slept for three days.

349
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,232
At least I woke up.

350
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,667
This guy who's claiming to be you...

351
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,067
...he's another story.

352
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,708
But why kill Double-decker?
I heard he went straight.

353
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,277
Like an arrow. This Nightshade
imposter's got snakes in his head.

354
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,945
I'll leave you here.

355
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,709
I know a way to get a profile on
just the kind of man we're looking for.

356
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,355
He ought to slow down.
He's gonna give himself a coronary.

357
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,219
So, what are you drinking?

358
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,861
Listen, do you need
a straw with that thing?

359
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,470
Here you are, Mr. Keefe.

360
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:23,115
Why here and not the station?

361
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,755
Strictly professional.

362
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,186
Don't be nervous. I just get
a little tired of dinner in a bag.

363
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,794
Now there's one thing
we can certainly agree on.

364
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,394
Too many dinners at the desk
the past few weeks.

365
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,132
Here.

366
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,736
Oh, I am starving.

367
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,634
Now, I've tallied the data up
and I think there's some interesting...

368
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,037
- Hold it.
- Excuse me?

369
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,439
You just sat down.

370
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:51,139
You're digging in your files already.
Are you always like this?

371
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,848
No, of course not.
It's just that...

372
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,112
- What?
- I'm very protective of my patients.

373
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,949
To be honest with you, the kidnapping
was very hard for me to deal with.

374
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,089
I understand.

375
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,595
Okay.

376
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,924
If our brief moment of personal
revelation is concluded...

377
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,801
...l've got a pretty solid take on both
the Nightshade and the Flash.

378
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,569
- The Flash has no part in this.
- Do you want what I've got or not?

379
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,944
Now, they're both
classic overachievers...

380
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,948
...looking for affection they didn't get
from their parents.

381
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,211
The costume is a blatant cry
for attention.

382
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,615
Oh, come on.

383
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,822
This misplaced civic virtue
is often triggered...

384
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,755
...by the loss of a parent or sibling.

385
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,723
In this case, most likely a violent crime.

386
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:44,662
Conceivably, it's guilt
over his own behavior that...

387
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:47,236
The Flash.

388
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,338
Thank you.

389
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,636
I should have guessed.

390
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,484
Now, I mean, it's all supposition,
but I think...

391
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,248
I was right.
He is in your pocket.

392
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,983
- What are you talking about?
- Don't be coy.

393
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,295
What do you think,
giving me all that hassle, Dr. Frost?

394
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:16,829
You say the Flash isn't working
for Felicia Kane's family.

395
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,998
You're sitting right here...

396
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,985
Barry?

397
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,856
Nasty little...

398
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,967
Oh, God.

399
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,401
He's dead.

400
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,373
Thank God no one else got hurt.

401
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,026
<i>A judicial system that allows legal pimps</i>
<i>like Chesley Keefe to flourish...</i>

402
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,793
<i>... has created a criminal class...</i>

403
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:28,598
<i>... too dense to prosecute</i>
<i>and too powerful to contain.</i>

404
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,530
<i>But no more.</i>

405
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,770
<i>No one is safe.</i>

406
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,945
<i>Not the punks, not the wise guys.</i>

407
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,106
<i>Nor the lawyers protecting</i>
<i>these scum.</i>

408
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,347
<i>Pray for the guilty.</i>

409
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,255
<i>Pray for a life, pal. Nobody loved</i>
<i>Chesley Keefe, but the system says</i>...

410
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,950
...we're all entitled
to legal representation...

411
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,993
...scums and saints alike.

412
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,131
But this Nightshade is a wanton killer.

413
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,429
A fascist terrorist with the means
to carry out his own bloody agenda.

414
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,136
<i>He's no better than those he seeks</i>
<i>to eliminate.</i>

415
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,934
<i>That's the way it looks from here.</i>
<i>I'm Joe Kline:</i>

416
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,440
<i>Voice of the city.</i>

417
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,477
You'll pay for that, Kline.

418
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,343
It came from
a German weapons manufacturer.

419
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,985
No help from them.
Their clients pay for privacy.

420
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,518
You do your homework, pal.

421
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,088
Our friend certainly knows
where to buy his weapons.

422
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,485
Hey, guys, come on.

423
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,593
I came here of my own free will.
How about losing the blindfold?

424
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,060
- I'll be good.
- Not part of the deal.

425
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,631
- Not a chance.
- Do a guy a favor and what do you get?

426
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,165
Treated like a street punk.

427
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,166
What did you bust
Double-decker Johnny for?

428
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,965
Real estate scam.
Bohannan's father was behind it.

429
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,576
Johnny gets 20 for the swindle
and Bohannan walks. Why?

430
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,540
He had a hotshot lawyer.

431
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,745
Fosnight, who represented Bohannan?

432
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,349
Oh, jeez, that goes way back...

433
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,918
Chesley Keefe.

434
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,748
He was a real pistol back then.

435
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,947
This all goes back
to the Bohannan business.

436
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,887
The son of one of Bohannan's victims?

437
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,357
No, this has to be someone
with resources.

438
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,929
Someone hurt by the whole crime.

439
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,528
Curt Bohannan has spent
his entire life and fortune...

440
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,966
...atoning for the actions
of his father.

441
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,333
You're saying the richest man
in Central City...

442
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,168
...is playing executioner?

443
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,309
Bohannan just came back
from Germany...

444
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,639
...same place these spikes are found.

445
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,305
The deadly Nightshade
is a costly enterprise.

446
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,951
Then let's pay a social call.

447
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,812
- Drop you somewhere, Fosnight?
- Yeah. Thanks.

448
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,253
I'll ride with Nightshade.
You're a little fast for me.

449
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,859
Come on.

450
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,225
If you'd wait for me once in a while...

451
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,066
After you.

452
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,162
You should stay in better shape.

453
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,461
Did you really search every room
in this mansion already?

454
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,631
Twice. And I found
the secret passage in here.

455
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,675
Kind of puts your garage to shame,
doesn't it?

456
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,177
Do you have a headquarters?

457
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,680
On my salary, an apartment.

458
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,853
What is this?

459
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,955
Some kind of super marionette?

460
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,354
What did you find?

461
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,720
Scrapbook of my exploits.

462
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,387
"Nightshade puts aviator in a tailspin."

463
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,693
"Police blast Nightshade vigilante tactics."

464
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,498
God, I haven't thought
about these in years.

465
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:22,795
Here it is.

466
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,636
- This guy's crazy about me.
- Or just crazy.

467
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,847
The original Nightshade
takes down Bohannan, Sr.

468
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,778
Now junior wants to become you.

469
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,748
What puzzles me...

470
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,786
...is why Curt Bohannan
waited until now...

471
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,947
...to start this deadly
Nightshade business.

472
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,821
Maybe your reappearance
as the Nightshade triggered it.

473
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,258
Wait.

474
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,055
This tape is dated today.

475
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,135
<i>Joe Kline's public opposition</i>
<i>to my crusade...</i>

476
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,575
<i>... shows he's clearly a puppet</i>
<i>of the criminal narcotic axis.</i>

477
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:06,145
<i>Like his audience,</i>
<i>I was duped into trusting him.</i>

478
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,344
<i>For the sake of the city,</i>
<i>Kline must be eliminated today.</i>

479
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,648
Kline's show is live at 10.

480
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,959
Mr. Kline, this city will remain
a solid knot of paranoia...

481
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,605
...as long as the deadly
Nightshade roams the streets.

482
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,297
That's a very interesting theory.

483
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,569
But what do you think it is that drives
a man so far over the line?

484
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,077
What's that?

485
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,276
What drives me, Kline?

486
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,281
A chance to cleanse the earth
of criminal filth.

487
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,953
Keep those cameras here.

488
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:52,160
Here's your chance, Kline.
Confess your misdeeds.

489
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,423
How about confessing yourself,
Nightshade?

490
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,324
If we could just talk.

491
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,002
I don't think it's a good idea
to antagonize him now.

492
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,334
Your day will come soon enough.
You'll see that I'm right.

493
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,910
Get down!

494
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,325
I'm the only man who can save
this city from itself.

495
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,223
I am the Nightshade.

496
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,225
Get me coverage of all of this.

497
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,905
Dr. Frost said that you were a killer.
Would you like to respond?

498
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,170
Get that mike out of my face.

499
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:45,008
Then how about sharing the real you
with our audience?

500
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,521
Ask his agent.

501
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:55,985
He got me in the leg.

502
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:01,055
See, I told you.
You should have waited for me.

503
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,630
I didn't kill him. He's just gonna be
asleep for a while.

504
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,101
"May 17th, 1955.

505
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,935
We're receiving pressure
from the mayor's office...

506
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:43,562
...to stop this masked man
the newspapers call Nightshade.

507
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,137
I have chosen not to do so.

508
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,541
His work has put a number
of criminals in jail...

509
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:54,151
...and I count him on our side
in spirit, if not in uniform.

510
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:58,716
I have my suspicions as to
the Nightshade's identity.

511
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,791
I will not expose him.

512
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,585
I leave it to the discretion
of those who follow me...

513
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,993
...as police captain. Julius Schwartz."

514
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,472
Good Lord.

515
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,308
Des.

516
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,610
Easy.

517
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,883
Your capacity for healing
is unbelievable.

518
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,552
Believe it.

519
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,323
But believe me,
it still hurts like living hell.

520
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,129
Not bad...

521
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,462
...having another doctor on call.

522
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,637
I wasn't so lucky.

523
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,400
I had to do most
of my own doctoring...

524
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:56,240
...which was a real drag, considering
how many scrapes I got myself into.

525
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,041
Bohannan is probably in hiding.

526
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,446
All right.

527
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,745
I'll find him. You stay put.

528
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,821
Which is exactly what
you should be doing.

529
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,120
Even with your four-star metabolism,
you took a real beating out there.

530
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,991
Half speed. All right?
I'll add 30 seconds to my travel time.

531
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,032
Youth is wasted on the young.

532
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:21,627
Lieutenant.

533
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:26,666
Warren. I haven't seen you in weeks.
Where have you been hiding?

534
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,137
I'm sorry, Des.

535
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,649
I can hardly believe this. But...

536
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,149
What? What is it?

537
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,987
We have evidence that you're Nightshade.
I'm arresting you for murder.

538
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,930
You and Garfield go way back.

539
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,069
Why didn't you tell him it's Bohannan?

540
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,296
And explain to him
how we arrived at our information?

541
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,931
How the Nightshade and the Flash
broke into Bohannan's house?

542
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,547
How those two ruthless vigilantes
set themselves above the law?

543
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:07,741
Take a good look, Barry.
Real bars.

544
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,584
Real trouble.

545
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,448
Maybe we ought to let the cops
handle it from here.

546
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,487
You really believe that?

547
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,395
I don't give a damn what anyone thinks.

548
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,561
You're my friend
and I am gonna get you out.

549
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:32,175
And that means I have to bring
Bohannan in. Right now.

550
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,809
- What...?
- He didn't do it!

551
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,845
Dr. Powell...

552
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,516
...can I be straight?

553
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,950
Are you the deadly Nightshade?

554
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,791
I don't know, doctor.

555
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,587
What do you think?

556
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,168
The hospital.

557
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,600
My God, Powell's garage.

558
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,572
Bohannan's figured it out.

559
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,723
I can't believe it, right here
in my police station.

560
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,757
- What happened?
- Some other Nightshade...

561
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,724
...he throws tear gas into the station.

562
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,855
He tears through us like a tank
and he busts Dr. Powell out of jail.

563
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,328
Look at this.
How the hell did he do it?

564
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:43,462
And how are we gonna stop him?
He knocked a dozen cops senseless.

565
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:48,475
And he busted Dr. Powell out of jail.

566
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,274
Come on, get it up. Get it up.

567
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,575
Curt. You're not well.

568
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,619
You. The Nightshade!

569
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,154
My hero, my inspiration.

570
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:08,229
After all those years, you put your mask
back on to deal with the Ghost.

571
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,991
I began to track you down.

572
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,862
When I heard this evening they arrested
the Nightshade at Central Hospital...

573
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,132
...my suspicions about your secret life
were confirmed.

574
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,266
I broke you out of jail as an ally.

575
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,379
And you refuse to join me.

576
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,708
You're way over the deep end, Curt.

577
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,943
- Killing people is...
- Not people!

578
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,753
- Scum of the earth.
- Now, how did this happen?

579
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,390
We're friends.
Come on, let me help you.

580
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,220
I don't think so.

581
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,525
This is all the help I need.

582
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,766
What the hell is that?

583
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,601
An exoskeleton...

584
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,632
...to accelerate my response
to the Flash.

585
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,964
To give me a fighting chance.

586
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,139
It should have been all three of us.

587
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,645
You, me, the Flash.

588
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:02,445
Yeah, just a bunch of crime fighters
out murdering the bad guys.

589
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,848
Exterminating vermin.

590
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,185
Striking fear in the criminal heart.

591
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:14,758
Curt, why don't you forget
all about this crime-fighting junk...

592
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,628
...donate some of your millions
to a poverty program.

593
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,360
I worshipped you.

594
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:24,472
I wanted to be like you, to be you.
Not like...

595
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,936
Your father.

596
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,812
- It's over, Bohannan.
- Like hell it is.

597
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:37,112
There's only room for one champion
of justice in Central City.

598
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,888
If that's the way you want it.

599
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,711
Only way to stop him
is a short circuit.

600
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,122
- How's the leg?
- Fine. How's he doing?

601
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:01,665
He'll live.

602
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,740
Done more damage to himself
than you could ever do.

603
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,608
- No need to give everything away.
- Yeah.

604
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,716
Thanks, Red.

605
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,861
Say, you wouldn't happen to have...

606
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,158
...another one of those
sandwiches on you, would you?

607
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,159
No.

608
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,717
Come in.

609
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,326
Barry, my lad!

610
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,189
Nice to see you.

611
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,560
I can't even open a newspaper
or turn on the TV without seeing you.

612
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,359
"Fifties' hero unmasked."

613
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,797
I got me a book deal,
couple of movie offers.

614
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,007
Better leave Garfield out of the story.

615
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:15,839
He can't believe you were able to hide
your identity from him all these years.

616
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,613
He'll get over it.

617
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,010
But you didn't get in
your Sunday best...

618
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,674
...just to come see me, did you?

619
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,146
Actually, I'm meeting someone
for dinner.

620
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,422
Anybody I know?

621
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,427
Professionally and personally.

622
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,857
I'll take that as a compliment,
you sexist pig.

623
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,231
- Ready to go, Barry?
- She asked me.

624
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,771
What was I supposed to do,
wait for him to ask me?

625
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,772
He was always disappearing.

626
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,671
You better be careful of her.
She's a dangerous woman.

627
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:53,248
I'd take it real slow.
Especially with that limp.

628
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,942
- I think I can handle it.
- I'll be the judge of that.

629
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,781
Oh, yeah?

630
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,123
So, Dr. Powell, what about you?
You got plans for the weekend?

631
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:06,055
Yeah. I thought I'd have
one hell of a garage sale.

632
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,899
You had to be there.

633
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,497
