this Emerald Tablet,

1470
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:57,696
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

1471
01:33:00,783 --> 01:33:02,159
Miss me?

1472
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:04,912
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this...

1473
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:06,080
-Is this new?
-Are you two...

1474
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:07,164
Because I hate it.

1475
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:08,415
DRUIG: Phastos,

1476
01:33:08,499 --> 01:33:10,292
I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1477
01:33:10,459 --> 01:33:11,919
Okay, get ready for it.

1478
01:33:15,172 --> 01:33:16,298
KINGO: Bracelets?

1479
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:17,883
You made us bracelets?

1480
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:19,969
PHASTOS:
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1481
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,054
Celestials are the most powerful

1482
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,806
energy generators in the universe.

1483
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:25,349
When Arishem made us,

1484
01:33:25,432 --> 01:33:27,226
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy

1485
01:33:27,434 --> 01:33:28,936
to keep our bodies regenerating.

1486
01:33:29,019 --> 01:33:30,729
The bracelets, in theory,

1487
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:32,773
shut down our regeneration process.

1488
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,316
And once that happens,

1489
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,026
our bodies accumulate
extra cosmic energy.

1490
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,361
What for?

1491
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:40,322
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy,

1492
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:44,160
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1493
01:33:44,326 --> 01:33:46,829
If I can find a way to connect us all,

1494
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:48,956
one of us could become
immensely powerful,

1495
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,834
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest,

1496
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:53,169
forming...

1497
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,090
a Uni-Mind.

1498
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:03,804

"mind" meaning "mind."

01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:09,768

-No, I invented it,

1503
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:10,936

1504
01:34:11,061 --> 01:34:15,441
(IN SIGN LANGUAGE) So suppose Druig can,
say... put Tiamut to sleep--

1505

1506
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:19,320
We find humans a new home
on another planet.

1507
01:34:19,486 --> 01:34:21,155
Are we building a big ship, too?

1508
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:22,323
Take a pair of each animal?

1509
01:34:22,489 --> 01:34:23,782
Well, you know
what's never saved the planet?

1510
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:24,867
Your sarcasm.

1511
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:26,869
Space colonisation
could take decades.

1512
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,412
It can happen quickly with our help.

1513

What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?

1514
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:33,292
We could be responsible
for billions of lives
