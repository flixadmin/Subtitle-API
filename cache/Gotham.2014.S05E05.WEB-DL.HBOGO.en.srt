1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,160
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,080
Where's Jeremiah?

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,560
Selina. She's not herself, Alfred.
She's desperate for revenge.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,720
You can't save her from herself.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,760
This time, woke up on a rooftop.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,520
No idea how I got there or what
happened during the preceding hours.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,840
In Haven, as long as we survive,
hope survives in Gotham.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,720
You've been promising me help
for weeks.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,440
<i>I'm working on getting you help.</i>

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,680
I promise I won't stop
until I find those responsible.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,440
I've got a lead
on a guy selling RPGs.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,440
Oh... oh, please don't hurt me.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,200
I just want to know what you saw.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,160
You had some kind of a rocket

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,920
and you shot it at that building.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,360
<i>Raise your hands, Mr. Gordon.</i>

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,400
<i>I'm sorry, Steve, they made me do it.</i>

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
<i>All right. Be quiet, you.</i>

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,160
<i>Miss Zant, we're sorry
to interrupt your breakfast,</i>

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,280
<i>but you'll come with us, quickly.</i>

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,840
<i>You may lower your hands now,
Mr. Gordon.</i>

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Turn around.

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,800
There a problem, Officer?

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,280
We know you sold the RPG
that took out Haven.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,760
- So?
- So, I want to know who bought it.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Or what?

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,400
You gonna arrest me?

28
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,160
Who said anything about
arresting you?

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
I want a name.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,120
What do you say, boys?

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,120
Should we show this lawman
how we feel about uninvited guests?

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,240
Now, who told you I sold that RPG?

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Eduardo?

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,760
Nice shot, right?

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,600
Lower your weapon now.

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
Delta Force, stand down.

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
What are you doing here?

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Come on.

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,440
The last time I saw you,
you were running through sniper fire,

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
plucking my sorry ass
from a burning truck.

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,760
Least I could do was pay you back.

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,280
I had that guy right
where I wanted him.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
I'm glad you're here.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,480
Yeah, me too.

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,600
{\an5}We hated each other in boot.

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,200
{\an5}Jim disapproved of my ops tempo.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,280
{\an5}Yeah, 'cause you only had
one speed - too fast.

48
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,920
{\an5}Took me a while to realize he wasn't
afraid to get his hands dirty.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,320
{\an5}- Just being careful.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,640
{\an5}Well, Jim's taught me a thing
or two about being careful.

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
{\an5}So what's the mission plan?

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,920
{\an5}Well, we are the help
Secretary Walker promised.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,800
{\an5}Our goal is to make this hellhole
safe again.

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
So it took the murder
of hundreds of innocent civilians

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
to get the government to act?

56
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
We're here to eliminate
all criminal threats.

57
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,640
We're gonna blanket
the city with flash sweeps.

58
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,240
{\an5}Well, what about the people
that are still trapped here?

59
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
{\an5}They need relief now.

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,360
{\an5}Hey, I'm with you,
but my mandate's clear.

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,880
First, we restore order,
then we take the next steps.

62
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
{\an5}Sir.

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
We got something, sir.

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,400
{\an5}Captain Gordon, this is my second,
Sergeant Angel Vallelunga.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
{\an5}Captain.

66
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
{\an5}Ledger.

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,000
Our arms dealer kept track
of his buyers.

68
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,680
{\an5}"Edward Nygma. Two RPG."

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,760
{\an5}Nygma. Yeah, that name's on my list.

70
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,080
{\an5}Think he's our bomber?

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,440
{\an5}Only one way to find out.

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,600
{\an5}All right, you and I will get Nygma.

73
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,400
{\an5}Harvey, I need you to set up
a command center

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,960
{\an5}with the soldiers at GCPD.

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,560
{\an5}- I'll grab some guys.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,880
{\an5}Hey, look. Hey, Jim.

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
{\an5}I'm not as fast as I used to be,
but I still got some fight in me.

78
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm not a desk jockey.
I'm a street guy.

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,040
What you are
is the best cop that I know.

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,800
We're going after Nygma.
He's ten steps ahead.

81
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,760
This thing goes sideways,
you're gonna have to take over.

82
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
I need your help, buddy.

83
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
{\an5}I got it.

84
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Alfred.

85
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,960
{\an5}Oh, there you are, Master Bruce.

86
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
{\an5}There's been a break
in the Haven bombing.

87
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,360
{\an5}Seems that Gordon and Bullock

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,920
{\an5}have got a rather strong lead,
apparently.

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,960
- What's the matter with you?
- I can't find Selina.

90
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,760
I've looked all over the Green Zone.

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
Somehow, I think
Miss Kyle is perfectly capable

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,680
of looking after herself,
Master Bruce.

93
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Except that she's not herself.

94
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,520
You saw what she did to Jeremiah.

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Yes. I did.

96
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Listen, come here.

97
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,640
Jeremiah Valeska deserved to die.

98
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Jeremiah made Selina a murderer.

99
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,880
Just like Ra's made me a murderer.

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,480
Ra's goaded you into stabbing him,
Master Bruce.

101
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,160
He used you as an instrument.
You're no murderer.

102
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
But Selina is.

103
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
You're not the same.

104
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,960
She did what she did with open eyes,

105
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,000
and you got to learn
to respect that, son.

106
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,160
You're wrong about her, Alfred.

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
And I'm gonna go find her.

108
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,760
<i>It's Monday, 5.32pm.</i>

109
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,880
<i>I'm standing in a dumpster.
My head hurts.</i>

110
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,160
<i>It's happened again.
It's Saturday, 12.16am.</i>

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,400
<i>My fingernails are full of dirt.
Have I been digging?</i>

112
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,000
<i>I think it's Sunday.
I can't find my watch,</i>

113
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,680
<i>and it's dark outside,
my feet are wet.</i>

114
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,920
<i>There's mud everywhere.</i>

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
God!

116
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,520
It doesn't make sense!

117
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,120
You're not a murderer, Ed.

118
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Except Kristen Kringle.

119
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
And Officer Dougherty.

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,240
But all those people...

121
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
and children.

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,840
How could you do it?

123
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,200
Why?

124
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,480
It doesn't matter why.

125
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
What matters

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,840
is that it was you who killed them.

127
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Not me.

128
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,200
Edward Nygma, you're under arrest
for the attack at Haven

129
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,040
and the murder of hundreds
of innocent people.

130
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
No.

131
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
No, Jim. I can explain.

132
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Explain?

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,560
You son of a bitch.
You actually did it?

134
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,920
- On your knees, now.
- No! I didn't.

135
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,680
I can prove it. I just, I need...

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,560
I need a little bit of time.

137
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Say the word, Jim.

138
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
You know me, Jim.

139
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
The people that I...

140
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,440
have hurt, they hurt me first.

141
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
I didn't know a single person
in Haven.

142
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm innocent.

143
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,280
It's your call, buddy.

144
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
He basically confessed.

145
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
We bring him in.

146
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
He stands trial.

147
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Yeah, I don't think so.

148
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,400
Your friend is standing
on a pressure-plated IED.

149
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,040
One of several throughout the rooms.

150
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,120
Twitch and you'll repaint
the room with your organs.

151
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Don't do it, Jim.

152
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,160
This little doohickey
monitors my heartbeat.

153
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,200
It increases by ten?

154
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,160
Boom. Decreases by ten?

155
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,960
- Boom.
- You try to walk out of here,

156
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,400
and a special forces sniper
will put a bullet in your head.

157
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
No, they won't.

158
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,920
This thing can detonate his bomb
from a mile away.

159
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Or am I bluffing?

160
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,440
Once words gets out
that you're responsible for Haven,

161
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,640
you'll have a target on your back.

162
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,760
I'll take my chances.

163
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,320
- I think he's bluffing.
- No, no.

164
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
He doesn't bluff.

165
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,840
I don't want anyone here
if this thing detonates.

166
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,440
You heard the man. Tell Sergeant
Vallelunga to stand down.

167
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,000
- Yes, sir.
- Nygma walks.

168
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,920
A wristband that monitors
his heart rate.

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,040
Welcome to Gotham.

170
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
So, what we do?

171
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,160
Well, the way I see it,
now we're all tied up.

172
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,200
I just got to save your life
one more time,

173
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,600
then I'm back in the lead.

174
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,760
Funny.

175
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,520
Seriously, the hell are we gonna do?

176
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,280
Well, he pulled a book
to set the booby trap.

177
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I think I can make it.

178
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,520
Assuming the vibrations
don't trigger the IED, what then?

179
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,920
Then we just got to figure out
what sort of puzzle

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,080
he wants us to solve.

181
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,280
Puzzle?

182
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,600
There's always a puzzle with Nygma.

183
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
You ready?

184
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,640
Chess Strategy:

185
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,280
Knight Moves Nimbly in the Dark.

186
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm gonna wring this nerd's neck.

187
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
In chess,

188
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,120
knights move in an "L."

189
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,160
Two spaces straight,

190
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,680
then one at a 90-degree angle.

191
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,240
Butterfly Collecting with Conviction.

192
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Or...

193
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Chess Strategy:

194
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,600
Knight's Gambit,
Escaping Checkmate.

195
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,840
- You okay?
- You left the Army for this city?

196
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
It grows on you.

197
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Harvey, come in.

198
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,320
<i>Jim, you nab Nygma?</i>

199
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,560
No. Put the word out:

200
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,000
Nygma's wanted for murder
and the attack on Haven.

201
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm looking for Selina.

202
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Follow me.

203
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,720
Everybody, raise your glasses
to the killer of Jeremiah Valeska.

204
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,680
The freak is dead!

205
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,320
The freak is dead!

206
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,200
The freak is dead! The freak is dead!

207
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,320
<i>Citizens of Gotham, this is a special
bulletin from the police department.</i>

208
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,720
<i>We have identified
the person who fired</i>

209
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,160
<i>a rocket-propelled grenade
that decimated Haven.</i>

210
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,560
<i>Be on the lookout for a tall,
skinny man</i>

211
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,760
<i>who goes by the name of Ed Nygma.</i>

212
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,280
<i>He was last seen wearing
a green suit and eyeglasses.</i>

213
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Ed Nygma.

214
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,960
The monster of Haven.

215
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
- Let's go get him!
- Yeah!

216
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
- Let's kill him!
- Kill him!

217
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,200
Kill him! Kill him!

218
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,920
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him!

219
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Excellent.

220
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,880
200 bullets, as promised.
Go have fun.

221
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,840
And there's more where that came
from if you keep up the good work.

222
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Off you go.

223
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,040
Mr. Cobblepot, sir.

224
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,840
- It's...
- What? What?

225
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,000
"Edward Nygma is the monster...

226
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,160
responsible for killing
the innocents at Haven."

227
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,560
Ed, what have you done?

228
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,680
I saw him go that way!
He's over there!

229
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,800
Get him! Come on!

230
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,080
<i>Bang Zero-One.</i>

231
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
<i>This is Bird Zero-Two.</i>

232
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,560
What's your status, Angel?

233
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,120
<i>We cleared 13th to 36th Street,
west of Broadway.</i>

234
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,440
<i>Gonna keep pushing uptown.</i>

235
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,520
That's progress. Still no Nygma.

236
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,240
My boys will scoop him up
by nightfall.

237
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,720
Now tell me about this, Scarecrow.

238
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
Well, he has chemical weapons.

239
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,280
Your guys will need gas masks,

240
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,400
but taking him down
would be a big win.

241
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,760
Well, that's why we're here.

242
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Hey.

243
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,200
Time to wake up.

244
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Who are you?

245
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,800
I'm the woman who's gonna
carry out your execution.

246
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,720
That's just a taste.

247
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,880
It's only fair you die slow
and painful to pay for JoJo.

248
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Who's JoJo?

249
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,480
JoJo was in Haven
when you blew it up.

250
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,280
This is a joke, right?

251
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,480
300 people died in Haven.

252
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,280
We don't care about people.

253
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Yeah!

254
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,240
Look at how happy JoJo was.

255
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,360
He always had a smile on his face.

256
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,480
You anthropomorphizing nincompoop.

257
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,840
Dogs can't smile.

258
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,200
I'm going to fix you, Ed.

259
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
What the hell?

260
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,040
Floor it!

261
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Yeah!

262
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,880
Yeah!

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,080
Yeah!

264
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm going to fix you, Ed.

265
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,880
- Did I say stop?
- I'm sorry, Ma.

266
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,280
Ma, can't we just beat him to death?

267
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,800
- It's not starting.
- Yes. Anything but electrocution.

268
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,480
Please don't let me die this way.

269
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,840
Oh, thank God the fuel line's
clogged.

270
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,920
Unclog the line.

271
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,120
We got it, we got it. Come on.

272
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Please.

273
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,840
Shoot me, stab me,
anything but another jolt.

274
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Hit it.

275
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Oh, no!

276
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Help him! Get him!

277
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,800
Put it out! Boys!

278
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Oh, my Lord!

279
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,280
Help him! Help him!

280
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,040
Who's gonna fix who, Oswald?

281
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,600
The Army's invading the city,
locking everyone up.

282
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,280
- They're coming this way.
- Please.

283
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,160
An invasion is tanks, infantry.

284
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
These are scouts.

285
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,200
- What about Nygma?
- Nobody's seen him,

286
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,600
but we got feelers out.

287
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,800
Well, you tell your "feelers"

288
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,840
that the first man to bring me Nygma
is the one who gets to live.

289
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,880
Now!

290
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,200
I am surrounded by morons, Edward.

291
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,480
If I didn't have an empire to run,
I would go get Nygma myself.

292
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Hello, Oswald.

293
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,800
We have a great deal to talk about.

294
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
But first...

295
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,200
did you name your dog after me?

296
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,560
Jim, Harper just radioed.

297
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640
She saw Nygma going into City Hall.

298
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,360
He's going to Penguin.

299
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,600
Cobblepot's at the top of my list
from Walker.

300
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,960
Sounds like a twofer.

301
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,960
Penguin's sitting on all the ammo
in Gotham.

302
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,520
He's better defended,
better manned than anyone else.

303
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,520
We need shock and awe.

304
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,840
Shock and awe is my default.

305
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
You ready?

306
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,320
You know what?
Take Harvey on this one.

307
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,560
I'll keep things locked down here.

308
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Let's saddle up.

309
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,720
Man, you're killing my buzz.

310
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Selina.

311
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,480
I know you, and this isn't you.

312
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,000
- You know me?
- Yes.

313
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,680
Maybe better than you know yourself.

314
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,680
Let me tell you something.

315
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,520
That night that your parents
were murdered...

316
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,680
I was in that alley
on the fire escape.

317
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,320
And I watched that guy...

318
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,440
shoot your father...

319
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
and shoot your mother.

320
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,760
And through it all, I did...

321
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
nothing.

322
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,320
I didn't call for help, I didn't...

323
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,160
I didn't scream for the guy to stop.

324
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,680
It wasn't your fault.
You were just a scared kid.

325
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,520
No.

326
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,120
You were the scared kid.

327
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,400
We are not the same, Bruce.

328
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,840
I didn't do anything

329
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,520
because I wasn't willing
to risk my neck for someone else

330
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,040
because I didn't care.

331
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,000
That's who I was and that's who I am.

332
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
I love this song.

333
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,560
What did you do to me, Oswald?

334
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,080
What are you talking about?

335
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Oh, please.

336
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,680
You did something to me.

337
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
You...

338
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,120
You are the reason
that I killed those people.

339
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
How could you?

340
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,680
You have made me
into some murderous puppet.

341
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,640
For weeks, I've been waking up
in strange places,

342
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,720
not knowing how I got there
or what I did.

343
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,720
Driving myself mad,
thinking I had gone mad.

344
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,480
And now I know
that it was all your doing.

345
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,080
Of everything
that you have put me through...

346
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
this...

347
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,600
this is the most cruel.

348
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Ed.

349
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,720
I don't know what you're
talking about.

350
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,000
I did not make you do anything.

351
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,040
Then what is "I'll fix you"?

352
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,840
What did that mean?
You didn't fix me.

353
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,160
You broke me!

354
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,320
Wait. No.

355
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,920
I said that to you
the night the bridges blew. I... I...

356
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
Think I wouldn't remember?

357
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
No, Ed, I saved your life!

358
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
That's it!

359
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
What are you talking about?

360
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,280
You had been stabbed,

361
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,440
I paid Hugo Strange
to save your life.

362
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,200
I bet he did something to you
when he was patching you up.

363
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,160
You paid Hugo Strange to save me?

364
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Why?

365
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,720
What? Was I supposed to do?
Let you die?

366
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,240
After Butch, you were my only friend.

367
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,840
You shot Butch!

368
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,640
Which is why I needed you!

369
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Edward Nygma,

370
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,720
if I wanted you to suffer,

371
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,080
I would never do it
in some backhanded way.

372
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
If you and I

373
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,320
are ever at odds again,

374
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,240
you will know, without a doubt,

375
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,320
that I am your enemy.

376
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,760
I promise you that...

377
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
as a friend.

378
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
What a mess.

379
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,920
I might have killed you, Oswald.

380
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,000
And if that day comes...

381
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,760
I swear to you,

382
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,920
I will stare you in the eye

383
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,080
as I stab you in the heart.

384
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Look on the bright side.

385
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,520
If Hugo Strange did do something
to you,

386
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,920
it means you are not responsible
for Haven.

387
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Where is he?

388
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,520
Sir, GCPD and the Army
have blown the gates.

389
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,640
Stay here. You'll be safe.

390
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,240
Grab Nygma. They want him, not me.

391
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
He's gone.

392
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Idiot!

393
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,760
Why, hello, Harvey.

394
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,120
Now, last time we were in a standoff,
you ran out of bullets.

395
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
I hope you're better prepared.

396
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,520
We don't want to take
your territory, Oswald,

397
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,760
but you have to put down your weapons
and hand over Ed Nygma.

398
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,600
Or, if you and your friends aren't
out by the time I count to three,

399
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,040
I will mow you all down!

400
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
We good?

401
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
Yep.

402
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Go ahead. Count.

403
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,240
Harvey, you're not thinking clearly.

404
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,720
Maybe call your boss,
see what he thinks.

405
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,640
I don't have to call anyone.

406
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,840
Go ahead. Count.

407
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
One...

408
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,600
How's that for better prepared?

409
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,120
Where's Ed Nygma?

410
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,720
The whole of Gotham
is looking for you.

411
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,600
I need information, your specialty.

412
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,080
I am going to cut your face
into a jigsaw puzzle

413
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,680
and watch you try and put it back
together again.

414
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Barbara... Barbara!

415
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Am I dumb?

416
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,440
In all the years of plotting
and the betrayals between us,

417
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,720
have you ever, ever,

418
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,760
known me to do something
as idiotically brutal

419
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,040
as shoot a rocket into a building
full of innocent people?

420
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,240
I did not kill those people in Haven.

421
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Not exactly.

422
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,280
There's more going on here.

423
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
I'm waiting.

424
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,800
The night the bridges fell,
I was hurt.

425
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
Oswald took me to Hugo Strange,

426
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,000
and he did something to my brain.

427
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,720
And that's your excuse
for murdering hundreds of people?

428
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,800
I'm saying that Strange, or somebody,
can control me.

429
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,640
They killed those people.

430
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,880
Okay, let's say, by some miracle,
I believe you.

431
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,440
Why the hell should I help you?

432
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,920
Because who's working with Strange?

433
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,480
Who would force me
to kill all of those people?

434
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,120
Information is your lifeblood.

435
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
You help me,

436
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,360
and I will give you
the best intel you've ever had.

437
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,880
I don't know where Strange is.

438
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
But I can tell you
where you'll find his Igors.

439
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,880
Where is Edward Nygma?

440
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
You're protecting a mass murderer.

441
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,520
Don't look to me for sympathy.

442
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Fine.

443
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,120
But not with that meathead around.

444
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,160
You know, they say you can judge
a man by his friends.

445
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,960
This from a man who has no friends.

446
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
Talk.

447
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Nygma's a patsy.

448
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,520
He is not a mass murderer.

449
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,240
Puzzles, games,

450
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,320
perhaps the odd killing here
and there,

451
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,440
but hundreds of people?

452
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,600
No. That's not him. You know this.

453
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
So who set him up?

454
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,520
Jim, you want information,

455
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,640
I want to go home.

456
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,560
Eduardo's not gonna go for that.

457
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,400
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were in charge.

458
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,840
Even if I were to let you go,

459
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,800
sooner or later,
the Army's gonna come for you.

460
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,760
Things are changing in Gotham.

461
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,080
I'll take my chances.

462
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,600
Now, do you want Nygma or not?

463
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,480
I know where Nygma's going.

464
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,560
I trust you know what you're doing.

465
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,320
We do what we have to do, right?

466
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,880
Gentlemen.

467
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Come in. You're late.

468
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,040
The last body you procured
for me was gangrenous.

469
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,200
Completely unsuitable.

470
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,040
Oh, my.

471
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
Bye.

472
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Hello, Professor.

473
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Mr. Nygma.

474
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,960
Let's skip the part where you deny
making me into a killing machine.

475
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,880
Tell me how you took control
of my alter ego.

476
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I don't follow.

477
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,640
You did something to access
the Ed Nygma side of my personality.

478
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,480
But, you're Ed Nygma.

479
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm also the Riddler!

480
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,520
Tell me what you did!

481
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,320
Why did you make me
kill all those people in Haven?

482
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
You did that?

483
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
How interesting.

484
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,400
I had no idea.

485
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,200
You really expect me to believe that?

486
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,560
Mr. Nygma, I don't know anything
about your alter egos.

487
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
But I will confess that when
I was sewing up your knife wound,

488
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,600
I may have tinkered a little
with your gray matter.

489
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,000
- Would you just...
- I put a chip in your brain.

490
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,480
It allows you to be able
to be controlled remotely.

491
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,040
I knew it.

492
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,920
But I don't control you.

493
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,120
I gave control to others.

494
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Who?

495
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
I will write it down.

496
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,160
That way, if I'm ever confronted,

497
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,400
I can honestly say
that I never told you.

498
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Not to worry.

499
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,240
You're experiencing
a simple neural cutout.

500
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,920
I am mystified

501
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,680
as to how you've become aware
you're being controlled.

502
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,880
I suppose we're just going
to have to open you up

503
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,400
and take a look under the hood.

504
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Won't we?

505
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,080
- Jim.
- Sorry, kid, it's just me.

506
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,040
You all right?

507
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Yeah, I'm just,

508
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,520
just looking for Jim. It's nothing.

509
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,080
I saw soldiers downstairs.

510
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,720
Yeah, the Army's finally gotten off
their asses and decided to help.

511
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Jim's out with them now.

512
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Are you sure you're all right?

513
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
I don't know.

514
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,400
I see people losing their will
to do good.

515
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
People I love.

516
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,200
What if we don't make it out of this?

517
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,520
I'm not gonna lie, kid.

518
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
These past few months,

519
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,000
I've wondered the same thing.

520
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,840
And when I don't know what to do,
I come up here

521
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,440
and I dig into these case files.

522
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,440
I sit my ass down and I get to work.

523
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
I used to hate
this kind of paperwork.

524
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,840
Now, it's the only thing
that keeps me going.

525
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,800
- Why?
- Because the little things matter.

526
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,960
Act by act, deed by deed,
it means something.

527
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,840
Even if no one notices or cares.

528
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,480
- Thanks, Harvey.
- You're welcome, kid.

529
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,960
If you really want to do
an old man a favor,

530
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,920
you can scrounge me up
a cup of joe because I...

531
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Kid's fast.

532
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,120
I apologize for the discomfort.

533
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,920
The neural cutout inhibits
muscular function,

534
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,640
but not pain receptors.

535
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,840
A simple reboot of the chip
should be all that is required.

536
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,680
Although, the sound may be,
somewhat unpleasant.

537
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,720
Not to mention the smell.

538
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,360
Edward, I believe the time has come
for a change of scenery.

539
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,120
It seems a powerful electrical charge

540
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,800
overloaded your chip,
but I've gotten everything updated.

541
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,080
I will pass the good news
along to your handler.

542
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,160
Care to expand on that?

543
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,920
I was merely helping a man
who needed medical attention.

544
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah, not buying it.

545
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
His eyes are open.

546
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,800
I gave him a biomedical anesthesia.

547
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,080
Wake him up now. Do it.

548
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,240
Oh, very well.

549
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,600
I told you this wasn't me!

550
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,560
He put a chip in my brain.

551
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,720
And someone's been controlling
it this whole time.

552
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,600
And then he drilled in my head!

553
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,400
Better talk now. I am a scientist.

554
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,200
A contract came along,
I developed a tool.

555
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
A tool? How dare you?

556
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,680
A contract from who?

557
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,280
Please escort the professor out,
thank you.

558
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
Ta-ta.

559
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,120
What the hell is going on?

560
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,840
Sorry, pal, but this part of the op
is need-to-know.

561
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,360
I couldn't say anything
until we had the suspect in custody,

562
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,360
but Walker wants Ed Nygma
taken out now.

563
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,560
Walker was behind this?

564
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,160
She's been controlling
Nygma the whole time?

565
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,440
You know I hate this spook crap.

566
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,480
I don't ask questions.
I follow orders.

567
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,600
She's responsible for Haven?

568
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,680
- I don't understand, why...
- Jim, stop right there, trust me.

569
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,080
Walker wants you to put a bullet
in his brain.

570
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,680
No.

571
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,000
Call it proof of loyalty.

572
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,160
It's what she needs from you
before she can move forward

573
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,960
with final relief plans.

574
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,520
Hey, come on. Look at him.

575
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,240
He's a loon.

576
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
A cop-killer.

577
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,600
Tell me the truth.

578
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,440
Did Walker destroy Haven?
Did you know? Tell me.

579
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,960
Jim, ours is not to reason why.

580
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,000
And this is your chance
to be a part of this mission.

581
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
So...

582
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
please.

583
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,160
You pull the trigger on him,
or I pull the trigger on you.

584
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,520
After all this, you'd kill me
for some bureaucrat?

585
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Mission comes first.

586
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
You taught me that.

587
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
What's your answer?

588
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,320
Looks like I saved your life
one too many times.

589
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
Maybe so.

590
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,720
You know Jim Gordon.

591
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,640
You know this city. Find him.

592
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
And kill him.

593
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,000
Boss. Wake up.

594
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,920
Wake up.

595
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,120
Ouch.

596
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,400
Stitches still sore, huh?

597
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,080
Never would have happened
if you wore that armor I prepared.

598
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,400
That bullet is making
you sentimental.

599
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,840
Give her a shake, huh?

600
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Better?

601
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,160
I told you I had to let Selina
thrust the knife

602
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,520
into my flesh at least once.

603
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,800
Verisimilitude trumps precaution,
you see.

604
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
I get it.

605
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,360
Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne
needed to think you were dead, boss.

606
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
Yeah.

607
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
Right.

608
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,120
I take it you have news?

609
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,760
All systems go.

610
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,160
Well, then lead the way.

611
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Doctor.

612
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,920
I'm hearing good things.

613
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,720
The bandages are ready to come off.

614
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,920
Your assistant thought
you'd like to see the results.

615
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,560
Indeed, I would.

616
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,960
Oh, you two look beautiful.

617
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,520
I love family reunions, don't you?
