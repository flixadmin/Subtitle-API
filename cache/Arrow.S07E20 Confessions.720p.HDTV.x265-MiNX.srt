1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:02,045
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,451
After 6 months in hell,

3
00:00:03,476 --> 00:00:04,681
I have been released from prison

4
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,638
and returned home with only one goal...

5
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:08,051
to save my city,

6
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:09,597
but things have changed.

7
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:11,589
Instead of operating outside the law,

8
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:13,479
I am now working alongside the police.

9
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:16,753
I am no longer Inmate 4587.

10
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:19,684
I am once more the Green Arrow.

11
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:21,922
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:23,336
Working with the SCPD...

13
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:24,714
that's what's best for this city.

14
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:26,343
The whole city will be watching you,

15
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,818
holding you to the highest standard.

16
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:29,931
Dad, please. Don't leave.

17
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:32,097
Dante took me under
his wing, and he trained me.

18
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:33,620
I kept holding out, thinking

19
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:35,602
one day you'd become
the father I deserved.

20
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,147
It's never gonna happen, is it?

21
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:39,607
Is there something else
you'd like to talk to me about?

22
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,466
No. Have a good trip.

23
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:45,912
When Emiko realizes that Dante
has been manipulating her,

24
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:50,206
it will drive a wedge between
her and the Ninth Circle.

25
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,259
Rot in hell.

26
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,400
The Ninth Circle got away

27
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:55,356
with a very dangerous
biological weapon...

28
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,814
the Cygnus X-1.

29
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:02,831
I have just received confirmation

30
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:06,766
of two fatalities here at the
Hudolin McGuire Metro Station.

31
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,958
SCPD have cordoned off the area,

32
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,527
but the community is very concerned.

33
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:14,119
Rumors are already flying as
to who might be responsible.

34
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:16,444
- Captain Drake.
- How's it look?

35
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:18,769
You need to see this for yourself.

36
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:22,253
Hey, keep those damn reporters back.

37
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,043
This is where we found them.

38
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:30,979
Oh, my god.

39
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:33,803
We'll have to wait for
the official M.E. report,

40
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,550
but it seems obvious...

41
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:36,808
blunt force trauma.

42
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:39,219
Looks like they got off a few rounds

43
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:40,489
before they went down.

44
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:41,947
Did they hit anything?

45
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,791
Nothing alive.

46
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,333
Where are the suspects?

47
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:58,105
We've got two dead guards
and one hell of a mess.

48
00:01:58,174 --> 00:01:59,750
Your team was on-site.

49
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:02,445
I think you better start talking.

50
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,770

This is... this whole
thing is ridiculous.

53
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:15,523
The real danger is still out there.

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,404
I don't think you get to decide
the real danger, Mr. Queen.

55
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:22,754
We went to the subway platform

56
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:23,909
to stop a terrorist attack,

57
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:25,199
which we did,

58
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,696
but the people that we were after

59
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:28,591
- are still on the loose.
- Well, luckily we have

60
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,903
half the department out there right now

61
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:30,980
following the same lead.

62
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,154
Do you think that these are
average street thugs, Dinah?

63
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:34,427
These are terrorists
that tried to release

64
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:36,332
a biological agent in Star City.

65
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,389
Thousands of people could have died.

66
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:41,615
Two people did die.

67
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,256
We found two emerald
arrows at the scene.

68
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:48,466
The new Green Arrow.

69
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:49,714
Why don't you tell me
about her involvement

70
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:50,775
at the subway tonight?

71
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:54,310
She was there.

72
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:57,771
She? How do you know that?

73
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:01,569
I think it's time we
tell people the truth.

74
00:03:01,997 --> 00:03:04,390
The new Green Arrow is my half-sister.

75
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:05,982
Her name is Emiko Adachi.

76
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:08,262
She belongs to a terrorist organization

77
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,537
called the Ninth Circle.

78
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:10,888
The vigilantes have been tracking her

79
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:12,145
for a few weeks now.

80
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:15,027
Why didn't you inform the SCPD?

81
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:16,065
Because the Ninth Circle is

82
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:19,463
just a little bit
beyond the SCPD, Officer.

83
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:22,466
The SCPD-vigilante
partnership works best

84
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:24,157
when we operate as a covert unit.

85
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:26,589
Doesn't seem so in this case.

86
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:28,794
Well, I'm usually kept
aware of what's going on,

87
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,638
but I did not know about this.

88
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,032
Care to explain why?

89
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,680
Things started moving pretty quickly

90
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:39,739
after you told us about Dante.

91
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,286
Oh, thank God.

92
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,439
Please tell me the news
that you are bringing

93
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:48,144
is about Emiko and her
Ninth Circle buddies

94
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:49,260
because I have had no luck

95
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:50,863
with my typity-type
finding anything thing.

96
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:52,361
Oh, well, you're in luck now.

97
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:53,784
Dante, not so much.

98
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,355
A couple SCPD beat cops
found his body this morning.

99
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:58,257
Let me guess, and not
from natural causes.

100
00:03:58,282 --> 00:03:59,882
Not unless you call 3 arrows

101
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,271
and a knife to the chest natural.

102
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:02,477
This was after you told Emiko

103
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:03,501
that Dante killed her mother.

104
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:06,308
- Can't be a coincidence.
- No. She went ahead and killed

105
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,887
the only father figure she had left.

106
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:08,929
Right. So that's a "no"

107
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:10,489
on the evil sister
redeeming herself then.

108
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:12,038
Ok, so we have to stop Emiko from using

109
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:14,389
this bio-weapon that
she stole from the D.I.A.

110
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,527
The terrifying bacteria
that eats through everything?

111
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,727
Yeah, let's keep that contained.

112
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,016
Ok, so the bad news is that

113
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,384
I haven't been able to
find the bio-weapon,

114
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,484
but the good news is

115
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,016
that the ninth circle
won't be able to either

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,510
unless they get a dissemination device,

117
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:26,463
A.K.A. a thermal fogger.
And, yes, I checked.

118
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:29,172
The only place to get one
is Aerodyne Initiatives.

119
00:04:29,197 --> 00:04:30,221
Digg, let's get there and

120
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:31,325
- help them protect it.
- Ok.

121
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,541
I'll follow up with the detective,

122
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,201
see if I can get some more
clues off Dante's body.

123
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,821
- Ok.
- And I'll hang back with Felicity

124
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:37,091
and help her with the typey-type.

125
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,049
- That's ok.
- Moral support.

126
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:40,967
Ok.

127
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,965
Mr. Queen, Mr. Diggle,

128
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,013
it's a pleasure to finally meet

129
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,603
the famous Green Arrow and Spartan.

130
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:51,748
I always believed in
vigilantes in the city.

131
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:53,562
Well, love to hear it.

132
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,399
Wish we were meeting
under better circumstances.

133
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,921
We have reason to believe

134
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,116
that an asset of yours has been targeted

135
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,903
by an international terrorist threat.

136
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:02,193
Well, that's quite an accusation,

137
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,139
but I can assure you our
security's top of the line.

138
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,536
With all due respect,

139
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:07,527
this organization is far more powerful

140
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:08,664
than any private company

141
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:10,023
could possibly contend with.

142
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,881
And with all due respect to you,

143
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:14,154
we hired over a dozen of the
world's best hackers and thieves

144
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:15,777
to try to break into our facility.

145
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:17,301
None made it past the front entrance.

146
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:19,175
Uh, Mr. Toth,

147
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,629
we're simply offering to help you.

148
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:25,693
What possible reason could you have

149
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:26,743
for turning us down?

150
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,076
Well, I appreciate your concern,

151
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,771
but we've got this covered.

152
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:43,216
It seems odd that he turned you down.

153
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:44,944
We agreed,

154
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,351
so we had Felicity do a deep dive

155
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:48,218
into Toth's financial records.

156
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:49,676
Turns out he was getting

157
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:51,667
some very large deposits.

158
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:53,204
So he was on the take...

159
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:55,723
- From the Ninth Circle.
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:58,271
And why the hell didn't you tell me?

161
00:05:58,296 --> 00:05:59,781
Because we couldn't confirm it

162
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:01,238
until later, Dinah.

163
00:06:01,546 --> 00:06:03,112
Well, I want to believe you, Oliver,

164
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:04,905
but you've got to admit,
this looks really bad.

165
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:08,572
I mean, we got arrows
at the crime scene.

166
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:11,080
We've got a very
incriminating distress call

167
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,739
from one of the victims,
and you were there.

168
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,525
Not to mention the
missing security footage.

169
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:21,186
Ok. Dinah, you know me, all right?

170
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,561
You know that I didn't
kill those people.

171
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:26,679
You've killed before...

172
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:28,861
huh...

173
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,468
many times.

174
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:32,883
Five months ago, you were sitting

175
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,342
in a cell in Slabside.

176
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,512
You're not exactly innocent.

177
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,270
Enjoying yourself?
You having a good time?

178
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:40,071
You have had it out for me

179
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:43,704
since the moment that I
was deputized by the SCPD.

180
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:45,955
You know, those guards
were not just killed, Oliver.

181
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:49,181
They were savagely beaten to death.

182
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,960
Do you understand how bad
this looks for the department?

183
00:06:51,985 --> 00:06:55,246
Yes, I do, but I didn't do it.

184
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:57,071
- Then who did?
- I don't know.

185
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:59,489
So it could have been
one of the members of your team.

186
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:00,684
My team...

187
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:04,076
Stopped a terrorist attack.

188
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,649
Except it wasn't just your team
who was there, was it?

189
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:08,454
There was somebody else there,

190
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,112
somebody besides Mr. Diggle

191
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:12,304
and Ms. Smoak and Mr. Ramirez.

192
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,105
Yes, there was.

193
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,219
We thought the Ninth Circle

194
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:21,978
was gonna wipe out Star City.

195
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:24,547
So I made a call.

196
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:28,915
You do understand

197
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,197
what accomplice to murder means, right?

198
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:34,080
You can't be serious.

199
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,205
Tonight's security footage

200
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,318
from Hudolin McGuire Subway
Station mysteriously disappeared.

201
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,539
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

202
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:43,764
Nope. Nothing, zilch, nada.

203
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,933
She's covering for her husband.

204
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,393
- Oh, come...
- That certainly is convenient.

205
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,767
And when exactly were
you planning on telling me

206
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,328
about Roy Harper's involvement?

207
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:53,674
Honestly?

208
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:56,742
After we saved Star City from
the Ninth Circle's attack.

209
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,815
We know how you guys feel
about "the unsanctioned."

210
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,890
Let's get real.

211
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,993
Emiko and the Ninth
Circle know our faces.

212
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:04,138
Roy was our ace in the hole.

213
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,868
So you risked your new
relationship with the SCPD

214
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:09,274
by teaming up with a criminal.

215
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:11,260
Former criminal.

216
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:12,736
Roy left the city 4 years ago,

217
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:14,206
and he's been on the straight
and narrow ever since.

218
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,230
Are you sure about that?

219
00:08:15,255 --> 00:08:16,554
Yes, I'm sure about that.

220
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,229
Because we traced Harper's whereabouts

221
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:19,687
after he faked his death in prison

222
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,055
to get Oliver Queen off the hook,

223
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,280
and his trail went cold
in march of last year.

224
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:26,565
Oh. You mean when
Ricardo Diaz kidnapped Roy

225
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,606
to turn him against Oliver?

226
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,041
You might have forgotten
about that since you

227
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:31,178
weren't exactly on speaking terms
with Oliver and I at the time.

228
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:32,737
It still doesn't explain

229
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,162
where he went after
getting freed from Diaz.

230
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:38,248
I'm sure the kidnapping
was extremely traumatic.

231
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:40,239
He probably just went
to go get some R&R...

232
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:41,861
some Roy relaxation.

233
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,228
Not funny. I see that now.

234
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:51,484
Oh. So this is what legit looks like.

235
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:55,221
That's right. A badge and a bunker.

236
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:56,376
Never thought I'd see the day.

237
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,798
Good seeing you.

238
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:00,557
I'm glad you're finally
seeing it in person again.

239
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,982
- Ooh!
- Oh!

240
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:04,682
Oh, I missed you so much.

241
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,438
Sorry. I'm just a little
overly emotional these days.

242
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:09,821
I mean, not overly emotional,

243
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:10,915
not, like, heightened or anything.

244
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:12,001
Because why would that be?

245
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:13,346
My hormones are totally in check,

246
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:14,871
like they always have been.

247
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:17,030
Nerves of steel. You know me. I'm cool.

248
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:20,063
- Ok.
- The Arsenal. Nice to finally meet you.

249
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:21,914
You, too. Thanks for keeping watch.

250
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:24,417
The Glades can use as
many heroes as it can get.

251
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:25,584
Welcome back.

252
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:26,653
All right.

253
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,464
How's Thea?

254
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,607
She's good. Yeah, I think
she's finally found her passion.

255
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,013
You'd be really proud of her.

256
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:35,540
Last I spoke with her, she says

257
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,704
you were zeroing in on
the remaining Lazarus Pits.

258
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:39,098
Yeah, we found two already,

259
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:40,417
- which we destroyed.
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:42,322
We were checking the rest
when we got your call.

261
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,166
Speaking of which, why'd
you ask me to come here

262
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:46,856
instead of Thea?

263
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:51,189
Star City's new terrorist
is Oliver's new sister.

264
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:53,555
What?

265
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,650
Yeah.

266
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:56,416
Don't you think Thea
would want to know that?

267
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,455
- Yeah.
- Yes.

268
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,386
And I have every
intention of telling her.

269
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:03,265
I just... this woman's name is Emiko,

270
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,057
and we wanted to get her into
custody before we told her.

271
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:09,226
I feel like she's finally
free of her life in Star City,

272
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,095
and I... I don't want to hurt her again

273
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,442
with a wound inflicted on our family

274
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:15,533
by our father.

275
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:18,948
Roy had been traveling the world

276
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:21,270
doing some extremely normal sightseeing.

277
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:23,251
Apparently he was too busy
to even send a postcard.

278
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:24,568
Then why did you call him in?

279
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:26,127
Because of the thermal fogger.

280
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:27,251
The what?

281
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:29,882
The scary bio-weapon
that the bad guys needed

282
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:32,460
to spread the bacteria through
the subway's HVAC system.

283
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:34,022
The device found on the scene.

284
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,586
The device found at the scene, yes.

285
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,255
Look,

286
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:40,642
we thought it was weird
that the CEO of Aerodyne

287
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,270
wasn't going to let us protect
it from the Ninth Circle,

288
00:10:42,294 --> 00:10:43,690
so we did some digging.

289
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:47,033
And found that Jason Toth
was dirty. Oliver told us.

290
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:49,386
We knew good old Jason would be
looking for members of the TGA,

291
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,589
and we needed someone with a
vigilante-like set of skills.

292
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:52,936
Voila. Roy Harper.

293
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,848
The facilities at Aerodyne are no joke,

294
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,741
and Roy is incredible at parkour.

295
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:03,256
I'm in.

296
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:04,591
Remember, Roy,
the floor is armed.

297
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:05,897
If you touch anything...

298
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:08,175
and I mean anything... it
is party time at Aerodyne,

299
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,864
- and not in a good way.
- Is there anything I can touch?

300
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:12,321
Walls and ceilings are fair game.

301
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,739
Anything that's not the floor.

302
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:21,676
So far, so good.

303
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:24,045
The control panel's
on the other side of the fan.

304
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:26,469
I got to get higher.

305
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,424
I see it.

306
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:42,553
You hit metal, it's over.
Shot has to be perfect.

307
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:46,064
Margin of error...
0.08, but who's counting?

308
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,333
Your target is the red button...

309
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:48,557
second from the left.

310
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,159
I don't have a shot...

311
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,097
But I will.

312
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,362
Just like that, piece of cake.

313
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:07,580
Oh, which actually
sounds so good right now.

314
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,697
Do you guys have any cake or cupcakes

315
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:11,167
or anything with, like, a cake-like...

316
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:13,492
Felicity, tell us what happened, please.

317
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:15,907
Roy squeezed his way through the blades,

318
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,119
and then after that, it was easy

319
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:20,445
to make his way into
the R&D vault. Boom.

320
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,939
Heads up. We're late to the party.

321
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:25,663
That was our only way in.

322
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:27,287
Not the only way.

323
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:30,821
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Toth.

324
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:33,867
Oh, your new sister... not a fan.

325
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:46,169
Take care of him. Move! Move!

326
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:05,108
Who the hell are you?

327
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,300
Your new worst nightmare.

328
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:08,824
Hmm.

329
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:14,566
See youse lads.

330
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,426
Roy?

331
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,238
We lost the bio-weapon.

332
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:24,557
So let me get this straight.

333
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:26,364
If your plan had worked,

334
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,198
Roy would have successfully stolen

335
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:30,654
a very dangerous piece of tech.

336
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,513
In other words, committed a felony.

337
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,997
Well, technically,

338
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,183
Roy was there to stop the Ninth
Circle from doing what they did,

339
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:37,608
which was steal the device,
so technically,

340
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:38,741
Roy didn't do anything.

341
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:40,966
No harm, no foul. Could
I maybe get a pizza?

342
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,188
- Just a personal size is fine.
- No. I think you've abused

343
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:44,862
your food privileges enough for today.

344
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:47,306
- Ok.
- Tell me what happened.

345
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,136
We stopped the Ninth Circle
from terrorizing the city.

346
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,190
End-stop.

347
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:51,449
And the two fatalities.

348
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:54,780
That wasn't our fault.

349
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,522
Then tell me what you know.

350
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:00,489
We knew that the Ninth Circle

351
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:02,338
wanted to maximize the
bio-weapon's impact.

352
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,630
There were two possible
locations to do that...

353
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:06,822
the ventilation room and
the ventilation shaft.

354
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,180
Oliver went to one, John
and Rene went to the other.

355
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:11,005
Roy and I went to the switch room.

356
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:18,675
Oh, wow! This thing is a fossil,

357
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,499
and not in a fun ice age way.

358
00:14:20,974 --> 00:14:22,474
Can you shut it down?

359
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,405
Well, once I shut down
the ventilation path,

360
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,350
we should be able to
minimize the damage.

361
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,215
Did you have any indication

362
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,806
those guards were still on-site?

363
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,899
No. I didn't see those
guards or any guards.

364
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:42,776
Sounds like we're not
alone. You got eyes?

365
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,530
All I got is two transit
guards in the corridor.

366
00:14:45,555 --> 00:14:47,072
If they're Ninth Circle,
you can't let them in here.

367
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,306
Well, I can't just leave you here.

368
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,047
I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Go.

369
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:00,982
I stayed in that room until
Oliver gave me the go-ahead.

370
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:02,140
And what about Roy?

371
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:03,791
What do you mean?

372
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,112
Can you account for his whereabouts

373
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,436
between the time he left you

374
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:07,800
and the time those guards were killed?

375
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,523
Guys, the vents are shut down.

376
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:11,148
Please tell me that you have the device.

377
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:15,992
He was keeping me safe.

378
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,350
That wasn't the question.

379
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:20,275
Felicity, do you know where Roy was

380
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,966
when those guards were killed?

381
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,710
No, I don't.

382
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:32,938
Roy Harper, you are a
hard man to track down.

383
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,162
I've been traveling.

384
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:38,619
So we've heard. Whereabouts exactly?

385
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:40,243
The world.

386
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:42,769
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

387
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:45,328
You've got quite the
rap sheet, Mr. Harper.

388
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:48,388
B&E, Grand Theft Auto...

389
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:51,655
Aggravated assault.

390
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:55,005
So is that why you came
back to Star City, Roy,

391
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,485
to steal a device from Aerodyne?

392
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,011
I came back to help prevent
Emiko from stealing it.

393
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:01,338
She's the one you guys
should be going after.

394
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:02,863
We will.

395
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:05,804
But first, why don't
you tell us what happened

396
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,083
after you failed to stop her?

397
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:12,915
I went back to the bunker
to figure out a new plan.

398
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:15,661
According to Felicity,
all Emiko had to do was

399
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:17,646
fill that device with some
sort of killer bacteria

400
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:20,279
and Star City would've turned
into a real-life horror movie.

401
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:21,637
Cygnus X-1.

402
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:25,563
Yeah. So she ran some sort of algorithm

403
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:27,739
and came up with a few possible places.

404
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:30,164
And that eventually
led you to the subway.

405
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,122
Cut to the chase.

406
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:34,347
What happened when you got there?

407
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:37,540
Specifically, what happened
after you left Felicity?

408
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,729
I didn't want to leave
her, but she insisted.

409
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,914
We thought the Ninth Circle
might have showed up.

410
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,981
Turns out we were right.

411
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,159
Those guys in the hoods jumped me.

412
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:54,594
After I took out the
first one, they just...

413
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:57,520
Just kept coming.

414
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,115
I tried to fight back,

415
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,031
but there were just too many of them.

416
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,402
The last thing I remember is

417
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:26,814
I was taking a mace to the face

418
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,506
before everything went black.

419
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:31,229
And when I came to,

420
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:32,837
you all were on the scene,

421
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:35,597
and the guards, they were already dead.

422
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:37,772
So you have absolutely no idea

423
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:39,463
who may have killed them.

424
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,523
It's rather convenient, don't you think?

425
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:49,392
You being unconscious at the same time

426
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,047
two men are brutally murdered?

427
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:53,943
You think I did it?

428
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,603
Whose side are you on?

429
00:17:57,628 --> 00:18:01,330
I am on the only side
that matters... the truth.

430
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:04,197
Now, why don't you stop wasting my time

431
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:06,271
and tell me what really happened?

432
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:09,369
I told you, Roy was
unconscious when I found him,

433
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:12,635
and that was before the
guards fired their sidearms.

434
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,860
So you don't think he killed them.

435
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,318
I just don't see how he could have.

436
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:20,100
You don't have to protect him, John.

437
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,192
Dinah, I'm not.

438
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:23,550
Right, right.

439
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:25,505
But that is what you do, isn't it?

440
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:29,060
You always put other people's
lives before your own.

441
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,341
At some point you might discover

442
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:32,833
not everybody's worth it.

443
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:37,684
Look, you don't know
Roy Harper the way I do.

444
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,109
He's had his troubles.

445
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:41,701
But deep inside, he's a very good man.

446
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:44,183
Well, you're very quick to defend Roy.

447
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,378
What about yourself?

448
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:47,496
Why? Are you asking me
if I killed those guards?

449
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:48,761
It certainly doesn't help

450
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:51,487
that you have blood on your sleeve.

451
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,607
Walk us through what
happened after you arrived.

452
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,250
Well, there were two
possible disbursement sites.

453
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:02,851
Oliver headed for the ventilation room.

454
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:06,598
And Rene and I headed
for the ventilation shaft.

455
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,578
And that's when we ran into trouble.

456
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:15,589
Access should be here,
ahead on the right.

457
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,267
Emiko.

458
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:25,628
- I've got her.
- Rene!

459
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,693
She's mine. Go secure the device.

460
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,804
So that's when you and Rene split up.

461
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:37,197
Rene was right. The
device was the priority.

462
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:38,623
I was headed for the ventilation shaft,

463
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:43,149
and that's when I found Roy unconscious.

464
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:46,108
And this was before the gunshots.

465
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,755
That's correct.

466
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,703
I ran toward the source

467
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:07,382
as fast as I could, but I was too late.

468
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:11,348
I checked their pulse,

469
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:13,184
but they were already dead.

470
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:15,709
That's how I got blood on my sleeve.

471
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,868
What about Mr. Ramirez?

472
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,827
Where was he during all of this?

473
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:24,207
John?

474
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:28,371
John, tell us what you saw.

475
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,082
When I got to the bodies...

476
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:40,062
That's when I found Rene.

477
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:44,589
Rene?

478
00:23:57,317 --> 00:23:58,649
What happened to your hand, Rene?

479
00:23:58,674 --> 00:23:59,706
I cut it.

480
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,898
Well, that's obvious.

481
00:24:02,102 --> 00:24:03,912
Was it around the same
time you lost your glove?

482
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:05,284
What are you getting at, D.?

483
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:08,081
You know, I've seen plenty
of perps change their tune

484
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:10,440
the longer they sit in here.

485
00:24:10,676 --> 00:24:12,543
The truth has a way of coming out.

486
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:13,944
This isn't my first time

487
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:16,069
being falsely accused of a crime...

488
00:24:16,094 --> 00:24:17,685
Sir.

489
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,776
Two men are dead, Rene.

490
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:22,017
Now, we know Team Arrow was on-site

491
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:25,043
as well as Emiko, which
means our two main suspects

492
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:27,401
are either her or...

493
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,126
Me?

494
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,997
I didn't say that.

495
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:32,434
Well, that's what you were thinking,

496
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,241
'cause you've been
looking for any excuse

497
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,892
not to trust me this whole year.

498
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:37,471
That's because you have given me

499
00:24:37,496 --> 00:24:39,630
every reason not to.

500
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:42,205
How many times have I
warned you about Emiko?

501
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,312
I told you she wasn't trustworthy.

502
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:45,702
You refused to listen.

503
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:46,727
Well, now she ends up

504
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,685
on the scene of an
attempted terrorist attack

505
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,229
and a double homicide,
and you were there, too.

506
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:54,195
And you what? You think I helped her?

507
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,887
I just want the truth, Rene.

508
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:58,797
Tell me what you were doing
before that mission tonight.

509
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:00,240
We managed to get the info

510
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,335
on the Ninth Circle's target

511
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,059
thanks to Felicity's algorithm.

512
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,718
She traced the chemical
signature of the bio-weapon

513
00:25:05,743 --> 00:25:07,108
to the subway station.

514
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:09,267
And that's when you headed off.

515
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:11,291
Yeah. Straight away.

516
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,660
You good with all this?

517
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,712
I'll be better once we get
to the subway and stop her.

518
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:23,274
I know that it's going to be
tough going up against Emiko.

519
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:25,173
You guys got really close, Rene.

520
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,471
If you're gonna try and give me
a pep talk, save it. I'm good.

521
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,562
I don't want to give you a pep talk.

522
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:32,493
I want to make sure that if
you're going out on a mission,

523
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:34,884
you're doing it with a clear head.

524
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:42,010
When I first met Emiko,

525
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:44,346
avenging her mother's death

526
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:47,411
and helping the Glades were the
only things that mattered to her.

527
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:48,639
Right, except she was lying.

528
00:25:48,664 --> 00:25:51,201
Then why did she kill Dante?

529
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,317
Why'd she do it?

530
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:55,953
I mean, she turned on a
member of the Ninth Circle

531
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:58,829
for her mother. That tells me
that family means more to her.

532
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:01,727
Fine. It doesn't
change the fact that she

533
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:06,087
could potentially kill
thousands... thousands of people.

534
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:11,057
I know, I know, but she's
still your sister, man.

535
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:13,611
Doesn't any part of you think
that maybe she's doing all of this

536
00:26:13,636 --> 00:26:16,203
because of what your father did to her,

537
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,088
that if not for her upbringing,

538
00:26:18,113 --> 00:26:20,580
she'd be fighting with
us instead of against us?

539
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:22,978
A big part of me thinks about that...

540
00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:25,878
All the time.

541
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:28,361
At a certain point, Rene,

542
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,320
people need to take responsibility

543
00:26:30,345 --> 00:26:32,145
for their actions.

544
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:38,774
Emiko made her choice. I've made mine.

545
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:42,724
You need to make yours.

546
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:52,574
There's something I'm not
liking about your story, Rene.

547
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:54,720
The part where we save the city?

548
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:55,932
The part you're not telling us.

549
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:57,722
Everything I told you
tonight is the truth.

550
00:26:57,747 --> 00:26:59,735
Then why did we find your fingerprints

551
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,327
on the murder weapon.

552
00:27:03,575 --> 00:27:05,153
What were you doing
with that pipe, Rene?

553
00:27:05,177 --> 00:27:06,434
I didn't do anything.

554
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,192
That's getting harder
and harder to believe.

555
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:10,476
John and I split up.

556
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:13,086
He went after the bomb.

557
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:14,411
I went after Emiko.

558
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:15,739
And did you catch up to her?

559
00:27:17,948 --> 00:27:19,247
No.

560
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:28,815
Emiko, it's not too late.

561
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,560
- Let me help you.
- I don't need your help.

562
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:32,556
I spared you once.

563
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:34,614
This time, I won't be so generous.

564
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,138
Why are you doing this?!

565
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:38,797
Because the Queens
took everything from me.

566
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:41,548
Now it's my turn to take
everything from them.

567
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,525
This isn't you.

568
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,650
You care about the Glades.

569
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:50,239
You're dressed as the new Green Arrow,

570
00:27:50,264 --> 00:27:51,864
and you killed Dante.

571
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:53,756
And that proves what exactly?

572
00:27:53,781 --> 00:27:55,258
That finding your mother's killer means

573
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:57,101
more to you than the Ninth Circle.

574
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:59,259
Why else would you risk
murdering their leader?

575
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:04,599
You really don't get it.
Dante wasn't their leader.

576
00:28:04,624 --> 00:28:06,424
I am.

577
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,711
Your mother would hate
what you've become.

578
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,134
Agh!

579
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:19,463
I was still searching for Emiko

580
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:20,686
when I heard the gunshots.

581
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:24,769
Where were you exactly?

582
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,854
Some random corridor.

583
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,295
The gunshots were close.

584
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
I followed the sound, which
led me to the platform.

585
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,381
You know we have a witness

586
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,132
who pins you as the
first person on the scene.

587
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:35,956
Yeah. John. He showed up...

588
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:39,173
he showed up seconds after I did.

589
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:44,178
What are you not telling us, Rene?

590
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:49,272
Someone else got to the
platform before I did.

591
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:02,642
And who was it?

592
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:06,284
It was Oliver.

593
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:14,045
Bring back Mr. Queen.

594
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:18,329
You didn't tell us the truth.

595
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:21,365
What are you talking about?

596
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:24,108
Your friend Ramirez says he
found you near the bodies.

597
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,844
I have no more ways to tell you

598
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:28,229
I didn't kill those guards.

599
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:29,814
Let me tell you what I think.

600
00:29:29,872 --> 00:29:31,571
I think you and your team were there

601
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:33,028
to stop the terrorist attack.

602
00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:34,303
I even think you did.

603
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,827
But one of the bad guys got
away. You went after them.

604
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:41,076
And transit guards Rosenberg
and Kim got in your way.

605
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:44,525
I didn't kill those guards.

606
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,217
Ok, then who did, Oliver?

607
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,283
Because I really want to help you,

608
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,964
but I can't do that unless
you're honest with us.

609
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,055
So let's try this again.

610
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,429
Tell me what went on in that subway,

611
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:55,086
and I want the truth this time.

612
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:08,367
After we separated,

613
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,126
I went to the ventilation room.

614
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:13,286
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

615
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:16,080
Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful.

616
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,939
One wrong move, and we'll
all be in a load of trouble.

617
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:24,223
Aah!

618
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:28,354
You're a real pain in
the arse, you know that?

619
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:15,806
That's not the part we're interested in.

620
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,605
We appreciate you disarming the device,

621
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,896
but that's not why you're here.

622
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,855
The device is a weapon

623
00:31:21,223 --> 00:31:22,957
that was gonna kill thousands of people,

624
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:25,057
and now it's in SCPD custody,

625
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:26,782
thanks to us.

626
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:29,920
What happened next?

627
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,637
I was still in the ventilation room

628
00:31:33,662 --> 00:31:35,429
when I heard the gunshots.

629
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,946
The guards must have
gotten off a few shots.

630
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,103
Oh, no.

631
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:51,836
But when I got there...

632
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,347
The killer was standing over them.

633
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:01,950
They were gone.

634
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,054
Blood everywhere.

635
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:07,989
And you got a good look at who did it.

636
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:10,775
Yeah.

637
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Then who was it?

638
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:17,476
Oliver, then who was it?

639
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:19,420
It was my sister.

640
00:32:24,562 --> 00:32:26,995
Emiko killed those guards.

641
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:36,050
I can't believe we're letting him go.

642
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:39,019
Oliver Queen is protecting his sister.

643
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:40,455
It makes sense.

644
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:43,224
I don't know. Something
doesn't feel right.

645
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:44,475
We don't have enough evidence

646
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,897
to keep them here.

647
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,855
Their stories line up.

648
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,713
Mayor Pollard agrees.

649
00:32:57,973 --> 00:32:59,900
So how's it look?

650
00:33:01,711 --> 00:33:03,644
Pollard bought it.

651
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,259
Yeah, as far as the SCPD is concerned,

652
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,235
Emiko was the one who
killed those guards.

653
00:33:09,635 --> 00:33:12,435
You all are very, very good liars.

654
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,927
So are you, D.

655
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,458
We know that this wasn't easy for you.

656
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:20,583
No, it wasn't.

657
00:33:20,696 --> 00:33:22,689
If anybody finds out about what we did,

658
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:24,447
our partnership with the SCPD is over.

659
00:33:24,472 --> 00:33:26,405
And the same goes for my job.

660
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:28,849
We just risked everything.

661
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,807
That's why we all had to agree.

662
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:35,642
This was the only way.

663
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:56,762
- I've got her.
- Rene.

664
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,021
She's mine. Secure the device.

665
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,266
I'll be fine. Go.

666
00:34:10,612 --> 00:34:12,445
Aah!

667
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,174
Hey! What the hell's going on down here?

668
00:35:19,735 --> 00:35:21,267
Vigilante attack in progress,

669
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:22,692
Hudolin McGuire Metro Station.

670
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:40,110
Roy!

671
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:42,941
Roy, stop it! Look at me!

672
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:44,465
Roy, stop!

673
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:02,063
Rene! Rene, don't touch that.

674
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:12,060
They're dead.

675
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:17,708
What the hell happened here?

676
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,189
What are we gonna do?

677
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,319
We have to protect him.

678
00:36:50,637 --> 00:36:52,086
Two innocent people are dead,

679
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:53,811
and we're covering it up.

680
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,524
Dinah, if someone
on this team goes down,

681
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:58,419
this entire team goes down.

682
00:36:58,444 --> 00:37:00,388
He's absolutely right.
And if pollard knew the truth,

683
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:01,577
we would be sitting in lockup

684
00:37:01,602 --> 00:37:02,902
while the city rehashes

685
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:04,450
whether vigilantes are a threat or not.

686
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,041
Which would free Emiko up

687
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:08,000
for evil plan B.

688
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:10,999
But Roy is not a part of this team.

689
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:13,267
He's been gone for months
doing who knows what.

690
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:16,953
With due respect, you don't
know what he's been through.

691
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,647
Roy is and always will be
as much a part of this team

692
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:20,830
as the rest of us.

693
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:22,485
Except the rest of us don't go around

694
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:23,691
killing innocent people.

695
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:25,060
Dinah, as horrible as that was,

696
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:28,090
let's not lose sight that
we stopped an attack tonight.

697
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,597
And we framed Emiko for murder.

698
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,886
Emiko's a murderer,

699
00:37:30,911 --> 00:37:32,903
a murderer who's the
leader of the Ninth Circle.

700
00:37:32,928 --> 00:37:34,595
And as long as she is out there,

701
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,353
this city will remain under threat.

702
00:37:36,378 --> 00:37:38,145
I hope we can all agree on that.

703
00:37:38,784 --> 00:37:40,650
Yes.

704
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:45,103
My search algorithms are up and running.

705
00:37:45,648 --> 00:37:46,681
It might actually be a good time

706
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:48,705
to go ask Roy what happened.

707
00:37:49,824 --> 00:37:51,257
I'm pretty sure I already know.

708
00:37:58,552 --> 00:37:59,953
That wasn't Mirakuru.

709
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,539
No.

710
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,958
How did it happen?

711
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:10,079
What do you mean?

712
00:38:11,394 --> 00:38:12,869
How did you die?

713
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:19,054
How did you know?

714
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:22,458
You, Thea, and Nyssa
left here over a year ago

715
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:23,808
in search of Lazarus Pits,

716
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:27,016
and I have not seen bloodlust like that

717
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,073
since Thea was resurrected by one.

718
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:32,477
Damn it.

719
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:42,432
To help, I need to know what happened.

720
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:48,346
The Thanatos Guild had us surrounded.

721
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:50,096
I tried to get Thea to safety,

722
00:38:51,044 --> 00:38:54,444
but I was hit with an arrow,

723
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:57,137
which... which is ironic.

724
00:38:57,771 --> 00:38:59,257
I don't really remember a lot after,

725
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:02,607
except for... except
for seeing Nyssa and Thea

726
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,811
destroy the Pit.

727
00:39:03,836 --> 00:39:05,374
The one they used to bring you back.

728
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:07,962
Yeah.

729
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:11,405
Nyssa had the Lotus Elixir.

730
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,589
She and Thea thought

731
00:39:12,614 --> 00:39:14,982
that we could control
the bloodlust, and we did.

732
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:16,339
Until you didn't.

733
00:39:16,364 --> 00:39:18,565
I keep trying to figure out why.

734
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,782
And all I can think of is that maybe

735
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:23,206
the Mirakuru changed something.

736
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:26,665
You know, I never
would've come back here

737
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,752
if I would've known
what was gonna happen.

738
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:33,174
- I never meant to hurt anyone.
- I know...

739
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,234
But keeping this information from us,

740
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:40,349
it jeopardized all the things that

741
00:39:40,374 --> 00:39:42,023
we have been working for this year.

742
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,082
I never asked you to cover for me.

743
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:46,280
I didn't want you to.

744
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:47,671
You never have to ask me.

745
00:39:50,612 --> 00:39:51,846
Ever.

746
00:39:54,663 --> 00:39:55,947
Guys?

747
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,566
Felicity has something.

748
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:04,903
I expanded my search
parameters, and presto.

749
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:06,361
Facial recognition puts Emiko

750
00:40:06,386 --> 00:40:08,488
in an abandoned building
a few miles outside of Star City.

751
00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:09,752
Any background on the building?

752
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:11,176
I mean, you name it, it's been it.

753
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,526
Hospital, shipping warehouse,

754
00:40:12,551 --> 00:40:13,583
manufacturing plant.

755
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:14,920
I mean, it's had more owners

756
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,270
than a "fortune" 500 company.

757
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:17,679
Which means it could be
a cover for something.

758
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:18,902
Yeah, something being

759
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:20,130
the Ninth Circle's headquarters

760
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:21,184
here in Star City.

761
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:23,761
Emiko's there, which is
all that matters to us.

762
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:25,853
We're going after her as a team.

763
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:28,159
Are you sure?

764
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:31,050
We got your back.

765
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,540
Oh, hey, Dinah!

766
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:37,213
Thank you for wiping that
security camera footage.

767
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:39,170
I could not get there
before the cops did.

768
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,963
I thought that was you.

769
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,105
No.

770
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,770
Let's go wide.

771
00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:00,228
Arsenal, on my 6.

772
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,744
Overwatch, any heat signatures?

773
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,268
No. Not even yours.

774
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:07,010
Thermal imaging can't penetrate

775
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:08,230
through those walls.

776
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:12,261
I have eyes on her.

777
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:13,985
Moving to intercept.

778
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:19,931
Oliver, confirm your location.

779
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:29,065
This is over.

780
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,690
Is it?

781
00:41:30,715 --> 00:41:32,269
Right now, Sergeant Bingsley

782
00:41:32,294 --> 00:41:33,644
is receiving an anonymous gift

783
00:41:33,669 --> 00:41:34,968
delivered to his office:

784
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,837
The missing security footage

785
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:38,462
from the Metro Station.

786
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:41,430
You're the one who made it disappear?

787
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:43,915
You set us up.

788
00:41:52,182 --> 00:41:53,582
What do you want?!

789
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:55,874
For you to suffer the way I suffered.

790
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:58,334
You and your team are
gonna die in there.

791
00:41:58,707 --> 00:42:02,009
And I will be out there
destroying your legacy.

792
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,763
You'll die a villain

793
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,044
just like our father did,

794
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:09,069
and I will be the cause
of both of your deaths.

795
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:11,295
And justice will finally be served.

796
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:20,842
What did you say?

797
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:22,534
I had the chance

798
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,293
to warn our father about the "gambit."

799
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:28,647
It was rigged to explode,

800
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,858
and I knew about it.

801
00:42:31,865 --> 00:42:33,460
I let our father die because

802
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:35,385
he didn't deserve to live.

803
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,799
And neither do you.

804
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,408
Bye, brother.

805
00:42:57,921 --> 00:43:00,387
Oliver, do you read me?

806
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,780
Does anybody copy?

807
00:43:03,268 --> 00:43:05,071
Oliver, come in.

808
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:08,254
John?

809
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:10,204
John, come in! Oliver?

810
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:13,057
Come in, please!

811
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:14,633
Come in!

812
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:22,079
