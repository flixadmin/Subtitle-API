1
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,375
<i>There's a group of men</i>
<i>called The Firm.</i>

2
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,791
<i>They've been running things
for a long, long time.</i>

3
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:38,375
<i>And when they need someone
to clean up their mess…</i>

4
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,083
<i>…They send me.</i>

5
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,158
<i>Go get your helmet.</i>
<i>Let's go to the store.</i>

6
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,666
<i>You look so cute, Nit.</i>

7
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,416
- <i>Sam.</i>
- Nathan.

8
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,875
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- At home. Sewing.

9
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,375
<i>Meet me at the diner.</i>

10
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,041
Why?

11
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,916
How much trouble am I in?

12
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,458
An extra scoop for my favorite client.

13
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,708
Thanks, Rose.

14
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,000
I put in an extra scoop
for my favorite client.

15
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,208
-Thanks, Rose,
-I'm sure she won't be long.

16
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,583
You clearly don't know
my mother very well.

17
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,125
Hey, stranger.

18
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,791
- Can I lighten your load?
- Not carrying today, Rose.

19
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:47,041
There's a first time for everything.
She's over there.

20
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,791
Thanks for keeping an eye on her.

21
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,583
You said you'd be here in 30 minutes.

22
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm a few minutes late.

23
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,333
Three hours.

24
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,833
You're bleeding.

25
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,791
Just another day at the office.
Did you bring it?

26
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,791
Anna May sure can pick them.

27
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,541
- It's loaded.
- Good girl.

28
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,875
Listen, I, um…
have to disappear for a while.

29
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,833
- Then I'm coming with you.
- You can't. Not this time.

30
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,375
Nathan will be here soon.
He'll take care of you when I'm gone.

31
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,708
- I don't want to go with Nathan.
- I'm doing this for your own good.

32
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,958
I'll stay in the library
with Anna May and the others.

33
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,625
It's too dangerous.

34
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,583
What's going on?

35
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,125
It's… it's complicated.

36
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,750
Tell me.

37
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not a kid any more.

38
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,500
No, you're not.

39
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,041
You haven't touched your milkshake.

40
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,250
Didn't want to drink it without you.

41
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,541
How long will you be gone?

42
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,166
I have to make a quick phone call.

43
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,791
Stay here.

44
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,583
Evening, gentlemen.
Can I lighten your load?

45
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,125
- Get lost.
- Hey.

46
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,208
Hello, little girl.

47
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,666
Mommy says I'm not allowed
to talk to strangers.

48
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,166
This "Mommy" looks a lot like you.

49
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,416
Only bigger and more stabby.

50
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,333
Got my father's blood all over her.

51
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,666
I don't like you.

52
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,625
Enough games.

53
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,166
Where is she?

54
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,375
Go kiss a pig.

55
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:06,375
Tell me where she is.

56
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,750
Close your eyes, baby girl.

57
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:36,791
Mom!

58
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,666
Evening, darling.

59
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,833
- Can I lighten your load?
- I'm clean.

60
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,000
Regular clean or diner clean?

61
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,416
- Forgot about this one.
- Of course, sugar.

62
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,541
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

63
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,958
Boy.

64
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,541
Oh, these girls are worse than the Stasi.

65
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,916
You hurt?

66
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,500
Just another day at the office.

67
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,791
Wow, you sound just like your mother.

68
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,708
I don't have a mother.

69
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,375
Well, you sure have her temper.

70
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,208
What the hell happened tonight?

71
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,041
Bad intel.

72
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,000
You said four or five idiots
with peashooters.

73
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,416
Yes. And?

74
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,916
Oh, for Christ's sake, child.

75
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,916
This was supposed to be low-profile,
not a bloody massacre.

76
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,125
Next time, I'll just let them shoot me.

77
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,125
Next time, just do what you're told.

78
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,083
Remember who you're working for.
As long as they're happy…

79
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,750
You called me here oh-so-urgently
just to remind me of that?

80
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No.

81
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,208
Your talents are needed, pronto.

82
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,208
Somebody stole from us.

83
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,750
Who's crazy enough to steal from The Firm?

84
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,375
Somebody who doesn't know
who we really are.

85
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,291
An accountant.
From the clean side of the business.

86
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,833
How much did he take?

87
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,791
Enough to earn a visit from you.

88
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,083
We need that money back.

89
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,208
Good girl.

90
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,625
I'll text you the address later.

91
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,166
Oh, and get rid of
those stone-age firearms you carry.

92
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,041
- I've had them for years.
- Find an open vendor.

93
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,833
And get yourself some clean boomsticks.

94
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,625
We can't have you linked
to that war zone you left behind, can we?

95
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,375
Did you know about this
little endeavor my son had on the side?

96
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,875
Sorry, Uncle. I had no idea.

97
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,375
Where's the shoe?

98
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,791
What shoe?

99
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,000
The shoe that is not currently covering
my son's left foot.

100
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,791
The one that looks like the right one.

101
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,083
<i>That </i>fucking shoe.

102
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,791
- I don't know.
- Well, find it.

103
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,375
Found it, Mr. McAlester.

104
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,458
Nobody tells his mother about this.

105
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,625
We'll tell her he ran off with some girl.

106
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,333
I get it.

107
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,333
Now, bring me the heads of the men
that killed my boy.

108
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,708
Hmm.

109
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hello, dear.

110
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,791
What can I do for you?

111
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,041
I need to exchange some… books.

112
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,250
Well, that's nice.

113
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,625
Not a lot of people your age
read nowadays.

114
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,416
- Do you have a card with us?
- No.

115
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,166
I'd like to open one.

116
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,375
Wonderful.

117
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,875
What kind of… books are you interested in?

118
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,208
Mostly smaller ones.

119
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,083
A few heavies.

120
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,375
Well, you won't find them there.

121
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,375
Those are our children's sections.

122
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,583
The Enchanted Forest…

123
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,958
and The Never-Ending Ocean.

124
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,208
They sound like fun.

125
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,708
Have we met before?

126
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,833
You seem so… familiar.

127
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,791
I'm embarrassed to say it's been a while
since I visited a library.

128
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,541
Well, that's no way to live, dear.

129
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,916
Let's get you into a good book.

130
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:58,833
Come.

131
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:34,416
Anna May, this lovely young lady
wants to open an account with us.

132
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,333
Well,

133
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,416
Madeleine should have told you
that we don't accept new readers

134
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,875
without a reference.

135
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,291
Madeleine had a hunch.

136
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,541
Fudge your hunches,
if you pardon my French.

137
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,375
- Technically not French.
- Always literal.

138
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,791
- Yes, I'm literary. I'm a librarian.
- Be that as it may.

139
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,791
Florence, dear.

140
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,208
Would you join us?

141
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,875
I'm afraid we need a tie-breaker.

142
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,750
Madeleine thinks this girl
needs to do some reading.

143
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,375
I told you I had a hunch.

144
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,291
There's something very familiar about her.

145
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,708
Hunch, smunch.

146
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,208
I, on the other hand,
think we should dispose of the body

147
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,875
and then have a long talk
about our onboarding protocols.

148
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,500
You know I can hear you, right?

149
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,625
Hush, girl.

150
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,375
Don't be rude.

151
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,041
Turn around, hon.

152
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,416
And take off your hat.

153
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,500
What did you say your name was?

154
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,666
She didn't.

155
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,375
Hmm. That's odd.

156
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,333
Well, girl?

157
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,625
Cat got your tongue? Speak up.

158
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,666
It's Sam.

159
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,291
Scarlet's kid.

160
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,083
Yeah.

161
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,000
I knew it. Never forget those eyes.

162
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,958
We haven't seen you
since you were yea high.

163
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,416
How is your mother?

164
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,250
Haven't seen her in 15 years.

165
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,000
Well, that's something
we both have in common.

166
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,541
My, my, my. Little Sam.

167
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,708
We hear about you all the time.

168
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,666
You've made
quite a reputation for yourself.

169
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,166
Come here. Give Auntie Madeleine a hug.

170
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,750
Why come back now?

171
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,041
I needed clean guns…

172
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,041
and I guess I needed an excuse.

173
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,583
Nice collection.

174
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,333
And you take good care of them.

175
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,583
Let me guess. You're the sentimental type.

176
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,125
<i>Ro-man-tique.</i>

177
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,750
Sentimental types
don't last long doing this.

178
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,708
So, no. I don't think
I'm the sentimental type.

179
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,291
Tommy Tomahawk.

180
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,666
I looked everywhere for him.

181
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,541
Yeah, sorry about that.

182
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,666
So…

183
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,875
you're an idealist.

184
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,583
Nope. Maybe I don't have a type.

185
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,416
Everybody has a type.

186
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,000
- Everybody.
- Mm-hmm.

187
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,375
Maybe I'm the professional type?

188
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,541
Ah. Old school.

189
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,875
"No women, no children" type.

190
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,208
Women are fair game.

191
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:40,958
Gender equality.

192
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,000
Very progressive.

193
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,500
She's a feminist.

194
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,000
Fine.

195
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,791
You get to live.

196
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,416
We'll make these disappear

197
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,916
and get you into some new, clean books.

198
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,666
You'll need a Jane Austen.

199
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,333
A Charlotte Brontë.

200
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,833
And a Virginia Woolf.

201
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,458
Oh, and an Agatha Christie.

202
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,625
For reading.

203
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,708
Please.

204
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,541
I need to answer this.

205
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:44,375
You need to walk away
and thank God I'm not in a killing mood.

206
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,250
I got no choice.

207
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,833
- No!
- Enough!

208
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,541
<i>Playing hard to get?</i>

209
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,666
<i>Not very smart, moron.</i>

210
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:34,166
<i>Not unless you want me to send
your little princess back in pieces.</i>

211
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,375
<i>You have exactly 60 minutes</i>

212
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,208
<i>to bring the money
to the Gutterball bowling alley.</i>

213
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,625
<i>A minute late, and she'll be celebrating</i>

214
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,666
<i>her ninth birthday with the worms.</i>

215
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,833
<i>60 minutes.</i>

216
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,708
Please.

217
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,708
It's my daughter.

218
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,000
Fuck me.

219
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,625
I'll get the doctor.

220
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,125
Guns go in the cookie jar.

221
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,416
- Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.
- Hmm.

222
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,125
And you brought a new friend.

223
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,583
- What the hell happened?
- I happened.

224
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,916
Just fix him.

225
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,125
I need him on his feet in ten minutes.

226
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,375
Ooh.

227
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,958
He's not going anywhere.

228
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,333
Not in ten minutes.

229
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,166
Maybe not ever.

230
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,291
- So what can we do?
- "We"?

231
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,125
Well, you can start
by not shooting people.

232
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,625
Please. My Emily.

233
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,333
- There's no time.
- Shh.

234
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,625
Just relax. Take it in deep.

235
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,250
Is that laughing gas?

236
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:48,875
Well, duh.

237
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,750
Just patch him up.

238
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,500
I'll be back soon.

239
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,625
He'd better be functional.

240
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,541
She's quite annoying, isn't she?

241
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:07,166
Who am I talking to?

242
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,250
The guy that she shot in the stomach?

243
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,083
- <i>Is it done?</i>
<i>- </i>There's a change of plan.

244
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,166
<i>What are you talking about?
What does that mean?</i>

245
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,333
They kidnapped his little girl.
That's why he stole the money.

246
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:27,291
If I'm not at the Gutterball
in 15 minutes, they'll kill her.

247
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,833
Sam, you're not thinking straight.
Just bring the money back, now!

248
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:34,000
I just need half an hour.
I'll release her and bring the money.

249
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,750
Okay. Listen to me, Sam.

250
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,625
If you screw this one up,
they will give the kill order.

251
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:44,750
<i>And I won't be able to stop them.</i>

252
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,208
She's just a little girl.

253
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,916
I can't leave her to die.

254
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,625
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Don't you dare hang up on me</i>.

255
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:53,958
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Don't you...</i>

256
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,083
Fuck.

257
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:13,250
Go to the Gutterball.
Try to reason with her.

258
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,416
Bring back the money.

259
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,208
Wait.

260
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,416
Now, when I say "reason with her,"

261
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,041
I mean no guns, no knives.

262
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,708
She comes back alive.

263
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:30,208
- Understood?
- Yeah.

264
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,208
And for God's sake…

265
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
be careful.

266
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:38,166
Remember who you're dealing with.

267
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,166
What are you waiting for? Go.

268
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,375
One of the men Sam killed
was Jim McAlester's son.

269
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,333
Are you sure
it was McAlester's kid?

270
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,708
Yes.

271
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,666
The board is on its way.

272
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,500
Goddammit, Sam.

273
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,375
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

274
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:06,000
Just someone who has your money.

275
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,833
I want the girl.

276
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,208
<i>Where's Daddy?</i>

277
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:11,416
He…

278
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,083
had an accident.

279
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:15,333
He sent me.

280
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,541
Do you want your money or not?

281
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:43,416
<i>The girl got to this point alive.</i>

282
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,041
<i>But if you as much as sneeze</i>

283
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,583
without my permission,

284
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,250
that could be easily rectified.

285
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,083
- Got it.
- <i>Good.</i>

286
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,625
<i>Now, see the locker behind you?</i>

287
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,916
W<i>eapon and phone go in the locker,</i>

288
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,875
<i>along with the clothes you're wearing.</i>

289
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:05,208
Slam the door shut, and it'll lock.

290
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,208
<i>Go to the Westfield Mall
across the street.</i>

291
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,708
You, the suitcase, the new clothes

292
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,666
<i>and the little girl's phone.</i>

293
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:16,416
Seriously?

294
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,708
Ten minutes.

295
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,166
Hello, Sam.

296
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,583
Bonehead.

297
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,083
- Hey, Sam.
- Sam.

298
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,041
Boneheads.

299
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:55,416
- I really don't have time for this.
- Nathan's worried about you.

300
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,916
Doesn't want you to do anything stupid.

301
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,500
So why don't you hand over the suitcase,

302
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,291
and nobody gets hurt.

303
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:08,208
Counter-offer: Go back to Nathan,
tell him you tried, but I roughed you up.

304
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:09,750
Ooh.

305
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,916
You can beat each other up
for added realism.

306
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,750
- That's funny.
- What?

307
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,791
No guns today?

308
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,791
Nathan doesn't want you hurt.

309
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,666
Not too badly, anyway.

310
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,958
Oh, that is so sweet.

311
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,625
I'll try not to kill you, too.

312
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:23,333
Who the fuck is she?

313
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,458
<i>Ground floor. Video Beast.</i>

314
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,541
Cutting it close.

315
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,583
I had a few hiccups.

316
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:14,416
We saw what you did with those hiccups.
How do we know you're not a cop?

317
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,000
Can a cop do what I just did?

318
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:19,291
I just want the girl.

319
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,833
Then we'll get along just fine.

320
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,750
There's a shopping cart behind you.

321
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,833
Put the suitcase inside.

322
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,750
Push the shopping cart towards us,

323
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,208
and we'll push the girl cart towards you.

324
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,041
One.

325
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,791
Two.

326
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,458
Three.

327
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:01,916
It's okay. You're safe.

328
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,875
I'll be right back.

329
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,666
We're all stinking rich,
you magnificent bastards.

330
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,916
Stop the fucking car.

331
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,708
Holy fuck!

332
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,583
You greedy traitor!

333
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,125
No… no!

334
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,250
No, no, no!

335
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Fuck.

336
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,541
Anything broken?

337
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,250
- Are you bleeding?
- No.

338
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,000
Bleeding on the inside?

339
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,875
How can you tell?

340
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,708
It's inside.

341
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,833
You're probably fine. Let's go.

342
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,000
Try to keep up.

343
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:26,666
I see you morons have found my stash.

344
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,750
This is some good shit, doc.

345
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,958
You should be very proud of yourself.

346
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,125
This is not a toy.

347
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,250
It's for medicinal use only.

348
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:46,791
So…

349
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,625
who fucked you up like this?

350
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,250
A girl.

351
00:36:57,166 --> 00:37:00,416
A girl made you look
like you're from <i>The Walking Dead</i>?

352
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,583
I've never felt
pain like this before, doc.

353
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,416
She got us good, doc. I…

354
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,208
I don't think I'll ever walk again.

355
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,250
There must be an epidemic,

356
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,291
'cause I got a guy in the next room
who's got similar symptoms.

357
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,291
What do you mean?

358
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,583
I mean…

359
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,083
a girl fucked him up, too.

360
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,791
Keep talking, doc.

361
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,666
You're bleeding.

362
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,416
It's just a scratch.

363
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,166
It can get infected.

364
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:40,166
Worms will get in there and lay eggs.
Then they'll have to cut your arm off.

365
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,541
That's what they teach in school
these days?

366
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,125
Discovery Channel.

367
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,166
Thank God we're going straight
to the hospital.

368
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:50,791
Is my daddy there?

369
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,208
Yeah.

370
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,875
Is that why he didn't come?

371
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,708
Is he sick?

372
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:00,708
He…

373
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,083
It's okay.

374
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,166
You don't have to lie for him.

375
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:08,250
He never comes when he says he will.

376
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,458
Here, just let me help you.

377
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:23,708
Thank you.

378
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:27,708
Sure.

379
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,166
Are you sure it's her?

380
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,625
<i>Yeah. She dropped off</i>
<i>some guy she shot.</i>

381
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:36,375
Said she's going to come back
and pick him up later.

382
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,208
And the money?

383
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:41,375
She had it last time we saw her.

384
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,375
Then get it back.

385
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:46,333
She's still getting the VIP treatment?

386
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,458
- Do whatever it takes.
- <i>Alright, alright, alright.</i>

387
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:01,250
Now that's what I call a work benefit.

388
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,541
Just, uh, stay behind me, okay?

389
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,083
Come on.

390
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,125
I'll get the doctor.

391
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,250
She's here.

392
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,916
Shot in the shoulder.

393
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,625
Maybe you should take your break now.

394
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,125
So. My payment?

395
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,583
- Oh!
- Shh.

396
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,333
Transferred to your account.

397
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,375
Now…

398
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:19,458
What's the plan, doc?

399
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:23,791
Oh.

400
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:27,166
Once I stick her with this,
she'll start losing control of her arms.

401
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,666
After 60 seconds or so…

402
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,083
she's a sitting duck.

403
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,250
What's wrong with you?
Let me do this right.

404
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,166
It's just a scratch.

405
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,791
Well, scratches get infected.

406
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:00,375
That's how you lose an arm.

407
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,625
Mm. Yeah, I heard.

408
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,583
What happened to him?

409
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,125
Someone shot him.

410
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:14,333
I hear that's pretty lethal.

411
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,458
Let's fix this.

412
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:19,458
Don't. I'm good.

413
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,125
Trust me, you'll need this.

414
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,125
I said, I'm good.

415
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:29,458
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

416
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,916
You motherfu...

417
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,916
- Ah!
- 60 seconds!

418
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,833
60 seconds!

419
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,666
60 seconds.

420
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:54,166
Oh, come on. Come on!

421
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:00,208
Listen, I need your help.

422
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:03,250
Some bad men are coming to hurt us.

423
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,333
Those who killed my dad?

424
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,375
I promise I'll explain,
but right now I need your help, okay?

425
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,875
- Okay.
- Good.

426
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:11,416
Grab the biggest knife.

427
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:13,791
Careful of the sharp end.

428
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,375
Okay…

429
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,458
Now grab the tape.

430
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,208
Excellent. Tape it to my hand.

431
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,916
36…

432
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,708
32…

433
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,666
Now tape the gun to my other hand.

434
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,583
Careful. It's loaded.

435
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,541
15… 14…

436
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,833
Round two, bitch.

437
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:00,291
Boneheads?

438
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:03,291
Better get ready!

439
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,833
Oh, thank God it's just you three.

440
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:08,750
For a second there,
I thought it was someone dangerous.

441
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:13,125
The only reason you're still alive
is 'cause Nathan wanted it that way.

442
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:17,333
Now, take my finger
and put it on the trigger.

443
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,166
Well, it's over now.

444
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:22,125
I'm going to tear you into little pieces.

445
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:25,666
And I'm gonna love every second of it.

446
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,000
Great. Hold that thought.

447
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,166
I'll be right out.

448
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,583
You're being very brave, Emily.

449
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:44,416
I need you to do one last thing for me,

450
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,458
and then go and hide, okay?

451
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:48,916
Okay.

452
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,125
Hey, Bonehead.

453
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:52,458
Emily.

454
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:57,708
I need you to come grab the phone.

455
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,833
Come on.

456
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,125
It's okay. Just pick it up.

457
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:30,083
You are a goddamn rock star.

458
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,500
Put it on speaker.

459
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,750
<i>Someone better start talking.</i>

460
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:36,833
That was a…

461
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:41,916
jerk move,
sending the Three Stooges after me.

462
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:45,500
You left us no choice, Sam.

463
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:46,875
There's always a choice.

464
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,291
Oh, well, then,
we can still figure this out.

465
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,208
Just bring the money back.

466
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:54,583
<i>It's gone. The suitcase</i>
<i>was blown to 1000 pieces.</i>

467
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,541
Oh.

468
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:04,458
That's really unfortunate.

469
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,166
So now what?

470
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,875
<i>Oh, you know the drill, Sam.</i>

471
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:11,875
You're no longer under our protection.

472
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:16,416
<i>In your little massacre</i>
<i>earlier tonight,</i>

473
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
<i>you killed the wrong people.</i>

474
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:21,000
Including Jim McAlester's son.

475
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,916
But I was sent by you.

476
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,791
By The Firm.

477
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,291
It doesn't matter.

478
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,750
This is business, Sam.

479
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:36,291
And you landed on the wrong side
of the balance sheet.

480
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,208
So…

481
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,750
It needs to be rectified.

482
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,750
How's this for business?

483
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:49,833
If I get out of this alive,

484
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:52,375
I'm coming for you.

485
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,541
All of you.

486
00:49:57,416 --> 00:49:59,083
I would expect no less.

487
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,666
Goodbye, Sam.

488
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:31,541
- Yes?
<i>- Mr. McAlester, this is Nathan.</i>

489
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:34,291
<i>I'm the head of the HR department
here at The Firm.</i>

490
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:35,583
What do you want?

491
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:38,916
<i>To prevent an all-out war
between our two fine organizations,</i>

492
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,208
<i>we would like to offer you
the woman responsible for your loss.</i>

493
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,541
So you had nothing to do with this?

494
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:49,000
I can assure you, this is not how The Firm
conducts its business, sir.

495
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:53,666
It was an unsolicited action
by a very troubled individual.

496
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,958
Now, I'm sending you her last location.

497
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:59,500
I hope this is satisfactory, sir.

498
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,458
For now.

499
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,625
Take everybody.

500
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,125
Don't come back until it's done.

501
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:37,208
- It's a text message from Nathan.
- What's it say?

502
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,750
"I'm sorry, child.
I can no longer protect you."

503
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:46,166
"I left you a package to help you
survive the next few days."

504
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,541
"Take it, and disappear."

505
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:51,375
Then there's an address.

506
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:54,166
That's close by.

507
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:57,000
What if it's a trap?

508
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:15,791
Can you press the button?
We're parked on minus two.

509
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:44,875
Just remember, you were spared

510
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:47,000
thanks to an eight-year-old girl.

511
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,916
Eight and three quarters.

512
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:52,500
Sorry.

513
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:54,625
Eight and three quarters.

514
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:07,416
Are you a serial killer?

515
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:09,958
What?

516
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:14,166
No…
Where did you learn that expression?

517
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,750
- History Channel.
- Well…

518
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:19,625
I am not a serial killer.

519
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:21,875
But… you kill people?

520
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,833
Yes.

521
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,833
So that makes you a killer.

522
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:27,875
And you've killed more than one.

523
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,333
That is serial.

524
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,250
It's…

525
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:34,000
It's more complicated than that.

526
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:38,375
Serial killers are, uh,
you know, mentally unstable.

527
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:40,791
They kill people out of a compulsive urge.

528
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:45,041
So, why do you kill them?

529
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:49,083
For money?

530
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:52,041
Again, it's, uh…

531
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,708
It's complicated.

532
00:53:57,458 --> 00:54:00,291
Look, I'm going to need your help
for a little longer.

533
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:02,000
Because your arms are still paralyzed?

534
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:04,125
Yes. After that,
I'll get you to your mother.

535
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:05,708
She left a long time ago.

536
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,916
- To your grandparents, then.
- They're dead.

537
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,250
Uncles? Anything?

538
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,916
We'll figure it out, okay?

539
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:24,583
Okay.

540
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:28,000
So, here's an unrelated question.

541
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:30,708
Do you know how to drive?

542
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:34,250
Let's go over it
one more time. Left.

543
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:36,208
Right.

544
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:37,875
Yes, I've got it already.

545
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:40,208
"D" is for drive. "R" is for reverse.

546
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:43,458
And you get to do the easy part,
stepping on the gas and breaks.

547
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:46,458
Don't be a smart-ass. Turn the key.

548
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:49,750
Put it in drive.

549
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,375
Let's go.

550
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:13,791
That's it. Straighten up.

551
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,041
I'm driving.

552
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:18,708
Yes, you are.

553
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,170
Don't worry about the bullets.

554
00:55:30,416 --> 00:55:31,708
Reverse. Now.

555
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:36,208
Hard left!

556
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:40,291
- Put it in drive.
- Yeah.

557
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:43,875
That's it.

558
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:47,125
Hard left.

559
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,708
Go, go, go.

560
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:53,708
Damn it!

561
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:55,791
Get ready. Hard left.

562
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,833
And another hard left.

563
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,750
Shh.

564
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,041
Okay. Put it in reverse.

565
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:22,583
Hard right!

566
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,625
Put it in drive.

567
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,291
Hard left.

568
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:34,958
Put it in reverse.

569
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,083
Okay, kill the lights!

570
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,750
Okay, be quiet. Duck down.

571
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:07,708
That's it. Get down.

572
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:22,000
Okay. Put it in drive…

573
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:24,875
and close your eyes.

574
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,333
Keep her straight.

575
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:46,791
Keep it straight.

576
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:55,625
Are your eyes still closed?

577
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,541
- Yes.
- Good girl.

578
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,375
Put it in reverse.

579
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,833
Can I turn on the radio?

580
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,250
Go nuts.

581
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,166
Emily, doorbell.

582
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:54,791
Didn't I teach you
to always guard your back?

583
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,833
Hi, Mom.

584
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,416
Hi.

585
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,500
Is this, um…

586
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:23,958
Am I a grandmother?

587
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,291
God, no.

588
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Hi. I'm Emily.

589
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,958
- I'm her apprentice.
- What?

590
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:36,125
Emily.

591
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:37,833
Come.

592
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:49,583
<i>…the additional burden</i>
<i>of needing to care</i>

593
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:51,708
<i>for her twelve-month-old daughter.</i>

594
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:53,166
<i>It will be at least a year…</i>

595
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:02,333
That is a hell of a story.

596
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,625
Mm. Hell of a night.

597
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:10,375
Um… Try wiggling your fingers.

598
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,833
- Feeling should come back in no time.
- Yeah, it's already working.

599
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:15,291
Excellent.

600
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:21,541
You look really good. Are you eating well?

601
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:22,791
Cut the crap, Ma.

602
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,708
Where have you been for the last 15 years?

603
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,083
Around.

604
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:33,500
Watching you.

605
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,666
Making sure you're safe.

606
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:39,625
Great parenting.

607
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:42,458
Glad to see you taking an interest
in my career.

608
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:45,791
- I never wanted this life for you.
- How's that working out for you?

609
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,916
I wanted to stay with you
and your aunts, but I couldn't.

610
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:55,916
Why not?

611
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,166
Because I fucked up.

612
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:07,458
I fucked up.

613
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,125
I was young when I had you.

614
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:15,666
We left London, followed your father here.
When he died...

615
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,541
When he was murdered.

616
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:22,708
When he was murdered,
you were a baby. I had nothing.

617
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:25,416
No money, nowhere to go.

618
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:28,458
I knew Anna May from your dad's work.

619
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,250
She and the other aunts took us in.

620
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,291
The best years of my life.

621
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,875
Me too.

622
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:44,000
Fast-forward twelve years,
and I find out who shot your dad.

623
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:46,875
The Russians?

624
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:49,416
The Russians from the diner?

625
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:53,375
Once I knew, I couldn't let him
walk around enjoying life…

626
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:56,750
knowing what he did to us.

627
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:02,416
But he was in bed with The Firm,
so there was a price to pay.

628
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,250
Once I killed him,
there was a mark on my back.

629
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:15,750
I couldn't take you with me.

630
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:19,708
I couldn't risk your life.

631
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,458
So I made Nathan promise to keep you safe.

632
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,125
I guess that's over.

633
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:37,916
There isn't a day that goes by
I don't regret pulling that trigger.

634
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:40,625
But back then, I couldn't help myself.

635
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,458
I'm sorry.

636
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:01,333
Does the kid know about you and her dad?

637
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:02,416
No.

638
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:06,166
But she's smart.

639
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,666
She'll figure it out.

640
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,125
What happens when she does?

641
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:30,375
I think there's a bad man outside.

642
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:37,708
We have to get out of here.

643
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:45,583
- So, what's the plan?
- Can you press the lobby button?

644
01:04:45,666 --> 01:04:48,125
- What plan?
- Come on, you always have a plan.

645
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,833
A secret escape route?
A warehouse filled with guns?

646
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:51,958
I called us an Uber.

647
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:53,500
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

648
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:55,708
An Uber.
What the hell are you talking about?

649
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,541
I know you. You make plans.

650
01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:59,791
And then you make plans
to make other plans.

651
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:02,875
You're frothing at the mouth.

652
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:04,458
It's unbecoming.

653
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,708
Get them!

654
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:33,541
Don't feel bad.

655
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,541
Could happen to anyone.

656
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:37,333
My hand is still paralyzed.

657
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:38,958
Yeah, course it is.

658
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:40,875
- It is.
- I know.

659
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,458
Right. After you, ladies.

660
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:57,041
Come on. Hurry up.

661
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,708
- Where does it go?
- Fucking Narnia.

662
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:00,791
Go. In.

663
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,958
- In!
- Fine.

664
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:18,958
- No plan, huh?
- Now is not the time.

665
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:21,166
Out of my way.

666
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,916
- Need help, Ma?
- No, thank you.

667
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,208
I'm quite capable…

668
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
of disposing of one…

669
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,166
…idiotic grate.

670
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:15,000
That freezer is a mess.
It's completely unacceptable.

671
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,333
- Come on.
- Are you kidding me?

672
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,625
- We have to go.
- Go where?

673
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:31,625
Obviously your plan was to end up here.

674
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,708
- That was a long time ago.
- Mom…

675
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:36,416
- I'm not going in there.
- Mom, listen.

676
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,916
We need weapons and a car.
We need a safe house!

677
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,291
I'm not sure they'd let me in!

678
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,041
Only one way to find out.

679
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:53,875
Hey.

680
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:11,625
For the record,
I still think this is a shit idea.

681
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,458
Madeleine?

682
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:35,791
Girls, I think I see a ghost.

683
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:43,041
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hi, Scarlet.

684
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:44,291
Florence.

685
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,458
- Hi, Anna May.
- No.

686
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,166
No, no. You don't get to talk.

687
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:54,958
Because you're a ghost,
and ghosts can't talk.

688
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:56,708
You know how I know that?

689
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:58,666
Can we do this later?

690
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,291
Because if ghosts could talk,

691
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:03,875
they would say something
before disappearing.

692
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:07,083
Or at least leave a note. But they can't.

693
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:09,833
So, ipso facto, you're a ghost.

694
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,250
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you.

695
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:14,666
Language, Anna May.
There's a child present.

696
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,041
Fine.

697
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:19,583
- Fudge you.
- Fudge you.

698
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:21,625
Fudge you!

699
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:28,916
And why is there a toddler
in our place of business?

700
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,708
The short version?

701
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,500
Please.

702
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:37,000
Her father was killed
and she has nowhere else to go.

703
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:38,708
I was downsized by The Firm,

704
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:42,083
and they fed me to McAlester's
endless supply of thugs.

705
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,791
And you decided to come here?

706
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:45,708
Shall we return
at a more convenient time?

707
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:47,541
Maybe you should.

708
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:50,000
It seems like
whenever you come here,

709
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:51,708
you bring a war with you.

710
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,125
Bring your problems...

711
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,125
We need to table this.

712
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:03,041
Seconded.

713
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:04,750
Let's go down.

714
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:24,291
Go and take Emily.

715
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:26,291
I'll buy us some time.

716
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,041
I think I should stay.

717
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:34,458
No.

718
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:36,541
I screwed this up.

719
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:39,333
I'll clean up my own mess.

720
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:42,666
We'll meet at the diner
once I've finished them off.

721
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:45,958
Go.

722
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,208
Please.

723
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,541
Come.

724
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:55,708
Are you sure?
I could use the target practice.

725
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:56,791
Mm-mm.

726
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:58,541
Anna May was right.

727
01:10:59,916 --> 01:11:01,958
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

728
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,750
I'm staying with you.

729
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,041
No. No, you're not.

730
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:18,875
You're going to the basement,
where it's safe.

731
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,458
But you need me. I'm your apprentice.

732
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,291
Okay, listen, Emily.

733
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:26,750
The bad men are coming.
I really need you to go with my mom.

734
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:29,333
No! I want to stay with you.

735
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:30,708
- You can't.
- But why?

736
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:32,291
Because…

737
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:38,500
Because I killed your father.

738
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:43,291
You're lying.
You just want to get rid of me.

739
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,291
Your dad, he, um…

740
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:50,500
He stole from some very bad people.

741
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,166
And they hired me.

742
01:11:55,666 --> 01:11:56,875
And I shot him.

743
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,083
Come on. Let's go.

744
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,500
I need weapons.

745
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,250
Try the self-help section.

746
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,541
- I have to help her.
- You need my permission?

747
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,333
- I can't bail on her again.
- Why? You're good at it.

748
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:06,333
I'm sorry I couldn't give it up back then
and just stay here with you.

749
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:17,250
You're human.

750
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,458
You screwed up.

751
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:23,041
I can only imagine
how painful it was leaving her behind.

752
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:37,625
Leaving us all behind.

753
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:41,291
But she grew up to be a fine woman.

754
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,250
I never wanted this life for her.

755
01:13:58,541 --> 01:13:59,958
Maybe it was meant to be.

756
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:02,958
Or maybe she wanted to be
just like her mother.

757
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:14,583
I missed you.

758
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,083
We kept these ladies for you.

759
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,750
Just meet us at the diner.

760
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:37,583
Come back in one piece, okay?

761
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,083
Both of you.

762
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:55,791
Motherfucker!

763
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:42,708
Is anything broken?

764
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,333
- Are you bleeding?
- I'm fine.

765
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:45,875
Bleeding on the inside?

766
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:49,166
The rest of them are coming.

767
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,208
Would it kill you to say thank you?

768
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,625
You can still go, Ma. I'll cover you.

769
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:57,541
And miss all the fun?

770
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:05,208
<i>Women Who Run with the Wolves.</i>

771
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,541
- <i>Awakening the Giant Within.</i>
- Ammo?

772
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,583
<i>How to Win Friends and Influence People.</i>

773
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:32,625
You should've stayed away
from this line of work.

774
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,291
Are you kidding, Ma?

775
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:36,500
You left.

776
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:39,791
Killing people was the only thing
I knew how to do.

777
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:43,833
Okay, maybe it wasn't the best environment
to raise a child in.

778
01:17:43,916 --> 01:17:45,375
You think?

779
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:48,416
It made you who you are.

780
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,250
At least we can agree on that.

781
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,708
And you are a strong, smart,
incredibly impressive young woman.

782
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:12,291
There's not a single person on earth
I'd rather kill people with.

783
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:15,083
Thanks, Ma.

784
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:19,750
You're so strong!
You can't be 8 and three quarters.

785
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:20,875
I am.

786
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:23,625
You sure you're not
28 and three quarters?

787
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,416
Anna May, Madeleine. Come and see this.

788
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:44,833
Oh.

789
01:18:45,541 --> 01:18:47,083
We're not leaving.

790
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:50,625
Scarlet's still a librarian,
no matter if she's an asshole.

791
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:52,458
- Language.
- Right.

792
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,416
- So these…
- Jerks.

793
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,416
…jerks up there

794
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,708
just made the biggest mistake
of their lives.

795
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:04,791
They stepped into our library
and threatened our own flesh and blood.

796
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:06,708
They're not gonna push us around.

797
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:10,500
They're not gonna scare us off.
This ends now.

798
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:13,541
Madeleine, finish getting the van ready.

799
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:17,666
Florence, you and I are going up there
to thin the herd.

800
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:22,458
We're gonna bring the sky down
on their mother-fudging heads.

801
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
All in favor?

802
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,166
- Aye.
- Aye.

803
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,500
Aye.

804
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:32,666
Motion carried.

805
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,000
You think you have a chance here?

806
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,250
I have an army.

807
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:43,541
Oh, yeah? Well, I've got my mom.

808
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,291
I wish we had more time, Ma.

809
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,916
It's quality, not quantity.

810
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:00,333
Chin up.

811
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:04,291
Why don't you come out,
and I'll put a bullet through your head?

812
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:05,958
Nice and quick.

813
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:08,958
Why don't you go fudge yourself?

814
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,208
If you make me work for it,
I'll shoot you in the stomach.

815
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,000
Then we'll have some real fun together.

816
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:28,708
Hey, dum-dums.

817
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:41,666
Hey, idiots. Catch these.

818
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:39,541
Idiots to the left.
Morons to the right.

819
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:42,750
The rest of you knuckleheads stay here
and kill those two.

820
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:31,916
Shh.

821
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Put these on.

822
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,208
I'm gonna make a little noise,

823
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,791
so play it loud.

824
01:23:57,416 --> 01:23:59,166
Can you do that for me?

825
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:55,000
Sam!

826
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:57,250
Reload!

827
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,083
You've got something in your hair.

828
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:49,666
It's a tooth.

829
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:10,416
Hey.

830
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,000
He…

831
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:17,291
He took Emily.

832
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,791
I couldn't save her.

833
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:24,250
It's okay.

834
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:26,000
We'll get her back.

835
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,291
It was nice…

836
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,375
having a kid in the library again.

837
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:48,500
Huh?

838
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:36,791
"There is little joy in life for me"

839
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:40,875
"And little terror in the grave"

840
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:44,500
"I've lived the parting hour to see"

841
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:48,208
"Of one I would have died to save"

842
01:33:12,916 --> 01:33:16,750
<i>Well, that was exciting.</i>
<i>Been a long time since I killed someone.</i>

843
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:18,833
Let me talk to Emily.

844
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,458
<i>It's a real tragedy</i>

845
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:24,833
<i>what happens to poor orphans
in our line of work, you know?</i>

846
01:33:25,625 --> 01:33:27,000
<i>It's really quite sad.</i>

847
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:31,083
What do you want?

848
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:34,083
<i>My uncle insists on meeting you.</i>

849
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:36,291
<i>He says, skinning you alive will let him</i>

850
01:33:36,375 --> 01:33:38,875
<i>work through his, uh, grief.</i>

851
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:41,958
<i>That's not too much to ask, is it?</i>

852
01:33:42,041 --> 01:33:43,458
If I come to you,

853
01:33:44,208 --> 01:33:45,583
Emily goes free.

854
01:33:46,625 --> 01:33:48,458
And everyone else is off the table.

855
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:54,791
<i>Okay, we have a deal.</i>

856
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:56,458
The diner.

857
01:33:57,166 --> 01:33:58,416
<i>Can't wait.</i>

858
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:01,125
We gotta go.

859
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:04,666
You can't just hand yourself over
to those animals.

860
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,916
They can't bring guns into the diner.

861
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:10,666
- It's Emily's best chance.
- It's a suicide mission.

862
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:12,833
Well, someone else got a plan? Hmm?

863
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:18,250
I, uh… I don't right now, no.

864
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:22,166
But it's you, Mom.

865
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:26,500
You always have a plan.

866
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:28,541
Sorry.

867
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:36,000
Then I guess this is goodbye.

868
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,916
They're waiting for you, honey.

869
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:16,166
Thanks, Rose.

870
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:38,333
Did they hurt you?

871
01:35:43,541 --> 01:35:45,375
It's been a long day.

872
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:48,291
It's gonna be over soon, okay?

873
01:35:50,416 --> 01:35:51,500
Okay.

874
01:36:02,958 --> 01:36:04,666
You're a special kid, Emily.

875
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:09,125
I wish I had more time to get to know you.

876
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,750
I'm Jim.

877
01:36:27,916 --> 01:36:29,166
Samantha.

878
01:36:31,958 --> 01:36:33,250
You know, Samantha…

879
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:37,750
I've always considered myself a feminist.

880
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:43,125
When my first daughter was born,
I was over the moon.

881
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:46,291
Painted half the house pink.

882
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:50,458
It was all unicorns and lollipops.

883
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:54,708
And my second daughter was born.

884
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:58,208
And the third and the fourth.

885
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:01,500
Girls…

886
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:06,083
always whispering at the dining table.

887
01:37:08,041 --> 01:37:10,500
Always giggling in dark corners.

888
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:14,791
I love my girls.

889
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,791
But I don't understand them.

890
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:22,916
Then my son was born.

891
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:26,083
It was different.

892
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:27,833
Simple.

893
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:32,250
We understood each other.

894
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:35,875
And I wasn't alone any more.

895
01:37:43,541 --> 01:37:44,833
I know…

896
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:49,625
it was just a job to you, and he was…

897
01:37:50,541 --> 01:37:52,875
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

898
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:56,625
None of that matters,

899
01:37:57,791 --> 01:38:00,625
because you took him away from me.

900
01:38:04,708 --> 01:38:07,416
I'm going to do terrible things to you,
Samantha.

901
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:12,833
You're going to suffer more
than you thought even possible.

902
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:19,291
Because you have made me
a stranger in my own home again.

903
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:22,208
For what it's worth…

904
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:27,333
I am very sorry about your son.

905
01:38:28,666 --> 01:38:30,333
Thank you, Samantha.

906
01:38:33,583 --> 01:38:35,291
Just let the girl go.

907
01:38:36,791 --> 01:38:37,791
Not yet.

908
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,250
We had a deal.

909
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:44,958
And I'm a man of my word.

910
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:49,083
I will set the girl free, unharmed.

911
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:54,250
But only after she's watched
what I do to you.

912
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:00,500
Please.

913
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:03,875
Please, I…

914
01:39:04,416 --> 01:39:06,458
I will do anything.

915
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,500
Don't start begging yet.

916
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:12,000
There's plenty of time for that.

917
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:16,791
- Can I get you something?
- No, we're just fine.

918
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:19,458
Maybe some more coffee,
or apple pie?

919
01:39:19,541 --> 01:39:22,708
If I have to tell you no again,
there will be consequences.

920
01:39:31,958 --> 01:39:33,125
Hi, sweetheart.

921
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:36,208
Hi, Mom.

922
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,291
Guess there was a plan, after all.

923
01:39:53,375 --> 01:39:54,916
Guess so.

924
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Why don't you take Emily out of here?

925
01:39:57,083 --> 01:39:58,833
It's no place for a kid.

926
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:00,416
Stay out of this, ladies.

927
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:02,125
It's not your fight.

928
01:40:03,166 --> 01:40:05,541
There's no more standing on the sidelines.

929
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,541
We all need to pick a side.

930
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:09,250
Right, ladies.

931
01:43:50,875 --> 01:43:51,875
Emily.

932
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:28,625
I am so sorry I killed your father, Emily.

933
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:32,291
If I could take it back…

934
01:44:32,375 --> 01:44:33,458
I know.

935
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:36,000
But you tried to save him.

936
01:44:37,833 --> 01:44:38,833
Still.

937
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:41,833
And you saved me.

938
01:44:47,125 --> 01:44:48,291
Thank you.

939
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:52,708
Besides…
I know you just pulled the trigger.

940
01:44:54,083 --> 01:44:56,750
I know there was someone else
who told you what to do.

941
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:00,166
Who sent you to my father?

942
01:45:10,666 --> 01:45:13,500
There's a group of men called The Firm.

943
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:20,416
It's a… It's a girl scout.

944
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,083
Get rid of her.

945
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,375
No, wait.

946
01:45:25,291 --> 01:45:28,583
They've been running things
for a long, long time.

947
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,333
They make all the rules and…

948
01:45:33,916 --> 01:45:35,791
change them when it fits their needs.

949
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:43,208
<i>They think they're untouchable.</i>

950
01:45:46,083 --> 01:45:48,541
They think they can get away
with anything.

951
01:45:50,416 --> 01:45:53,166
But they won't, right?

952
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:56,791
No.

953
01:45:57,291 --> 01:45:58,375
They won't.

954
01:46:00,375 --> 01:46:01,625
Not any more.

955
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:10,625
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

956
01:46:10,708 --> 01:46:12,666
I'm selling cookies.

957
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:15,666
Oh, really? Uh, where are they?

958
01:46:18,125 --> 01:46:22,250
You're the little girl
that I've heard so much about, aren't you?

959
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,833
They think so little of me
they sent a child to do their dirty work?

960
01:46:31,916 --> 01:46:33,416
I'm insulted, frankly.

961
01:46:41,916 --> 01:46:44,416
"Look into your heart"?

962
01:46:52,416 --> 01:46:54,041
Fuck me.

963
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:57,916
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

964
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,833
Loud and clear.

965
01:46:59,916 --> 01:47:01,666
<i>We're both alive and well.</i>

966
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,458
That's the way it's gonna stay.

967
01:47:03,541 --> 01:47:06,500
<i>Come on, Sam.</i>
<i>You know that's not up to me.</i>

968
01:47:06,583 --> 01:47:09,250
You get one chance to end this now.

969
01:47:10,458 --> 01:47:13,666
Years ago, my mom screwed up
and pulled the wrong trigger.

970
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,541
I'm not making the same mistake.

971
01:47:16,625 --> 01:47:20,083
<i>That little girl in front of you</i>
<i>will have a future.</i>

972
01:47:20,958 --> 01:47:24,583
Go back to the partners
and tell them we know where they work,

973
01:47:25,166 --> 01:47:26,291
where they live.

974
01:47:26,375 --> 01:47:30,125
We can kill them 100 times over
without them ever seeing us coming.

975
01:47:31,708 --> 01:47:34,166
Tell them they were only spared

976
01:47:34,666 --> 01:47:36,375
because of an eight-year-old girl.

977
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:38,375
Eight and three quarters.

978
01:47:39,083 --> 01:47:41,541
Sorry. Eight and three quarters.

979
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,500
Got it?

980
01:47:43,541 --> 01:47:44,875
Got it.

981
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:48,375
<i>Now, close your eyes</i>
<i>and count to ten.</i>

982
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:49,708
<i>Slow.</i>

983
01:47:52,625 --> 01:47:53,625
One…

984
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:55,708
two…

985
01:47:56,291 --> 01:47:57,375
three…

986
01:47:58,416 --> 01:47:59,416
<i>four…</i>

987
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:01,125
<i>five…</i>

988
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:02,750
<i>six…</i>

989
01:48:03,291 --> 01:48:04,291
seven…

990
01:48:04,833 --> 01:48:05,833
eight…

991
01:48:06,875 --> 01:48:07,916
nine…

992
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
ten.

993
01:48:35,625 --> 01:48:37,000
Can I drive?

994
01:48:37,791 --> 01:48:38,791
No.

995
01:48:40,333 --> 01:48:42,291
Can I turn on the radio, then?

996
01:48:44,875 --> 01:48:46,208
Go nuts, baby girl.

997
01:48:49,166 --> 01:48:52,833
<i>Right folks,</i>
<i>time to hit the road.</i>

998
01:48:52,916 --> 01:48:56,166
<i>Take care, and see you on the other side.</i>
