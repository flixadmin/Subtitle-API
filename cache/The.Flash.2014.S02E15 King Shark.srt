1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:02,265
BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:04,433
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:08,698
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,736
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:15,170
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,241
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:20,611
but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:23,912
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,510
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,402
NARRATOR: Previously, on "The Flash"... 

11
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:31,183
Zoom wants you dead.

12
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,002
Do you think he can do
everything really fast?

13
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,636
- How you doing, Dig?
- You're fast.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,703
Welcome to my Earth-2.

15
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,043
Dad!

16
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,813
- No! No!
- (FLAT LINE TONE)

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,126
Caitlin. That is your name, isn't it?

18
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:52,093
I hate the name Caitlin. I'm Killer Frost.

19
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:54,530
Ronnie and Caitlin's
doppelgangers are evil?

20
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:55,831
If you're coming with us. We have to go.

21
00:00:58,468 --> 00:00:59,568
Cisco!

22
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:01,070
Get ready to close the breach for good,

23
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:02,171
Zoom's coming.

24
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:04,997
- (YELLS)
- No!

25
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:15,274
He's not dead. He's not dead.

26
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:16,769
Caitlin...

27
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:18,536
He's not dead. He's not.

28
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:20,439
- Caitlin...
- This isn't happening.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,140
This isn't happening again.

30
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,374
Hey, I got you.

31
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:25,177
Come on.

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,094
- Open it up.
- Allen...

33
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,918
- I need to go back.
- I can't do that.

34
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,552
- Open it up!
- Allen!

35
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:37,488
The breaches are closed.

36
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,758
All the breaches are closed.

37
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,162
Why can't we just open one of 'em?

38
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:47,451
The quark matter energy that
we used to seal the breaches,

39
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:51,510
it prevents them from
being opened, ever again.

40
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:54,117
There's no going back to our world.

41
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,479
Wait.

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,727
We're trapped here for good?

43
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,574
Yes.

44
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:06,551
No, we can't just let
Zoom get away with this.

45
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,351
He just murdered Jay right in front of us.

46
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:10,020
There's got to be something we can do.

47
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:11,121
There's not.

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,059
Not this time.

49
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:20,964
It's over.

50
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,334
No.

51
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:45,588
How's she doing?

52
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:48,492
Not good. We tried to get her to go home,

53
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:51,193
but she refused to leave, so, you know,

54
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:54,162
I just sat with her until she fell asleep.

55
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:57,086
First Ronnie, now Jay.

56
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,575
(SCOFFS) Yeah.

57
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:02,351
I'm afraid what this double
dose of grief is gonna do to her.

58
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:04,420
I mean, she's pretty shell-shocked.

59
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,654
She'll be fine.

60
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:08,689
Snow's strong. She'll get past this.

61
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:14,716
But in the meantime, I
would not say anything to her

62
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,241
about her counterpart from my Earth.

63
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,145
That goes for Joe and Iris too.

64
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:20,246
Why?

65
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:22,715
Because you don't want
to influence their reality

66
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:24,450
in ways that should not be influenced.

67
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:27,153
Like in the same way as
when Barry time-travels?

68
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:28,587
Exactly, but also,

69
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,355
what's the point?

70
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:33,891
Those people are not your people.

71
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:36,262
Their lives are not your lives.

72
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:38,096
Never were, never will be.

73
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:39,931
Bury it. Move on.

74
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:43,636
Yes?

75
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:47,176
Yeah. That I can do.

76
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:52,711
Allen?

77
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:02,654
So that's what we did.

78
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,657
We didn't talk about Earth-2.

79
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:09,762
We kept what happened there
between the three of us

80
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,497
and got on with our lives knowing

81
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:14,798
there was nothing we
could do now to stop Zoom.

82
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,677
Instead, we tried to just adjust

83
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:28,178
to our new circumstances
and cope with our losses.

84
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,017
Jay's death took its toll... 

85
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:38,206
left scars on all of us,
some more than others.

86
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,027
And so to try and keep my mind

87
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,097
off thoughts of the
surreal other life

88
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:47,932
I experienced that wasn't my own,

89
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:50,603
I kept running, waiting for some

90
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,705
other meta-human threat
to rear its ugly head

91
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:56,273
and distract me from the
frustration I was feeling,

92
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,443
and as fate would have it,

93
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,479
I did not have to wait long.

94
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:02,448
All good.

95
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,693
Hey, ugly! It's time for dinner.

96
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,099
I think Bruce has gone belly up.

97
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,837
Power down the grid.

98
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,475
We're gonna have to fish him out.

99
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:44,890
So this is where Waller kept
all her secret projects, huh?

100
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,258
One of many sites, I'm learning.

101
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,695
I'm sure the new director
of A.R.G.U.S. will clean up

102
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:51,530
the mess that Waller left behind.

103
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,566
Easier said than done, honey.

104
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:54,667
Hey.

105
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:58,304
My wife can do anything
she puts her mind to.

106
00:05:58,305 --> 00:05:59,672
Code seven in Aquaria Three.

107
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:01,774
I repeat, code seven
in Aquaria Three.

108
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,709
There's been breach in the aquarium!

109
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,677
You have an aquarium? Why?

110
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:10,049
What the hell?

111
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,059
(ROARS)

112
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,333
Are you kidding me?

113
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:37,390
Seven, six, five,

114
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,714
four, three, two, one.

115
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,214
- Whoa! Yes!
- Time. (LAUGHS)

116
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:44,315
Ain't nobody faster than me.

117
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,517
Whoo.

118
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,418
- I don't know about that.
- (LAUGHS)

119
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:50,159
Earth to Barry.

120
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,177
It's your turn, dude.

121
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,628
Yeah, it's time to show this little punk

122
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,263
who the fastest stack attacker alive is.

123
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:01,297
One of you guys go ahead. I'm gonna pass.

124
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,963
You're afraid of a little competition?

125
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:07,082
No, just not in a gaming mood right now.

126
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:12,276
Okay, well, I guess that makes me champ.

127
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,480
Right?

128
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,249
Anyway, I'm gonna go
meet up with some friends.

129
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,350
All right.

130
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,331
- Bye.
- Bye.

131
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:28,194
Maybe next time.

132
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:35,968
And I thought you were the competitive one

133
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,069
in the family.

134
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:38,637
I know, right? What's up, Bar?

135
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:39,938
Nothing. Just...

136
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:44,343
I don't know, I don't think
Wally likes me too much.

137
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:46,044
Well, we need to fix that.

138
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,415
I mean, you been so busy running
between alternate realities,

139
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,051
you two haven't had a chance
to spend any time together.

140
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:54,219
What you want us to do together?

141
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,320
(LAUGHS)

142
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,489
Get to know each other,

143
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,925
find something that
you guys have in common.

144
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,994
He's part of the family now, Bar,

145
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,463
you're gonna have to give it a chance.

146
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:05,564
I know.

147
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,068
All right, well, look, I'm
gonna head to bed, all right?

148
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:10,169
Mm.

149
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,270
- Good night.
- Good night.

150
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,675
Something is up with him,

151
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:19,611
and I don't think it's just Jay's death.

152
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:21,046
He's been acting weird
ever since he came back

153
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:22,147
from Earth-2.

154
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,584
Did he say anything to you
about what happened over there?

155
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,218
No, not a thing. You?

156
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:32,524
Hmm.

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,508
Hey, so... I've been thinking.

158
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,338
You've been working around the clock.

159
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,407
Maybe you want to get some rest, go home.

160
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:49,641
You know, a good night's sleep wouldn't be

161
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:50,776
the worst thing in the world.

162
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:51,877
I'm fine.

163
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:53,372
Look, I get it.

164
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:54,772
You're having a hard
time with what happened.

165
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:56,474
It's a lot to take so soon after...

166
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:57,775
I said I'm fine.

167
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:07,685
- Hey.
- Did you hear that?

168
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:08,786
No, what?

169
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,454
Caitlin just bit my head off.

170
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:12,790
She's been all business,
no emotion lately.

171
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,340
She's been... cold.

172
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:18,061
Cold? Come on, Cisco.

173
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,404
This could be the beginning
of her becoming evil.

174
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,662
You're not worried about that?

175
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,964
I'm not worried about that.

176
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,232
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.

177
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,468
- Hm.
- You haven't mentioned anything

178
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,903
about about Earth-2, have you?

179
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,105
No, 'cause I know how to keep a secret.

180
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,508
All right, well, look, I
mean, it's gonna take some time

181
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,675
for her to heal.

182
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,444
We just got to be there
for her, keep her busy.

183
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,813
That shouldn't be a problem.

184
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,314
- Oh.
- Hey, Dig, Lyla.

185
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,582
What are you guys doing here?

186
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,752
We came to give you the head's up, Barry.

187
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,853
About what?

188
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,289
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody,

189
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,923
goes by the name King Shark.

190
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,025
King Shark?

191
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,895
You mean the half-man/half-shark
that tried to kill you

192
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,695
months ago. I thought he was dead.

193
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,165
That's what A.R.G.U.S.
wanted you to believe

194
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,999
when they snatched him up, but believe me,

195
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,835
this half-shark is very much alive,

196
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,904
and his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing.

197
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,338
That's kill you, Barry.

198
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,440
(SCOFFS)

199
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,743
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

200
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:13,946
(SIGHS)

201
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:22,343
So how do you know about King Shark?

202
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:24,303
Well, as the new director of A.R.G.U.S.,

203
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:27,039
Lyla's job is to clean
up Amanda Waller's messes.

204
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,108
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.

205
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:30,710
And it appears under her directives,

206
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,712
A.R.G.U.S. had been
monitoring meta-human activity

207
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:33,946
for the past two years.

208
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:34,373
Why?

209
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:37,456
Well, to see if any of those
powers could be exploited.

210
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:38,656
Weaponized.

211
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:42,660
How do you know that he's coming after me?

212
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:45,363
While in our custody, he
kept saying the same thing.

213
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:47,397
"Zoom wants The Flash dead".

214
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:50,301
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,

215
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:51,936
the readings we did
receive show he that was

216
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,037
headed towards Central City.

217
00:10:53,038 --> 00:10:54,138
Let him come.

218
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,674
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

219
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:57,942
We just came here to warn you, man.

220
00:10:57,943 --> 00:10:59,043
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

221
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:00,745
Nah, I can't do that, Dig.

222
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:03,081
I'm sorry, but all year,
we've been sitting ducks

223
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:05,249
for Zoom and his Earth-2 henchmen.

224
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,750
This is the last one.

225
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:08,886
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.

226
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:12,054
I'm going after him
first. I owe that to Jay.

227
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:15,059
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?

228
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,894
Real name, Shay Lamden, he was a...

229
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:20,198
get this... marine biologist
before my particle accelerator

230
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,368
changed him into King Shark, and
Zoom put him under his control.

231
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:25,737
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?

232
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:28,172
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.

233
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:29,340
I just followed.

234
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,776
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.

235
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:33,277
Can you find King Shark too?

236
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:34,378
I can try.

237
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,780
All right.

238
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:41,449
Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.

239
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,221
There must only be a few
hours before he needs to get

240
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:45,623
back into the water to
re-oxygenate his blood.

241
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:46,658
(BEEPS)

242
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:48,059
I can take the waterfront.

243
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,360
Can you have your team handle the rest?

244
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:51,861
- I'll get them on it.
- All right.

245
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:54,232
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?

246
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,933
Maybe he could help us somehow.

247
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,901
Or not. Looks like he died

248
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,438
when the particle accelerator exploded.

249
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,206
What about next of kin?

250
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:04,275
He's got a widow, Doctor Tanya Lamden.

251
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:06,511
She's a research
scientist at Nautilus Labs,

252
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:09,412
and she studies... wait for it... sharks.

253
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:12,417
Maybe the two of you can go
and see if she's discovered

254
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:14,218
anything in her research
that could help us.

255
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:15,319
Sure.

256
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:16,654
Great.

257
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:20,424
- Hey, Digg.
- Yeah?

258
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:21,624
How's that helmet treating you?

259
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,294
Could use some improvements.

260
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:24,995
I'll get to work on it.

261
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:26,130
Hey, Joe, what's up?

262
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:27,631
Hey, Bar, I talked to Wally,

263
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:28,865
he wants to meet up with you.

264
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:29,967
All right.

265
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:31,701
He's working on his engineering project

266
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:32,474
at our place tonight.

267
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,938
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

268
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,197
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry,

269
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,630
right now is kind of a crazy time.

270
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,166
What? What's going on?

271
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,901
Remember that meta-human shark

272
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:43,069
that Patty was after and attacked me?

273
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:45,339
He's back? I thought Wells... you know.

274
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,575
Yeah, me too, but
apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him

275
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:50,744
and he escaped, and now he's
heading for Central City.

276
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:51,846
I get it.

277
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,212
I'll tell Wally some other time.

278
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:56,083
Hey, you know what?

279
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,984
It's all good, I'll make it work.

280
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,218
Tell him tonight should be fine.

281
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:01,555
Are you sure?

282
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:03,323
- Yeah. 
- Thanks, Bar.

283
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,525
Yeah, bye.

284
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,262
(SIGHS) Why?

285
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,003
It's been two years since your
particle accelerator exploded.

286
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,071
Seems a little late to be asking questions

287
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:19,906
about my husband, doesn't it?

288
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:23,144
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?

289
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:25,246
I suppose you could say that.

290
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:27,380
It only took three days
for every cell in his body

291
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:29,014
to grow uncontrollably.

292
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:32,776
Whatever cancer he had, it
turned him into something...

293
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,454
not human.

294
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,357
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

295
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,058
There's a meta-human in Central City

296
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,559
whose body seems to be mutating

297
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,061
in the same way as your late husband,

298
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:45,265
but he didn't die, he
became a dangerous monster.

299
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:47,134
My husband was no monster.

300
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,537
That's not what she was implying.

301
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,438
What does this have to do with me?

302
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,574
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

303
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:55,743
Mm-hmm, yeah, I've had
some encouraging results,

304
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,643
although still preliminary.

305
00:13:57,946 --> 00:13:59,246
We need to see it.

306
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:00,680
I beg your pardon?

307
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,550
Your research, all of it.

308
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,384
What my colleague means to say is that

309
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,087
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,

310
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,122
it could help us stop this
meta-human from hurting anyone.

311
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:16,594
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'm just supposed to trust you?

312
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,766
Please, Mrs. Lamden.

313
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,200
This could help save lives.

314
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,937
I'll email you what I have.

315
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:26,941
Thank you.

316
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,046
- Little harsh.
- I was being direct.

317
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:36,750
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

318
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,152
You've been acting differently toward me

319
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,720
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

320
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,654
What's your problem, Cisco?

321
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:44,758
Nothing.

322
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,759
Let's just go.

323
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:58,505
Grid one, negative.

324
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,376
Grid four, negative.

325
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:10,217
Status check, grid two.

326
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,652
Grid two, negative.

327
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:12,753
Anything?

328
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:14,188
No, man, nothing yet.

329
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:15,990
Yeah, so far, nothing on our end either.

330
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:19,093
Let's just hope Wells is
doing better than we are.

331
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:20,926
Hey, how's Felicity doing?

332
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,863
Well, I'm not gonna lie,
Barry, it was pretty rough

333
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:26,430
there at first, but you
know Felicity, she's tough.

334
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:30,004
Yeah, she's just not
returning any of my calls.

335
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:32,438
She has a lot going on right now.

336
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,374
Buddy, I'll ask if she can give you a call

337
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,942
when this is all over.

338
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:38,579
Just want to catch this thing, man,

339
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,915
have everything to do with
Zoom and Earth-2 put behind us,

340
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,548
so we can just move on with our lives.

341
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,520
Starting to do that
thing Oliver does, Barry,

342
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,789
carry the weight of the
world on your shoulders.

343
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,157
Got to stop that, man,
it's gonna slow you down.

344
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,628
Still nothing.

345
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:56,829
Status check, Grid six.

346
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,033
Hold on, I think we got something.

347
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,159
(ROARING)

348
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:15,390
So much for cleaning up
after Waller's messes.

349
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:17,089
We don't find King Shark soon,

350
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,458
someone's gonna be cleaning up after mine.

351
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:21,092
We'll find him, Lyla.

352
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:24,397
All right, I searched the whole area.

353
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:25,498
He's gone.

354
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:26,799
Couldn't have gotten far.

355
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,501
Still, he knows we're here now.

356
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,735
We lost the element of surprise.

357
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,795
Not if Wells can figure
out a way to track him.

358
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,249
In the meantime, we'll keep looking.

359
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:36,800
All right, I'll meet
up with you guys later.

360
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,661
I got to go see Joe's son.

361
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:43,364
Okay, I thought our
relationship was hard to follow.

362
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:44,465
See ya.

363
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:49,770
(CHUCKLES)
He's fast, John, get over it.

364
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:50,871
Never.

365
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,680
Joe thought I should have you take a look.

366
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:06,520
So, this is what I got so
far for my project essay

367
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:09,154
to get into CCU's engineering program.

368
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:14,060
Turbine supercars?

369
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:16,664
Turbines? Like jet engines?

370
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:18,899
Yeah, yeah, it'd use an
engine like the ones they have

371
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,267
in some helicopters, only
it'd run on bio-diesel.

372
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,551
- Cool.
- It's very cool.

373
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,173
Yeah, you're gonna want to address

374
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:27,808
the fuel economy issue here.

375
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,111
It is a jet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

376
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:33,047
Yeah, that's why I want to use bio-diesel.

377
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:35,315
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

378
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:37,051
No, okay, but you also got a sound issue.

379
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:38,352
Gonna wake the neighbors...

380
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:39,653
(LAUGHS) For sure.

381
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:41,655
Anything else?

382
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,225
Um...

383
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:48,962
Well, I just... want to help, you know.

384
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:49,997
I'm just trying to make
sure they don't have

385
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:51,498
any reason to say no.

386
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,867
Okay. (LAUGHS)

387
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:57,036
Sorry, Wally, I didn't mean that...

388
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:58,572
it looks really good.

389
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:03,444
All right, let's start over, okay?

390
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:04,678
(LAUGHS) Is it...

391
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:08,713
why don't we go through it
all together, work it out?

392
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,250
Sounds good.

393
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:11,618
Cool.

394
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:21,829
(CLEARS THROAT)

395
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:30,302
This is a complete waste of time.

396
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:33,240
We're not gonna find anything
in Doctor Lamden's research

397
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:35,608
to tell us how to find King Shark.

398
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,444
Maybe I should take a look.

399
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:38,712
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor

400
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:40,347
with a specialty in bio-chem.

401
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:42,349
I'm just saying maybe you could use

402
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,650
another set of eyes, considering.

403
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:46,820
Considering what?

404
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:49,256
Considering the way
you've been acting lately.

405
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:50,824
What does that mean?

406
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,058
You are not yourself, Caitlin,

407
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:55,262
and it's freaking me out, 'cause you have

408
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:59,096
this icy look in your eye
just like you did over there.

409
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,200
Over there?

410
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:02,202
You mean Earth-2?

411
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:05,184
No. Uh, no.

412
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:09,223
Um, what I meant to say was...

413
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:11,623
You met my doppelganger, didn't you?

414
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:14,626
(LAUGHS) What? No.

415
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,860
Cisco.

416
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:18,129
Look, I'm not supposed to say anything.

417
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,708
Why not?

418
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,132
Because I'm not supposed to say anything.

419
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:24,961
Francisco Ramon, if you
don't start talking...

420
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:28,019
Okay, fine, yes, I met your doppelganger.

421
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:30,762
She's a coldhearted ice
queen named Killer Frost,

422
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:33,462
a meta-human who enjoyed killing a lot.

423
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,396
There, great.

424
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:39,070
Now Harry's gonna kill me and
throw myself across the room.

425
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:42,516
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

426
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:44,809
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting

427
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,477
just like she did over there.

428
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,645
You're being shut off.
You're being detached.

429
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,181
You're being cold.

430
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,783
Because I have to be right now.

431
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:57,885
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes,

432
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:01,525
just when I was starting
to feel normal again,

433
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:03,893
just when I was beginning to love.

434
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:08,298
So if I let myself feel,

435
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:12,506
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

436
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:14,171
it's never gonna stop,

437
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,907
and that's not gonna help me either,

438
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:19,009
so let's just get back to this research

439
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,643
and figure out how to find King Shark.

440
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,147
Okay.

441
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:36,327
Here you are.

442
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,697
Yup, just like back home, always working.

443
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,866
I'm trying to locate this King Shark.

444
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,767
He's here? On this Earth?

445
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,936
Yes, it turns out our friend Zoom

446
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:48,370
brought him here to kill The Flash.

447
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:51,609
Looks like he's stuck
here just like we are.

448
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,411
It looks like he is, and
so I need to figure this out

449
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,986
before more people get hurt, Jessie, so...

450
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,817
Probability distribution algorithm?

451
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:01,452
Partial matching strategies, yes.

452
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:02,299
Based on what?

453
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:05,651
Semantic trajectories...
water, Central City, The Flash.

454
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:08,269
What about mobility behaviors?

455
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,039
Jessie.

456
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:12,008
Look, you wanted me out of that room,

457
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,878
but now that I am, you don't want me here.

458
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,848
Just let me help, please.

459
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,417
Grab a marker.

460
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:26,793
(SIGHS)

461
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:28,424
Yeah.

462
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,247
Hardest part was amping the torque

463
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:33,581
without increasing drag.

464
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,116
A heavier engine would
only slow things down,

465
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:36,918
but this streamlined
version should optimize

466
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,352
both the torque and the horsepower.

467
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:42,924
Yeah, I'm just worried
it's... won't be enough still.

468
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:44,225
Here, let's do this...

469
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:45,560
use a one-to-one transfer gearbox

470
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:47,862
to drop the output shaft of the engine,

471
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:49,965
reverse rotation and send more power

472
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:51,666
to the torque converter.

473
00:21:54,136 --> 00:21:56,905
I didn't come for you
to just do it for me.

474
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:58,807
I thought we were gonna
work on this together.

475
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:00,208
Yeah, we are, I'm...

476
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:02,110
I'm just trying to speed up the process.

477
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,211
Why?

478
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:07,781
What, you got somewhere better to be?

479
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:11,716
No, Wally, I'm... Wally.

480
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:14,989
All right. (CHUCKLES)

481
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,891
Do you have a problem with me?

482
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:20,895
Who could have a problem with you?

483
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:23,396
You're Barry, right? You're perfect.

484
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:25,566
Never do anything wrong.

485
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:28,035
Always this, always that.

486
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:30,905
Wally.

487
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,574
I mean, take a look around you, man.

00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:35,142
You're in every picture in this room.

489
00:22:35,444 --> 00:22:37,545
You know, thanks for your help,

490
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:40,246
but I'll just take care of this myself.

Where's The Flash?

493
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,235
I know The Flash is here.

494
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:07,720
I can smell him.

495
00:23:07,813 --> 00:23:09,246
Everybody get out!

496
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:12,015

00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:33,333
Yeah, I know.

504
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,538
Then you get to go home, right?

505
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,476
Well, guess what, man.

506
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,675
The breaches that Zoom
used to bring you here,

507
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,543
they're all gone. I closed 'em, for good!

508

There's no more Zoom.

covers a "Sharknado" attack.

Wally, come on.

00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:25,880
You know, Joe and Iris
told me a lot about you,

made it out like you could
walk on water, or something,

about you being a coward.

I know you guys love me,

all this great stuff about me.

Start telling him the
truth. I'm not perfect.

even The Flash can't fix.

00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:06,268

I shouldn't... tell you guys this, but...

00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,424
I met your doppelgangers.

558
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:20,731
You were the cop in the
family, a good one too.

559
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,879
(LAUGHS)

560
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:23,527
I told you I would've made a good cop.

561
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:25,119
Don't get any ideas.

562
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,393
What about me then?

563
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:29,294
You were a lounge singer.

564
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,063
Yeah, you had this
amazing voice, actually,

565
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,234
but you didn't like me at all.

566
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,338
You actually blamed me
for Iris becoming a cop,

567
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:40,372
said that she only became one

568
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:43,676
to help her selfish husband's career.

569
00:26:44,745 --> 00:26:45,912
Wait. (SCOFFS)

570
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,148
We were married?

571
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,516
Mm-hmm.

572
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,685
And we went to go see Joe perform.

573
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,923
And that's when everything went wrong.

574
00:26:59,374 --> 00:27:04,856
Um, some metas that
worked for Zoom showed up,

575
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:05,802
they were looking for me.

576
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:08,070
They knew I wasn't supposed to be there,

577
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:10,183
and they attacked,

578
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:14,411
and you got caught in the crossfire,

579
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:17,115
and... you died.

580
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:25,157
I knew that it wasn't you,
that none of that was this life,

581
00:27:25,182 --> 00:27:25,873
but...

582
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:32,428
I mean, watching it happen
in front of me, living that,

583
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:37,249
it didn't feel any different,
because it was all still real.

584
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:41,637
And Jay warned me not to
get emotionally sucked in

585
00:27:41,638 --> 00:27:42,938
when I went there,

586
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:47,107
and then that's exactly what happened.

587
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:52,579
And now Joe West on Earth-2
is dead, because I showed up.

588
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:59,265
Barry, that... that's not your fault.

589
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,323
Yeah, it is my fault.

590
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,460
It's all my fault.

591
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:06,128
Zoom,

592
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:08,723
this King Shark,

593
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,520
Jay's death,

594
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:14,202
it's all because of me.

595
00:28:15,138 --> 00:28:18,932
And then I just left an entire world

596
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:20,176
at Zoom's mercy.

597
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:39,718
Just when you thought it was
safe to go back in the suburbs,

598
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,850
King Shark shows up at your house.

599
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,584
I mean, I don't even know how he found me.

600
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:45,485
It's not like I was The
Flash while I was at home.

601
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:47,453
- Must be a reason.
- Yeah.

602
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:49,723
Have you figured out a way
to track King Shark yet?

603
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,258
No, I don't have enough information

604
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:53,327
to create an accurate location algorithm.

605
00:28:53,328 --> 00:28:54,494
What about Dr. Lamden's research?

606
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:55,762
Anything that can help us?

607
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:56,669
I didn't think so at first,

608
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,903
but then I found something
that I think might help us.

609
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:00,913
Sharks are predators.

610
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:02,472
In order to track their prey, they use

611
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:04,507
what's known as passive electrolocation.

612
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,209
Passive electrolocation?

613
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,211
Yes, it's how they sense
the bioelectric potential

614
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:09,712
around a fish's body.

615
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:12,215
King Shark senses
electricity in Barry's system.

616
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:15,018
Okay, that explains how
King Shark can track Barry,

617
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,753
but how is that going
to help us track him?

618
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,221
We flip it. Instead of King Shark

619
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:19,923
being the predator, we make him the prey,

620
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,525
and track him using
active electrolocation.

621
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:24,661
We reprogram our satellite to generate

622
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,563
a specific electric field and then measure

623
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,231
any electrical distortions that correlate

624
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:30,132
with a 1-ton walking shark.

625
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,701
(CHUCKLES)
That'll help us get him.

626
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,237
You help me out?

627
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,039
Sure.

628
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,335
Great.

629
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:41,538
Let us know when you locate him
and we'll take it from there.

630
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,713
Okay.

631
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:44,837
Let's get the team ready.

632
00:29:57,151 --> 00:29:59,251
DIGGLE: What exactly is that?

633
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:02,421
That, my friend, is bait.

634
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,191
You made a Flash lure?

635
00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:05,759
It's the best I could come up with

636
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,127
given the time frame.

637
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:08,662
It's rigged to mimic and enhance

638
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:10,364
the electric field Barry's body generates.

639
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:11,798
King Shark takes one whiff of that,

640
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:13,033
cue the "Jaws" soundtrack.

641
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:14,568
Also stuffed it with enough tranqs

642
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:15,869
to knock him out for a month.

643
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,071
Should make him a lot easier to reel in.

644
00:30:18,072 --> 00:30:19,572
And that container.

645
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:21,808
Strong enough to hold
him once he's sedated?

646
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:24,478
It's made of promethium
metal. It's impenetrable.

647
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:26,179
Meanwhile, we'll be able
to keep track of King Shark

648
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,949
with this, and the cameras
that are on the lure.

649
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,984

813
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:43,375
Hail, hail, the gang's
all here. What's good?

814
00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:44,554
(SIGHS) Uh...

815
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,251
I need to apologize to you all.

816
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:52,744
Um...

817
00:39:53,546 --> 00:39:56,153
Last year I made a choice

818
00:39:56,153 --> 00:39:59,921
to go back in time and save my mother,

819
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:05,738
and that choice had a lot of consequences

820
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,817
that will haunt me for
the rest of my life,

821
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,790
just like I know it haunts all of you too.

822
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:18,838
Zoom, Jay's death...

823
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,013
It's all because of me,

824
00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:26,867
but I own those choices.

825
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:29,654
We're the ones who opened
the door to Earth-2.

826
00:40:29,655 --> 00:40:31,923
We're the ones who brought Zoom here,

827
00:40:31,924 --> 00:40:35,291
but we are also the ones
who are gonna stop him.

828
00:40:35,895 --> 00:40:36,995
How?

829
00:40:38,797 --> 00:40:41,164
How are we gonna stop Zoom, Allen?

830
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:43,668
I don't know yet.

831
00:40:47,506 --> 00:40:50,275
But those breaches aren't closed forever,

832
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:52,509
and we're not done with Earth-2.

833
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,686
Jay's death was not in vain.

834
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:06,945
We will meet Zoom again,

835
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:10,740
and the next time, I will beat him,

836
00:41:12,564 --> 00:41:14,264
whoever that monster is.

837
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:36,353
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

838
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:52,902
Well, this is a complication.

839
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:07,408
