1
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,054
Thanks.

2
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,738
No.

3
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,821
Hands up. Hands up!

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,622
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

5
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,496
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

6
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,454
Look, Dr. Brenner asked
for me specifically. Okay?

7
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,663
How else do you think
I got in here?

8
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,582
What's your name again?

9
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,383
It's Jim Hopper.

10
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,176
Chief Jim Hopper.

11
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,129
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper...

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,182
<i>Come again?</i>

13
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,438
Hey...

14
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,015
you mind if I borrow this one?

15
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,404
Drink.

16
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,783
It'll calm your nerves.

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,116
Help you think straight, yeah?

18
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,748
I don't know what to do.

19
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,592
I know. I know.

20
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,255
This whole time...

21
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,643
I... I could... I could feel him.

22
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,970
He was...

23
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,060
He was so close.
He was... he was right there.

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,893
I knew he was alive.

25
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,777
Our hands...
our hands were almost touching.

26
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,859
Now it's like I... uh...

27
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,155
God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

28
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,284
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

29
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,415
Like how everybody is looking at me.

30
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,417
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.

31
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,379
You're not gonna like this,

32
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,088
but I think you need to seriously consider
the possibility that all this...

33
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,469
It's in your head.

34
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,970
- You remember your Aunt Darlene?
- No.

35
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,023
No, this is not that.

36
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,316
I mean, when something like this happens,

37
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,440
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

38
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,940
I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral
tomorrow for our little boy

39
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,945
and you're saying his body is fake.

40
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,489
He's in the wall.

41
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,162
I mean, how do you explain that?

42
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,580
It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

43
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,380
At least go talk to a shrink or...

44
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,503
- What about Pastor Charles or someone...
- I don't... Well, they can't help.

45
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,459
Joyce, you just told me...

46
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,799
that Will is gone.

47
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,850
What else is there to do?

48
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,392
Hey.

49
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,158
Will?

50
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,619
Will?

51
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,285
Will?

52
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,459
Will?

53
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,270
What was Will saying?

54
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,571
Like home... Like home...

55
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,449
but dark?

56
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,785
And empty.

57
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,329
Empty and cold.
Wait, did he say cold?

58
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,502
I don't know.
The stupid radio kept going in and out.

59
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,999
It's like riddles in the dark.

60
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,955
Like home.
Like his house?

61
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,291
Or maybe like Hawkins.

62
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,920
Upside down.

63
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,253
- What'd she say?
- Upside down.

64
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,883
- What?
- Upside down.

65
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,760
When El showed us where Will was,
she flipped the board over, remember?

66
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,810
Upside down.

67
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,513
Dark. Empty.

68
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,439
Do you understand what he's talking about?

69
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,562
No.

70
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,938
Guys, come on, just think about it.

71
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,066
When El took us to find Will,
she took us to his house, right?

72
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,943
Yeah.
And he wasn't there.

73
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,740
But what if he was there?

74
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,784
What if we just couldn't see him?

75
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,827
What if he was on the other side?

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,078
What if this is Hawkins and...

77
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,752
this is where Will is?

78
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,454
The Upside Down.

79
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,255
Like the Vale of Shadows.

80
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,629
Will?

81
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,216
Will?

82
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,595
Will?

83
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,280
I see him! Hey! Stop!

84
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,242
"The Vale of Shadows"

85
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,580
is a dimension that is a dark reflection
or echo of our world.

86
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,635
<i>"It is a place of decay and death."</i>

87
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,057
Will?

88
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:37,012
"A plane out of phase.
A place of monsters."

89
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,854
"It is right next to you,
and you don't even see it."

90
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,310
Will?

91
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,488
Will?

92
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,566
An alternate dimension.

93
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,489
But... how... how do we get there?

94
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,615
You cast Shadow Walk.

95
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,991
In real life, dummy.

96
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,073
We can't shadow walk, but...

97
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,454
maybe she can.

98
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,917
Do you know how we get there?
To the Upside Down?

99
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,672
Oh, my God!

100
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,562
What the hell?

101
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,190
Hey!

102
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,276
Hey! Hey!

103
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,518
Hey, kid.

104
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,399
What's going on?

105
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,574
- Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.
- On the couch.

106
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,696
Yeah, I'm here
as long as you need me, okay?

107
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,574
How are you holding up?

108
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,328
What happened?

109
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,034
- Don't worry about that.
- Mom...

110
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,755
that thing you saw before,
did it come back?

111
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,548
Jonathan, that's enough.

112
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,044
Can we talk?

113
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,299
Alone?

114
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,348
- You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.

115
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,016
We all are.

116
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,188
But you need to listen to me.
Your mother is sick. Really sick.

117
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,764
Yeah. Well, you being here,

118
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,065
you're just making things worse,
like always.

119
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,187
- Worse?
- Yeah!

120
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,234
She took down that wall with an ax.

121
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,404
She said that Will was inside
and that he's talking to her.

122
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,981
Yeah.
Maybe he was.

123
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,816
This isn't some kind of joke.

124
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,902
Your mom was half frozen to death
when I got here.

125
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,361
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

126
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,697
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

127
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,952
or whatever the hell you want to call it,

128
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,533
you're gonna push her right over the edge.

129
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,997
You hear me?

130
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,382
Look, I'm on your side.

131
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,754
I'm here to help.

132
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,636
I'm gonna make things better
around here for all of us.

133
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,430
Thank God you're here.

134
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,723
Do me a favor.
At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.

135
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,471
If not for me, for your mother.

136
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,945
Take that down.
It's inappropriate.

137
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,831
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

138
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,625
Ah... there.
It's supposed to be a little tight.

139
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,790
Looks good.

140
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,248
Here we go.

141
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,334
You look nice, sweetie.

142
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,679
Anything else?

143
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,631
You can borrow my black heels if you want.

144
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,558
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

145
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,931
I'm fine. Thanks.

146
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,626
Ugh.

147
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,226
Come on.
Time to go.

148
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,936
Come on.

149
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,904
<i>"Fear not,
for I am with you.</i>

150
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,656
<i>Be not dismayed, for I am your God.</i>

151
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,617
I will strengthen you.

152
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,869
Yes, I will help you.

153
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,624
"I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand."

154
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,090
It's times like these
that our faith is challenged.

155
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,718
How, if He is truly benevolent...

156
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,049
could God take from us
someone so young, so innocent?

157
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,977
It would be easy to turn away from God...

158
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,306
but we must remember that nothing,

159
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,017
not even tragedy,
can separate us from His love.

160
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,104
We are here today to find comfort
in the truth of scripture,

161
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,439
and to surround Will and his family...

162
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,867
Just wait till we tell Will that
Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.

163
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,089
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

164
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,257
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

165
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,380
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

166
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,629
Take care, all right?
Thanks.

167
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,219
Thanks for coming out.

168
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,271
I see Will the Wise is back.

169
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,901
What's that shooting out of his cane?

170
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,405
Fireballs.

171
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,782
I couldn't find the red crayon,
so that's why it's green.

172
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,909
Oh, well...

173
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,037
if he's so wise,
why does he need fireballs?

174
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,336
Why can't he just, you know,
outsmart the bad guys?

175
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,043
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

176
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,422
But... sometimes the bad guys
are smart, too.

177
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,501
You know?

178
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,045
Yeah.

179
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,096
So he needs the fireballs?

180
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,971
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

181
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,474
All right. Well, I don't know
who's been raising you,

182
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,976
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

183
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,979
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

184
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:23,003
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

185
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,754
<i>Will! Will, it's us!
Are you there?</i>

186
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,214
<i>Can you hear us?
We're here!</i>

187
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,595
<i>Hello? Mom?</i>

188
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,519
<i>- Why can't he hear us?
- I don't know!</i>

189
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,892
<i>Mom, it's coming!</i>

190
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,187
She was there.

191
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,813
This is where we know
for sure it's been, right?

192
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,365
- So, that's...
- Steve's house.

193
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,989
And that's the woods
where they found Will's bike and...

194
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,159
that's my house.

195
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,114
- It's all so close.
- Yeah. Exactly.

196
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,575
I mean, it's all within a mile
or something.

197
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,957
Whatever this thing is, it's...
it's not traveling far.

198
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,960
You want to go out there.

199
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,841
We might not find anything.

200
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,259
I found something.

201
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,136
And if we do see it...

202
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,265
then what?

203
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,065
We kill it.

204
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,358
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

205
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,531
Are you serious?

206
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,995
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

207
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,256
This is a terrible idea.

208
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,880
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

209
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,883
What? You can tell someone,
but they're not gonna believe you.

210
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:37,963
You know that.

211
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,298
Your mom would.

212
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,884
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.

213
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,389
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

214
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,811
when this thing is dead.

215
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,443
I don't know what in the world caused it.

216
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,691
- Let's take a look, huh?
- Yeah.

217
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,444
Mr. Clarke says
he's never seen anything like it.

218
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,570
Mr. Clarke?

219
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,577
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

220
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,779
That right?

221
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,240
Apparently, some of the less
athletic types go nuts for this stuff.

222
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,864
Mr. Clarke?

223
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,570
Oh, hey, there.

224
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,781
How are you boys holding up?

225
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,998
We're... in... mourning.

226
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,830
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

227
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,210
We were wondering
if you had time to talk?

228
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,465
- We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.

229
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,467
<i>So, you know how in Cosmos,
Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions?</i>

230
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,673
Like, beyond our world?

231
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,258
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

232
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,433
Right, theoretically.

233
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,102
So, theoretically,
how do we travel there?

234
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,396
You guys have been thinking about

235
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,565
<i>Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation,
haven't you?</i>

236
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,270
Well, basically,
there are parallel universes.

237
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,775
Just like our world,

238
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,323
but just infinite variations of it.

239
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,571
Which means there's a world out there

240
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,244
where none of this tragic stuff
ever happened.

241
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,492
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.

242
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,118
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more

243
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,745
of an evil dimension,
like the Vale of Shadows.

244
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,371
You know the Vale of Shadows?

245
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,875
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic...

246
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,954
Yeah, exactly.

247
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,416
If that did exist,
a place like the Vale of Shadows,

248
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,842
how would we travel there?

249
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,794
- Theoretically.
- Well...

250
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,385
Picture... an acrobat...

251
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,812
standing on a tightrope.

252
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,515
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

253
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,067
And our dimension has rules.

254
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,987
You can move forwards, or backwards.

255
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,068
But, what if...

256
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,277
right next to our acrobat,
there is a flea?

257
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,489
Now, the flea can also travel
back and forth, just like the acrobat.

258
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,868
- Right?
- Right.

259
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,246
Here's where things
get really interesting.

260
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,623
The flea can also travel this way...

261
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,831
along the side of the rope.

262
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,540
He can even go...

263
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,717
underneath the rope.

264
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,011
- Upside down.
- Exactly.

265
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,339
But we're not the flea,
we're the acrobat.

266
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,675
In this metaphor, yes,
we're the acrobat.

267
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,384
So we can't go upside down?

268
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,810
No.

269
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,604
Well, is there any way for the acrobat
to get to the Upside Down?

270
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,275
Well... you'd have to create
a massive amount of energy.

271
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,149
More than humans are currently
capable of creating, mind you,

272
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,526
to open up some kind of tear
in time and space,

273
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,823
and then...

274
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,081
you create a doorway.

275
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,830
- Like a gate?
- Sure. Like a gate.

276
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,707
- But again, this is all...
- Theoretical.

277
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,255
But... but what if this gate
already existed?

278
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,754
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

279
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,130
It would disrupt gravity,

280
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,177
the magnetic field, our environment.

281
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,677
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

282
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,475
Science is neat.

283
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,304
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

284
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,941
Whoa.

285
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,536
Hey, Chief!

286
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,244
- Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

287
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,536
- Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

288
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,294
- We tried calling, but...
- Yeah, the phone's dead.

289
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,798
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in
this morning all upset.

290
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,551
Said that Dale and Henry
went hunting yesterday...

291
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,677
and they didn't come back home.

292
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:54,262
She thought they were on another binger,
but she's not so sure now.

293
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,557
I think this whole Will Byers thing
has everybody on edge.

294
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,267
- Where was this?
- It was at the station.

295
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,273
No, no. Where did Henry
and Dale go hunting?

296
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,229
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

297
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,821
Mirkwood.

298
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,149
What?

299
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,992
Okay.

300
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,786
You go back to the station.
I'll take care of this, all right?

301
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,539
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, leave it.

302
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,084
- Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What?

303
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,083
Barbara Holland's car.
Seems she ran away after all.

304
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,711
Staties found it late last night
at a bus station.

305
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,839
Funny, right?
They keep doing our job for us.

306
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,714
Yeah.
It's funny.

307
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,850
Is he off his meds again?

308
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,557
He's been spending too much time
with Joyce Byers.

309
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,892
That's what I think.

310
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,030
What are you doing?

311
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,736
What does it look like I'm doing?

312
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,366
You want to freeze to death all winter?

313
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,578
- I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.

314
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,039
How long are you gonna keep those up?
I mean, really?

315
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,384
You know, it's a shame
what they've done to this family.

316
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,260
- What?
- The Sattler Company.

317
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,057
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

318
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,181
I just wanted to look around, you know?

319
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,729
Couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.

320
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,397
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

321
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,524
Ought to be held accountable
if you ask me.

322
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,403
It would take a lot of energy
to build a gate like this.

323
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,577
But that's got to be what happened.

324
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,704
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
- Right.

325
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,661
What we want to know is,
do you know where the gate is?

326
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,498
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

327
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,552
Dustin, what are you doing?
Dustin?

328
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:56,884
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

329
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,890
- I... I need to see your compasses.
- What?

330
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,267
Your compasses.
All of your compasses, right now!

331
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,362
What's exciting about this?

332
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,941
- Well, they're all facing north, right?
- Yeah, so?

333
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,901
- Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean?

334
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,079
I mean exactly what I just said.
That's not true north.

335
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,498
Are you both seriously this dense?

336
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:26,706
The sun rises in the east,
and it sets in the west. Right?

337
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,166
Which means that's true north.

338
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,966
So what you're saying
is the compasses are broken.

339
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,512
Do you even understand
how a compass works?

340
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,840
- Do you see a battery pack in this?
- No.

341
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,926
No, you don't.
Because it doesn't need one.

342
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,807
The needle's naturally drawn
to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

343
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,308
So what's wrong with them?

344
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,391
Well, that's what I couldn't figure out,
but then I remembered.

345
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,521
You can change the direction
of a compass with a magnet.

346
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,978
If there's the presence
of a more powerful magnetic field,

347
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,779
the needle deflects to that power.

348
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,527
And then I remembered
what Mr. Clarke said.

349
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,279
The gate would have so much power...

350
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,951
It could disrupt
the electromagnetic field.

351
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,073
Exactly.

352
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,530
Meaning, if we follow
the compasses' north...

353
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,581
They should lead us to the gate.

354
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,137
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

355
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,466
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

356
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,140
- Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.

357
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,596
What? No.

358
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,727
Oh, no, I was just...

359
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,561
- thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.

360
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,520
Well, uh...

361
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:15,947
listen, I'm really sorry.

362
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,776
I mean, even before you threatened me
with the baseball bat.

363
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,611
Okay.

364
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,196
I panicked and...

365
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:28,077
- I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.

366
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,794
Did you get in trouble with your parents?

367
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,125
Totally, but...

368
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,381
you know, who cares?
Screw 'em.

369
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,303
Any news about Barbara?

370
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,349
- Parents heard from her? Or...
- No.

371
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,512
Hey, listen.

372
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,599
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

373
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,355
Just kinda pretend everything's normal
for a few hours.

374
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,232
<i>All The Right Moves is still playing.</i>

375
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,739
<i>You know, with your lover boy
from Risky Business?</i>

376
00:26:58,826 --> 00:26:59,862
Yeah, I know.

377
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,614
You know, Carol thinks
I actually kinda look like him.

378
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,444
What do you think? Huh?

379
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,662
I just, I... I don't think I can.

380
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,213
I've been really busy
with this whole funeral thing and...

381
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,419
with my brother.

382
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,220
It's been really hard on him.

383
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,923
Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah, yeah.

384
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,430
So...

385
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,139
I should go.

386
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,312
Sorry.

387
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,022
I'll call you later.
Is that okay?

388
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,779
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

389
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,883
- You were here for the money!
- No!

390
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,556
The money!
Admit it!

391
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,226
You aren't here 'cause of Will.
You never cared about him. You never did!

392
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,556
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today.
Do we have to do this right now?

393
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,187
- I can't believe I fell for this.
- I'm here to help, Joyce.

394
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,519
- To help?
- We could use that money for good.

395
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,276
Oh, like maybe
to pay off your debts?

396
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,698
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!

397
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,901
- Oh, don't do that.
- Do what?

398
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,987
- Lie to me!
- I'm not lying to you!

399
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,446
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?

400
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,576
- Huh?
- What?

401
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,248
Where does Jonathan
want to go to college?

402
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,247
We get that money,
anywhere he damn well pleases!

403
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,078
NYU, Lonnie!

404
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,711
He's wanted to go to NYU
since he was six years old!

405
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,087
So then he goes to NYU!

406
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,339
Get out.

407
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,883
Get out!

408
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,965
You need me here, Joyce.

409
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,723
Oh, brother,
I have not needed you for a long time!

410
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,054
Oh, no?
Look what happened.

411
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,316
Oh, don't you dare.

412
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,860
- At least I was here!
- Oh, come on, Joyce.

413
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,813
Just look around at this place.

414
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,273
All your Christmas lights.

415
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,451
What the hell am I supposed to think?
You're such a great mom? You're a mess!

416
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,745
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm out of my mind!

417
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:14,826
But, God help me, I will keep
these lights up until the day I die

418
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,628
if I think there's a chance
that Will's still out there!

419
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,632
Now, get out!

420
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,801
Get out of my house!

421
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,933
You're supposed
to hit the cans, right?

422
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:44,148
No, actually, you see the spaces
in between the cans?

423
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,107
I'm aiming for those.

424
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,237
Ah.

425
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,078
You ever shot a gun before?

426
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,032
Have you met my parents?

427
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,997
Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten.

428
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,496
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.

429
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,331
He made me kill a rabbit.

430
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,213
- A rabbit?
- Yeah.

431
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:08,013
I guess he thought it would make me
into more of a man or something.

432
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,427
I cried for a week.

433
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,678
Jesus.

434
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,055
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

435
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,389
I meant your dad.

436
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,689
Yeah.

437
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,735
I guess he and my mother
loved each other at some point, but...

438
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,151
I wasn't around for that part.

439
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,696
Um, yeah.

440
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,238
Just, uh, point and shoot.

441
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,205
I don't think my parents
ever loved each other.

442
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,252
They must've married for some reason.

443
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,705
My mom was young.

444
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,165
My dad was older,

445
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:49,345
but he had a cushy job, money,
came from a good family.

446
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,763
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

447
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,765
and started their nuclear family.

448
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,688
Screw that.

449
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:00,936
Yeah.

450
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,560
Screw that.

451
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,078
<i>- Hello?
- Hey.</i>

452
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,668
<i>Jim?</i>

453
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,495
Yeah.

454
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,252
<i>Why are you calling me here?
I told you not to call me.</i>

455
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,959
I know, I know, I know.
I just wanted to...

456
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,420
I just wanted to hear your voice and,
uh...

457
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,633
I just wanted to say that, um...

458
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,519
even after everything that happened,
I don't...

459
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,270
I don't regret any of it.

460
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,229
And those seven years, they were...
everything to me.

461
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,780
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

462
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,567
No.

463
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,824
No.

464
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,031
<i>Honey, hey...</i>

465
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,209
<i>Hey, it's okay...
it's okay.</i>

466
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,916
You know what, actually,
I have been drinking, I'm sorry.

467
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,372
<i>Jim, I can't...</i>

468
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,549
Just take care of yourself, okay?

469
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,001
Say hi to Bill for me.

470
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,381
<i>Are you sure...</i>

471
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,247
How much further?

472
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,411
I don't know.
These only tell direction, not distance.

473
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,713
You really need to learn more
about compasses.

474
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,256
I'm just saying.

475
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,755
How do we know
when we get to the gate?

476
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,509
Uh, I think a portal to another dimension
is gonna be pretty obvious.

477
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,011
Do you think she's acting weird?

478
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,689
You're asking if the weirdo
is acting weird?

479
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,893
I mean, weirder than normal?

480
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,612
I don't know.
Who cares?

481
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,910
How far, Papa?

482
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,242
Farther than we've ever gone before.

483
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,623
- The bath?
- Yes.

484
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,258
Yes, the bath.

485
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,047
Is that okay?

486
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,390
Okay.

487
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,563
Mike.

488
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,020
Yeah?

489
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,650
Turn back.

490
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,277
What? Why?

491
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,448
I'm tired.

492
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:24,324
Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

493
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,136
You never said what I was saying.

494
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,634
What?

495
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,844
Yesterday.

496
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,430
You thought I was saying something
and that's why you took my picture.

497
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,685
Oh, uh...

498
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,851
I don't know.

499
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,521
My guess...

500
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:04,743
I saw this girl, you know,
trying to be someone else.

501
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,287
But for that moment...

502
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,832
it was like you were alone,
or you thought you were.

503
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,285
And, you know,
you could just be yourself.

504
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:18,083
That is such bullshit.

505
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,542
What?

506
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,257
I am not trying to be someone else.

507
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,840
Just because I'm dating Steve
and you don't like him...

508
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,597
You know what? Forget it.
I just thought it was a good picture.

509
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,644
He's actually a good guy.

510
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,811
Okay.

511
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,190
Yesterday, with the camera...

512
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,311
He's not like that at all.

513
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,692
He was just being protective.

514
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,614
Yeah, that's one word for it.

515
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,533
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

516
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,111
No, I... I never said that.

517
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,412
He had every right to be pissed...

518
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,535
Okay, all right.
Does that mean I have to like him?

519
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,036
No.

520
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,210
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay?

521
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,163
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

522
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,252
You know, I was actually starting
to think that you were okay.

523
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,177
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

524
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,348
Yeah, I was thinking,
"Jonathan Byers,

525
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,677
maybe he's not the pretentious creep
everyone says he is."

526
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,727
Well, I was just starting
to think you were okay.

527
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,680
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,"

528
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,687
she's not just another suburban girl
who thinks she's rebelling

529
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,690
by doing exactly what
every other suburban girl does...

530
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,397
until that phase passes
and they marry some boring one-time jock

531
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,652
who now works sales,

532
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,577
and they live out a perfectly boring
little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

533
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,996
Exactly like their parents,
who they thought were so depressing,

534
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,074
"but now, hey, they get it."

535
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,302
Go away, Lonnie.

536
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,302
Seriously!

537
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,263
I am gonna murd...

538
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,098
What? What?

539
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,284
Oh, Jesus.

540
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,792
Oh, no.

541
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,674
"Oh, no"?
What's, "Oh, no"?

542
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,221
- We're headed back home.
- What?

543
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,548
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

544
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,009
Setting sun, right there.
We looped right back around.

545
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,594
And you're just realizing this now?

546
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,601
- Why is this all on me?
- Because you're the compass genius!

547
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,182
What do yours say?

548
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,812
North.

549
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,361
Makes no damn sense.

550
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,404
Maybe the gate moved.

551
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,357
No, I don't think it's the gate.

552
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,285
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

553
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,112
Maybe it's something here.

554
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,619
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

555
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,370
It's not a magnet.

556
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,372
She's been acting weirder than normal.

557
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,296
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

558
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,418
Why would she do that?

559
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,465
Because she's trying
to sabotage our mission.

560
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,884
Because she's a traitor!

561
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,925
Lucas, what are you doing?

562
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,887
You did it, didn't you?

563
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,765
You don't want us to reach the gate.

564
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,642
You don't want us to find Will.

565
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,847
Lucas, come on, seriously,

566
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,102
- just leave her alone!
- Admit it.

567
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,808
- No.
- Admit it!

568
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,987
- Fresh blood. I knew it.
- Lucas, come on!

569
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,157
I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks!
She was using her powers!

570
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,030
Bull! That's old blood.
Right, El?

571
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,196
Right, El?

572
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,871
It's... not...

573
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,499
it's not safe.

574
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,059
Okay.

575
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,735
Should be okay, I mean...

576
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,814
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

577
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,570
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

578
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,867
They bugged my place.

579
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,285
- What?
- They bugged my place.

580
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,829
They put a microphone in the light.

581
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,160
It's because I'm on to them
and they know it.

582
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,961
- I don't know...
- Who?

583
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,414
I thought they might be watching you, too.

584
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,750
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,
Department of Energy... I don't know.

585
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,006
You gotta explain this to me,
'cause I am not...

586
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,134
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

587
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,640
What?

588
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,635
It wasn't him.

589
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,516
What?

590
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,723
Will's body, it was a fake.

591
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,406
You were right.

592
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,070
This whole time, you were right.

593
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,202
What did I tell you?
She's been playing us from the beginning!

594
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,504
That's not true.
She helped us find Will!

595
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,923
Find Will?

596
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,377
Where is he, then? Huh?
I don't see him.

597
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,134
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.

598
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,465
Just think about it, Mike.

599
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,266
She could've just told us where
the Upside Down was right away,

600
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,434
but she didn't.

601
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,433
She just made us
run around like headless chickens.

602
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,139
- All right, calm down!
- No!

603
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,020
She used us, all of us!

604
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,477
She helped just enough
so she could get what she wants.

605
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,777
Food and a bed.

606
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,071
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas!

607
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,149
No! Screw you, Mike.
You're blind...

608
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,530
blind because you like
that a girl's not grossed out by you.

609
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,078
But wake up, man!
Wake the hell up!

610
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,206
She knows where Will is,

611
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,079
and now she's just letting him die
in the Upside Down.

612
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,627
- Shut up!
- For all we know, it's her fault.

613
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,750
Shut up.

614
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,298
We're looking for some stupid monster...

615
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:55,594
but did you ever stop to think
that maybe she's the monster?

616
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,009
I said shut up!

617
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,558
- Stop!
- Knock it off, you idiots.

618
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,976
- Stop it!
- Mike, get off!

619
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,974
Stop it!

620
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,435
Jesus!

621
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,315
Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas, are you all right?

622
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,150
- Lucas.
- Lucas, come on!

623
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,327
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- Come on, Lucas!

624
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,075
Why would you do that?

625
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,532
- Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

626
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,827
What is wrong with you?

627
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,993
What is that?

628
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,407
I have no idea.

629
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:04,298
Help! Help!

630
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,222
Come on, wake up.
Come on!

631
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,229
Lucas...
Lucas, come on!

632
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,397
Lucas.

633
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,566
Lucas, you okay?

634
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,737
Lucas... Lucas,
how many fingers am I holding up?

635
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,193
Lucas, how many fingers?

636
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,279
- Let me see your head.
- Get off of me!

637
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,785
Just... Lucas.
Lucas, let me see.

638
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,161
Get off of me!

639
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,286
- Lucas, come on.
- Let him go.

640
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,586
Man, let him go.

641
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,929
Where is El?

642
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,175
El?

643
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,556
- El!
- Eleven!

644
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,476
El!

645
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,566
- Eleven!
- El!

646
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:58,853
Eleven!

647
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,212
What, are you tired?

648
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,763
Shut up.

649
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,885
What?

650
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,012
I heard something.

651
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,367
Oh, God.

652
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,839
It's been hit by a car.

653
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,554
We can't just leave it.

654
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,610
I'll do it.

655
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,164
- I thought you said...
- I'm not nine anymore.

656
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,398
What was that?

657
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,352
Where'd it go?

658
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,475
I don't know.

659
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,518
Do you see any more blood?

660
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,062
No.

661
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,909
Jonathan?

662
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,376
Nancy!

663
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,425
Nancy?

664
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,099
Nancy?

665
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,726
Nancy, where are you?

666
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,438
Nancy!

667
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,983
Nancy!

668
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:38,007
