Movietown News presents
Spotlight on Adventure.

2
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,179
What you are now witnessing

3
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,765
is footage never before seen
by civilized humanity,

4
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,600
a lost world in South America.

5
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,894
Lurking in the shadow
of majestic Paradise Falls,

6
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,938
it sports plants and animals
undiscovered by science.

7
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:07,316
Who would dare set foot
on this inhospitable summit?

8
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:11,320
Why, our subject today,
Charles Muntz!

9
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,489
The beloved explorer lands
his dirigible, the Spirit of Adventure,

10
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:15,990
in New Hampshire this week,

11
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:19,117
completing a yearlong expedition
to the lost world.

12
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,120
This lighter-than-air craft
was designed by Muntz himself

13
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:26,166
and is longer than 22 prohibition
paddy wagons placed end to end.

14
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,002
And here comes the adventurer now.

15
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,253
Never apart from his faithful dogs,

16
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:33,631
Muntz conceived the craft
for canine comfort.

17
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:35,758
It's a veritable floating palace
in the sky,

18
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:39,303
complete with doggy bath
and mechanical canine walker.

19
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:43,599
And, Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
consider Muntz the bee's knees.

20
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:45,017
And how!

21
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:47,478
Adventure is out there!

22
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:52,191
But what
has Muntz brought back this time?

23
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:57,029
Gentlemen, I give you
the monster of Paradise Falls!

24
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,033
And, golly, what a swell monster this is!

25
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:04,785
But what's this? Scientists cry foul.

26
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:07,037
The National Explorer's Society
accuses Muntz

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,872
of fabricating the skeleton.

28
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:10,123
No!

29
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:11,959
The organization strips Muntz

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,210
of his membership.

31
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:18,881
Humiliated,
Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls

32
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:21,884
and promises
to capture the beast alive!

33
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:24,679
! promise to capture the beast alive,

34
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:28,474
and I will not come back until I do!

35
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:32,519
And so,
the explorer's off to clear his name.

36
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:34,312
Bon voyage, Charles Muntz,

37
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,817
and good luck capturing
the monster of Paradise Falls!

38
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,117
Here's Charles Muntz

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,452
piloting his famous dirigible.

40
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,583
He hurdles Pikes Peak.

41
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,710
He hurdles the Grand Canyon.

42
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:01,713
He hurdles Mount Everest.

43
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:07,385
He goes around Mount Everest.

44
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:10,305
Is there nothing he cannot do?

45
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:14,766
Yes, as Muntz himself says,
"Adventure is..."”

46
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:18,312
Adventure is out there!
Look out!

47
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:21,315
Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!

48
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:25,277
Must get Spirit of Adventure
over Mount Rushmore!

49
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:29,447
Hold together, old girl.
How're my dogs doing?

50
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:36,954
All engines, ahead full!
Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.

51
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:39,832
Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.

52
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:43,710
It's a beautiful day.
Winds out of the east at 10 knots.

53
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:48,298
Visibility unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook.

54
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:52,636
Oh! There's something down there.
I will bring it back for science.

55
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:59,433
Aw! It's a puppy! Ah! No time!
A storm! Lightning. Hail.

56
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:00,976
- What are you doing?
- Ahhh!

57
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:03,979
Don't you know
this is an exclusive club?

58
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:06,023
Only explorers get in here,

59
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:10,026
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles.

60
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:13,029
Do you think you've got what it takes?
Well, do you?

61
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:16,866
All right, you're in. Welcome aboard.

62
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:20,870
What's wrong? Can't you talk?

63
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:25,374
Hey, I don't bite.

64
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:32,254
You and me, we're in a club now.

65
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:40,096
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on. Let's go get it.

66
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:43,057
My name's Ellie.

67
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:47,728
There it is.

68
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,817
Well, go ahead.

69
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,240
Go on.

70
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:21,717
Ow.

71
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:23,135
Hey, kid!

72
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,513
Thought you might need
a little cheering up.

73
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:28,432
I got something to show you.

74
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:33,145
I am about to let you
see something

75
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:35,981
I have never shown
to another human being.

76
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,442
Ever! In my life!

77
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:42,738
You'll have to swear
you will not tell anyone.

78
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:46,116
Cross your heart. Do it!

79
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:51,037
My Adventure Book.

80
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:54,331
You know him.

81
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,085
Charles Muntz, explorer.

82
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,213
When I get big,
I'm going where he's going,

83
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:06,885
South America.
It's like America, but south.

84
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,554
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

85
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:14,516
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

86
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,895
I ripped this right out of a library book.

87
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:23,649
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there
and park it right next to the falls.

88
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:26,360
Who knows what lives up there.

89
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,571
And once I get there?

90
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:32,617
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.

91
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:38,623
Only I just don't know
how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.

92
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,423
That's it!
You can take us there in a blimp!

93
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:51,468
Swear you'll take us! Cross your heart!

94
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:56,598
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good, you promised. No backing out.

95
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,183
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

96
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:04,270
Adventure is out there!

97
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,108
You know, you don't talk very much.

98
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:10,318
I like you!

99
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:14,154
Wow.

100
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:00,656
o

101
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:02,588
Hah!

102
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,221
Stevie, throw me a deuce!

103
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:45,434
Quite a sight, huh, Ellie?

104
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:51,272
Uh! Mail's here.

105
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:08,581
Shady Oaks Retirement.
Oh, brother.

106
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,793
Hmm...

107
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:21,009
Hey! Morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
Need any help there?

108
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:22,969
No. Yes!

109
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:27,264
Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.

110
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:28,808
Well, just to let you know,

111
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,477
my boss will be happy to take
this old place off your hands,

112
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,978
and for double his last offer!

113
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:35,271
What do you say to that?

114
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,859
Uh, I take that as a "no," then?

115
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:43,321
I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.

116
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,990
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

117
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:49,201
Yeah, that was good.
Here, let me talk to him.

118
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:56,875
You in the suit.
Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie!

119
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:59,378
I am not with him!

120
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:03,048
This is serious!
He's out to get your house.

121
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:06,135
Tell your boss
he can have our house.

122
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:08,679
- Really?
- When I'm dead!

123
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,516
I'll take that as a maybe.

124
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:14,851
Order now,
you get the camera,

125
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:18,186
you get the printer, 4x optical zoom,

126
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,730
Schneider lens, photo printer, SD card.

127
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:28,655
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell.

128
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:34,034
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer
in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12.

129
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,204
"Are you in need
of any assistance today, sir?"

130
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:38,330
No.

131
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:41,542
- I could help you cross the street.
- No.

132
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,588
- I could help you cross your yard.
- No.

133
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:49,340
- I could help you cross your porch.
- No.

134
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,759
Well, I gotta help you cross something.

135
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,887
No. I'm doing fine.

136
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,729
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell."

137
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,897
- Kid... Kid.
-"And I am a Wilderness Explorer

138
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:09,568
-"in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."
-1... Slow down. Kid!

139
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:11,904
-"Are you in need of any assistance..."
- Thank you,

140
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:13,529
-but I don't need any help!
-"...today, sir?"

141
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:16,407
Ow.

142
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,079
Proceed.

143
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:25,458
-"Good afternoon..."
- But skip to the end!

144
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:30,378
See these? These are
my Wilderness Explorer badges.

145
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,592
You may notice one is missing.
It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.

146
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:40,388
If I get it, I will become
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

147
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:43,098
"The wilderness must be explored!"

148
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:45,267
Caw, caw! Raar!

149
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:49,146
It's gonna be great!
There's a big ceremony,

150
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:52,775
and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges.

151
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,776
So, you want to assist an old person?

152
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:58,279
Yep! Then I'll be
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

153
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,617
- You ever heard of a snipe?
- Snipe?

154
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:04,744
Bird. Beady eyes.

155
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:08,790
Every night it sneaks in my yard
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

156
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:14,628
I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it.
If only someone could help me.

157
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,090
- Me, me! I'll do it!
- I don't know. It's awfully crafty.

158
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:21,134
You'd have to clap your hands
three times to lure it in.

159
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,011
I'll find him, Mr. Fredricksen!

160
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:25,471
I think its burrow is two blocks down.
If you go past...

161
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:28,641
Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe.

162
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,602
Here, snipey, snipey.

163
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,312
Bring it back here when you find it.

164
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:34,480
Snipe!

165
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:35,690
Okay, keep her coming.
Keep coming.

166
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,819
And stop. Stop. Stop!

167
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:45,531
Why... Hey! Hey, you!

168
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:47,157
What do you...
What do you think you're doing?

169
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,660
- I am so sorry, sir.
- Don't touch that!

170
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,328
No, no, no.
Let me take care of that for you.

171
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,497
- Get away from our mailbox!
- Hey. Sir, ll...

172
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,040
I don't want you to touch it!

173
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,166
Ow!

174
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,012
Steve, you all right?

175
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:45,211
Sorry,
Mr. Fredricksen.

176
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:49,549
You don't seem like
a public menace to me. Take this.

177
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:53,720
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?

178
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:10,027
What do I do now, Ellie?

179
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:41,570
Morning, gentlemen.

180
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,573
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
You ready to go?

181
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:47,784
Ready as I'll ever be.

182
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:50,245
Would you do me a favor
and take this?

183
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:52,622
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute.

184
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:57,043
I wanna say one last goodbye
to the old place.

185
00:20:57,543 --> 00:20:59,920
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.

186
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:06,551
That's typical. He's probably
going to the bathroom for the 80th time.

187
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:10,263
You think he'd take better
care of his house.

188
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,555
So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

189
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,851
Heh!

190
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:27,307
We're on our way, Ellie.

191
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:15,225
Huh?

192
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:21,397
Hmm.

193
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,458
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell.

194
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,543
What are you doing out here, kid?

195
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:46,380
I found the snipe
and I followed it under your porch,

196
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:51,301
but this snipe had a long tail
and looked more like a large mouse.

197
00:24:57,098 --> 00:24:58,808
Please let me in.

198
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:00,476
No.

199
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:07,232
Oh, alright, you can come...

200
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:09,651
...in.

201
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:16,448
Huh.

202
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,662
I've never been
in a floating house before.

203
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:27,292
Goggles. Look at this stuff.
Wow! You're going on a trip?

204
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,088
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

205
00:25:31,171 --> 00:25:32,923
You're going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?

206
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:34,842
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.

207
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,010
You know, most people take a plane,

208
00:25:37,094 --> 00:25:40,431
but you're smart because you will
have all your TV and clocks and stuff.

209
00:25:40,513 --> 00:25:43,474
Whoa.
Is this how you steer your house?

210
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:44,976
Does it really work?

211
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:47,478
Kid, would you stop with the...

212
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,105
- This makes it go right.
- Let go of that...

213
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:51,691
- And that way's left.
- Knock it off!

214
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:53,818
Hey, look! Buildings.

215
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:57,820
That building's so close
I could almost touch it.

216
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:03,159
Wow! This is great!

217
00:26:03,534 --> 00:26:05,703
You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen.

218
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:09,206
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

219
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:11,833
Hey! I can see your house from here.

220
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,711
Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa!

221
00:26:16,838 --> 00:26:18,381
Well, that's not gonna work.

222
00:26:18,548 --> 00:26:21,718
I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus.

223
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:22,886
Did you know that

224
00:26:23,303 --> 00:26:24,637
the cumulonimbus forms

225
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:26,222
when warm air rises over cool air?

226
00:26:26,347 --> 00:26:29,642
Stayed up all night
blowing up balloons...for what?

227
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:30,852
...and that's how we get lightning.

228
00:26:30,894 --> 00:26:32,353
- That's nice, kid.
- Mr. Fredricksen?

229
00:26:33,563 --> 00:26:35,565
There's a storm coming.
It's starting to get scary.

230
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:39,318
We're gonna get blown to bits!
We're in big trouble...

231
00:26:40,736 --> 00:26:43,238
- What are you doing over there?
- Look.

232
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:57,042
See? Cumulonimbus.

233
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:34,118
My pack!

234
00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:40,290
Got ya!

235
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:19,286
I thought you were dead.

236
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:23,456
What happened?

237
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:26,959
I steered us. I did. I steered the house.

238
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:28,127
Steered us?

239
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:30,963
After you tied your stuff down,
you took a nap.

240
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:33,089
<i>So went ahead
and steered us down here.</i>

241
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,883
Yeah. Sure.

242
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,855
Can't tell where we are.

243
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,982
Oh, we're in South America, all right.

244
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:55,694
It was a cinch
with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.

245
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:58,488
- GP... What?
- My dad gave it to me.

246
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,865
It shows exactly where we are
on the planet.

247
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,703
With this baby, we'll never be lost!

248
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,375
Oops.

249
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,337
We'll get you down, find a bus stop,

250
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,465
you just tell the man
you wanna go back to your mother.

251
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,218
Sure, but I don't think
they have buses in Paradise Falls.

252
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,724
There. That ought to do it.

253
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:29,642
Here, I'll give you
some change for bus fare.

254
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:32,227
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

255
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,981
Whoa. That's gonna be
like a billion transfers

256
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,733
to get back to my house.

257
00:29:44,238 --> 00:29:47,200
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

258
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:51,079
Well, we're up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.

259
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,541
That thing was... building or something.

260
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:59,044
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

261
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:01,421
We can't be close to the ground yet.

262
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:13,265
Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't!

263
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,060
Wait, wait. Wait!

264
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:24,235
- Russell, hang on! Hey!
Whoa! Whoa!

265
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:34,244
Aaaagggghhhhh!

266
00:30:34,452 --> 00:30:35,954
Walk back. Walk back.
- Okay.

267
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:37,914
Come on. Come on.

268
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:53,303
Where... Where are we?

269
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:58,140
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.

270
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,978
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

271
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:29,795
There it is.

272
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,364
Ellie, it's so beautiful.

273
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:04,327
We made it.

274
00:32:04,368 --> 00:32:09,165
We made it! Russell! We could float
right over there! Climb up. Climb up!

275
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:10,666
You mean, assist you?

276
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,002
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
- Okay. I'll climb up.

277
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,717
Watch it!
Sorry.

278
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:32,187
Now, when you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up!

279
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:34,521
Got it?

280
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:40,318
You on the porch yet?

281
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:48,742
What? That's it?

282
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:54,414
I came all this way just to get stuck
at the wrong end of this rock pile?

283
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,209
Great.

284
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:05,926
Hey, if I could assist you over there,
would you sign off on my badge?

285
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:11,223
- What are you talking about?
- We could walk your house to the falls.

286
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:14,893
- Walk it?
- Yeah! After all, we weigh it down.

287
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:18,271
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.

288
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,861
Now, we're gonna walk
to the falls quickly and quietly

289
00:33:25,944 --> 00:33:28,572
-with no rap music or flash-dancing.
Uh-huh.

290
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:33,450
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those balloons.

291
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:36,036
And if we're not at the falls
when that happens...

292
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,455
- Sand.
-...we're not getting to the falls.

293
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:40,416
I found sand!

294
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:44,962
Don't you worry, Ellie.
We'll get our house over there.

295
00:33:49,465 --> 00:33:51,968
This is fun already, isn't it?

296
00:33:52,302 --> 00:33:55,930
By the time we get there,
you're gonna feel so assisted.

297
00:33:56,055 --> 00:33:59,642
Oh, Mr. Fredricksen,
if we happen to get separated,

298
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,895
use the Wilderness Explorer call.

299
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:03,980
Caw, caw! Raar!

300
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:07,942
Wait. Why are we going
to Paradise Falls again?

301
00:34:07,984 --> 00:34:10,111
Hey, let's play a game.

302
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:13,404
It's called
"see who can be quiet the longest."

303
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:16,324
Cool!
My mom loves that game!

304
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,175
Darn thing!

305
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,886
Come on, Russell.
Would you hurry it up?

306
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,224
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.

307
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:29,850
Which knee?

308
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:34,897
My elbow hurts,
and I have to go to the bathroom.

309
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:37,733
I asked you about that five minutes ago.

310
00:35:37,857 --> 00:35:41,027
Well, 1 didn't have to go then!

311
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:47,492
I don't wanna walk
anymore. Can we stop?

312
00:35:47,574 --> 00:35:50,703
Russell, if you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

313
00:35:50,744 --> 00:35:55,207
There are no tigers in South America.
Zoology.

314
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,504
On, for the love of Pete! Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

315
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:02,756
Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.

316
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:07,385
I've always wanted to try this.

317
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:12,598
Mr. Fredricksen,

318
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:15,727
am I supposed to dig the hole
before or after?

319
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:18,354
None of my concern!

320
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,940
Oh. It's before!

321
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:23,608
Bah!
La la la la la!

322
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:28,071
Huh?

323
00:36:29,698 --> 00:36:31,366
Tracks?

324
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:33,701
Snipe.

325
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:39,248
Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe.

326
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,042
Snipe.

327
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:44,210
Huh?

328
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:04,563
Ha! Gotcha! Don't be afraid, little snipe.

329
00:37:04,646 --> 00:37:09,318
I am a Wilderness Explorer,
so I'm a friend to all of nature.

330
00:37:09,902 --> 00:37:11,612
Want some more?

331
00:37:14,073 --> 00:37:18,285
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.

332
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:24,832
Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

333
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:29,587
Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice...

334
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:32,588
Giant snipe.

335
00:37:37,134 --> 00:37:40,513
- I found the snipe!
- Oh! Did you?

336
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:43,140
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes, they're very tall.

337
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:46,268
- Do they have a lot of colors?
- They do, indeed!

338
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:50,106
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yes... chocolate?

339
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:55,694
- Gah! What is that thing?
- It's a snipe!

340
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:57,822
There's no such thing as a snipe!

341
00:37:57,862 --> 00:38:00,615
- But you said snipes eat your... Whoa!
- Hey!

342
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:04,702
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!

343
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,334
Whoa!</i>

344
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,627
<i>Whoa!</i>

345
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,712
Careful, Russell!

346
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:20,716
Hey, look, Mr. Fredricksen.
It likes me. Whoa!

347
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:24,053
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles.

348
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,306
Get out of here! Go on! Get!

349
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:39,484
Uh-oh. No, no, no! Kevin!
It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

350
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,737
- Kevin?
- Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.

351
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,076
Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
Hey! That's mine!

352
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,583
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

353
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:57,376
Go on! Beat it!

354
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,924
Can we keep him? Please?

355
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,928
I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.
I'll change his newspapers.

356
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:09,095
No.

357
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:14,433
"An Explorer is a friend to all,
be it plants or fish or tiny mole."

358
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:17,269
- That doesn't even rhyme.
- Yeah, it does.

359
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:20,272
- Hey, look. Kevin.
- What?

360
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:24,443
Get down! You're not allowed up there!

361
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:29,280
You come down here right now!

362
00:39:32,366 --> 00:39:33,451
Sheesh!

363
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:35,620
Can you believe this, Ellie?

364
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:36,787
Ellie?

365
00:39:37,788 --> 00:39:40,541
Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?

366
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,461
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

367
00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:45,922
She said for you to let me.

368
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,798
But I told him no. I told you no!

369
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:49,300
N-O.

370
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,479
I see you back there.

371
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,317
Go on! Get out of here! Shoo!
Go annoy someone else for a while.

372
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,985
Hey, are you okay over there?

373
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:17,242
Uh... Hello?

374
00:40:21,578 --> 00:40:22,621
Oh!

375
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:25,457
Hello, sir! Thank goodness.

376
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:27,960
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

377
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:29,795
I can smell you.

378
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:33,507
What? You can smell us?

379
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:36,969
I can smell you.

380
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:45,351
Hey.

381
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:47,853
You were talking to a rock.

382
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:51,022
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.

383
00:40:51,106 --> 00:40:54,109
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog.

384
00:40:55,527 --> 00:40:57,529
- It is a dog!
- What?

385
00:40:58,446 --> 00:41:01,533
We're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.

386
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:05,202
Hey, I like dogs.

387
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:06,954
We have your dog!

388
00:41:07,371 --> 00:41:09,373
- Whoa!
- Wonder who he belongs to.

389
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:13,043
Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained. Shake.

390
00:41:13,377 --> 00:41:14,461
Uh-huh.

391
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:15,546
- Speak.
Hi, there.

392
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:19,549
Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?

393
00:41:19,674 --> 00:41:20,842
Oh, yes.

394
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:24,971
My name is Dug.
I have just met you, and I love you.

395
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,392
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master,

396
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:33,021
and he made me this collar
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

397
00:41:34,896 --> 00:41:36,231
My master is good and smart.

398
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:37,399
It's not possible.

399
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:39,985
Oh, it is,
because my master is smart.

400
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:42,070
- Cool! What do these do, boy?
Hey, would you...

401
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:44,406
I use that collar...

402
00:41:45,698 --> 00:41:47,908
...10 talk with.
I would be happy if you stopped.

403
00:41:48,034 --> 00:41:51,412
Russell, don't touch that!
It could be radioactive or something!

404
00:41:51,537 --> 00:41:52,830
I am a great tracker.

405
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:56,000
My pack sent me on a special mission
all by myself.

406
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,209
Have you seen a bird?

407
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,545
I want to find one,
and I've been on the scent.

408
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:01,755
I am a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

409
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:04,591
Hey, that is the bird.

410
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:07,594
I have never seen one up close,
but this is the bird.

411
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:10,221
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

412
00:42:10,263 --> 00:42:14,267
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog.

413
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:15,434
I can bark.

414
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:17,770
And here's howling.

415
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,526
Can we keep him?
Please, please, please!

416
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:27,779
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

417
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:31,449
It's just a weird trick or something.
Let's get to the falls.

418
00:42:31,574 --> 00:42:32,950
Please be my prisoner.

419
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:35,620
Oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner!

420
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,626
Oh! Here it is.
I picked up the bird's scent!

421
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:44,044
Wail 2 minute, wait a minute!
What is this?</i>

422
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:45,962
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

423
00:42:46,088 --> 00:42:50,550
I'm getting prunes
and denture cream! Who are they?

424
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:52,969
Oh, man,
Master will not be pleased.

425
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:56,098
We better tell him someone
took the bird. Right, Alpha?

426
00:42:57,807 --> 00:42:58,933
No.

427
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:01,811
Soon enough the bird
will be ours yet again.

428
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:03,979
Find the scent, my compadres,

429
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,815
and you too shall
have much rewardings

430
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,651
from Master for the toil factor
you wage.

431
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:12,446
Hey, Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

432
00:43:12,486 --> 00:43:13,737
You must've bumped it.

433
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:16,115
Yeah,
your voice sounds funny!

434
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,997
Beta! Gamma!
Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!</i>

435
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:28,127
Mayhaps you desire
to challenge the ranking

436
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:30,796
that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning.

437
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,633
No, no, no. But maybe
Dug would. You might wanna ask him.

438
00:43:35,592 --> 00:43:40,556
Yeah. I wonder if he's found
the bird on his very special mission.

439
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:42,724
Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.

440
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:48,062
His fool's errand will keep him
most occupied. Most occupied indeed.

441
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:53,192
Do you not agree with that
which I am saying to you now?

442
00:43:53,275 --> 00:43:57,571
Sure, but the second Master
finds out you sent Dug out by himself,

443
00:43:57,654 --> 00:43:59,239
none of us will get a treat.

444
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:02,451
You are wise,
my trusted lieutenant.

445
00:44:04,243 --> 00:44:06,829
This is Alpha calling Dug.
Come in, Dug.

446
00:44:07,162 --> 00:44:09,748
Hi, Alpha.
Hey, your voice sounds funny.

447
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:12,917
I know, I know!
Have you seen the bird?

448
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:15,754
Why, yes.
The bird is my prisoner now.

449
00:44:15,837 --> 00:44:17,297
Yeah, right!

450
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,092
Impossible! Where are you?

451
00:44:21,176 --> 00:44:22,594
I am here with the bird,

452
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:25,430
and I will bring it back,
and then you will like me.

453
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,932
- Gotta go.
- Hey, Dug, who you talking to?

454
00:44:28,016 --> 00:44:29,934
No, wait, wait!
What's Dug doing?

455
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:31,853
Why's he with
that small mailman?

456
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:33,563
Where are they?

457
00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:37,941
There he is. Come on!

458
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:45,282
Oh, please, oh, please,
oh, please be my prisoner.

459
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:46,784
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

460
00:44:46,867 --> 00:44:48,786
That man there says
I can take the bird,

461
00:44:50,203 --> 00:44:51,621
and I love that man there
like he is my master.

462
00:44:51,703 --> 00:44:52,788
I am not your master!

463
00:44:52,871 --> 00:44:54,414
I am warning you
once again, bird.

464
00:44:54,498 --> 00:44:56,500
- Hey! Quit it!
I am jumping on you now, bird.

465
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:58,877
Russell, at this rate,
we'll never get to the falls.

466
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,295
Here, bird.

467
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,179
I am nobody's master, got it?

468
00:45:10,262 --> 00:45:12,723
I don't want you here,
and I don't want you here!

469
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:14,099
I'm stuck with you!

470
00:45:14,183 --> 00:45:16,852
And if you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

471
00:45:16,936 --> 00:45:19,480
A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy!
A ball!

472
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:22,983
Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy?

473
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:24,944
Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah?

474
00:45:25,027 --> 00:45:27,071
Yes, I do!
I do ever so want the ball.

475
00:45:27,154 --> 00:45:28,614
- Go get it!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

476
00:45:28,697 --> 00:45:30,533
I will get it and then bring it back!

477
00:45:30,616 --> 00:45:32,159
Quick, Russell.
Give me some chocolate.

478
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:34,285
- Why?
- Just give it to me!

479
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:36,120
Bird. Bird!

480
00:45:38,498 --> 00:45:40,291
Come on, Russell.

481
00:45:40,624 --> 00:45:43,001
Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

482
00:45:48,214 --> 00:45:49,924
What are we doing?

483
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,141
Hey, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.

484
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:06,773
I think that did the trick.

485
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,026
Hi, Master.

486
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:12,195
Afternoon.

487
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:40,889
Well, thanks for keeping us
dry anyway, Ellie.

488
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,849
Which one's the front?

489
00:46:44,516 --> 00:46:45,726
Oh, boy.

490
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:49,521
Is this step three or step five?

491
00:46:51,815 --> 00:46:53,066
There.

492
00:46:57,029 --> 00:46:59,364
All done! That's for you.

493
00:47:05,703 --> 00:47:06,787
Oh...

494
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:08,372
Tents are hard.

495
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:14,170
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,
with the GPMs and the badges?

496
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:18,966
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?

497
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:22,385
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

498
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:26,431
I never actually built a tent before.
There, I said it.

499
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:29,141
You've been camping before,
haven't you?

500
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:31,685
Well, never outside.

501
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:35,606
Well, why didn't you ask your dad
how to build a tent?

502
00:47:36,065 --> 00:47:38,901
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

503
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,612
Well, why don't you try him sometime.
Maybe he'll surprise you.

504
00:47:41,694 --> 00:47:44,030
Well, he's away a lot.
I don't see him much.

505
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:45,740
He's gotta be home sometime.

506
00:47:45,823 --> 00:47:50,078
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

507
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:53,581
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

508
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,833
Phyllis isn't my mom.

509
00:47:58,085 --> 00:47:59,127
<i>Oh.</i>

510
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:10,389
But he promised
he'd come to my Explorer ceremony

511
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,265
to pin on
my Assisting the Elderly badge.

512
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,478
So, he can show me
about tents then, right?

513
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:26,653
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?

514
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:30,573
Don't wanna wake up
the traveling flea circus.

515
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:34,119
Mr. Fredricksen?

516
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:37,080
Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner.

517
00:48:37,955 --> 00:48:39,915
We have to protect him.

518
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:44,169
Can Kevin go with us?

519
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:47,715
All right, he can come.

520
00:48:48,382 --> 00:48:50,509
Promise you won't leave him?

521
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,137
- Yeah.
- Cross your heart?

522
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:03,228
Cross my heart.

523
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:11,278
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

524
00:49:34,466 --> 00:49:36,217
Morning, sweetheart.

525
00:49:38,386 --> 00:49:39,971
We better get moving.

526
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:44,017
Bird's gone.

527
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,687
Maybe Russell won't notice.
All right, everybody up!

528
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,982
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

529
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:56,903
Find the bird, find the bird!
Hi, hi. Point!

530
00:49:56,986 --> 00:49:58,863
Look. There he is!

531
00:50:01,282 --> 00:50:02,450
Point!

532
00:50:02,825 --> 00:50:06,496
Hey! That's my food! Get off my roof!

533
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:07,830
Yeah, get off of his...

534
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:14,504
What is it doing?

535
00:50:14,587 --> 00:50:17,006
The bird is calling to her babies.

536
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:19,591
Her babies.

537
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,511
Kevin's a girl?

538
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,641
Her house is over there
in those twisty rocks.

539
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:32,312
She has been gathering food for
her babies and must get back to them.

540
00:50:33,562 --> 00:50:35,231
Wait. Kevin's just leaving?

541
00:50:37,816 --> 00:50:40,318
But you promised to protect her.

542
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:43,696
Her babies need her.
We gotta make sure they're together!

543
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,825
Sorry, Russell.
We've lost enough time already.

544
00:50:48,283 --> 00:50:49,409
Yeah.

545
00:50:57,084 --> 00:50:59,795
This was her favorite chocolate.

546
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,466
Because you sent her away,
there's more for you.

547
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:07,177
Huh?

548
00:51:07,261 --> 00:51:08,428
Kevin?

549
00:51:27,112 --> 00:51:30,031
Where's the bird?
You said you had the bird.

550
00:51:30,114 --> 00:51:31,323
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

551
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:34,451
Since I have said that,
I can see how you would think that.

552
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:37,621
Where is it?
Uh... Tomorrow.

553
00:51:37,705 --> 00:51:41,584
Come back tomorrow, and then
I will again have the bird. Yes.

554
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:46,504
You lost it!
Why do I not have a surprised feeling?

555
00:51:47,046 --> 00:51:50,300
Well, at least you now have led us
to the small mailman

556
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:52,886
and the one who smells of prunes.

557
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:57,056
Master will be most pleased
we have found them

558
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:00,059
and will ask of them many questions.
Come!

559
00:52:00,143 --> 00:52:03,688
Wait. We're not going with you!
We're going to the falls!

560
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:07,317
Get away from me!

561
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:12,446
Get down!

562
00:53:06,788 --> 00:53:07,872
Stay!

563
00:53:16,088 --> 00:53:18,674
You came here in that?

564
00:53:19,174 --> 00:53:20,425
Uh, yeah.

565
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:25,012
In a house? A floating house?

566
00:53:33,521 --> 00:53:36,357
That is the darnedest thing
I've ever seen.

567
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,484
You're not after my bird, are you?

568
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:42,445
But if you needed to borrow
a cup of sugar,

569
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:44,781
I'd be happy to oblige.

570
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,745
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.

571
00:53:51,204 --> 00:53:53,039
My dogs made a mistake.

572
00:53:53,623 --> 00:53:56,042
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

573
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,752
Yeah, well, yes.

574
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:00,963
THE Charles Muntz?

575
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,257
"Adventure is out there!"

576
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,885
It's really him! That's Charles Muntz!

577
00:54:07,176 --> 00:54:10,555
- It is? Who's Charles Muntz?
- Him!

578
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,473
Yes! Yes! That's him!
- I'm Carl Fredricksen.

579
00:54:12,557 --> 00:54:15,393
My wife and I,
we were your biggest fans.

580
00:54:15,476 --> 00:54:17,228
Oh, well. You're a man of good taste.

581
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:21,732
Now, you must be tired. Hungry?

582
00:54:21,815 --> 00:54:22,858
Uh-huh.

583
00:54:23,066 --> 00:54:24,401
Now, attention, everyone!

584
00:54:24,484 --> 00:54:28,322
These people are no longer intruders!
They are our guests.

585
00:54:30,532 --> 00:54:32,909
Follow me.
I like you temporarily.

586
00:54:32,992 --> 00:54:34,702
You do smell like prunes.

587
00:54:34,785 --> 00:54:35,828
Whoa!

588
00:54:37,455 --> 00:54:38,581
I will not bite you.

589
00:54:38,664 --> 00:54:41,125
The small mailman
smells like chocolate.

590
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:44,545
I'm sorry about the dogs.

591
00:54:44,627 --> 00:54:47,630
- Hope they weren't too rough on you.
We weren't.

592
00:54:47,714 --> 00:54:51,176
Go ahead and moor
your airship right next to mine.

593
00:54:56,806 --> 00:55:00,393
We're not actually going inside
the Spirit of Adventure itself?

594
00:55:00,476 --> 00:55:01,518
Oh...

595
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:03,354
Would you like to?

596
00:55:03,437 --> 00:55:04,688
Would I?

597
00:55:06,815 --> 00:55:08,692
Wait up, Mr. Muntz.

598
00:55:09,526 --> 00:55:11,070
Jiminy Cricket.

599
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:13,447
Not you.
What do we do with Dug?

600
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:17,284
He has lost the bird.
Put him in the Cone of Shame.

601
00:55:22,246 --> 00:55:24,582
I do not like the Cone of Shame.

602
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:30,213
Well, most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums,

603
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:34,049
New York, Munich, London.
Of course, I kept the best for myself.

604
00:55:34,423 --> 00:55:37,259
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

605
00:55:37,343 --> 00:55:39,845
Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium.

606
00:55:39,929 --> 00:55:42,640
Beast charged
while I was brushing my teeth.

607
00:55:42,723 --> 00:55:45,476
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.

608
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:47,269
Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me.

609
00:55:47,353 --> 00:55:49,772
Only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time

610
00:55:49,855 --> 00:55:52,817
was to have it declared
as dental equipment.

611
00:55:53,234 --> 00:55:56,612
Oh, my gosh!
The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!

612
00:55:56,695 --> 00:55:59,573
Oh, you recognize it. I'm impressed.

613
00:55:59,906 --> 00:56:01,950
That's an interesting story there.

614
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:04,077
Excellent choice.

615
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,956
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.

616
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:11,918
He and I fell into a habit
of playing gin rummy in the evenings,

617
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,836
and did he cheat!

618
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:16,171
Oh, he was horrible.

619
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:19,425
Master, dinner is ready.

620
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:21,885
Oh, dear. Broken translator.

621
00:56:21,969 --> 00:56:26,557
It's that loose wire again.
There you go, big fella.

622
00:56:26,638 --> 00:56:28,014
Thank you, Master.

623
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:30,308
I liked his other voice.

624
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:34,813
Well, dinner is served. Right this way.

625
00:56:35,939 --> 00:56:39,109
So, how are things stateside, huh?

626
00:56:39,192 --> 00:56:41,611
Almost tempted to go back a few times,

627
00:56:42,654 --> 00:56:45,282
but I have unfinished work here.

628
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:48,368
Please. I hope you're hungry,

629
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:52,747
because Epsilon is the finest chef
I've ever had.

630
00:56:57,543 --> 00:57:00,546
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

631
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:01,672
Yes!

632
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:05,217
Hey! Hey!

633
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:08,679
Oh, my Ellie would've loved all this.

634
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:11,222
You know, it's because of you
she had this dream

635
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:13,975
to come down here
and live by Paradise Falls.

636
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:16,602
I'm honored. And now you've made it.

637
00:57:16,685 --> 00:57:19,146
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

638
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:23,275
No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests,
a real treat.

639
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,775
Treat! Where's the treat!
Treat!

640
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,904
No, no. Quiet!
Calm down, calm down.

641
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:29,405
I want a treat! I want a treat!
- Hey!

642
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,073
I shouldn't have used that word.

643
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,910
Having guests is a delight.

644
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:37,872
More often I get thieves
come to steal what's rightfully mine.

645
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:38,998
No!

646
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:44,003
They called me a fraud, those...

647
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:50,510
But once I bring back this creature,
my name will be cleared.

648
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,386
Beautiful, isn't it?

649
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:58,725
I've spent a lifetime tracking it.

650
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:04,523
Sometimes years go by
between sightings.

651
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:10,068
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives.

652
00:58:10,902 --> 00:58:12,570
You can't go in after it.

653
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:15,281
Once in, there's no way out.

654
00:58:15,907 --> 00:58:17,867
I've lost so many dogs.

655
00:58:20,536 --> 00:58:25,040
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to take.

656
00:58:25,707 --> 00:58:30,754
But they soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.

657
00:58:33,507 --> 00:58:35,592
Hey, that looks like Kevin.

658
00:58:37,636 --> 00:58:40,472
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.

659
00:58:40,556 --> 00:58:42,641
I trained it to follow us.

660
00:58:42,724 --> 00:58:45,936
Follow you? It's impossible. How?

661
00:58:46,395 --> 00:58:48,855
- She likes chocolate.
- Chocolate?

662
00:58:49,272 --> 00:58:52,858
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

663
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:55,860
But it ran off. It's gone now.

664
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:07,288
You know, Carl, these people
who pass through here,

665
00:59:07,371 --> 00:59:09,957
they all tell pretty good stories.

666
00:59:12,668 --> 00:59:14,920
A surveyor making a map.

667
00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:19,048
A botanist cataloguing plants.

668
00:59:22,135 --> 00:59:27,807
An old man taking his house
to Paradise Falls.

669
00:59:34,355 --> 00:59:38,484
I mean, that's the best one yet.
I can't wait to hear how it ends.

670
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:51,746
Well, it's been a wonderful evening,
but we better be going.

671
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:53,164
Oh, you're not leaving.

672
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:56,876
We don't want to take advantage
of your hospitality.

673
00:59:56,959 --> 01:00:00,171
- Come on, Russell.
- But we haven't even had dessert yet.

674
01:00:00,253 --> 01:00:03,173
The boy's right.
You haven't had dessert.

675
01:00:03,506 --> 01:00:07,886
Epsilon here makes
a delicious cherries jubilee.

676
01:00:09,095 --> 01:00:12,182
Oh, you really must stay. I insist.

677
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:15,185
We have so much more to talk about.

678
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:20,689
Kevin?

679
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:29,782
It's here.

680
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:32,992
Get them!

681
01:00:35,745 --> 01:00:38,164
- Hurry!
I am hurrying!

682
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:40,541
Ahhh! They're coming!

683
01:00:42,668 --> 01:00:45,253
Master, over here.

684
01:01:00,726 --> 01:01:03,062
Go toward the light, Master!

685
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:33,298
Russell!

686
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:39,221
Get back!

687
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:45,768
Go on, Master!
I will stop the dogs!

688
01:01:46,978 --> 01:01:48,604
Stop, you dogs.

689
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:00,949
<i>Whoa!</i>

690
01:02:16,963 --> 01:02:18,089
Help!

691
01:02:18,631 --> 01:02:19,924
Help!

692
01:02:20,383 --> 01:02:21,593
Help!

693
01:02:23,136 --> 01:02:26,181
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

694
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:28,141
Give me your hand!

695
01:02:39,485 --> 01:02:41,195
Hang on to Kevin!

696
01:03:12,765 --> 01:03:14,141
Kevin.

697
01:03:37,872 --> 01:03:41,793
Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.

698
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:47,090
She's hurt real bad.
Can't we help her get home?

699
01:03:58,057 --> 01:04:00,643
All right, but we gotta hurry.

700
01:04:07,274 --> 01:04:08,775
You lost them?

701
01:04:08,859 --> 01:04:10,026
No, it was Dug.

702
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:13,446
Yeah. He's with them.
He helped them escape!

703
01:04:14,781 --> 01:04:15,866
Wait.

704
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:18,785
Wait a minute. Dug.

705
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:26,501
See anything?

706
01:04:26,585 --> 01:04:30,046
No. My pack is not following us.
Boy, they are dumb.

707
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:31,589
This is crazy.

708
01:04:31,672 --> 01:04:35,259
I finally meet my childhood hero,
and he's trying to kill us. What a joke!

709
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:36,719
Hey, I know a joke.

710
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:38,720
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says,

711
01:04:38,845 --> 01:04:42,015
"I forgot to store acorns for winter
and now I am dead."

712
01:04:42,098 --> 01:04:45,435
Hal! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.

713
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:50,772
Careful, Russell.

714
01:04:50,856 --> 01:04:52,441
You okay, Kevin?

715
01:04:57,528 --> 01:04:59,780
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?

716
01:04:59,864 --> 01:05:02,742
The wilderness isn't quite
what I expected.

717
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:04,452
Yeah? How so?

718
01:05:04,785 --> 01:05:07,038
It's kind of wild.

719
01:05:07,455 --> 01:05:10,791
I mean, it's not how they made it sound
in my book.

720
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,793
Get used to that, kid.

721
01:05:12,877 --> 01:05:15,296
My dad made it sound so easy.

722
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,465
He's really good at camping

723
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:20,635
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff.

724
01:05:20,718 --> 01:05:23,429
He used to come to all
my Sweat Lodge meetings.

725
01:05:24,096 --> 01:05:27,391
And afterwards,
we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.

726
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,643
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickie.

727
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:33,729
Then we sit on this one curb
right outside,

728
01:05:33,771 --> 01:05:37,608
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones,

729
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:41,278
and whoever gets the most wins.

730
01:05:43,988 --> 01:05:45,782
I like that curb.

731
01:05:48,993 --> 01:05:50,787
That might sound boring,

732
01:05:51,454 --> 01:05:55,333
but I think the boring stuff
is the stuff I remember the most.

733
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,675
Look! There it is!

734
01:06:05,425 --> 01:06:08,845
Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell. Stand still.

735
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:23,025
Look at that bird go.
Wait up, you overgrown chicken.

736
01:06:24,317 --> 01:06:27,779
That's it. Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

737
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:34,160
Run, Kevin! Run!

738
01:06:36,996 --> 01:06:38,330
Oh, no!

739
01:06:43,544 --> 01:06:45,796
Russell, give me your knife!

740
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:49,800
Get away from my bird!

741
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:17,200
No!

742
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,166
No!

743
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,383
Careful. We'll want her
in good shape for my return.

744
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:39,095
Let her go! Stop!

745
01:07:42,932 --> 01:07:44,851
Kevin!

746
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:00,364
You gave away Kevin.

747
01:08:03,201 --> 01:08:06,037
You just gave her away.

748
01:08:07,872 --> 01:08:13,461
This is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of this!

749
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,883
Master, it's alright.

750
01:08:19,716 --> 01:08:21,593
I am not your master!

751
01:08:22,302 --> 01:08:25,430
And if you hadn't have shown up,
none of this would've happened!

752
01:08:25,555 --> 01:08:27,808
Bad dog! Bad dog!

753
01:08:36,148 --> 01:08:38,234
Now, whether you assist me or not,

754
01:08:38,734 --> 01:08:42,321
I am going to Paradise Falls
if it kills me.

755
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:58,308
Here. I don't want this anymore.

756
01:13:38,929 --> 01:13:40,097
Russell?

757
01:13:45,101 --> 01:13:46,143
Russell!

758
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:49,772
I'm gonna help Kevin, even if you won't!

759
01:13:51,107 --> 01:13:53,109
<i>No, Russell! No!</i>

760
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,885
Huh?

761
01:15:05,926 --> 01:15:07,094
Russell?

762
01:15:09,262 --> 01:15:10,388
Dug!

763
01:15:10,597 --> 01:15:15,268
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

764
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,771
Can you stay?
Well, you're my dog, aren't you?

765
01:15:17,812 --> 01:15:19,147
And I'm your master.

766
01:15:19,272 --> 01:15:20,774
You're my master?

767
01:15:20,814 --> 01:15:22,149
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

768
01:15:22,274 --> 01:15:25,027
Good boy, Dug!
You're a good boy!

769
01:15:50,842 --> 01:15:51,968
Yes!

770
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,806
Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save...

771
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:09,820
And they wouldn't believe me.
Just wait till they get a look at you.

772
01:16:09,859 --> 01:16:11,110
Master?

773
01:16:11,528 --> 01:16:14,656
- The small mailman has returned.
- What?

774
01:16:15,156 --> 01:16:16,658
Let me go.

775
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,620
Where's your elderly friend?

776
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:24,540
He's not my friend anymore.

777
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,502
Well, if you're here,
Fredricksen can't be far behind.

778
01:16:29,503 --> 01:16:31,672
Where are you
keeping Kevin?

779
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,049
Let me go!

780
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:36,343
Scream all you want,
small mailman.

781
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:38,846
None of your mailman friends
can hear you.

782
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:43,016
I'll unleash
all my Wilderness Explorer training!

783
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:48,522
Alpha,
Fredricksen's coming back.

784
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:52,233
Guard that bird. If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

785
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,695
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not finished with you!

786
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,655
Nice talking with you.

787
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:01,908
Ahhh!

788
01:17:02,533 --> 01:17:04,702
Where are you, Fredricksen?

789
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:24,554
Russell!

790
01:17:37,108 --> 01:17:39,736
- Mr. Fredricksen!
- Dug, bring her over!

791
01:17:41,613 --> 01:17:44,115
You came back for Kevin!
Let's go get her!

792
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,409
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.

793
01:17:46,533 --> 01:17:47,743
But I wanna help.

794
01:17:47,783 --> 01:17:49,076
I don't want your help.

795
01:17:49,201 --> 01:17:50,912
I want you safe.

796
01:17:58,085 --> 01:18:00,421
How do we get past these dogs?

797
01:18:00,795 --> 01:18:02,130
Point!

798
01:18:12,599 --> 01:18:13,767
Kevin.

799
01:18:14,975 --> 01:18:17,436
Don't worry, Kevin. We're on our way.

800
01:18:17,937 --> 01:18:21,065
Allow no one to be entering
through these doors.

801
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:24,151
Guard well that bird, my minions.

802
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:26,487
What do we do now, Dug?

803
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:41,626
Who wants the ball?

804
01:18:42,834 --> 01:18:44,628
Me! I want it!
Me! I do!

805
01:18:44,962 --> 01:18:46,338
I want the ball!
Give it to me!

806
01:18:46,463 --> 01:18:47,756
Then go get it!

807
01:18:47,798 --> 01:18:50,175
I'm gonna get there first!

808
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,677
Getting the ball!

809
01:18:51,802 --> 01:18:53,261
I got it!

810
01:18:53,637 --> 01:18:54,638
Uh-oh.

811
01:18:58,474 --> 01:19:01,435
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Let's get you out of here.

812
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:03,479
Master! He's gone!
The old man!

813
01:19:03,604 --> 01:19:04,647
He's here!

814
01:19:04,689 --> 01:19:06,816
He's got the bird!
The bird's gone...

815
01:19:06,941 --> 01:19:08,943
Calm down! One at a time!

816
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:15,198
I...want...to...help!

817
01:19:15,323 --> 01:19:16,324
Ha-ha!

818
01:19:25,834 --> 01:19:27,335
He's in Hall D!
He's in Hall C!

819
01:19:27,376 --> 01:19:28,836
It's the old man!

820
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:32,297
Does anyone know where they are?

821
01:19:47,812 --> 01:19:50,064
Gray Leader? Take down the house.

822
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:58,113
Gray Leader, checking in.

823
01:19:58,196 --> 01:19:59,197
Gray Two, checking in.

824
01:19:59,322 --> 01:20:00,490
Gray Three, checking in.

825
01:20:04,995 --> 01:20:06,329
Target sighted.

826
01:20:14,795 --> 01:20:16,338
Come on, Kevin.

827
01:20:23,636 --> 01:20:24,679
Auuggghh!

828
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:32,562
Hi.

829
01:20:58,836 --> 01:21:02,173
Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on!
Spit it out!

830
01:21:05,925 --> 01:21:08,177
- Come on.
- Enough!

831
01:21:08,511 --> 01:21:13,224
I am taking that bird back with me.
Alive or dead!

832
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:41,209
Come on, Kevin.

833
01:22:00,433 --> 01:22:03,395
I will have many enjoyments
from what I am about to do, Dug.

834
01:22:11,778 --> 01:22:13,280
He wears the Cone of Shame!

835
01:22:13,822 --> 01:22:17,242
What?
Do not just continue sitting. Attack!

836
01:22:20,328 --> 01:22:23,623
No, no! Stop your laughing!
Get this off of me!

837
01:22:23,665 --> 01:22:25,584
Listen, you dog. Sit!

838
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:28,420
Yes, Alpha.

839
01:22:28,503 --> 01:22:31,131
Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is...

840
01:22:31,505 --> 01:22:32,548
Oh!

841
01:22:34,175 --> 01:22:35,885
I can't do it.

842
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:39,471
Russell!
- Huh?

843
01:22:39,638 --> 01:22:43,058
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

844
01:22:43,975 --> 01:22:46,477
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

845
01:23:03,201 --> 01:23:05,077
Hey, squirrel!

846
01:23:05,161 --> 01:23:07,163
Squirrel? Where?
Where? Where?

847
01:23:07,246 --> 01:23:08,581
Where's the squirrel?

848
01:23:12,418 --> 01:23:14,086
I hate squirrels.

849
01:23:34,772 --> 01:23:35,856
Dug!

850
01:23:36,357 --> 01:23:37,566
Master!

851
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:41,946
<i>Russell! Over here! Let's go!</i>

852
01:23:46,783 --> 01:23:48,618
Mr. Fredricksen!

853
01:23:49,202 --> 01:23:50,828
Go on, Kevin!

854
01:24:05,759 --> 01:24:06,885
No!

855
01:24:21,733 --> 01:24:24,069
<i>Russell! Get out of there!</i>

856
01:24:26,069 --> 01:24:28,196
No! Leave them alone!

857
01:24:43,502 --> 01:24:47,673
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go of her!

858
01:24:49,758 --> 01:24:51,844
Kevin! Chocolate!

859
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:15,991
That was cool!

860
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:22,414
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Easy, Russell.

861
01:25:24,707 --> 01:25:27,209
Oh, I am ready to not be up high.

862
01:25:50,564 --> 01:25:53,233
Sorry about your house,
Mr. Fredricksen.

863
01:25:55,861 --> 01:25:58,655
You know, it's just a house.

864
01:26:06,704 --> 01:26:08,873
Look at you. You're so soft.

865
01:26:11,459 --> 01:26:13,044
Aw!

866
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:14,921
I wish I could keep one.

867
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:21,343
Where's my cane? I just had it here.

868
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,938
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

869
01:26:33,813 --> 01:26:35,356
Bye, Kevin!

870
01:26:44,781 --> 01:26:46,074
Ready?

871
01:26:46,449 --> 01:26:47,784
Ready.

872
01:26:58,544 --> 01:27:00,295
And by receiving
their badges,

873
01:27:00,379 --> 01:27:05,050
the following Explorers will graduate
to Senior Explorers.

874
01:27:05,426 --> 01:27:09,263
For Extreme Mountaineering Lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.

875
01:27:09,513 --> 01:27:13,976
For Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.

876
01:27:14,475 --> 01:27:16,644
For Assisting the Elderly...

877
01:27:17,478 --> 01:27:20,648
Uh, Russell, is there someone that...

878
01:27:23,401 --> 01:27:26,487
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

879
01:27:29,322 --> 01:27:30,824
I'm here for him.

880
01:27:31,032 --> 01:27:33,285
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

881
01:27:36,455 --> 01:27:39,541
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly

882
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,212
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

883
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:49,466
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

884
01:27:51,843 --> 01:27:53,595
The Ellie badge.

885
01:27:56,598 --> 01:27:57,682
Wow.

886
01:28:02,395 --> 01:28:04,898
All right,
! think that covers everybody.

887
01:28:04,981 --> 01:28:07,025
So let's give a big Explorer call

888
01:28:07,317 --> 01:28:10,820
to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers.

889
01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:12,196
Ready, everybody?

890
01:28:12,279 --> 01:28:13,822
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

891
01:28:20,871 --> 01:28:22,581
- Blue one.
- Red one.

892
01:28:23,248 --> 01:28:25,042
- Blue one.
Gray one.

893
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,002
- Red one.
That's a bike.

894
01:28:28,419 --> 01:28:30,087
It's red, isn't it?

895
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:32,047
Mr. Fredricksen,
you're cheating.

896
01:28:32,255 --> 01:28:34,049
No, I'm not. Red one.

897
01:28:34,132 --> 01:28:35,926
That's a fire hydrant.

898
01:28:38,053 --> 01:28:40,096
Maybe I need new glasses.

899
01:28:40,429 --> 01:28:42,056
Another blue one.

900
01:34:02,687 --> 01:34:06,899
<i>Adventure is out there
It's heading our way</i>

901
01:34:07,065 --> 01:34:11,069
So grab your scarf and goggles
Let's fly

902
01:34:11,444 --> 01:34:15,740
I've mapped out our journey
We're up here to stay

903
01:34:15,824 --> 01:34:20,078
<i>A sunset is our home
A moonbeam we will own</i>

904
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:23,955
<i>My spirit of adventure is you</i>

905
01:34:24,497 --> 01:34:28,668
<i>Freaks of nature span a globe
That's too big to deny</i>

906
01:34:28,751 --> 01:34:33,089
<i>With canine guards we'll travel there
and spit into their eye</i>

907
01:34:33,589 --> 01:34:37,802
Bang, bang
Once the smoke has cleared

908
01:34:37,885 --> 01:34:41,806
<i>After all the crowds have cheered</i>

909
01:34:41,889 --> 01:34:46,394
<i>We'll make it a joint venture
Before we're in our dentures</i>

910
01:34:46,477 --> 01:34:50,106
<i>My spirit of adventure is you</i>

911
01:35:08,163 --> 01:35:12,459
<i>Adventure is out there
Let's crack some champagne</i>

912
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:16,796
I've hung a hundred heads
on my wall

913
01:35:16,879 --> 01:35:21,300
<i>To say that I'm travelled
is far too mundane</i>

914
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:25,679
Let's grab our aero-fare
The high-brows will be there

915
01:35:25,763 --> 01:35:30,017
<i>The spirit of adventure
is something to indenture</i>

916
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:34,480
<i>My spirit of adventure is you</i>
