Not even a thing.
I just have one question.

175
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,590
When MJ told you
Peter was Spider-Man...

176
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,424
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Heh.
- What's up?

177
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,927
I-I knew way before MJ did.

178
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,504
I was Spider-Man's
"guy in the chair."

179
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,729
I know about those.

180
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,531
Dude, half my guys
are guys in the chair.

181
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:11,933
Exactly. You would know.

182
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,302
I literally helped him
find the Vulture.

183
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,704
- I didn't know that.
- I helped him hack a suit once

184
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,239
and helped him get to space.

185
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,741
So in Spider-Man's
illegal vigilantism,

186
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,877
you were his main accomplice.

187

00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:37,932
The Runes of Kof-Kol.

473

The Runes of Kof-Kol?

474
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,702
It's just a standard
spell of forgetting.

475

- Seriously?
- No, not seriously.

and unknown reality.

480

So, what is this place?

490
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:36,290
The Sanctum's built
at the intersection

491
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,059
of cosmic energy currents.

492

We weren't the first
to seek them out.

493

Some of these walls
are thousands of years old.

And they shot an episode of
<i>The Equalizer</i> here in the '80s.

Wait, excuse me?

504
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,463
The entire world's
about to forget

505

Uh, can't some people

508

That's not how the spell works.

509

And it's very difficult
and dangerous

to change it mid-casting.

Was she your girlfriend
because you were Spider-Man?

- I don't know. I really hope not.
- All right, fine.

He's my best friend

that Ned knows.

it was really messy.

PETER 2: Uh,
this might seem kind of weird,

1576
01:28:04,886 --> 01:28:06,721
but I've been trying
to find your friend

1577
01:28:06,854 --> 01:28:08,890
ever since I got here.

1578
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:11,125
I just have this sense that...

1579
01:28:12,894 --> 01:28:14,128
That he needs my help.

1580
01:28:14,262 --> 01:28:15,797
Our help.

1581
01:28:17,231 --> 01:28:18,266
He does.

1582
01:28:18,398 --> 01:28:20,067
We don't know where he is.

1583
01:28:20,201 --> 01:28:25,606
And, um, honestly, right now
we're all he really has left.

1584
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:30,745
Well, uh, is there some place
that he might go

1585
01:28:30,878 --> 01:28:33,281
that has meaning to him?

1586
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:37,952
Like a place
where he would go to just...?

1587
01:28:38,085 --> 01:28:40,021
Get away from everything?

1588
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:45,893
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1589
01:28:46,027 --> 01:28:47,895
Empire State.

Yes.

1592
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:58,706
Yeah. I... I think I know
exactly where that would be.

[SNIFFLES, THEN CRYING]

I'm sorry.

1595

Peter, there's...

1596
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:47,521
There's some people here.

- Um...

Hey, wait, wait! Whoa!

Sorry...

PETER 3: Yeah. Sorry.

1603
01:30:16,684 --> 01:30:18,686
I got some understanding
of what it is you're...

1604
01:30:18,819 --> 01:30:22,056
No, please don't tell me that
you know what I'm going through.

1605
01:30:22,189 --> 01:30:24,491
- Okay.
- She's gone.

1606
01:30:26,994 --> 01:30:28,396
And it's all my fault.

1607
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:34,201
She died for nothing.

1608
01:30:37,772 --> 01:30:40,241
So I'm gonna do what I should
have done in the first place.

1609
01:30:40,374 --> 01:30:42,009
- PETER 2: Peter...
- Please don't.

1610
01:30:43,044 --> 01:30:44,145
You don't belong here.

1611
01:30:44,278 --> 01:30:45,278
Either of you.

1612
01:30:45,346 --> 01:30:47,748
So I'm sending you home.

1613
01:30:47,882 --> 01:30:50,851
Those other guys
are from your worlds, right?

1614
01:30:50,985 --> 01:30:52,420
So you deal with it.

1615
01:30:52,553 --> 01:30:55,189
If they die, if you kill them...

1616
01:30:55,323 --> 01:30:56,357
that's on you.

1617
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,193
It's not my problem.

1618
01:30:59,327 --> 01:31:00,761
I don't care anymore.

1619

I'm done.

1620

I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

1621

Good luck.

PETER 2:
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1624
01:31:27,989 --> 01:31:29,357
It was my fault.

1625
01:31:30,591 --> 01:31:32,026
I lost...

1626
01:31:34,695 --> 01:31:36,731
I lost Gwen, my, um...

1627
01:31:38,032 --> 01:31:39,800
She was my MJ.

1628
01:31:41,902 --> 01:31:43,437
I couldn't save her.

1629
01:31:45,072 --> 01:31:47,808
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1630
01:31:50,244 --> 01:31:52,580
But I carried on,
tried to, um...

1631
01:31:52,713 --> 01:31:55,916

tried to keep being the, uh...

'cause I know that's what
she would've wanted.

1634
01:32:02,323 --> 01:32:05,993
But at some point, I just...
I stopped pulling my punches.

1635
01:32:09,597 --> 01:32:11,098
I got rageful.

1636
01:32:13,234 --> 01:32:14,602
I got bitter.

1637
01:32:15,936 --> 01:32:17,471
I just don't want you

1638
01:32:17,605 --> 01:32:20,307
to end up like... Like me.

PETER 2: The night Ben died...

1640
01:32:24,845 --> 01:32:27,548
I hunted down the man
who I thought did it.

1641
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,118
I wanted him dead.

1642
01:32:33,587 --> 01:32:35,122
I got what I wanted.

1643
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:39,528
It didn't make it better.

1644
01:32:43,064 --> 01:32:45,534
It took me a long time...

1645
01:32:47,301 --> 01:32:49,703
to learn to get through
that darkness.

1646
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:54,008
I wanna kill him.

1647
01:32:56,343 --> 01:32:58,312
I wanna tear him apart.

1648

Even after she was hurt,

1651
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:13,727
she said to me
that we did the right thing.

1652
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:24,205
She told me
that with great power...

Comes great responsibility.

Wait, what?
How do you know that?

1655

The day he died.

for nothing, Peter.

Okay, so, uh, Connors,
Marko, Dillon and, um...

01:34:00,741 --> 01:34:03,545
I think that I can repair the
devices for Dillon and Marko,

1660
01:34:03,677 --> 01:34:05,412

Oh, I got Connors. I've cured
him once, so no big deal.

2350
02:26:05,799 --> 02:26:09,069
STRANGE: <i>We tampered with
the stability of space-time.</i>

2351
02:26:09,203 --> 02:26:11,071
<i>The multiverse is a concept</i>

2352
02:26:11,205 --> 02:26:14,208
<i>about which we know
frighteningly little.</i>

2353
02:26:16,143 --> 02:26:18,078
MORDO:
<i>Your desecration of reality...</i>

2354
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:20,749
<i>will not go unpunished.</i>

2355
02:26:26,655 --> 02:26:28,255
STRANGE: <i>It was the only way.</i>

2356
02:26:33,193 --> 02:26:37,632
<i>But I never meant
for any of this to happen.</i>

2357
02:26:56,551 --> 02:26:57,585
STRANGE: Wanda.

2358
02:26:59,688 --> 02:27:02,222
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up.

2359
02:27:02,356 --> 02:27:06,060
I made mistakes,
and people were hurt.

2360
02:27:06,193 --> 02:27:08,563
I'm not here to talk
about West view.

2361
02:27:09,531 --> 02:27:10,765
Then what are you here for?

2362
02:27:10,898 --> 02:27:11,932
We need your help.

2363
02:27:13,367 --> 02:27:14,602
With what?

2364
02:27:14,736 --> 02:27:16,370
What do you know
about the multiverse?

2365
02:27:25,212 --> 02:27:26,413
I'm sorry, Stephen.

2366
02:27:28,882 --> 02:27:31,151
<i>I hope you understand...</i>

2367
02:27:33,788 --> 02:27:35,557
<i>the greatest threat...</i>

2368
02:27:36,758 --> 02:27:38,158
<i>to our universe...</i>

2369
02:27:46,634 --> 02:27:47,836
<i>is you.</i>

2370
02:27:50,672 --> 02:27:53,340
Things just got out of hand.
