1
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,285
BRANDT: <i>Benji?</i>

2
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,371
<i>Benji, do you copy?</i>

3
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,539
<i>Benji?</i>

4
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,876
- BENJI: Shit.
- BRANDT: <i>Where is Ethan?</i>

5
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:25,795
Uh, I can't talk right now.

6
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,714
BRANDT: <i>The package is on the plane.</i>

7
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,341
BENJI: Yeah, I know.

8
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,262
<i>We're currently formulating a plan B.
Although, technically, it's a plan C.</i>

9
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,055
This isn't going very well.

10
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,015
<i>I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.</i>

11
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,643
- Where's Ethan?
- I don't know. We're on radio silence.

12
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,354
That plane cannot take off
with the package on it.

13
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:44,981
- Do you understand?
- LUTHER: <i>We're working on it.</i>

14
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,733
Luther?
What the hell are you doing there?

15
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,527
<i>You're supposed to be
on assignment in Malaysia!</i>

16
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,237
I am in Malaysia.
I've been here two days.

17
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,239
- Benji needed my help.
- I didn't need help.

18
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,783
I needed assistance.
It's a different thing.

19
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,034
The package is still on the plane.

20
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,455
BENJI: <i>We understand the package
is on the plane.</i>

21
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,791
- We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that?

22
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,627
We can if the pilot left
the satellite uplink switched on.

23
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,878
Which he has.

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,382
- And how do you access the uplink?
- It involves hacking a Russian satellite.

25
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,302
- I can't authorize that.
- Which is why I didn't ask permission.

26
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,096
We're under investigation
for misconduct.

27
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,390
The package is on board.
What do you want me to do?

28
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,026
Uh, Luther.

29
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,028
BRANDT: I'm reading
a heat bloom, Benji.

30
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,280
- The engines are starting.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

31
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,241
<i>But I can't do anything
until I'm connected to the satellite.</i>

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,327
Benji, you're connected.

33
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,619
Okay, great.

34
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,497
The package is still on that plane.

35
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:45,583
LUTHER: <i>Shut down the fuel pump.</i>

36
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,461
BENJI: Uh, the mechanicals
are locked down.

37
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:51,005
- What about the electrical system?
- Oh, that might work.

38
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,340
Uh, no.

39
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,300
- Hydraulics!
- BENJI: <i>Okay, stand by.</i>

40
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,926
No, they're encrypted.

41
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,013
Benji, the plane!

42
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,349
Yes! The package is on the plane!
We get it!

43
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,269
Can you open the door?

44
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,605
Ethan? Where are you?

45
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:10,316
ETHAN: <i>I'm by the plane.
Benji, can you open the door?</i>

46
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,818
Uh, can I open the door? Uh, maybe.

47
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,987
Open the door when I tell you!

48
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,420
<i>I'm on the plane. Open the door.</i>

49
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,546
BENJI: <i>How did you get in the plane?</i>

50
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,299
ETHAN: <i>Not in the plane.
I'm on the plane!</i>

51
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,301
Open the door!

52
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,891
Benji! Open the door!

53
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay!

54
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,317
- Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I'm trying!

55
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,292
- Come on, Benji!
- Benji, open that door!

56
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:12,670
BENJI: Come on! Come on!

57
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,052
Come on!

58
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,220
Yes, got it!

59
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,394
That's the wrong door!

60
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,187
Benji, not that door. The other door.

61
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,481
The other door, right!
Yes, the other door.

62
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,692
Okay, yes! Sorry, my bad, my bad!

63
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:41,949
Check it out.

64
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,369
All right, look, I'm gonna open
the para door! How's that?

65
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,484
Hey! Hey!

66
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,811
We're about to close.

67
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,396
ETHAN: I won't be long.

68
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,148
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

69
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,360
Something rare.

70
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,574
Let me guess.

71
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,577
Classical.

72
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,662
- Jazz.
- Sax?

73
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,081
- Coltrane.
- Piano?

74
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,165
Monk.

75
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,085
Shadow Wilson on bass.

76
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,337
Shadow Wilson played drums.

77
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,549
Know why they call him Shadow?

78
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,427
Because he had a light touch.

79
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,804
You're in luck.

80
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,516
I have a first pressing.

81
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,735
It really is you.

82
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,197
I've heard stories.

83
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,908
They can't all be true.

84
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,932
MAN: <i>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.</i>

85
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,811
<i>The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas</i>

86
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,730
<i>capable of devastating a major city.</i>

87
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,149
<i>The bodies of the air crew were found</i>

88
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,069
<i>less than 24 hours
after they landed in Damascus.</i>

89
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,322
<i>They were identified as
low-level Chechen separatists</i>

90
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,240
<i>with neither the access nor the ability</i>

91
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,451
<i>to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.</i>

92
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,037
<i>This would support your suspicion</i>

93
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,415
<i>that a shadow organization
is committed to inciting revolution</i>

94
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:22,086
<i>by enabling acts of terror
in nations friendly to Western interests.</i>

95
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,589
<i>IMF suspects this to be
the same shadow organization</i>

96
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,841
<i>you have been tracking for the last year,</i>

97
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,802
<i>also known as the Syndicate.</i>

98
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,346
<i>IMF would be right.</i>

99
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,807
<i>Normally, you and your team
would be tasked</i>

100
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,935
<i>with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network.</i>

101
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,605
<i>But we have taken steps to ensure
that this will not happen.</i>

102
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:44,274
<i>Because we are
the Syndicate, Mr. Hunt.</i>

103
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,610
<i>And now we know who you are.</i>

104
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:50,823
<i>Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to face your fate.</i>

105
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:55,202
<i>Pursue us, you will be caught.
Resist us, you will be killed.</i>

106
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:59,248
<i>And your precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.</i>

107
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,624
<i>Good luck, Mr. Hunt.</i>

108
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,377
<i>This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

109
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,431
DIRECTOR HUNLEY: <i>Mr. Chairman,
the IMF's misadventures date back</i>

110
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,349
to my earliest days at the CIA

111
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:03,937
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

112
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,106
And now, more recently,
a Russian warhead?

113
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,316
Disarmed Russian warhead.

114
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,860
- A Russian nuclear warhead...
- Rendered safe by the IMF.

115
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,695
DIRECTOR HUNLEY:
...clipped the Transamerica Pyramid

116
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,614
before plunging into
the San Francisco Bay.

117
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,700
- Saving the western hemisphere.
- This made possible by IMF agents

118
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:20,704
who did willingly provide
the launch codes to a known terrorist.

119
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,039
Do I have that right, Agent Brandt?

120
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,126
I can neither confirm nor deny details

121
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,295
of any such operation
without the Secretary's approval.

122
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,215
This was the same week that the IMF
infiltrated the Kremlin.

123
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,633
Here is the Kremlin before

124
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,303
and the Kremlin after.

125
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,934
I can neither confirm nor deny details
of any operation...

126
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,769
Without the Secretary's approval,
yes, we know.

127
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,146
In fact, until this panel appoints
a new Secretary,

128
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,732
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, Agent Brandt?

129
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,234
Well, I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.

130
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,070
DIRECTOR HUNLEY: Mr. Chairman,
the so-called Impossible Mission Force

131
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,280
is not just a rogue organization.

132
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:59,284
It is an outdated one, a throwback
to an era without transparency

133
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,911
- and without oversight.
- Mr. Chairman?

134
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,580
- Time has come to dissolve the IMF...
- BRANDT: Mr. Chairman?

135
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:07,000
...and transfer their salvageable assets
to the CIA.

136
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:10,087
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.

137
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,881
- Mr. Chairman?
- Are its methods unorthodox? Yes.

138
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,843
Are its results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

139
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,595
- But without the IMF...
- There will be order and stability!

140
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,013
Without the IMF...

141
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:26,937
This panel recognizes
the IMF's contribution to global security.

142
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:30,315
But the events laid out
by CIA Director Hunley

143
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,360
also show a pattern
of wanton brinksmanship

144
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,280
and a total disregard for protocol.

145
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,116
From where I sit,
your unorthodox methods

146
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,618
are indistinguishable from chance.

147
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,707
And your results, perfect or not,
look suspiciously like luck.

148
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,170
I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out.

149
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,064
What are you doing here?

150
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,732
Hmm?

151
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,196
I said, what are you doing here?

152
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,123
What does he see in you, I wonder?

153
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,583
Who is "he"?

154
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,007
I want to see what he's made of.

155
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,262
ETHAN: Well, why don't you
take off the cuffs and I'll show you,

156
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,431
Vinter?

157
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,186
You know who I am.

158
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,105
Janik Vinter.

159
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,942
They call you the Bone Doctor.

160
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,820
The funny thing is,

161
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,199
you were officially declared dead
three years ago.

162
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:27,909
Nice shoes, by the way.

163
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,621
Not his.

164
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,957
Yours.

165
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,716
Our instructions were to break him down...

166
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,968
...not kill him.

167
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,262
Some guys break different than others.

168
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,141
This one's a fighter.

169
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,727
He'll die before you turn him.

170
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,645
Are you worried
he's going to take your place?

171
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,036
You should go before it gets ugly.

172
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,417
Yeah, he's right. You should go.

173
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,392
So now let's see how tough you are.

174
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,146
Janik.

175
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,356
We've never met before, right?

176
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,776
Follow me.

177
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,286
Give me the gun!

178
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,001
- What are you doing?
- I can't leave.

179
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,170
You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

180
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,797
We didn't kill them, you did.

181
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,300
I tried to stop you. You got away.

182
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,803
Who are you?

183
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,806
You better hurry now. Good luck.

184
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:37,974
No, wait! Wait!

185
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,227
Where is he?

186
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,812
He's heading towards the north passage.
He's closed the gate.

187
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,649
Run. He's getting away. Hurry.

188
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,413
- Satcom seven.
- ETHAN: <i>Western Europe unsecured.</i>

189
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,832
- Designator?
- <i>Bravo-Echo-1-1.</i>

190
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:03,875
Connecting.

191
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,836
- This is Brandt.
- ETHAN: <i>Go secure.</i>

192
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,798
Go.

193
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,842
<i>London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.</i>

194
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,929
Agent in place is down.
Request immediate extraction.

195
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,639
What happened?
Who breached London?

196
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,516
<i>Do you have anything to go on?</i>

197
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,684
A face.

198
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:24,437
<i>He wanted something. Not information.
He could've killed me.</i>

199
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,064
But he didn't.

200
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,734
- Okay. What do you think it means?
- The Syndicate is real.

201
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,821
They know who we are, how we operate.

202
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,907
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

203
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:39,577
Just focus operations on gathering
any available intel regarding

204
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,079
former covert operatives.

205
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,248
It doesn't matter
what country or agency,

206
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,583
just as long as they're dead
or presumed dead.

207
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,044
Start with Janik Vinter.

208
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,213
<i>He's also known as the Bone Doctor.</i>

209
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,381
I can't do that.

210
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,758
What? What are you talking about?

211
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,678
The Committee has shut us down.

212
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,347
Operations have been handed over
to the CIA.

213
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,977
<i>There is no more IMF.
I've been ordered to bring everyone in.</i>

214
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,355
- <i>Ethan...</i>
- I understand.

215
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,274
- <i>Ethan...</i>
- I understand, Brandt.

216
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,067
We didn't have this conversation.

217
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,446
I've disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

218
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,489
<i>If I'm dead or alive.</i>

219
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,116
This man you saw, can you find him?

220
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,245
I won't stop until I do.

221
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,999
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

222
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,917
Make it count.

223
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,419
Brandt?

224
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,690
DIRECTOR HUNLEY: <i>Since we're going
to be working together,</i>

225
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,609
<i>I want you to choose
your next words very carefully.</i>

226
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,152
Where is Hunt?

227
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,237
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt.

228
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,782
I have no way of contacting him.
He's deep cover.

229
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,700
Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

230
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:05,288
Let's cut the bull. You know who we are,
you know what we're capable of.

231
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,082
How come the CIA has never discovered

232
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,793
any actionable intel
regarding this, uh, Syndicate?

233
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,837
- What are you implying?
- Not implying. Stating.

234
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,131
Leveling an accusation, actually.

235
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,385
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

236
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,304
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination,

237
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,224
created to justify the IMF's existence.

238
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,060
I am going to find him, Brandt,
and when I do,

239
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,853
he will be called upon to answer for

240
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,232
every wanton act of mayhem
he is responsible for.

241
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,486
Welcome to the CIA.

242
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,657
You'll never find him.

243
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,328
Set your watch, Brandt. Ethan Hunt
is living his last day as a free man.

244
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,846
All right, everybody, heads up! This is it.

245
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,765
MAN:
<i>Alpha team prepped, standing by.</i>

246
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:06,850
Execute.

247
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,936
Langley, Brimstone. Go.
I say again, we are go.

248
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,745
MAN: <i>Langley, there's nobody here.</i>

249
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,296
Langley, Brimstone. Face the north wall.

250
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,948
Dunn.

251
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,035
Is it that time already? Okay.

252
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:35,290
WOMAN: I will ask you
a series of control questions.

253
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,041
BENJI: I know,
and I'm gonna answer truthfully,

254
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,502
and then you're gonna ask me
to lie intentionally.

255
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,963
- State your name.
- The King of Norway.

256
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,007
See, that's a lie.

257
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:47,635
I'm actually third in line to the throne.
My brother was...

258
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,387
Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?

259
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,471
Why would he contact me?

260
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,639
DIRECTOR HUNLEY:
Hunt has resurfaced.

261
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,182
This time in Cuba.

262
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,352
He, uh, left these behind.

263
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,314
Tell me what you make of them.

264
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,858
I don't know. He's taken up
scrapbooking?

265
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,234
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

266
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,112
All of them are either missing or dead.
Every one.

267
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,197
All of them were government agents.

268
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,408
Russian, French, British, Israeli,
you name it.

269
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,704
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no trouble collecting them.

270
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,123
And he always seems to be
a step ahead of us.

271
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,625
I wonder how.

272
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,210
- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?
- Oh, the thought had crossed my mind.

273
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,671
BENJI: Six months I have been here,

274
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,884
sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

275
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,180
I have decrypted, processed, parsed
more data than anyone in my section.

276
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,098
And yet, every week you haul me in here

277
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,060
and you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

278
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,979
And today you haven't answered it.

279
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:45,568
You seem to think
I have some kind of obligation to him.

280
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,738
Okay. Nothing could be further
from the truth.

281
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,699
Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field,

282
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,619
and I am stuck here answering for it.

283
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,163
We are not friends.

284
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:00,667
I owe him nothing.

285
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,424
That'll be all, Dunn.

286
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,402
ETHAN:
<i>Welcome to Vienna, Benji. Miss me?</i>

287
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,029
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

288
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,990
You know what?
Please, don't tell me that.

289
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:17,034
Because it's just another thing I'll have
to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

290
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,162
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.
Just keep walking.</i>

291
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,330
<i>But make sure
you're not being followed.</i>

292
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,332
I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?

293
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,834
<i>No, I'm afraid not.</i>

294
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:26,252
- So, where do we meet?
- <i>We don't.</i>

295
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,087
<i>For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.</i>

296
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,256
<i>You have mail.</i>

297
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:32,967
- BENJI: Who is he?
- ETHAN: <i>That's what</i>

298
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,051
<i>we're here to find out.</i>

299
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:37,346
<i>What I do know is he's our
only possible link to the Syndicate.</i>

300
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,849
<i>And I have reason to believe
he's going to be here tonight.</i>

301
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,852
<i>But I can't find him alone. Are you in?</i>

302
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,604
- Uh...
- <i>Are you in?</i>

303
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,355
Yes, of course. Of course. Um...

304
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:47,982
So what's the play?

305
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,861
<i>Simple. You find him. We tag him.
I follow him wherever he goes.</i>

306
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,070
And after that?

307
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,614
<i>After that, you're on a plane.</i>

308
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:57,658
<i>Back at work Monday morning.
No one is the wiser.</i>

309
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,287
- Wait, that's it?
- <i>You're in enough danger as it is.</i>

310
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,915
<i>I didn't want to involve you this much,
but I had no choice.</i>

311
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,583
Well, if you're going to bring me
all this way,

312
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,753
you could at least give me something
a bit more, you know, dramatic.

313
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:11,631
<i>Benji, we're trying to keep a low profile.</i>

314
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,259
<i>You want drama, go to the opera.</i>

315
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,624
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- ETHAN: <i>Yes, I am.</i>

316
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,968
BENJI: <i>Am I correct in assuming
that is the Chancellor of Austria?</i>

317
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,469
ETHAN: Yes, you are.

318
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,304
BENJI: <i>Did you know
he was going to be here?</i>

319
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,389
No.

320
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,433
<i>Right. Well, we have
a European head of state here</i>

321
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:08,271
<i>at the same time as we are looking
for a nefarious terrorist.</i>

322
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,107
<i>And I'm sure that the two things
are completely unrelated.</i>

323
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,149
Benji.

324
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,818
<i>Meanwhile, I will try and overlook
the fact that</i>

325
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,612
<i>you're an international fugitive
wanted by the CIA!</i>

326
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,991
<i>And that this little unsanctioned
operation is tantamount to treason.</i>

327
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:23,786
<i>Because, as you stated earlier, I will be
back at my desk on Monday morning,</i>

328
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:26,455
playing videogames,
and no one will be any the wiser.

329
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,915
- <i>The show's about to start, Benji.</i>
- Right.

330
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,250
<i>Just take your position.</i>

331
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:30,668
- <i>Tell me what you see.</i>
- Okay.

332
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,169
<i>Nice tux, by the way.</i>

333
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,066
Lights ready, Act One preset.

334
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,578
Final preparations complete.

335
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,829
Everyone standby please.

336
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:44,241
Join the IMF! See the world!

337
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:47,244
On a monitor. In a closet.

338
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:30,997
Okay, I have eyes.

339
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,290
Searching.

340
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,729
Talk to me, Benji.

341
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,272
Nothing yet. Stand by.

342
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:43,694
I know you're here. Where are you?

343
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,828
Uh, Ethan, I might have
something for you. Can't confirm.

344
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,663
- Where?
- Backstage. I'll direct you.

345
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,090
<i>Take the door on your left.</i>

346
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:06,008
He should be right in front of you.

347
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,884
Benji, do you see that?

348
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,219
<i>See what?</i>

349
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,722
- That woman.
- What woman? Where are you?

350
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,224
I can't see you.

351
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:14,613
What was that?

352
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,115
I don't know.

353
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,878
Oh! Ah!

354
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,964
Ethan, do you copy? Ethan, come in!

355
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,774
Ethan, the lighting booth!

356
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:57,192
Ethan, do you copy?

357
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,073
It's just a fleshwound.

358
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:11,702
Seal the building. Close the exits.

359
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:16,873
I have a way out. Interested?

360
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,794
Lead the way.

361
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:32,014
- Anything you want to tell me?
- Uh, no, not right now.

362
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,850
- How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me.

363
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,818
What's next?

364
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,364
There.

365
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,082
Shoes.

366
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,251
Shoes, please.

367
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:31,740
Uh...

368
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,267
If anything were to happen to you -

369
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,144
Nothing's going to happen to me.

370
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,105
Stop the car.

371
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,240
Get in!

372
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,702
Go, go, go.

373
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,295
What the... She tried to shoot me!

374
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,506
That doesn't make her a bad person.

375
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,925
I'm going to have to search you.

376
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,594
- You have to let me go.
- Oh. Not a chance!

377
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,346
I assumed you were deep cover
back in London,

378
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,140
but isn't this taking
the role a little far?

379
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,725
Hang on a minute. Do you know her?

380
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,268
We haven't been formally introduced,

381
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,687
but I'm pretty sure
she's British intelligence?

382
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,106
Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.

383
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,693
And that shade is very hard to find.

384
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,320
What were you doing
at the opera tonight?

385
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:53,905
Aside from killing the Chancellor.

386
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:56,366
Saving your life in London
put me in a tight spot

387
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,410
with some very dangerous people.

388
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,454
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

389
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,539
Ah, so you admit that you killed him!

390
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,709
I went through the motions.
That's not the same thing.

391
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,502
You thought you'd put him
in the hospital,

392
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:08,962
take him out of harm's way.

393
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:10,088
Same thing you tried to do.

394
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,548
BENJI: You're not going to
believe that, are you?

395
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,008
What about the rest of her team?

396
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,968
You mean those other two idiots.

397
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,762
I can only assume
they were redundancies.

398
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:19,890
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

399
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,434
the other one to kill you.

400
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:25,729
- A test.
- Second one I've failed, thanks to you.

401
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,190
And the car bomb was insurance.

402
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:33,862
Uh, we have a tail.

403
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:37,657
ETHAN: Who is he?

404
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:40,327
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

405
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:43,163
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you have to let me out.

406
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:44,289
Uh, they're closing!

407
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,710
This has to look like an escape,
So you just throw me out anywhere.

408
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:50,253
Tell me who he is.

409
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:51,379
Whoa!

410
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,383
Change of plan! Throw her out!

411
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,721
You have everything you need
to find me.

412
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:17,280
DIRECTOR HUNLEY:
<i>Less than 24 hours</i>

413
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:19,282
<i>after we interviewed Benji Dunn
about Ethan Hunt,</i>

414
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:22,744
he was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

415
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:25,747
And within six hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

416
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:28,250
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defender,

417
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,253
but to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

418
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,338
Consider for the moment
the possibility that

419
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,841
Ethan's investigation
led him to the opera,

420
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,551
and that he's the one
with the actionable intelligence!

421
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:41,763
In any case, finding Hunt
is no longer a pet project.

422
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:45,433
The Special Activities Division
will now have full discretion.

423
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,686
You mean shoot to kill.

424
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:52,190
Whether Hunt lives or dies
is entirely up to him.

425
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,376
New identity.

426
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,921
Passport, cash, move map.

427
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,339
There's a change of clothes
in that bag right there.

428
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,008
Everything you need
to make it to D.C. undetected.

429
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,218
Once you're there,
you have to inform on me.

430
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,888
- I'm sorry, what?
- Just tell the truth.

431
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,807
You came to Vienna believing
you won two tickets to the opera.

432
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,477
I attempted to recruit you
into assassinating the Chancellor.

433
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,020
- You refused.
- That's not the truth!

434
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:14,439
Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji.

435
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,775
It'll go easier
if you tell them what they want to hear.

436
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:20,362
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

437
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,871
You recognize anyone?

438
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,260
Him.

439
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:46,388
He's former KSA. German intelligence.

440
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,056
Missing, presumed dead.

441
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:50,976
He was at the opera tonight.

442
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:52,435
This one, too.

443
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,270
Former Mossad.

444
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:55,981
Let me guess. Presumed dead.

445
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,774
Tonight, I made it official.

446
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,903
I was looking for him in the Bosphorus.

447
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:05,490
The same day, a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

448
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,576
He slipped away again in Jakarta,

449
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,455
hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

450
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:14,749
with 236 passengers.

451
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,919
I just missed him in the Philippines

452
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,213
right before a fire
at a petrochemical plant

453
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:22,215
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

454
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:27,137
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

455
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:31,891
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

456
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,604
That fire bankrupted
a global arms corporation.

457
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,275
That wreck triggered a civil war.

458
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:43,862
These are no accidents.

459
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,114
They're links in a chain.

460
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,451
The work of a single organization,
the Syndicate.

461
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,620
A rogue nation,
trained to do what we do,

462
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,456
imbued with a new sense of purpose.

463
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:58,460
Destroy the system that created them
regardless of who's in their way.

464
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:01,880
An anti-IMF.

465
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:06,176
Since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

466
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,803
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement,

467
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,472
the start of a new phase.

468
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:14,684
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

469
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:17,312
He was there.

470
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:19,981
Every time.

471
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:22,317
Just like he was there tonight,
I'm sure of it.

472
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:26,279
I don't know who he is, where he's from,

473
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,907
how he's funded.

474
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,825
But I know he's the key.

475
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:34,829
Ethan, this is what I signed up for.
Let me help you find him.

476
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:36,664
That's why I brought you here
in the first place,

477
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,333
and look what happened!

478
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,793
I can't protect you.

479
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:42,170
That's why I need you to leave.

480
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,798
That's not your decision to make, Ethan!

481
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,176
I am a field agent. I know the risks.

482
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:49,844
More than that, I am your friend,

483
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:51,888
no matter what I tell
the polygraph every week.

484
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:54,933
Now, you called me
because you needed my help.

485
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:57,310
And you still do. So I am staying.

486
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,522
And that is all
we are going to say about that.

487
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:05,735
Okay.

488
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,071
Good.

489
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,032
Where do we start?

490
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:14,410
Ilsa.

491
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,040
Right. And how do we find her?

492
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,584
She said we have everything we need.

493
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,585
We had an agreement.

494
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:07,130
You send me to do a job, I do it.
But my way, not yours.

495
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,548
Where did I deviate?

496
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,633
You put two more gunmen
at the opera tonight.

497
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:11,926
One of them tried to kill me.

498
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:13,469
You missed.

499
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:16,222
I missed because Ethan Hunt was there
looking for you.

500
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:19,642
Ethan Hunt's in Vienna because
you allowed him to escape in London.

501
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:22,937
Vinter would have killed him in London,
and that's not what you asked for.

502
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,274
Twice now you've let him slip away.

503
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,110
Curious.

504
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:32,363
Are you questioning my loyalty
or my ability?

505
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:37,702
- Can't decide.
- I've told you before, trust me or kill me.

506
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:39,996
But if you're going to kill me, be a man.

507
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,750
Do it yourself.

508
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,030
Did he say anything?

509
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,450
He knows about Morocco.

510
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,661
What does he know about Morocco?

511
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:24,165
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

512
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,001
Find him, please.

513
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,296
He'll find me.

514
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,174
I've seen to that.

515
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:39,722
That's interesting.

516
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,349
- What is it?
- It's a skiff.

517
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:44,227
A secure computer facility.
Offline, ultra-contained.

518
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:46,312
It's impossible to hack into
from the outside.

519
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,982
It's essentially
a digital safety deposit box.

520
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:52,360
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

521
00:51:52,694 --> 00:51:53,903
Where's it located?

522
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:55,113
Uh...

523
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,281
Morocco.

524
00:51:58,366 --> 00:51:59,617
Morocco.

525
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,071
And what brings you gentlemen
to Casablanca?

526
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:50,061
Good to see you.

527
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,480
What couldn't you tell me
over the phone?

528
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,984
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

529
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:59,779
We believe that
Ethan and Benji were there.

530
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:03,157
Hunley has handed this over
to the Special Activities Division.

531
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:06,619
We need to find Ethan before they do.

532
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:09,205
And that's where you come in.

533
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:12,750
Not interested.

534
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,671
- Okay, look, Luther...
- Look, man, I know Ethan.

535
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:18,214
I don't know you.

536
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:21,968
All I know about you
is that you chose to work for Hunley.

537
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,512
Yeah. All I know about you
is you chose to resign.

538
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:29,475
You don't have to worry
about Ethan. They'll never catch him.

539
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:31,310
No, they're not gonna catch him. No.

540
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:33,813
This is the CIA.
This is Hunley we're talking about.

541
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:36,941
Things are out of control.
No, they're going to kill him.

542
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,611
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

543
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:44,073
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

544
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:53,249
You need to understand something.

545
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:56,878
Ethan is my friend.

546
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,048
And if I have one second of doubt
whose side you're on...

547
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,301
Mmm?

548
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:06,179
I believe you.

549
00:55:07,889 --> 00:55:09,765
- All right.
- All right.

550
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:10,892
What do I have to go on?

551
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,479
Not much. And not a lot of time.

552
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,441
ILSA: <i>His name is Solomon Lane.</i>

553
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:20,943
He created the Syndicate.

554
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:22,778
Where does he come from?

555
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:25,865
He's former British intelligence.

556
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,702
Well, if British intelligence knows
the Syndicate exists,

557
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,871
why don't they just tell the CIA?

558
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:33,664
Because they don't want
anyone knowing

559
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:36,709
the Syndicate was created
by one of their own.

560
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:40,379
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust

561
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:43,674
and eventually identify the members
of his organization.

562
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:47,929
And for the first time in two years,
I'm close to knowing who they are.

563
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:50,264
Lane had a ledger.

564
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:54,435
It contained the identities of
his operatives, his terrorist associates,

565
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,271
the entire inner workings
of the Syndicate.

566
00:55:57,313 --> 00:56:00,399
One of his agents stole it,
hoping to blackmail him,

567
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:04,612
and kept it in a secure computer facility
for safekeeping.

568
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:07,365
He died being interrogated
for the access code,

569
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:09,158
leaving Lane with a serious problem.

570
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:13,913
So the key to crushing Lane

571
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:16,958
is sitting in a computer,
just waiting for someone to take it.

572
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:21,420
So, why hasn't Lane
just sent someone to steal it?

573
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:23,506
Oh, he has.

574
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,633
He sent me.

575
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:27,802
And I can tell you

576
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,805
it's impossible.

577
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:38,521
The facility's hidden beneath
a local power plant under military guard.

578
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,356
And the only way to download the ledger

579
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:43,317
is through the central
computer terminal, located there.

580
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,029
<i>To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gate,</i>

581
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,033
<i>access the elevator
with fingerprint recognition,</i>

582
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:55,329
<i>and open
three separate combination locks.</i>

583
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:03,170
BENJI: <i>Well, that's easy.
We just impersonate the agent</i>

584
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:06,007
who stole the ledger in the first place,
and I get to wear a mask!

585
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:31,699
ILSA: Unfortunately, even if you could
make it through

586
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,619
every other security measure,
you won't beat the last one.

587
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:37,288
<i>That's because it's protected
by gait analysis.</i>

588
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,540
<i>The step beyond facial recognition.</i>

589
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:42,209
<i>These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,</i>

590
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:43,878
<i>how he talks, how he moves.</i>

591
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:46,213
<i>Right down to his facial tics.</i>

592
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:56,098
BENJI: <i>So, what you're saying is
no mask can beat it.</i>

593
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,433
We're busted before we even get
into the vault,

594
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,893
and I wind up in a Moroccan jail,

595
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,562
playing mummies and daddies
with Ahmad the Strangler.

596
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:03,189
Okay, I don't get to wear a mask.

597
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:05,399
And there's no other way
into the computer lab?

598
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:06,734
ILSA: No other way in.

599
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:08,903
- Air shaft?
- Six-inch-diameter pipe.

600
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:10,029
Foundation?

601
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:11,864
Twelve feet of concrete, top and bottom.

602
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:13,866
- Electrical conduit.
- Electrical conduit.

603
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:15,618
Bottom line is there's no way
into that terminal

604
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:18,996
unless your profile is preinstalled
in the security system.

605
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:22,083
Profile.

606
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,001
Where are the profiles stored?

607
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:28,339
All security data is stored offline
in the liquid-cooled array.

608
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,925
Here, inside the torus.

609
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,427
Liquid-cooled.
You mean that thing is underwater?

610
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,054
- Yes.
- Yes.

611
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:38,307
Okay. So, to get the ledger,

612
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:40,142
<i>one of us needs to enter the torus</i>

613
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,854
<i>and change the security profile,</i>

614
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,859
<i>so that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.</i>

615
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,531
- That's the only way.
- That's the only way.

616
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,785
Can I get in through there? What's that?

617
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:01,122
That's the service hatch.
It can only be opened from the inside.

618
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,998
If you try and open it from the outside,

619
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:06,210
you'd be hit with 70,000 gallons
of pressurized water.

620
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:07,461
Where does the water come from?

621
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:10,923
Desalinized seawater flows through
the intake, in the power plant.

622
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:14,009
And, before you ask, the system
is designed to shut down automatically

623
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:16,011
if any metal enters the intake.

624
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,556
No oxygen tanks.

625
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:24,145
All right.
Well, how long will it take to free swim

626
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,813
from the intake to the service hatch?

627
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:27,815
Two minutes,
with the current at full power.

628
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,900
Then you just have to hold your breath
for two minutes.

629
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:32,194
What about installing
the security profile?

630
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,447
Well, that's gonna be, like,
a minute, tops.

631
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,073
So I have to hold my breath
for three minutes.

632
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,658
You can do that.

633
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:39,827
What I think you're overlooking
is the physical exertion.

634
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:42,955
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

635
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:46,667
Don't worry about him, all right?
All he has to do is install the fake profile

636
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:50,254
before I get to the gait analysis.
You said it yourself, it's the only way.

637
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,214
That doesn't sound impossible.

638
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,513
BRANDT: Satellite overwatch
covering all seven continents.

639
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:03,225
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

640
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,978
So, how are we supposed to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

641
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:09,064
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her.

642
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:11,525
What do you mean?

643
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,112
These sketches. What do you see?

644
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:19,700
BRANDT: Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guy is.

645
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:23,204
But this woman...

646
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,582
- He knows her.
- He trusts her.

647
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,835
I'm betting that if he's not already
with her, he's on his way.

648
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,545
Find her, find Ethan.

649
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:34,048
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition off a sketch.

650
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:35,758
For mere mortals, no.

651
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,886
- For me, I could've done this at home.
- All right.

652
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,351
- How long is this gonna take?
- LUTHER: Found her.

653
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,566
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

654
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:55,444
BRANDT: What the hell?

655
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:58,489
She's bad news.

656
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:28,978
Sorry.

657
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,759
Your card isn't working.

658
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:02,136
ETHAN:
<i>Benji, we're in.</i>

659
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,349
One more time.
You'll have three minutes.

660
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:52,353
Two and a half minutes
to switch the security profile.

661
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:54,730
Thirty seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

662
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,274
Remember, conserve oxygen.

663
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:59,276
Don't move a muscle
if you don't have to.

664
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,672
I'm in the elevator.

665
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:32,935
ILSA: That current will carry you
to the torus.

666
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,728
Once you're there, I'll shut it down.

667
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,400
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

668
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:42,820
And a slightly more important note.
If you haven't switched that profile

669
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:45,406
before I reach the gait analysis,
I'm dead.

670
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,324
Thank you, Benji.

671
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,103
What's the problem?

672
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:01,356
The cooling system's rebooting by itself.

673
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,901
All systems normal.

674
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:30,154
Cooling system's at full power.

675
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:38,370
No, no, no.

676
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,204
You're all right.

677
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,622
Oh, you're okay.

678
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:10,916
BENJI: You see? What did I tell you?

679
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,752
Difficult? Absolutely. But certainly not...

680
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:18,507
Jesus. Is he all right? What happened?

681
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:32,729
Okay.

682
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:34,940
Here.

683
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:37,984
Hey.

684
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,694
I misjudged you.

685
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:47,619
Hey, man. You okay? How you doing?

686
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:49,287
Hey, buddy.

687
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,458
- Benji.
- Yeah, Benji. You did good.

688
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:56,128
You take a moment, all right?
Just take a moment.

689
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,713
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix.

690
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:00,882
- You'll be right as rain.
- What are you doing here?

691
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:02,926
Look, look.

692
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:04,511
We got it.

693
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:06,513
I knew we'd get it.

694
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,434
Listen, I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay?

695
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:12,519
I appreciate everything you do for me,

696
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:15,355
but one of these days,
you're going to take it too far.

697
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,233
We got it!

698
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:19,693
We're gonna nail that...

699
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,371
Wait, wait...

700
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:36,460
BRANDT: I thought you said
you could find him.

701
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:37,752
LUTHER: I said I could locate him.

702
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:39,629
- You have to find him.
- Right.

703
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:00,567
Where's Hunt?

704
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:07,991
He's dead.

705
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,743
That really hurts!

706
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,077
- Can you walk?
- Yes.

707
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,830
We have to get to her before Lane does.

708
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,506
BENJI: Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

709
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:07,717
Are you okay to drive?
A minute ago you were dead.

710
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:09,427
What are you talking about?

711
01:13:10,637 --> 01:13:12,013
This is not going to end well.

712
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:23,984
There she is!

713
01:13:34,953 --> 01:13:37,330
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

714
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:38,832
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

715
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,836
Ah! God damn it!

716
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:14,618
Whoa.

717
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:28,048
We found him.

718
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:30,717
LUTHER: Oh, come on, man!

719
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:35,472
Shit!

720
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,099
It's a high-speed chase!

721
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:40,393
You just had to get the four-by-four,
didn't you?

722
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:43,188
- Don't blame me. You chose the car.
- You just had to have it!

723
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,565
- Do you want me to drive?
- BRANDT: Look at this thing!

724
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:47,484
LUTHER: Look how slow you're going.
Speed it up!

725
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:53,907
Who's this guy?

726
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,160
Shit!

727
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:00,622
Oh!

728
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,098
Ahhh!

729
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:25,563
Go! Go! Go!

730
01:15:29,651 --> 01:15:31,277
I'm okay! I'm okay! I'm okay!

731
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:37,742
Whoa!

732
01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:39,661
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

733
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:50,964
Here they come!
What are we gonna do?

734
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,091
Uh...

735
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:05,937
Gun!

736
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:12,152
- Do you have your seatbelt on?
- You're asking me that now?

737
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,661
Hang on!

738
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:02,494
We good?

739
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,580
Things got a little out of hand.

740
01:17:05,914 --> 01:17:07,707
Ah! Look out!

741
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:15,089
We're good?

742
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:25,058
Oh, hey, boys, what did I miss?

743
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:32,690
Ooh, that looks sharp. Careful! Careful!

744
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:17,457
So what do we do now?

745
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,463
Please tell me
you made a copy of that disk.

746
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,051
Of course I made a copy.

747
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:37,477
So where are we going?

748
01:22:02,085 --> 01:22:05,421
It's a ledger.
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

749
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:07,006
Who they are,
the politicians they control,

750
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:10,384
and where the money comes from.
It's everything you want to know.

751
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:15,098
What makes you think
this so-called ledger is authentic?

752
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:18,226
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

753
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:20,478
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

754
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:24,065
Did you never stop to consider
that he may want me to have it?

755
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,692
Misinformation, manipulation,
it's what he does, Ilsa.

756
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:28,361
It's what he's trained to do.

757
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:31,572
Lane lies to you,
you sell these lies to Hunt.

758
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:34,784
Together, you're both compromised.
That's his ultimate objective.

759
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:37,036
This may be authentic.

760
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:41,833
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

761
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:45,586
No.

762
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:50,049
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

763
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:51,759
Your orders were
to infiltrate the Syndicate

764
01:22:51,843 --> 01:22:55,012
that we may learn more
about them firsthand.

765
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:57,557
This isn't proof.
It's a test, like everything else.

766
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,059
The only way to pass is to go back.

767
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:04,188
I can't do that. I've betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

768
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:06,732
And in every instance,
you did so on your own volition.

769
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:09,443
He was going to torture and kill
an American agent.

770
01:23:09,527 --> 01:23:12,905
And you should have let him.
Then you would still have Lane's trust.

771
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:15,158
This is the trade. Hunt understands that.

772
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:17,660
I wasn't going to let him die.
He's our ally.

773
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:21,831
There are no allies in statecraft, Ilsa,
only common interests.

774
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:25,293
As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man
without a country.

775
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:29,922
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

776
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,676
Are you ordering me to kill Hunt?

777
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:36,095
Good God, no.
Nothing so crude as that. No.

778
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:38,848
Lane will order you.

779
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:42,185
And to regain his trust,

780
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:44,353
you will do it.

781
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:49,775
You sent me to do a job. I did it.

782
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:52,570
Now you bring me in!

783
01:23:52,612 --> 01:23:55,281
Might I remind you,
you are without a country of your own?

784
01:23:57,158 --> 01:24:00,328
The Director of the CIA called me,
inquiring about you personally.

785
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:02,747
Of course, to protect your cover,
I had to lie.

786
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:04,373
So, as far as the Americans
are concerned,

787
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:07,293
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

788
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:11,464
Precious few people know
about your true identity.

789
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:15,801
It would be unfortunate if we forgot.

790
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:19,805
You see, there really is no choice, Ilsa.

791
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,849
You're going back.

792
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,151
Glad to know you're still with us.

793
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:43,287
- ETHAN: What's happening?
- LUTHER: I can't open it.

794
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:47,291
- What do you mean, you can't open it?
- I mean I can't open it, ever.

795
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:48,918
That's a red box.

796
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,670
- A what?
- It's a red box.

797
01:24:50,962 --> 01:24:53,214
The British government uses them
to transport state secrets.

798
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:56,342
- Doesn't sound good.
- BENJI: Meaning it's triple-encrypted.

799
01:24:56,384 --> 01:24:57,510
You're not getting into that thing

800
01:24:57,593 --> 01:24:59,679
unless you have fingerprints,
retinal scan,

801
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:03,140
and a voice phrase spoken
by a specific individual.

802
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:05,184
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.

803
01:25:05,226 --> 01:25:06,394
Yes, him.

804
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:08,604
So what you're saying is
there is no ledger,

805
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:11,065
which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exists.

806
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:14,694
So we're back to square one,
only now we are all wanted by the CIA.

807
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:17,196
I'm so proud of us.

808
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:19,699
BENJI: What I don't understand is
why is there a red box

809
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:22,201
sat in a private data vault in Morocco?

810
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,954
And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?

811
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:27,915
If Lane wants it,
you can bet he has a plan to open it.

812
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,043
And we just helped him steal it.

813
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:36,966
He's going to take the Prime Minister.

814
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:40,344
Yes, he is. The question is how.

815
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:42,096
Well, we have to warn
the British government.

816
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,347
Yeah, MI6.

817
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:46,225
No, Brandt. Put down the phone.
Let's think about this for a minute.

818
01:25:46,309 --> 01:25:48,311
We have a responsibility
to warn the British government

819
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:51,605
and not gamble
with the Prime Minister's life, Ethan,

820
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:56,110
just so you can beat the guy
that has beaten you at every turn.

821
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:00,114
Is that what you think this is?

822
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:01,991
Brandt?

823
01:26:04,744 --> 01:26:06,412
Is that what you think this is?

824
01:26:07,747 --> 01:26:11,083
I think right now you're incapable
of seeing that there is another way.

825
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:14,795
And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.

826
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:18,132
And if he is wrong,
then we have Vienna all over again!

827
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:19,425
You don't know him.

828
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,511
If he wants something to happen,
there is no preventing it!

829
01:26:22,595 --> 01:26:24,555
That's why we have to warn the British.

830
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:26,849
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

831
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:29,310
Are you listening to yourself?
We are going to warn the British.

832
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:31,771
No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him,

833
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:34,106
before he takes the Prime Minister.

834
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:40,279
Okay.

835
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,782
All right, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.

836
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:46,452
But please tell me
how are we going to do that?

837
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:27,743
All is forgiven.

838
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:30,079
That isn't a ledger, is it?

839
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:32,123
You didn't take a look for yourself?

840
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:35,251
Of course I did,
but the file was encrypted.

841
01:27:35,835 --> 01:27:37,461
And why would I lie to you?

842
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,463
So that I would lie to Hunt.

843
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:43,592
But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.

844
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,929
And you wouldn't have helped him.

845
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:50,599
What is actually on that disk?

846
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:53,978
I'll be honest with you
when you start being honest with me.

847
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:58,983
Now, you and I both know
why you've come back. Don't we?

848
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:00,860
Hmm?

849
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:04,905
You're still alive
because I believe in your potential.

850
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:06,866
But I'm growing impatient.

851
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:10,536
Why do you continue to resist?

852
01:28:14,874 --> 01:28:18,461
Well, if we're being honest,
you're a terrorist.

853
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,505
If that were true,
my goal would be to spread fear.

854
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:25,718
But my method is far more surgical.

855
01:28:28,179 --> 01:28:29,638
You kill innocent people.

856
01:28:30,181 --> 01:28:33,100
I helped my government kill
many innocent people and more.

857
01:28:33,184 --> 01:28:34,894
So much more.

858
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:38,022
Killing to keep things as they were.

859
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:41,650
And now I'm killing
to bring about change.

860
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:45,154
I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.

861
01:28:45,613 --> 01:28:49,408
Ethan Hunt is a gambler.
And one day his luck will run out,

862
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:52,953
and thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.

863
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,831
Which one of us will be the villain then?

864
01:28:59,919 --> 01:29:02,129
Nothing here. It's empty.

865
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:21,607
I'm interested to see who you blame

866
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:25,402
for what happens next.

867
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,118
So that's her?

868
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:15,619
That's her.

869
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:23,586
I have to say you sure can ride.

870
01:30:26,839 --> 01:30:29,008
- Ethan...
- You were just doing your job.

871
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:31,719
That's all we're going to say about it.

872
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:35,723
Atlee said you would understand.

873
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:38,475
Atlee.
Your handler in British intelligence.

874
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,273
And he didn't bring you in,

875
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,693
even after you gave him the disk.

876
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,196
You knew perfectly well it was blank.

877
01:30:52,031 --> 01:30:53,198
BENJI:
<i>That's a lie.</i>

878
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:55,743
The disk she took from me
was an exact copy. I'm sure of it.

879
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:58,203
Was it in your possession
the entire time?

880
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:13,135
They don't care if you live or die.

881
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:22,895
But you knew
I was going to take it to him.

882
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:26,857
I hoped you would.
I hoped it'd be enough to get you out.

883
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:30,861
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That means
Lane doesn't have the disk. Only we do.

884
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,404
I have a question.

885
01:31:32,488 --> 01:31:35,949
If the disk was blank,
why is she still alive?

886
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:39,870
<i>Unless, of course,
Lane wanted us to find her.</i>

887
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,540
So who you working for now?

888
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,629
Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same.

889
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:50,964
We only think
we're fighting for the right side

890
01:31:51,048 --> 01:31:52,925
because that's what
we choose to believe.

891
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:56,136
So where does that leave us?

892
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:59,098
The way I see it,
you have three choices.

893
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:02,643
One, you hand me
and the disk over to the CIA.

894
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,978
I am proof the Syndicate exists.

895
01:32:05,062 --> 01:32:08,315
Lane becomes their problem
and your work is done.

896
01:32:08,482 --> 01:32:10,567
- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me.

897
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:12,528
But you know
they're not gonna believe you.

898
01:32:13,237 --> 01:32:15,114
And you'll all be tried for treason.

899
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:17,032
Lane goes free.

900
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,076
I'm afraid she has a point.

901
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:22,621
Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.

902
01:32:23,664 --> 01:32:26,333
You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.

903
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:30,295
But some part of you suspects
you've met your match.

904
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:33,090
And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk,

905
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:34,717
whether you want to or not.

906
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,969
That is entirely possible.

907
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:39,012
And option three?

908
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:41,140
Come away with me.

909
01:32:42,808 --> 01:32:44,143
Right now.

910
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,106
Oh, boy.

911
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:53,986
And what about Lane?

912
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:56,113
Forget about Lane.

913
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:58,699
There will always be another Lane.

914
01:32:59,283 --> 01:33:01,952
There will always be people like us
to face him.

915
01:33:02,995 --> 01:33:06,165
We've done our part
and we've been cast aside.

916
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,168
We can be anyone.

917
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,670
We can do anything.

918
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:15,674
It's only a matter of going.

919
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,774
Lane sent you to deliver a message,
didn't he?

920
01:33:32,691 --> 01:33:34,735
I've saved your life twice.
I won't be able to do it again.

921
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:37,154
What's the message?

922
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:51,376
ETHAN: Benji.

923
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:05,557
Parking garage.

924
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:07,267
Luther, stay with her!

925
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:33,710
She's gone. I lost her.

926
01:34:37,214 --> 01:34:38,715
She set us up, Ethan.

927
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:41,426
No. She delivered a message.

928
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:44,388
She set us up!
She knew this would happen!

929
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:47,266
Only Lane knows
what's going to happen!

930
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:55,023
LANE: <i>I have a job for you, Ethan.</i>

931
01:34:55,107 --> 01:34:57,818
<i>And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it.</i>

932
01:34:57,901 --> 01:34:58,944
I'm listening.

933
01:34:58,986 --> 01:35:02,030
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it</i>

934
01:35:02,114 --> 01:35:05,742
<i>is to bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight tonight.</i>

935
01:35:05,784 --> 01:35:07,452
<i>Now say the words, please.</i>

936
01:35:08,704 --> 01:35:10,205
I accept.

937
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:12,374
Yes.

938
01:35:15,294 --> 01:35:16,503
I knew you would.

939
01:35:23,969 --> 01:35:28,640
He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight.

940
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:33,145
Ethan, there's only one person on Earth
who can unlock that disk.

941
01:35:34,855 --> 01:35:36,982
We have to take the Prime Minister.

942
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:40,485
Let's just think about that
for a minute.

943
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:44,281
It's the only way to get Benji back.

944
01:35:44,323 --> 01:35:47,159
Ethan, that's exactly
what Lane wants you to do.

945
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:50,621
Which is why it has to happen.

946
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,336
This is how we beat Lane.

947
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,005
This is how we make everything right.

948
01:36:00,339 --> 01:36:01,590
Can you see?

949
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:04,343
Can't you see it?

950
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:21,360
William Brandt, sir. He says it's urgent.

951
01:36:26,448 --> 01:36:28,450
I had a feeling
you'd come to your senses, Brandt.

952
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:31,161
I'm only calling you
because I have no other choice.

953
01:36:31,203 --> 01:36:32,871
I'm trying to prevent a catastrophe.

954
01:36:32,955 --> 01:36:34,873
<i>I can understand that. Where are you?</i>

955
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:40,212
- London.
- Reroute us to London now.

956
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:43,340
- Where in London?
- <i>I'll tell you when you land, not before.</i>

957
01:36:43,382 --> 01:36:45,467
I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt.

958
01:36:45,676 --> 01:36:48,428
And I'm not interested
in seeing my friends get killed either.

959
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:50,931
So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going do this on my terms

960
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:52,808
and my terms only. Do you understand?

961
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:55,227
<i>Keep your phone on.
Instructions will follow.</i>

962
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:03,360
LUTHER: You should've been gone
by now.

963
01:37:03,402 --> 01:37:04,403
Yeah.

964
01:37:07,781 --> 01:37:09,116
You okay?

965
01:37:12,536 --> 01:37:13,662
We're supposed to take down

966
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:15,455
the Prime Minister
of Great Britain tonight.

967
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:17,874
So...

968
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,086
ETHAN: Brandt?

969
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:27,050
I can't see another way.

970
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:30,887
Neither can I.

971
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:36,184
But we do what we have to do
for our friends, right?

972
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:22,481
Get him ready, please.

973
01:38:48,215 --> 01:38:50,175
You were right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?

974
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:52,177
He's on his way.
We don't have much time.

975
01:38:52,219 --> 01:38:55,013
- What does he intend to do?
- What matters is that he's alive.

976
01:38:55,055 --> 01:38:58,016
And I need your reassurance
that he's going to stay that way.

977
01:39:14,241 --> 01:39:15,867
Have you informed
the British government

978
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:17,786
that Hunt has targeted
the Prime Minister?

979
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:21,331
I will help you capture him alive.
That is the deal.

980
01:39:28,505 --> 01:39:30,882
You've picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt,

981
01:39:30,924 --> 01:39:34,427
the worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome.

982
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:36,930
Stay with him.

983
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:43,145
Chief Atlee! Chief Atlee.

984
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:45,564
Director Hunley,
how delightful to see you here.

985
01:39:45,647 --> 01:39:49,484
Last time we spoke, you were hunting
rogue agents in Morocco.

986
01:39:49,568 --> 01:39:53,530
Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger.

987
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:57,909
I'm listening.

988
01:40:01,371 --> 01:40:04,749
AUCTIONEER: Any advance
on 22,000? Anyone?

989
01:40:05,167 --> 01:40:07,335
Going once. Going twice.

990
01:40:07,878 --> 01:40:10,046
Sold to our generous chairwoman.

991
01:40:10,714 --> 01:40:13,633
Sir? Chief Atlee from MI6
needs to see you.

992
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:15,260
He says it's urgent.

993
01:40:16,887 --> 01:40:18,305
Excuse me.

994
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:30,275
What's this all about?

995
01:40:30,317 --> 01:40:32,569
It's a matter of national security, sir.

996
01:40:39,993 --> 01:40:42,621
Under no circumstances
is anyone to enter.

997
01:40:42,913 --> 01:40:44,080
Yes, sir.

998
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,125
PRIME MINISTER:
<i>Help me to understand.</i>

999
01:40:48,168 --> 01:40:50,921
Who is this man? Why is he after me?

1000
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:53,715
I'm afraid, Prime Minister,
Director Hunley and I

1001
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:56,051
share responsibility for this.

1002
01:40:56,134 --> 01:40:59,137
Ethan Hunt was part of
a disgraced intelligence agency

1003
01:40:59,221 --> 01:41:00,472
which has since been dissolved.

1004
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:01,848
ATLEE: And he's gone rogue,

1005
01:41:01,932 --> 01:41:05,518
unfortunately intent on dismantling
an imaginary terror network.

1006
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,146
But new intelligence suggests
he's been manipulated

1007
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:10,065
by one of your own former agents.

1008
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:13,026
Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared two years ago.

1009
01:41:13,151 --> 01:41:16,905
If you don't mind my asking, what do
I have to do with this phantom network?

1010
01:41:17,155 --> 01:41:20,116
Uh, sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.

1011
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:23,328
He came forward with firsthand
knowledge of the plot against you.

1012
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:26,081
Sir, Hunt is in possession
of a virtual red box

1013
01:41:26,164 --> 01:41:27,999
that can only be opened by you.

1014
01:41:28,083 --> 01:41:31,503
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

1015
01:41:33,255 --> 01:41:35,090
The Syndicate, you say?

1016
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:38,009
BRANDT: Yes, sir.
That's what he calls it.

1017
01:41:38,969 --> 01:41:40,011
Atlee?

1018
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:43,223
He couldn't possibly be talking about

1019
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:44,683
that Syndicate.

1020
01:41:47,519 --> 01:41:51,314
Because you assured me that
that Syndicate was merely an exercise.

1021
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:54,818
And it was, Prime Minister,
I can assure you.

1022
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:55,860
And yet here we have

1023
01:41:55,944 --> 01:41:58,154
the Central Intelligence Agency
indicating otherwise.

1024
01:41:58,196 --> 01:41:59,572
I don't understand.

1025
01:41:59,656 --> 01:42:01,741
Prime Minister, your life is in danger.

1026
01:42:01,992 --> 01:42:05,328
I think our first priority is to move you
to a secure location.

1027
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:08,248
Sir, does the name Solomon Lane
ring a bell?

1028
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,710
Yes.

1029
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:15,714
Unfortunately, it does.

1030
01:42:18,383 --> 01:42:20,885
So there actually is a Syndicate?

1031
01:42:21,303 --> 01:42:25,307
It was the hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee.

1032
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:28,435
Recruit former agents
from other nations,

1033
01:42:28,518 --> 01:42:29,894
supply them with a new identity,

1034
01:42:29,978 --> 01:42:33,732
and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.

1035
01:42:34,566 --> 01:42:36,860
Its operating budget
was to be hidden offshore

1036
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,904
in a virtual red box
which I alone would control.

1037
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:43,074
It would have made me
judge, jury, and executioner,

1038
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:44,409
with zero accountability.

1039
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:47,203
I rejected the proposal, unequivocally.

1040
01:42:47,245 --> 01:42:49,914
Furthermore,
I was given every assurance

1041
01:42:49,998 --> 01:42:51,833
it never passed the planning stage.

1042
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:54,461
Prime Minister, there is no Syndicate.

1043
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:57,088
These men have been duped
by Agent Faust.

1044
01:42:57,172 --> 01:43:00,508
Atlee! Save it for the public inquiry.

1045
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:02,302
Sir, I urge you not to leave this room.

1046
01:43:02,385 --> 01:43:03,595
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1047
01:43:04,179 --> 01:43:06,598
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

1048
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:10,018
A specialist without equal,
immune to any countermeasures.

1049
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:12,395
There is no secret he cannot extract.

1050
01:43:12,437 --> 01:43:15,774
No security he cannot breach.
No person he cannot become.

1051
01:43:16,775 --> 01:43:20,278
He has, most likely,
anticipated this very conversation

1052
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,198
and is waiting to strike
in whatever direction we move.

1053
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:27,369
Sir, Hunt is the living manifestation
of destiny.

1054
01:43:27,452 --> 01:43:30,038
And he has made you his mission.

1055
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:33,041
ATLEE: Prime Minister?

1056
01:43:49,099 --> 01:43:50,141
Hunt.

1057
01:43:51,059 --> 01:43:53,228
Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister.

1058
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:59,651
Just relax, sir.
Everything's going to be all right.

1059
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:02,320
- Atlee shot me.
- Yes, he did, sir.

1060
01:44:05,824 --> 01:44:08,326
Hunt, I hope you realize you've set back

1061
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:11,162
US-UK relations
to the American Revolution?

1062
01:44:11,663 --> 01:44:14,416
Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir.

1063
01:44:17,043 --> 01:44:18,044
I'm here.

1064
01:44:18,128 --> 01:44:19,796
- ETHAN: <i>Stand by to receive.</i>
- Ready.

1065
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:28,847
The Prime Minister's office asked me
to meet him here.

1066
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,348
This way, sir.

1067
01:44:30,515 --> 01:44:31,766
Scanning.

1068
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,647
Retinal scan confirmed.

1069
01:44:39,566 --> 01:44:40,608
Mmm.

1070
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:42,444
It's okay. Here you go, sir.

1071
01:44:43,695 --> 01:44:46,156
You've got a very warm hand.

1072
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:56,666
LUTHER: <i>Biometric confirmed.</i>

1073
01:44:57,709 --> 01:44:59,210
The prompt is "Kipling."

1074
01:44:59,377 --> 01:45:01,045
The prompt is "Kipling."

1075
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:05,884
Sir, I'm going to need a pass-phrase.
The prompt is "Kipling."

1076
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,260
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, of course.

1077
01:45:07,552 --> 01:45:10,847
"If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs...

1078
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:19,522
<i>"If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."</i>

1079
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:26,029
- You got it?
- LUTHER: <i>I got it.</i>

1080
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:27,822
Oh, man, do I got it.

1081
01:45:27,906 --> 01:45:29,574
I'm here to see the Prime Minister.

1082
01:45:29,866 --> 01:45:31,367
We were told not to let anybody in.

1083
01:45:32,202 --> 01:45:34,746
- By whom?
- By you, sir.

1084
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:40,752
ATLEE: Hunley? What is this?

1085
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:42,337
Security!

1086
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:50,261
ETHAN: Chief Atlee.

1087
01:45:50,595 --> 01:45:52,514
Kind of you to accept our invitation.

1088
01:45:52,931 --> 01:45:53,932
Ah.

1089
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,108
Do you know who I am?

1090
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:08,488
We know you created the Syndicate.

1091
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,907
But Lane went rogue
and turned it against you, didn't he?

1092
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,618
And you've been
desperately trying to cover it up.

1093
01:46:13,785 --> 01:46:15,870
That's why you erased the disk
when she brought it to you.

1094
01:46:16,621 --> 01:46:18,122
That's true.

1095
01:46:21,084 --> 01:46:25,672
Now, Director Hunley has some
questions for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

1096
01:46:25,755 --> 01:46:28,383
Namely, how you framed her.

1097
01:46:28,466 --> 01:46:30,843
That's also true.

1098
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:37,058
It's the antidote.

1099
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:39,561
When the Prime Minister found out
about the Syndicate,

1100
01:46:39,644 --> 01:46:41,312
Atlee attacked him.

1101
01:46:41,354 --> 01:46:42,564
Yes, that's true.

1102
01:46:42,647 --> 01:46:45,358
And then you saved
the Prime Minister, sir.

1103
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:46,734
PRIME MINISTER: Did he?

1104
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:48,486
I'm very grateful.

1105
01:46:59,831 --> 01:47:00,957
Sir.

1106
01:47:03,793 --> 01:47:06,296
You're cutting it very close, Ethan.

1107
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:10,174
I have what you want. Where do I go?

1108
01:47:27,859 --> 01:47:29,736
Ethan, wait.

1109
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:31,904
If I'm not there in 15 minutes,
he'll kill Benji.

1110
01:47:31,988 --> 01:47:33,865
The mission
is to bring down the Syndicate.

1111
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:38,202
If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower.

1112
01:47:38,244 --> 01:47:40,371
He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it.

1113
01:47:40,413 --> 01:47:44,042
And what happens,
Ethan, if you can't make it back?

1114
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:46,502
I'll make it back.

1115
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,088
Just be ready.

1116
01:47:54,052 --> 01:47:55,553
ATLEE:
<i>Greetings, Prime Minister.</i>

1117
01:47:55,595 --> 01:47:56,846
<i>If you are viewing this message,</i>

1118
01:47:56,888 --> 01:48:00,016
<i>it means that you have chosen
to activate the Syndicate.</i>

1119
01:48:00,058 --> 01:48:03,728
<i>This disk gives you access
to £2.4 billion</i>

1120
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:05,313
<i>in untraceable currency</i>

1121
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:09,817
<i>that will allow the Syndicate
to operate undetected for decades.</i>

1122
01:48:10,193 --> 01:48:14,572
Instructions to access these funds
are as follows.

1123
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:23,474
BENJI: This is the end, Mr. Hunt.

1124
01:49:32,817 --> 01:49:33,985
Careful.

1125
01:49:37,238 --> 01:49:38,740
BENJI: Two pounds of Semtex.

1126
01:49:39,157 --> 01:49:42,660
Five hundred .30 caliber ball bearings.

1127
01:49:43,077 --> 01:49:45,121
Your friend is sitting on
a highly sensitive...

1128
01:49:45,163 --> 01:49:46,706
...pressure trigger.

1129
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:48,833
So no sudden moves.

1130
01:49:57,258 --> 01:49:58,509
Your final test.

1131
01:49:58,593 --> 01:50:02,430
When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji.

1132
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:06,601
If not, everyone dies.

1133
01:50:09,854 --> 01:50:11,355
No time to think, Ethan.

1134
01:50:11,856 --> 01:50:13,608
LANE: Have a seat, please.

1135
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:31,793
Human nature. My weapon of choice.

1136
01:50:32,376 --> 01:50:36,005
From the moment I killed the young lady
in the record shop,

1137
01:50:36,047 --> 01:50:38,841
- I knew you would...
- ...stop at nothing to catch me.

1138
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:41,552
I also knew Ilsa wouldn't have a choice.

1139
01:50:42,053 --> 01:50:45,556
Whether she broke you
that night you met or let you go,

1140
01:50:46,057 --> 01:50:47,892
whether you let her run in Morocco,

1141
01:50:48,684 --> 01:50:51,062
whether she went to Atlee or not...

1142
01:50:51,354 --> 01:50:55,233
You were certain we'd end up
where we are right now.

1143
01:50:59,237 --> 01:51:00,905
Then, again,

1144
01:51:02,114 --> 01:51:03,199
so was I.

1145
01:51:04,492 --> 01:51:05,827
<i>I know you, Lane.</i>

1146
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:08,788
<i>Somewhere along the line,
you had a crisis of faith.</i>

1147
01:51:08,871 --> 01:51:12,375
Human life didn't matter anymore.
Or maybe it never really did.

1148
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:15,920
Either way,
you killed too many innocent people

1149
01:51:15,962 --> 01:51:20,091
without ever asking
who was giving the orders or why.

1150
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:24,428
<i>You blame the system for what you are,
instead of yourself.</i>

1151
01:51:25,221 --> 01:51:28,975
You wanted revenge,
but Rome wasn't destroyed in a day.

1152
01:51:29,058 --> 01:51:32,270
You needed help.
You needed money, a lot of it.

1153
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:35,773
And you'll stop at nothing to get it.

1154
01:51:36,232 --> 01:51:38,693
That's how I know
I'm going to put you in a box.

1155
01:51:41,112 --> 01:51:42,238
Where's the disk?

1156
01:51:43,948 --> 01:51:45,283
Where is the disk?

1157
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:46,993
ETHAN: You like to play games.

1158
01:51:47,493 --> 01:51:48,911
I have a game for you.

1159
01:51:49,662 --> 01:51:52,832
I'll give you $50 million

1160
01:51:54,959 --> 01:51:56,752
<i>to let Benji go.</i>

1161
01:52:13,269 --> 01:52:14,604
Where is the disk?

1162
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:16,981
Where is the disk?

1163
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:19,609
You're looking at it.

1164
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:20,902
I am the disk.

1165
01:52:21,068 --> 01:52:24,572
I memorized it.
All £2.4 billion in numbered accounts.

1166
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:26,866
If that vest goes off, you get nothing.

1167
01:52:26,949 --> 01:52:31,495
<i>Without this money, you're nothing.
Without me, you're nothing.</i>

1168
01:52:36,167 --> 01:52:38,002
<i>Right now, you're thinking it's a bluff.</i>

1169
01:52:38,294 --> 01:52:39,962
<i>I'd never let my friends die.</i>

1170
01:52:40,004 --> 01:52:43,299
<i>I couldn't possibly memorize
the entire disk.</i>

1171
01:52:43,507 --> 01:52:45,301
There's only one way to be sure.

1172
01:52:46,802 --> 01:52:48,179
Let Benji go.

1173
01:53:05,863 --> 01:53:06,906
Take him.

1174
01:53:11,202 --> 01:53:13,829
They come one step closer, shoot me.

1175
01:53:15,456 --> 01:53:16,791
Stop!

1176
01:53:20,044 --> 01:53:22,838
You remember I told you one day
you were going to take things too far?

1177
01:53:22,922 --> 01:53:24,507
This is me speaking, by the way,
it's not him.

1178
01:53:24,882 --> 01:53:29,679
The only way this ends is you and me,
Lane, face to face.

1179
01:53:30,012 --> 01:53:32,682
<i>Only this time,
I won't be locked in a glass box.</i>

1180
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:34,225
<i>You want your money?</i>

1181
01:53:34,266 --> 01:53:35,601
The Bone Doctor
is going to have to

1182
01:53:35,685 --> 01:53:36,936
beat it out of me!

1183
01:53:37,728 --> 01:53:40,356
Now let Benji go.

1184
01:53:45,236 --> 01:53:47,071
1-3-9...

1185
01:54:08,551 --> 01:54:10,094
- Go.
- Ethan...

1186
01:54:10,177 --> 01:54:11,846
Brandt and Luther are waiting. Go.

1187
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:21,522
What do I do?

1188
01:54:21,856 --> 01:54:22,982
Kill the woman.

1189
01:54:24,942 --> 01:54:26,819
I need Hunt alive.

1190
01:55:14,492 --> 01:55:16,327
- Go!
- <i>It's Benji. Where am I going?</i>

1191
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:17,870
- They're coming.
- We're not ready.

1192
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:19,080
Then get ready.

1193
01:55:45,731 --> 01:55:47,066
Which way?

1194
01:58:08,999 --> 01:58:10,918
Now let's see what you're made of.

1195
02:00:07,159 --> 02:00:10,829
Face to face, just as you wished, Ethan.

1196
02:00:34,144 --> 02:00:35,813
It hurts, I know.

1197
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:40,651
Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.

1198
02:00:41,902 --> 02:00:43,320
Mr. Lane,

1199
02:00:44,988 --> 02:00:46,824
meet the IMF.

1200
02:02:06,278 --> 02:02:07,613
You're free now.

1201
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:12,201
Where will you go?

1202
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:14,870
I don't know.

1203
02:02:17,581 --> 02:02:19,249
I've done my part.

1204
02:02:19,917 --> 02:02:21,043
Yeah.

1205
02:02:26,590 --> 02:02:27,925
Ethan, we got to go!

1206
02:02:37,893 --> 02:02:39,603
You'd better hurry now.

1207
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:43,065
Good luck.

1208
02:02:58,288 --> 02:02:59,957
You know how to find me.

1209
02:03:17,766 --> 02:03:19,142
MR. CHAIRMAN: Director Hunley?

1210
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:23,021
Director Hunley!

1211
02:03:23,105 --> 02:03:24,356
Uh, Mr. Chairman.

1212
02:03:24,439 --> 02:03:26,275
MR. CHAIRMAN: Six months ago,
you stood before this panel

1213
02:03:26,316 --> 02:03:29,152
and demanded that
the IMF be dissolved.

1214
02:03:29,194 --> 02:03:30,862
DIRECTOR HUNLEY:
That is correct, sir.

1215
02:03:30,946 --> 02:03:32,823
How do you explain
your testimony today?

1216
02:03:32,906 --> 02:03:35,242
It's quite simple, really.
We had reason to believe that

1217
02:03:35,325 --> 02:03:38,662
the Syndicate had infiltrated
our government at the highest level.

1218
02:03:38,745 --> 02:03:41,331
In order for our man
to infiltrate that organization,

1219
02:03:41,415 --> 02:03:44,293
his cover had to be absolute.

1220
02:03:44,334 --> 02:03:45,502
The whole operation was known

1221
02:03:45,544 --> 02:03:48,505
only to myself
and a handful of IMF agents.

1222
02:03:48,839 --> 02:03:53,719
So the shuttering of the IMF
was all part of an elaborate scheme

1223
02:03:53,802 --> 02:03:55,804
to expose the so-called Syndicate.

1224
02:03:56,138 --> 02:03:57,180
That is correct, sir.

1225
02:03:57,264 --> 02:04:02,311
Which is why you're here today
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

1226
02:04:02,811 --> 02:04:04,396
That is correct, sir.

1227
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:09,901
I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.

1228
02:04:10,485 --> 02:04:13,780
Uh, desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.

1229
02:04:15,699 --> 02:04:19,536
And you, Mr. Brandt,
how can you justify this deception?

1230
02:04:21,997 --> 02:04:25,250
I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation

1231
02:04:25,334 --> 02:04:27,377
without the Secretary's approval.

1232
02:04:35,344 --> 02:04:37,721
Welcome to the IMF,

1233
02:04:37,804 --> 02:04:39,306
Mr. Secretary.
