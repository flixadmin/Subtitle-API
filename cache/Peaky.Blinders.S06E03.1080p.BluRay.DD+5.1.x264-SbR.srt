1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,321
<i>Jack Nelson's
coming to London.</i>

2
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:06,041
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

3
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:07,161
Fascists.

4
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:10,121
Not the ones
in boots and black shirts.

5
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:11,681
<i>The ones in tuxedos.</i>

6
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:13,281
Mr Shelby,
Lady Diana Mitford.

7
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:15,681
Oswald's most recent
and last ever mistress.

8
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:18,721
Officially he's coming to buy
liquor import licences.

9
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:22,121
And unofficially
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

10
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:24,041
By being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

11
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:25,361
I can undermine them.

12
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:27,641
Still looking for trouble
big enough to kill you.

13
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,281
If you don't want
to help me carry the bucket,

14
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:30,641
then I wouldn't blame you.

15
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,241
You have to carry this bucket
on your own.

16
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:33,761
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

17
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:36,681
You're a brave man.

18
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,321
Every war hero I ever met,

19
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:41,081
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

20
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:42,641
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby...

21
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:44,041
It will be you.

22
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:47,441
The devil will be dead.
The future belongs to us.

23
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:49,161
<i>You need to see
a doctor.</i>

24
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:52,401
We've got to keep going until
this Boston business is done.

25
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:54,801
- Hello?

26
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,481
Tommy, she has a temperature
of 101 and nothing is working.

27
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,241
Just get here now.

28
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:23,241
Out of the way! Out of the way!

29
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:26,041
- No... No. Where's the doctor?
- Can you get the doctor?

30
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,161
I need to speak a doctor!

31
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:30,201
Mr Shelby! Mr Shelby...
your daughter has consumption.

32
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:33,041
Consumption
is a very infectious disease.

33
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,961
There are procedures
that must be followed.

34
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:37,081
- Please, hand over the child.
- OK.

35
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:38,201
Lizzie?

36
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:41,641
Right, you take her.
You be gentle.

37
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,521
Look after her.

38
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:46,441
That's my daughter.
You hear me?

39
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:47,881
I need to be with her.

40
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,801
I need to be with my daughter!

41
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:51,441
Calm.

42
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:54,241
OK. Come on.
They are X-raying Ruby.

43
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,721
They have to X-ray us because
we might have it as well.

44
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:57,841
Fuck us, Lizzie.

45
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,881
Fuck us! Fuck you and me!

46
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:01,681
Who brought this on?!

47
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:05,761
We brought on this curse!

48
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:07,761
Stop, Tommy.

49
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,241
Fucking stop!

50
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,241
They wouldn't let me pass.

51
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:14,561
They wouldn't let me pass.

52
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:19,561
They did it on purpose -
to punish me.

53
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,841
Tommy, stop it, please.

54
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:25,801
All right.

55
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:27,561
All right.

56
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,081
My husband...is very sorry.

57
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,001
OK.

58
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,161
My husband is very sorry

59
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:39,801
and he is calm now.

60
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:44,481
He is recovering
from addiction.

61
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:45,841
Sometimes...

62
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,961
Sometimes...

63
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:53,801
...he's a horse in a crate,
kicking the crate.

64
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:57,161
It's just the crate
I'm kicking.

65
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:00,521
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,761
- Lizzie.
- Yeah?

67
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,641
Tell me what I have to do.

68
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:07,841
- This way, sir.
- Sorry.

69
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,801
Thank you.

70
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:23,481
Mr Shelby, you will need
to keep still for a moment.

71
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:39,681
To see what's inside.

72
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,281
Wait till you see.

73
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,441
God.

74
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,521
God knows what's inside.

75
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,321
God help her.

76
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,481
She has a tubercular infection
in her left lung.

77
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,281
They've caught it quite early.

78
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,161
They'll do more tests.

79
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:45,521
They do this thing,
pulmonary something,

80
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:48,321
where they collapse the lung,
let it rest.

81
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:50,081
Sometimes the lung
cures itself.

82
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:55,481
And if that doesn't work,
they use gold.

83
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,481
What?

84
00:04:57,601 --> 00:05:00,721
- Gold?
- Gold salts.

85
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:03,201
The doctor said he explained
their methods to you

86
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:06,001
when you cut the ribbon
to open the institution.

87
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:08,401
I can't remember.
I wasn't listening.

88
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:10,601
Yeah, well.

89
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:12,481
Gold salts.

90
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:15,601
Salt with 37% gold.

91
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:23,561
They say it helps, but it will
make her more sick at first.

92
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,681
Did they say what...?

93
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,521
Did they say
what the chances are?

94
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,921
- No. They don't say.
- Hmm.

95
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,481
But she's small.
And with TB that's not good,

96
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,721
because the disease
is big and fast.

97
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:34,241
I'm so sorry...my darling.

98
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:38,761
I will deal with it.

99
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,801
I will make it go away.

100
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,561
I will strike a bargain.

101
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:58,121
You should be wearing a mask.

102
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,201
I am.

103
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,081
You can try gold.

104
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,161
I will try something else.

105
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,681
<i>Mayfair 244.</i>

106
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:40,201
Ada? Listen to me.

107
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:43,001
I need you to be me in London.

108
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,761
No, it's important.

109
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,961
I know you want nothing
to do with my business,

110
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:49,401
but Ruby is very sick.

111
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:51,321
I need five days of your time.

112
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:08,681
So, she dresses well.

113
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:13,481
Go to the door
and take her coat.

114
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,521
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh...

115
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:17,281
And make a note of the label.

116
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:18,921
Of course, ma'am.

117
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,721
Oh, Thomas,
where the devil are you?

118
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,961
Mrs Ada Thorne, ma'am.

119
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:11,121
I thought you were
all called Shelby.

120
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:12,601
Ah, I'm a widow.

121
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,761
My husband didn't have
the good grace to die.

122
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,281
He lingers yet.

123
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:18,961
Your husband is a member of
the Guinness family, I believe.

124
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,521
They do a lot of good work
on behalf of the poor.

125
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:22,921
The poor who are only poor

126
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,681
because they've spent so much
of their income on Guinness.

127
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:26,721
Please.

128
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,361
I think the causes of poverty

129
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:30,161
are a little more complex
than that.

130
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,921
Yes. I believe
it is to do with genetics.

131
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:35,321
Huh. Beautiful vase.

132
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:38,041
My grandfather stole it
from a brothel in Cairo.

133
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,361
Egyptian.

134
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,201
The 18th Dynasty, I think.

135
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,921
How do you know so much
about Egyptian vases?

136
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,001
- I collect antiques.
- Hmm.

137
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:50,841
A tribe of Gypsies settles on a
clearing in a factory town.

138
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:53,881
Children, of course,
ensue in their hundreds,

139
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:57,041
but one of them becomes
a gangster and a politician,

140
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:59,041
the other
a collector of antiques.

141
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,801
It is quite extraordinary.

142
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,161
A result of genetics, I think.

143
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:05,641
My dear, you researched me
and I researched you.

144
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:08,841
If this was 1919, you would
have come through my front door

145
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,001
carrying a revolver
and a Molotov cocktail

146
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:12,641
and would happily
have blown off my head.

147
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:15,721
Hmm. Isn't it wonderful
how time changes everything?

148
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,081
Where is the American?

149
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:18,641
- He'll be here later.
- Where's Mosley?

150
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,761
He heard Thomas wasn't coming
so he decided to sulk.

151
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,001
You know how men are.

152
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:24,161
Where is Thomas?

153
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:25,961
His daughter is sick.

154
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:27,881
Does he not employ a governess?

155
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:31,281
Hmm. It's a class thing,
a genetic thing.

156
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,001
He puts his daughter's welfare
before business.

157
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:35,921
Even the business
of changing the world?

158
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,881
I thought
today was purely social.

159
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,081
Now that it's just you,
I suppose it will be.

160
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:47,921
You should know your brother
has altered my life.

161
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:52,481
The men here just bounce up
and down in their saddles

162
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:55,321
in a rising trot,
never even galloping.

163
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:58,001
Thomas is the man on the horse
on the vase.

164
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:00,961
That's why I put it out for you
to look at.

165
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:04,561
According to
recent interpretations,

166
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:08,241
the black rider on 18th Dynasty
vases is meant to signify

167
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,081
approaching death,

168
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:13,961
so, yes, I suppose
it resembles Thomas.

169
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,201
Tell me, why is he
so emotionally mutilated?

170
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:21,161
Oh. Because he's a character
in a novel, of course.

171
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,881
One of those novels
ladies like you like to read -

172
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,481
all about wild men.

173
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,641
Oh, I don't read novels,

174
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:30,281
I read only pornography
and politics.

175
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:33,361
In the absence of the men,

176
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:35,961
shouldn't we ladies
be engaging in small talk?

177
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:37,761
Very well.

178
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,921
Small talk.

179
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:54,681
You know I like to fuck women
as well as men?

180
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,601
Mmm, Tommy was right.

181
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:01,441
He says that
everything is a circle.

182
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:03,081
A lady in Eaton Square,

183
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:06,081
as coarse and honest
as an Aston whore.

184
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:08,601
I just realised I haven't
even offered you a drink.

185
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:17,441
Ada...

186
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:20,281
Before the dreary business
of changing the world begins,

187
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:21,801
I want you to know something.

188
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:26,161
When the time comes
for the great cleansing,

189
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:28,361
I myself will personally
argue the case

190
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:30,401
that the Jews
must be dealt with,

191
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:32,361
but that the Gypsies
should be spared.

192
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:33,841
Huh.

193
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,841
Let's drink whisky
and wait for the American.

194
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,561
- Huh.

195
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:29,121
Who the fuck are you?!

196
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:36,121
I am the owner
of this Colt pistol

197
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:38,521
and the bullets within it.

198
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:40,401
And I'm in a hurry.

199
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:44,761
I followed the patrin signs
for the Lee family.

200
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,601
I'm looking
for Esme Shelby-Lee.

201
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,641
Never heard of her.

202
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:01,601
Esme's husband
was a fucking dirty didicoy.

203
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:04,641
- He was a Peaky Blinder.
- Yeah?

204
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:07,481
Well, I'm the elder
and more terrible.

205
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:09,081
And as I said, I'm in a hurry.

206
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,281
Where is she?

207
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,601
Put your gun away, Thomas.
There's children around.

208
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:44,921
You only found me
cos I let you find me.

209
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,041
I heard you were looking,
and I'm curious.

210
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:53,561
If any of these men
is your man,

211
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,841
please tell him
I want no trouble.

212
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,121
I don't have a man.

213
00:15:58,241 --> 00:15:59,921
What use is a man?

214
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,121
Horse pulls the wagon.

215
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,441
Dog keeps me safe.

216
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,241
Cat keeps me warm at night.

217
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,801
And if anybody's going to give
you trouble, Tommy Shelby,

218
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,121
it'll be me.

219
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:14,961
What d'you want?

220
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:18,921
Tell 'em to leave.

221
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,641
What, you think <i>I'm</i> in charge
here?

222
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:23,321
Oh, I'm sure of it, Esme.

223
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:54,841
Didicoy's too grand to put his
arse on the grass these days?

224
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:03,801
I have a daughter, Esme.

225
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,641
Her name is Ruby.

226
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:07,601
She's fallen ill suddenly.

227
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:09,361
She's very sick.

228
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:13,201
And I can tell...

229
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:16,481
...by saying her name
and looking in your eyes...

230
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:19,001
...that I have wasted petrol,
time and hope.

231
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,921
Wasted petrol on what?

232
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:25,521
Ah...

233
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:29,681
Tommy Shelby OBE MP...

234
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:31,441
...running around
the mountains

235
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:34,201
in pursuit of a Gypsy curse,
is that it?

236
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:37,641
I thought you had
Polly deal with the spirits.

237
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:38,881
Polly is dead.

238
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:43,801
Bullet or blade?

239
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:46,441
Still speaks to me
in my dreams.

240
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:50,321
It was her who told me
come find you.

241
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:53,921
Polly...

242
00:17:57,521 --> 00:18:00,001
That name like the ringing
of the school bell.

243
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,601
"Come and do as you're told."

244
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:04,201
Fuck!

245
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:07,401
I am so glad I'm not
in your camp any more.

246
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,281
Made of bricks and bars.

247
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:13,961
My daughter is dying, Esme.

248
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:16,361
Some people go to France,
to Lourdes.

249
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:18,081
I hear they sell trinkets.

250
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:19,841
I need more than
fucking trinkets.

251
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:25,961
I can tell from your reaction
this is not your doing.

252
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:28,081
Sorry for troubling you.

253
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:50,161
The butler says our American
friend is parking the car.

254
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:52,761
He also says, in answer
to your inquiry, Diana,

255
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,521
that the coat our exotic friend
is wearing is made by Chanel.

256
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,961
That's a very expensive label.

257
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,201
Yes, it is.

258
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:04,721
But the perfume I can smell
on you is very cheap.

259
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:14,841
I am deeply, deeply annoyed
that Thomas isn't here.

260
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,641
It is a family
emergency, apparently.

261
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,681
We only have Ada. The sister.

262
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:25,321
Well, would the sister
like some more champagne?

263
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:26,881
Oh, the sister is allowed
to speak?

264
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,321
She thinks this lunch
is purely social.

265
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:33,401
The sister is here because
there's sickness in the family.

266
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:35,681
Thomas wanted someone
from the Shelby organisation

267
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,521
to introduce Mr Nelson to you

268
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:40,201
and to offer all three of you
an invitation.

269
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:41,921
Ooh.

270
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,681
What invitation?

271
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,561
The invitation can wait.

272
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,601
And please remember that,
in this moment, in this room,

273
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,081
it is the Shelby family
that holds the power,

274
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:53,801
because we have the information
and the incentives

275
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:57,721
that will make Mr Nelson
do what you require him to do.

276
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,401
So when I speak, please keep
your fucking mouths closed,

277
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:02,041
because,
although I'm reluctant,

278
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,521
I am actually quite good
at this.

279
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:06,321
And yes, I will have champagne.

280
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,841
- Ah.
- Take care of this.

281
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:17,281
OK, so before
these dull introductions begin,

282
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,401
I just have to tell you
something that my niece Gina

283
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:21,761
- just told me.
- Jack.

284
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:24,321
She said the Shelby family
are all witches and sorcerers

285
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:26,001
who speak freely with the dead.

286
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:28,961
So...who here's a Shelby?

287
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:33,681
- Is it true?

288
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,681
Hmm. Gina.

289
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,881
Hello, Ada.

290
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,161
Michael sends his regards.

291
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,921
You're the sister.

292
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,361
Yes, it seems I am indeed
the sister.

293
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:48,441
I did some research.
You were a communist once,

294
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,121
but diamonds and lipstick now.

295
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:51,801
Actually, I'm a socialist.

296
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:55,201
She's Mr Shelby's
political adviser.

297
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,201
And you, you're the future
Prime Minister of Great Britain

298
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:00,561
- and its dominions.
- Indeed I am.

299
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:03,241
And you, Lady Diana Mitford,

300
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:06,121
the talk of London with
her amphetamines and emeralds.

301
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,561
It's her sharp mind
that I'm in love with.

302
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:11,681
Men bore me.

303
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:14,161
Ada, do you have a man?

304
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:17,361
My husband died,
but of course we speak often.

305
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,481
Between
this sparkling conversation,

306
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:24,721
could I get a drink
of some kind?

307
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:27,681
So, this little kid Gina,
she runs out,

308
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,441
she marries a gangster,

309
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,481
and now here we all are.

310
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:33,961
Oh, Jack, please,
you're so blunt.

311
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:37,441
Yes, it's wonderful. A man who
is not careful with his words.

312
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:38,681
I'm not careful.

313
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:41,521
Just say it first, and then
clear up the broken glass

314
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:43,001
with my bare hands.

315
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:44,321
There you are.

316
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:46,961
I don't seem to have
a drink either.

317
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:51,361
Well, I have Scotch or Irish.

318
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:53,841
- Thomas drinks Irish.
- Where the hell is he?

319
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:55,361
Irish.

320
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,321
He's been unavoidably detained.

321
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,561
Nothing's unavoidable.

322
00:21:58,681 --> 00:21:59,881
His daughter is unwell.

323
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,561
- He doesn't have a wife?

324
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:09,001
You know, I did some research
on you too, Mr Nelson.

325
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,321
Ada here is the smart one

326
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:12,561
- of the family.
- I learnt

327
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,921
that when you were young,
you lost a brother and a sister

328
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,001
to consumption.

329
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:25,321
No ice?

330
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:29,561
Well, that same awful illness
has entered our family.

331
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,161
And, you see,
Thomas has very little faith

332
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:34,881
in current medical practices
regarding tuberculosis.

333
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,681
- Man, he has <i>that</i> right.
- He's gone off in search

334
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:39,481
of alternative approaches
to curing the disease,

335
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:42,081
experimental work that he hopes
will save the life

336
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:43,281
of his daughter.

337
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:44,961
In his shoes, I would do
the same thing.

338
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:47,641
Your brother intrigues me.

339
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:50,561
Yes, he often has that effect
on people.

340
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,081
Yes, and my future husband
has that effect on

341
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:58,041
20 million people in this
country who attend his rallies

342
00:22:58,161 --> 00:23:00,001
and listen to his broadcasts.

343
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:02,161
It's amazing...

344
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:05,441
...what English
upper-class women can do

345
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:08,801
with just skin, bone
and arrogance.

346
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:12,721
My brother sends his apologies
for not being here

347
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:16,481
and would like to invite all of
you to his home for a meeting,

348
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:19,001
a meeting where the real
business will be done,

349
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:22,241
and where you can meet
like minds from Ireland

350
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,281
who would also like to discuss
the future of Europe.

351
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:28,321
But, as you say,
this lunch is purely social.

352
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:32,161
And looking at my glass, I see
I still don't have champagne.

353
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:35,321
Michael told me
the sister had gone straight.

354
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:37,361
Yes, but her brother
is the sun.

355
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:39,881
The rest just orbit around him.

356
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,401
Gina tells me lots of things,

357
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:46,281
but I want to hear it from you,
Ada.

358
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:53,241
What exactly does
the Shelby Company Limited do?

359
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,841
Fuck!

360
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:36,041
You used to have eyes
in the back of your head.

361
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,841
How can you change so much
and not change at all?

362
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:43,161
I have other lines of enquiry.
Give me the spark plug.

363
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,521
Give me the...

364
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:46,161
Give me the fucking spark plug.

365
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:48,881
Give you the spark, give you
hope? Is that what you want?

366
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,841
Something you should see.

367
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,681
Someone dead.

368
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,601
Someone grieving.

369
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:05,521
Lot of hate against you.

370
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:12,561
You were wise to come to me,
Thomas.

371
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:16,001
Open the bonnet, would you?

372
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:18,841
What hate?

373
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:21,401
What hate? What grieving?

374
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:47,561
I can't explain where it is
you have to go,

375
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:48,881
so I'll take you there.

376
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:52,681
I hope the suspension's good.

377
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,241
We're going
to a wild old place.

378
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:12,361
Mrs Thorne,
Mr Shelby isn't here.

379
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:14,441
I know. I am.

380
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:16,041
Do you know where he's gone?

381
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:19,641
He's gone up a mountain
looking for a miracle.

382
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,681
No-one is allowed to go in
if he's not here.

383
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,401
Just bring me the keys.

384
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:25,921
All of the keys.

385
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:50,001
Do you want tea, Mrs Thorne?

386
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:52,001
Whisky.

387
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:55,041
Mr Shelby doesn't allow whisky
in the building any more.

388
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:57,521
Then have someone
go and fetch some.

389
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:03,801
Until Mr Shelby comes down off
his mountain, I'm in charge.

390
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,321
Yes, Mrs Thorne.

391
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,841
Fuck.

392
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,401
Mickey, I've got to go.
The boss's sister is here.

393
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:10,161
For the next five days,
I'm not the boss's sister,

394
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:11,641
I'm the boss.

395
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:13,321
Where is Arthur?

396
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,281
We locked him in the cash safe.

397
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:17,321
When he gets the yamps
really bad,

398
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:19,401
he tells us to lock him
in the safe,

399
00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:21,881
to stop him from slipping down
to Chinatown.

400
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:25,921
- What are the yamps?
- When you lose your head.

401
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,401
When you can't
control yourself.

402
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:29,681
Young people say it.

403
00:28:31,641 --> 00:28:34,681
Hmm. And Arthur gets the yamps
a lot?

404
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,441
A lot is twice a day.

405
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:38,681
Arthur gets them
three times a day.

406
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:42,001
It smells in here.

407
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:45,561
Arthur sleeps on the floor.
We lock him in at night.

408
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:47,001
On your feet.

409
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,041
Sit down.

410
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:59,361
Nice perfume.

411
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:05,961
Tommy likes you, Isiah.

412
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:08,521
I believe I'm suited
to this life.

413
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:10,681
I'm not so sure about you.

414
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,841
I was given to understand

415
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,441
that you are no longer part
of the company.

416
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:19,281
Hmm.

417
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:21,081
You speak well.

418
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:23,521
I was going to be an accountant

419
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:26,601
but everybody said I'd be
wasted counting money...

420
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:28,361
...instead of stealing it.

421
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:33,161
What's the name
of that perfume?

422
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:34,921
I've got a girlfriend
with a birthday.

423
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:38,801
I want you to go to Liverpool.

424
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:41,161
Then I will go to Liverpool.

425
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:44,361
We have opium in storage
at the Salthouse Docks.

426
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:46,601
Word got out
among the dock workers.

427
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:49,681
They started stealing cupfuls.
Now it's by the bucket.

428
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,721
By the bucket?

429
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:54,121
The audacity of it.

430
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:58,561
The sale of the stolen opium
is being organised

431
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:01,961
by a union convenor
called Hayden Stagg.

432
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,681
In the envelope you'll find
details of where to find him

433
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:07,281
and what to do to him
when you do.

434
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:12,841
Is there a black star
in the envelope?

435
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,801
I decided not.

436
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:18,521
<i>You</i> decided?

437
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:20,481
The name of the perfume is

438
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:22,801
know your fucking place,
soldier.

439
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:25,961
- I decided

440
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:27,281
he'll just take a beating,

441
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:31,281
and, also, that you're
going to take Arthur with you.

442
00:30:31,401 --> 00:30:33,841
Arthur, ten days clean,

443
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,561
and we're gonna take him
into a warehouse

444
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:36,681
full of fucking opium?

445
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,001
It can be your job
to look after him.

446
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:40,601
Why take him at all?

447
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:43,081
It's his reputation
you're taking.

448
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:46,401
The beating can be conducted
in a civilised way.

449
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:48,921
No-one would dare fuck
with Arthur Shelby.

450
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,081
- But they would fuck with me?
- Yes.

451
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,921
He is Arthur Shelby.

452
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,681
You're Isiah...who?

453
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:03,161
I'm just Isiah...

454
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:06,161
...who is keen to learn, Ada.

455
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:08,841
Keep him clean.

456
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:13,441
Deal with Hayden Stagg.
Bring Arthur back in one piece.

457
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:15,881
And in return,
I won't tell Tommy

458
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,601
that you're laying private bets
on races that we've fixed.

459
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:23,881
Just trying to make
a few extra pennies,

460
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:26,721
buy that birthday present
for my girlfriend.

461
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:29,321
Mmm, lucky girl.

462
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,241
Lock the door, Lizzie.
There are people around here

463
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:21,801
who start drinking
this early in the morning.

464
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:29,121
No.

465
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:34,241
I need to stay myself...
be strong.

466
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:37,481
Now, come on, not with me.
You can let it go with me.

467
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:40,721
I can't cry, Ada.
If I start, I'll fall apart.

468
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:43,961
I need to stay strong for Ruby.

469
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:49,201
Tommy says
it's just in one lung.

470
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:52,601
No. They now think
it's in both.

471
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,801
It's...moving quickly.

472
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:59,361
They collapsed the left lung
but it made no difference.

473
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:03,041
They're starting her
on the gold salts tomorrow.

474
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:09,401
You know somebody who died
on the gold treatment, yes?

475
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,841
Half the people I tell look
like you just did,

476
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:15,201
because they know someone
who died on the gold treatment.

477
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:19,481
The person I knew was old.

478
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:22,281
Huh. Old and young, the same.

479
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:28,201
Have you given up, Lizzie?

480
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,361
No.

481
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:35,081
I'm...being strong...

482
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:38,361
...at her bedside...
on my own...

483
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:41,521
...while Tommy is up
in the mountains

484
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:43,321
to be amongst Gypsies.

485
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:46,561
In truth, it's a blessing

486
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:48,801
he's not around
at the hospital,

487
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:51,321
because all he wants to do
is fight people

488
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:53,081
and blame himself,

489
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:54,921
and I've never felt
so ashamed of him,

490
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:58,321
Christ, because right now I...
I need a normal man.

491
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:03,801
It's me sitting there,
taking away the bloody rags

492
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:05,601
and watching her disappear.

493
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:29,921
Do you know when he's back,
Ada?

494
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,841
He gave me instructions,
not information.

495
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:40,121
Can you get a message to him?

496
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:42,721
He'll be out of reach.

497
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:45,841
Ada, I thought you might
know things.

498
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:49,321
I've been away from all this.

499
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:52,121
You're still Gypsy.

500
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:55,201
Yeah, well...
The mystery leaves you.

501
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,321
What mystery?

502
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:00,761
Lizzie, is there anything
practical that I can do?

503
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:08,281
Before he left, he was looking
for a number for Esme.

504
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:11,521
What's Esme got to do
with this?

505
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:13,601
I thought you might know.

506
00:35:15,121 --> 00:35:17,361
Esme's a Lee.

507
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:19,521
What does that mean?

508
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:22,601
The Lees and the Barwells,
they're wild tribes.

509
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:26,001
Where do they live?

510
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:28,281
They're Gypsies.
They live where they like.

511
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:30,161
- Fuck.

512
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:32,241
- Fuck, Ada.

513
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,641
Tribes in the mountains!

514
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:43,081
It's 1934, and the doctors
know what it is,

515
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:44,561
they know what causes it,

516
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:46,601
but, oh, no, my husband,
he knows better.

517
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:48,761
Not a normal man, your brother.

518
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,481
He's up in the mountains
with...

519
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:53,201
...fucking horse thieves
and sorcerers

520
00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:55,001
while I'm here on my own.

521
00:35:57,081 --> 00:35:58,801
Not a normal man.

522
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:51,401
It's OK, Arthur.
I'll look after you.

523
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:54,321
Yeah.

524
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:57,441
And Ada said it'd be OK
if I recruited my cousins -

525
00:36:57,561 --> 00:37:00,961
off the streets of Alum Rock
and looking for the big time.

526
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,521
What do you say, Arthur?

527
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:23,681
I say big-time boys
don't ask for permission.

528
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:27,761
I think he means you're in.

529
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:29,321
Let's go.

530
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,281
Can you still ride bareback?

531
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,081
We're a long way from anywhere,
Esme.

532
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:01,561
If I find out
you've been wasting my time,

533
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:03,881
I'll use that rope
to fucking hang you.

534
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:24,761
Right, hold up,
Hold on, hold on.

535
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:27,561
Listen, you know
what you've got to do, right?

536
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:30,561
You've got your orders.
I'm depending on you.

537
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:32,081
Do you hear me?

538
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:33,961
Let me tell you something.

539
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:39,321
Any man, any fucking man
who looked like this before...

540
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:43,321
...they're Peaky Blinder.

541
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:45,881
Peaky Blinder
still looks like this...

542
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:48,841
...after.

543
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:20,601
We are here to meet a gentleman
called Hayden Stagg.

544
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:23,521
A gentleman?

545
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:26,801
Mr Stagg?

546
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,321
That scoundrel.

547
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,761
Never there when you need him.

548
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:39,761
Who needs him?

549
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:41,121
We do.

550
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:43,921
Where is he?

551
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:48,321
The last I saw, he was...

552
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:50,841
...up to his balls in a lady
called Maria.

553
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,841
We have no time for tradition

554
00:40:56,961 --> 00:40:58,921
or the rules of
the sporting life,

555
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,641
because, among
the Peaky Blinders,

556
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:05,761
any man who comes home from
a mission with all his bullets,

557
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,721
he pays a fine.

558
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:11,401
My name's Hayden Stagg.

559
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:14,241
I hear there's some men here
from Birmingham looking for me.

560
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:18,881
I was in the banana warehouse
playing football with the boys.

561
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:30,761
But I'm guessing you gentlemen
aren't here to kick footballs.

562
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,561
No.

563
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:36,441
We're here
about other business.

564
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,001
We like to call it
Black Star business.

565
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:42,201
The Black Star a pub, is it?

566
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:46,641
Yeah. The Black Star's a pub.

567
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:51,361
The last pub
you ever fucking drink in.

568
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:53,441
Peaky Blinders
take you to the Black Star...

569
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,401
...and all your troubles
are done.

570
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:00,481
But the pub <i>you</i> drink in,
Mr Stagg...

571
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:04,321
...is called the Dolphin,
right?

572
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:07,161
Every night...you're in there.

573
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,321
Not to drink.

574
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:14,441
You're there divvying up
the day's takings, ain't ya?

575
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,681
And there's a woman there.

576
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:24,081
She sings out,
"Opium for sale!"

577
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:30,001
Sit down, boys.

578
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,481
The rules say the king
puts his head on the block

579
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:38,041
when the game's up.

580
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:42,681
You're stealing from
the Shelby Company Limited.

581
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:46,881
You're stealing from
the Peaky Blinders, man.

582
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:51,761
Therefore...

583
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:55,801
...punishment...

584
00:42:57,281 --> 00:43:00,001
...is a visit
to the Black Star pub.

585
00:43:01,841 --> 00:43:03,281
Hmm.

586
00:43:05,881 --> 00:43:08,681
But...out of kindness...

587
00:43:10,441 --> 00:43:12,041
...of my heart...

588
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:15,281
...your sentence
has been commuted.

589
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:19,001
Praise the fucking Lord!

590
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:22,161
And our lovely Ada, eh?

591
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:27,561
Instead...

592
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:32,041
...instead, Mr Hayden Stagg,
it's just a beating for you.

593
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:36,921
Well, before
I take this beating...

594
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:40,961
Arthur Shelby, is it, yeah?

595
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:47,281
Well, comrade, beneath
your sleeves lies the truth.

596
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:49,041
The marks on your arm.

597
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:51,361
Yeah.

598
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:54,001
Stories about you
come up the canal.

599
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:57,041
You know, where once
you walked fine alone,

600
00:43:57,161 --> 00:43:59,081
now you need a stick.

601
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:01,081
Let's just fucking do it,
Arthur.

602
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:05,961
For me, it was the morphine
they gave us in France.

603
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:07,761
I got a taste for it, Arthur.

604
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:13,361
It was 1924 before I realised
the fucking war was over.

605
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:18,561
There's a warehouse full of it
just across the yard, there,

606
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:20,841
where the boys play football.

607
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:23,721
And they steal it
and roll around laughing,

608
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,721
and it floats in the air.

609
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:31,201
But I'm strong, comrade.

610
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:33,561
Arthur, let's just
fucking do it.

611
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:36,721
Liar.

612
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,681
It's me that's due a beating,

613
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,961
but it's me who feels sorry
for <i>you,</i> Mr Shelby,

614
00:44:42,081 --> 00:44:46,401
because you take your beating
every hour of every day.

615
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:50,641
Your own blood betrays you,
because it demands dilution.

616
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:55,161
Sometimes you want
to cut a doorway in your arm

617
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:58,441
so your blood can escape
and leave you in blessed peace.

618
00:44:58,561 --> 00:44:59,721
Yeah.

619
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:02,921
Fuck you, man.

620
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:05,401
I was once where you are now,
Arthur.

621
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:11,361
If you're going to do it,
do it.

622
00:45:11,481 --> 00:45:14,441
But look at me
as the man you can be.

623
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:19,481
You've tried Jesus, yeah?

624
00:45:19,601 --> 00:45:22,761
Yeah, he looked you up and down
and he shook his head.

625
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:24,241
Your loved ones?

626
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:28,241
Your wife, your kids?

627
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:36,921
Jesus and your wife
and your kids can't help you.

628
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:42,041
Only you, Arthur Shelby.

629
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,401
Only you.

630
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:47,401
Don't count the days.

631
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:49,201
Futile.

632
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:51,081
You get to 100,
and then you wake up

633
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:52,761
and it's fucking one again.

634
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:58,241
Don't build mountains.

635
00:45:58,361 --> 00:46:01,081
- Walk like it's a flat plain.

636
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:05,881
Easy step...by easy step.

637
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:09,521
Arthur, just give me

638
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,761
the fucking word!
I'll fucking do it!

639
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:18,041
Use your stick, Arthur.
Give him the order.

640
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:26,841
Arthur, I'm not gonna
ask you fucking twice!

641
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:29,681
- Isiah, leave him alone.
- No... No fucking way.

642
00:46:31,161 --> 00:46:33,521
Isiah, I said
you can stand down!

643
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:51,921
Be off. Let's go. Come on.

644
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,681
Come on, all of ya! Go on.

645
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:56,041
Go on!

646
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:34,201
Gypsy graveyard?

647
00:47:34,321 --> 00:47:36,081
You can still read the signs?

648
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:40,241
No horse will go beyond here.
We'll have to walk.

649
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,841
Just tell me whose grave it is.

650
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:51,681
You'll see.

651
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:53,801
Who knows what you'll see?

652
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:58,201
Do you ever go to John's grave?

653
00:47:58,321 --> 00:47:59,881
When things are really bad.

654
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:01,841
When what's really bad?

655
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:03,921
I've done bad things, Esme.

656
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:07,721
And you think now you're being
punished for them?

657
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:09,601
I would like to make amends.

658
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:12,401
You want to lift every curse
anyone's ever put on you?

659
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:14,241
That's a lot of lifting.

660
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:16,121
My own curse is in there
somewhere.

661
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:17,881
I should have done more
to protect John.

662
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:19,081
You think in this holy place

663
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:21,161
the spirits are listening
to you being kind?

664
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:24,241
Believe it or not, Esme,
I'm discovering kindness.

665
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:26,441
I'm learning it
from my children.

666
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:29,921
Do you ever think
you've lost your mind, Thomas?

667
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:33,761
Lost it long ago. I only use
the crate it came in.

668
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:37,161
- I know why you're here.
- I'm in a hurry, Esme.

669
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,441
You think you can make a deal
even with death?

670
00:48:39,561 --> 00:48:42,241
Well, soon you'll be
in the right place to do it.

671
00:48:42,361 --> 00:48:44,801
The village disappeared.
Church fell down.

672
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,841
Only us still use
the graveyard.

673
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,321
Do you recall a sapphire?

674
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:55,161
You gave a sapphire to
a woman called Bethany Barwell.

675
00:48:55,281 --> 00:48:56,761
Ten years ago.

676
00:48:56,881 --> 00:48:58,761
She took the stone back
to her camp.

677
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:01,481
I warned her about it,
but she took it anyway.

678
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:04,161
She gave the sapphire
to her sister.

679
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:05,961
Evadne Barwell.

680
00:49:06,081 --> 00:49:08,841
Evadne put the stone around
the neck of her daughter.

681
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:10,361
A little girl.

682
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:14,841
Straight away, the little girl
began to cough.

683
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:18,561
She died that night.

684
00:49:18,681 --> 00:49:19,961
Seven years old.

685
00:49:27,321 --> 00:49:30,401
I heard they threw the sapphire
in the river.

686
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:32,841
No-one's ever gone
to look for it.

687
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,721
I'm guessing
it'll be the girl's mother

688
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,361
who laid the curse.

689
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:40,601
Only women can lay curses.

690
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:44,601
Perhaps she waited till
your little girl was seven,

691
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:47,081
so you'd know how it feels.

692
00:49:58,401 --> 00:50:00,281
- Do you have whisky?
- No.

693
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,481
Tommy!

694
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:21,641
Perhaps the treatment will work
and your daughter will live.

695
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:26,081
It's science.

696
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:28,601
Science is winning everything
these days.

697
00:50:28,721 --> 00:50:30,961
Even against the angels.

698
00:50:35,881 --> 00:50:38,401
I can leave you, if you want.

699
00:50:38,521 --> 00:50:41,041
Your horse'll know
its way back.

700
00:50:41,161 --> 00:50:43,201
But I think there should be
some reward

701
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:46,081
for what I have shown you,
some consideration.

702
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:48,801
You can afford it,
Mr Shelby OBE.

703
00:50:50,161 --> 00:50:51,681
I will find her.

704
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:53,921
I will find this fucking
Evadne Barwell,

705
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:55,481
I will fucking find her,

706
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:57,601
and I will give her money
to take back this curse!

707
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,841
You only found me
because I wanted to be found.

708
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:01,961
And the Barwells roam
from the border to the sea.

709
00:51:02,081 --> 00:51:04,161
I will give her £10,000.
More. Anything!

710
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:05,401
You will put out word, Esme.

711
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:07,201
You will put out word.
I will put out word,

712
00:51:07,321 --> 00:51:08,841
and I will find her!
And instead

713
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:10,801
- of this poor wooden cross...
- Tommy!

714
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:13,681
...I will build a monument
to this little girl!

715
00:51:13,801 --> 00:51:15,161
Her mother can decide how big.

716
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,961
It can be as big as
fucking Nelson's Column.

717
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:20,801
That, and £10,000!

718
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:23,721
I will buy her off.
I will start looking today.

719
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:25,081
Ruby will be well!

720
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:28,201
She will be well!

721
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:31,321
And I will undo the many wrongs
that I have done!

722
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:34,001
Now that I'm without whisky,
I can hear the spirits clearly,

723
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:36,441
and they're saying that Ruby
will be well if I make amends.

724
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:37,801
That is the conversation!

725
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:39,361
If you want my help,
I will help you, Thomas,

726
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:42,841
if you also pay me. Pay me and
I will help you to find her.

727
00:51:42,961 --> 00:51:44,961
- I will pay you.
- But I don't want money.

728
00:51:45,081 --> 00:51:47,521
I don't read the papers,
but I know there was a crash,

729
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:49,801
and nothing is certain,
and money loses value.

730
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:52,441
Instead of money, give me gold.

731
00:51:52,561 --> 00:51:54,041
- Gold. Yes.

732
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:55,361
I will give you gold.

733
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:57,681
In uncertain times,
gold is always certain.

734
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:01,801
I will give you gold. And you
will help me find this woman.

735
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:04,441
And she will spare my daughter.

736
00:52:23,521 --> 00:52:25,401
- Lizzie!
- Where the fuck were you?!

737
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:30,121
Where were you?
Where the fuck were you?!

738
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:37,481
She's gone, Tommy.

739
00:52:41,081 --> 00:52:42,641
She's gone.

740
00:52:44,401 --> 00:52:46,281
Just now. 5.17.

741
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:54,681
You weren't fucking here...
were you?

742
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:57,401
Were you?

743
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:10,521
It was before then,
and she was here,

744
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:11,841
and then she was gone,

745
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:14,441
and now she's gone to
where they've put the dead.

746
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,961
They've put her
with the dead people.

747
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:31,521
She was asking, just now,
for you...

748
00:53:33,161 --> 00:53:34,161
...but went...

749
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:37,521
...at 5.17.

750
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:49,041
I told her that you loved...

751
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,961
I gave her your kiss goodbye.
