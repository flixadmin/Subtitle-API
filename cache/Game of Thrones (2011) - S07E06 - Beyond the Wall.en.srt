00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,570
- You all right?
- Mm.

5
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,779
Ever been north before?

6
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,445
Never seen snow before.

7
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:43,320
Beautiful, eh?

8
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,862
I can breathe again.

9
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:47,029
Down south, the air
smells like pig shit.

10
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,654
You've never been down south.

11
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:50,570
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

GENDRY: How do you live up here?

14
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:55,987
How do you keep your
balls from freezing off?

15
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:58,487
TORMUND: You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

16
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:02,529
Walking's good, fighting's
better, fucking's best.

17
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,987
There's not a living woman
within a hundred miles of here.

18
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:08,363
We have to make do with what we've got.

19
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:16,570
This one is maybe not so smart.

20
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,487
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

21
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:21,987
Good. That's more important
than being smart.

22
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:25,196
Smart people don't come up
here looking for the dead.

23
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:30,029
TORMUND: So, you met
this Dragon Queen, huh?

24
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,403
And?

25
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:34,779
She'll only fight beside
us if I bend the knee.

26
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,195
You spent too much time
with the Free Folk.

27
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,905
Now you don't like kneeling.

28
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:44,195
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

29
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:46,029
A proud man.

30
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,863
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

31
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:54,863
How many of his people
died for his pride?

32
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:10,195
You still mad at us, boy?

33
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:12,237
You sold me to a witch.

34
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,654
A priestess.

35
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:16,570
I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

36
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,737
We're fighting a great war.
Wars cost money.

37
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,612
I wanted to be one of you.

38
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:24,654
I wanted to join the
Brotherhood, but you sold me off

39
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,612
like a slave.

40
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,612
Do you know what she did to me?

41
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,195
She strapped me down on a bed,

42
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:33,029
- she stripped me naked...
- Sounds all right so far.

43
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,779
- and put leeches on me.
- Was she naked, too?

44
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,237
She needed your blood.

45
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:38,904
Yes, thank you. I know that.

46
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:41,862
- Could have been worse.
- She wanted to kill me!

47
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:43,898
They would have killed
me if wasn't for Davos.

48
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:45,863
But they didn't, did they?

49
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,779
So, what you whinging about?

50
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,445
I'm not whinging.

51
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:52,403
Your lips are moving and you're
complaining about something.

52
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:54,445
That's whinging.

53
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:56,237
This one's been killed six times.

54
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:57,947
You don't hear him bitching about it.

55
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,571
Good lad.

56
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,779
JON: The first time I went north
of the Wall was with your father.

57
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,403
He was a good man.

58
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:22,529
He deserved a better son.

59
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,570
Were you with him at the end?

60
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:27,654
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

61
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,654
But we avenged him.

62
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:31,153
I want you to know that.

63
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:34,153
Every mutineer found justice.

64
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:36,987
Can't think of a worse
way for him to go.

65
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:38,487
The Night's Watch was his life.

66
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:41,320
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

67
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,779
And they butchered him.

68
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,987
I hate that he died that way.

69
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,654
My father was the most
honorable man I ever met.

70
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:51,445
He was good all the way through.

71
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:54,695
And he died on the executioner's block.

72
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:58,862
Your father wanted to
execute me, you know?

73
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:00,403
I heard.

74
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:02,695
He was in the right, of course.

75
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,195
Didn't make me hate him any less.

76
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:08,196
- I'm glad he didn't catch you.
- Me, too.

77
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:18,445
Your father gave me this sword.

78
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:21,988
Changed the pommel from
a bear to a wolf...

79
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:27,238
but it's still Longclaw.

80
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,529
Lord Commander Mormont

81
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,154
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

82
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:42,029
But you are back,

83
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,987
and it's been in your
family for centuries.

84
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,780
It's not right for me to have it.

85
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:53,362
He gave it to you.

86
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,571
I'm not his son.

87
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,738
I brought shame onto my house.

88
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:07,446
I broke my father's heart.

89
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:12,738
I forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

90
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:16,570
It's yours.

91
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,696
May it serve you well...

92
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,738
and your children after you.

(CHATTER)

95
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:50,445
Father used to watch us from up here.

96
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:52,946
He wouldn't say much.

97
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:54,320
You probably don't remember.

98
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,321
You were inside knitting all the time.

99
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,072
I remember.

100
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:04,154
One time, the boys were shooting
arrows with Ser Rodrik.

101
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,779
I came out here after,

102
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,029
and Bran had left his bow behind,

103
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,654
just lying on the ground.

104
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:15,030
Ser Rodrik would have
cuffed him if he saw.

105
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,612
There was one arrow in the target.

106
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:24,278
There was no one around, just like now.

107
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,154
No one to stop me.

108
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:29,779
So I started shooting.

109
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,153
And every shot, I had to go up there

110
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:35,446
and get my one arrow and walk
back and shoot it again.

111
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:38,696
I wasn't very good.

112
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,237
Finally, I hit the bull's-eye.

113
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:45,654
Could have been the
20th shot or the 50th.

114
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,112
I don't remember.

115
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:50,530
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this.

116
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:54,445
I looked up,

117
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:56,195
and he's standing right here,

118
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:57,863
smiling down at me.

119
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:03,445
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

120
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:07,862
But he was smiling, so I
knew it wasn't wrong.

121
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,404
The rules were wrong.

122
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,072
I was doing what I was meant
to be doing, and he knew it.

123
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,696
Now he's dead.

124
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,445
Killed by the Lannisters

125
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:24,072
with your help.

126
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:29,138
What?

127
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:40,946
That's your pretty handwriting.

128
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,779
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles

129
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,530
'cause I couldn't write as well as you.

130
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:50,570
"Robb, I write to you
today with heavy heart.

131
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:52,737
Our good King Robert is dead,

132
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:54,570
killed from wounds he
took in a boar hunt."

133
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:56,071
You don't have to read it. I remember.

134
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,779
"Father has been charged with treason.

135
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,737
He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

136
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:02,570
and tried to steal his throne.

137
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:04,403
The Lannisters are treating me well

138
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,403
and providing me with every comfort.

139
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,737
I beg you, come to King's Landing,

140
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,612
swear fealty to King Joffrey,

141
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,821
and prevent any strife
between the great houses

142
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,612
of Lannister and Stark.

143
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,821
Your faithful sister, Sansa."

144
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,237
They forced me to do it.

145
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,403
Did they?

146
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:22,695
With a knife at your throat?

147
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:24,153
Did they put you on a
rack and stretch you

148
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,862
until your bones started to pop?

149
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:27,779
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

150
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,612
So was I. I would have let them kill
me before I betrayed my family.

151
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:34,445
They told me it was the
only way to save Father.

152
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:36,988
And you were stupid
enough to believe them.

153
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,946
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

154
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:43,654
when they dragged Father to the block.

155
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,278
I remember the pretty
dress you were wearing.

156
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,655
I remember the fancy
way you did your hair.

157
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:50,612
You were there?

158
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:51,904
I was there.

159
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:54,779
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

160
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,570
And what did you do?

161
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:58,987
Did you come running to the rescue?

162
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:01,779
Did you fight off the
Lannisters and save Father?

163
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,403
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't, just like me.

164
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:06,987
I didn't betray him. I
didn't betray Robb.

165
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:10,655
I didn't betray our entire
family for my beloved Joffrey.

166
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:15,987
You should be on your
knees, thanking me.

167
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:19,862
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

168
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,071
You didn't win it back,
Jon didn't win it back.

169
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:24,153
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

170
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:25,904
The Knights of the Vale won the battle,

171
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:27,529
and they rode north for me.

172
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,821
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

173
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:33,654
- I was training.
- Training.

174
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,529
Well, while you were training,

175
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,779
I suffered things you
could never imagine.

176
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,404
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

177
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:46,153
You never would have
survived what I survived.

178
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,738
I guess we'll never know.

179
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:54,696
What are you going to
do with that letter?

180
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:57,655
I don't know yet.

181
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,987
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

182
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,071
You're scared, aren't you?

183
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:06,195
What are you scared of?

184
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:08,195
You didn't commit any crimes.

185
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:10,029
- No one's going to hang you.
- Well, Arya...

186
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,487
You're scared I'll show it
to Jon and he'll be angry.

187
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:15,862
No, that's not Jon. He'll understand.

188
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:17,821
You were just a scared little girl,

189
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:20,029
all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

190
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,904
Do you know how happy Cersei would
be right now if she saw us fighting?

191
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:25,904
This is exactly what she wants.

192
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,987
This is what she's always
wanted... to tear us apart.

193
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:30,571
You're scared the Northern
lords will read it.

194
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,779
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

195
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,779
if they knew how she
did Cersei's bidding.

196
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,779
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

197
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,946
She's younger than you
were when you wrote this.

198
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:45,446
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child?"

199
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:50,029
You're angry.

200
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,237
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

201
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:55,863
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

202
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:59,738
I'll go with anger.

203
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:32,654
You're the one they call "the Dog."

204
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:34,487
- Fuck off.
- (CHUCKLES)

205
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,278
They told me you were mean.

206
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,695
Were you born mean or
you just hate wildings?

207
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:41,071
I don't give two shits about wildings.

208
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:42,779
It's gingers I hate.

209
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,654
Gingers are beautiful.

210
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:48,237
We are kissed by fire, just like you.

211
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:51,154
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

212
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:58,529
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

213
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,278
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

214
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,195
And ever since, you've been mean.

215
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:03,821
Will you fuck off?

216
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,779
I don't think you're truly mean.

217
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,321
You have sad eyes.

218
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,320
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

219
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:13,029
- Dick?
- Cock.

220
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,029
Ah, dick.

221
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,320
I like it.

222
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,362
I bet you do.

223
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:20,987
Nope, it's pussy for me.

224
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:23,987
I have a beauty waiting for
me back at Winterfell.

225
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,112
If I ever get back there.

226
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:28,862
Yellow hair, blue eyes,

227
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,071
the tallest woman you've ever seen.

228
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:32,530
Almost as tall as you.

229
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:36,862
- Brienne of Tarth.
- You know her?

230
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:39,195
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

231
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:41,570
Well, not with her yet.

232
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:45,195
- But I see the way she looks at me.
- How does she look at you?

233
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:47,654
Like she wants to carve you
up and eat your liver?

234
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,403
You do know her.

235
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:50,862
We've met.

236
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:52,987
I want to make babies with her.

237
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,987
Think of them... great big monsters.

238
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:57,570
They'd conquer the world.

239
00:14:57,571 --> 00:15:01,153
How did a mad fucker
like you live this long?

240
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,905
I'm good at killing people.

241
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,445
You don't look much like him.

242
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:08,904
Who's that?

243
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:10,946
Your father.

244
00:15:10,947 --> 00:15:13,029
I suppose you favor your mother.

245
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,403
You knew him?

246
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:17,195
'Course I did.

247
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:18,779
When he was Hand,

248
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,153
he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

249
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,612
Your wildling friend told me

250
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,904
the red woman brought you back.

251
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:29,071
Thoros has brought me back six times.

252
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:32,153
We both serve the same lord.

253
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:34,071
I serve the North.

254
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:36,112
The North didn't raise
you from the dead.

255
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:38,112
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

256
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,487
I don't know anything about him.

257
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,112
I don't know what he wants from me.

258
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:44,487
- He wants you alive.
- Why?

259
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,904
I don't know.

260
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,278
That's all anyone can
tell me... "I don't know."

261
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,112
So, what's the point in serving a god

262
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:54,612
if none of us knows what he wants?

263
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:57,320
I think about that all the time.

264
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:00,403
I don't think it's our
purpose to understand.

265
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:03,779
Except one thing... we're soldiers.

266
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,445
We have to know what we're fighting for.

267
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:09,654
I'm not fighting so some
man or woman I barely know

268
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:12,695
can sit on a throne made of swords.

269
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:15,112
So, what are you fighting for?

270
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:16,513
Life.

271
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,612
Death is the enemy.

272
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,905
The first enemy and the last.

273
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:26,138
But we all die.

274
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:30,153
The enemy always wins.

275
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,403
And we still need to fight him.

276
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:34,362
That's all I know.

277
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:37,821
You and I won't find much
joy while we're here,

278
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:40,071
but we can keep others alive.

279
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:42,863
We can defend those who
can't defend themselves.

280
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:49,071
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

281
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:52,904
Maybe we don't need to
understand any more than that.

282
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,112
Maybe that's enough.

283
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,513
Aye.

284
00:16:58,072 --> 00:16:59,822
Maybe that's enough.

285
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:10,196
That's what I saw in the fire.

286
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,404
A mountain like an arrowhead.

287
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,738
THOROS: Are you sure?

288
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,196
We're getting close.

289
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,196
DAENERYS: Do you know
what I like about you?

290
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:36,695
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

291
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:38,237
Oh.

292
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:41,029
Well, I've been heroic on occasion.

293
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,821
I once charged through the Mud
Gate of King's Landing and...

294
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:45,612
I don't want you to be a hero.

295
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:48,904
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

296
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:50,946
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

297
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:54,237
even this... Jon Snow...

298
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,904
they all try to outdo each other.

299
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:59,071
Who can do the stupidest, bravest thing.

300
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:02,071
It's interesting, these heroes you name.

301
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,278
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

302
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,195
even this... Jon Snow.

303
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,320
They all fell in love with you.

304
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,278
- Jon Snow's not in love with me.
- Oh, my mistake.

305
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,987
I suppose he stares at you longingly

306
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:16,905
because he's hopeful for a
successful military alliance.

307
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:22,862
He's too little for me.

308
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:24,695
I didn't mean...

309
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:27,862
As heroes go, he is quite little.

310
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:30,278
I know you're brave.

311
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,238
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

312
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,153
So, if all goes well,

313
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:42,446
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

314
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,779
From everything you've
told me about her,

315
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,112
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

316
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:51,946
Oh, first, she'd torture
you in some horrible way,

317
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,347
then she'd murder you.

318
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:57,987
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

319
00:18:57,988 --> 00:18:59,779
But if we go to the capital,

320
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,612
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

321
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:06,362
Anyone touches you, King's Landing
burns down to the foundation stones.

322
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,403
And right now, she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

323
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:09,987
Of course she is.

324
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:12,278
And she's wondering what
trap you're laying for her.

325
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,737
Are we?

326
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:15,905
Laying any traps?

327
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:21,237
If we want to create a
new and better world,

328
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:24,362
I'm not sure deceit and mass
murder is the best way to start.

329
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,154
Which war was won without
deceit and mass murder?

330
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:30,946
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless

331
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:32,821
if you're going to win the throne.

332
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,862
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

333
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:37,237
But fear is all Cersei has.

334
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:40,071
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

335
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:41,987
It makes their power brittle

336
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:45,779
because everyone beneath
them longs to see them dead.

337
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,320
Aegon Targaryen got quite
a long way on fear.

338
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,987
He did.

339
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,612
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

340
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:54,071
Aegon built a wheel.

341
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:56,278
If that's the kind of
queen you want to be,

342
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,862
how are you different from all the
other tyrants that came before you?

343
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:02,278
So we walk into the lions' den.

344
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,946
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip

345
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:05,570
on the Lannister forces.

346
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,445
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

347
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:10,737
Except yours.

348
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:12,862
And I promised him

349
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:15,404
I'd keep you from doing
anything impulsive.

350
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:18,222
Impulsive?

351
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:24,445
This will be a difficult negotiation.

352
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:27,987
We're sitting down with people who
want to see us both headless.

353
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:30,487
My sister is likely to say
something provocative.

354
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:33,029
- And?
- And you have been known

355
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,195
to lose your temper from time to time,

356
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:36,529
as all great leaders do.

357
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,946
When have I lost my temper?

358
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,487
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

359
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,029
That was not impulsive.

360
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,862
That was necessary.

361
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:47,779
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

362
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,362
Perhaps the father needed
to die and not the son.

363
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:54,071
Perhaps they both needed time
to contemplate their mistakes

364
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:56,362
in the solitude of a cold cell.

365
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:58,779
We had no time to discuss
the possibilities

366
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,821
before you ended their possibilities.

367
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:02,529
One could be forgiven for
thinking you're taking

368
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,362
your family's side in this debate.

369
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,195
I am taking their side.

370
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:07,904
You need to take your enemy's side

371
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:09,904
if you're going to see
things the way they do.

372
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,862
And you need to see
things the way they do

373
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,904
if you're going to
anticipate their actions,

374
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,237
respond effectively, and beat them.

375
00:21:17,238 --> 00:21:19,570
Which I want you to do very much.

376
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:23,071
Because I believe in you and in
the world you want to build.

377
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,737
But the world you want to build

378
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,320
doesn't get built all at once.

379
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,445
Probably not in a single lifetime.

380
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:33,278
How do we ensure that
your vision endures?

381
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,238
After you break the wheel, how
do we make sure it stays broken?

382
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,112
You want to know who sits on the
Iron Throne after I'm dead.

383
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,513
Is that it?

384
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:46,862
You say you can't have children,

385
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:50,153
but there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

386
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:52,278
The Night's Watch has one method.

387
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,654
The ironborn, for all their
many flaws, have another.

388
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:57,362
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

389
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:59,112
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows

390
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:01,445
fly towards you when you
fought on the Blackwater Rush,

391
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,529
and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

392
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,153
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended your...

393
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:09,320
You've been thinking about my
death quite a bit, haven't you?

394
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:10,904
Is this one of the items you discussed

395
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,612
with your brother in King's Landing?

396
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:15,071
I'm trying to serve you by
planning for the long term.

397
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,654
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

398
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,696
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

399
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,988
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

You're worried.

We're asking 20,000 men

436
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,946
to fight with us in the worst
winter any of them have ever seen.

Many of them will be happy to
find a good reason to go home.

00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,237
- You question their loyalty?
- Their loyalty is to Jon.

440
00:27:23,238 --> 00:27:25,862
Jon is not here. I haven't
heard from him in weeks.

441
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:27,904
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

442
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:30,613
The king chose you to
rule in his absence.

443
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:34,403
And rule you have.

444
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:37,737
Wisely, ably.

445
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:40,487
They see that. They respect you.

446
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:41,904
Some may even prefer you.

447
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:43,320
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon

448
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:44,737
when it was time to retake Winterfell,

449
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:46,403
then they named him their king,

450
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:48,278
and now they're ready to turn
their backs on him again.

451
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,529
How far would you trust men like that?

452
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,612
They're all bloody wind vanes.

453
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:54,654
If they found out that
I wrote that letter,

454
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:56,153
a woman who's already married

455
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:59,695
not one, but two enemies of her house...

456
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:02,737
By the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

457
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,530
Arya's not like them.

458
00:28:06,947 --> 00:28:08,362
She's your sister.

459
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:10,153
You may have disagreements,

460
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,612
but she would never betray her family.

461
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:15,153
She would if she thought I
was going to betray Jon.

462
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:17,071
Is that what she thinks?

463
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,987
I don't know what she thinks.

464
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,030
I don't know her anymore.

465
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,863
Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.

466
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:32,320
She's sworn to protect both
of Catelyn Stark's girls,

467
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:33,721
is she not?

468
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:36,571
She is.

469
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,904
And if one of you were planning
to harm the other in any way,

470
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:47,030
wouldn't she be honor
bound to intercede?

471
00:28:50,072 --> 00:28:51,530
She would.

472
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:07,987
- Something I've always wanted to know.
- All right.

473
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:12,237
How drunk were you when you charged
through the breach on Pyke?

474
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:16,030
If I'm being honest, I don't remember
charging through the breach.

475
00:29:17,905 --> 00:29:21,570
Some of the lads told me
about it the next morning.

476
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:23,946
Sounded like a good scrap.

477
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:26,237
Aye.

478
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:28,529
It was a proper scrap.

479
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,904
The ironborn thought you
were some kind of god,

480
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:34,238
the way you were waving
that flaming sword.

481
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:39,320
I thought you were the
bravest man I ever saw.

482
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,196

to sit next to a handsome,
young king on the Iron Throne.

I wanted to be a knight,

to pick up a sword like
Father and go off to battle.
