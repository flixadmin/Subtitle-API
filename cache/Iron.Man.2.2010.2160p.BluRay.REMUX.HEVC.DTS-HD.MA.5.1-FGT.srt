1
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,033
<i>Been a while since I was up here
in front of you.</i>

2
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:36,202
<i>Maybe I'll do us all a favour
and just stick to the cards.</i>

3
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,958
<i>There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred</i>

4
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop...</i>

5
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,150
<i>Sorry, Mr Stark, do you
honestly expect us to believe</i>

6
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,258
<i>that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,</i>

7
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,053
<i>despite the fact
that you sorely despise bodyguards?</i>

8
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:54,262
<i>Yes.</i>

9
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:59,017
<i>And this mysterious bodyguard
was somehow equipped</i>

10
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,520
<i>with an undisclosed
Stark high-tech powered battle...</i>

11
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,564
<i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

12
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:08,193
<i>It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely</i>

13
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,488
<i>to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

14
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:17,786
<i>I mean, let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.</i>

15
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,080
<i>A laundry list of character defects,</i>

16
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,999
<i>all the mistakes I've made,
largely public.</i>

17
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,709
<i>The truth is</i>

18
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,633
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

19
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,603
<i>Ivan.</i>

20
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,332
<i>Vanya.</i>

21
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,579
<i>270 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15,000 feet.</i>

22
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,444
<i>You are clear for ex-filtration
over the drop zone.</i>

23
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,492
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

24
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,911
It's good to be back.

25
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,116
- You missed me?
<i>- Blow something up!</i>

26
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,766
I missed you, too.
Blow something up? I already did that.

27
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,772
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying

28
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:49,027
its longest period of uninterrupted peace
in years because of me.

29
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:57,744
I'm not saying
that from the ashes of captivity,

30
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,874
never has a greater phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

31
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:11,883
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

32
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,593
sipping on an iced tea

33
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:16,721
because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough

34
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:19,682
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.

35
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,313
<i>I love you, Tony!</i>

36
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:27,524
Please, it's not about me.

37
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:30,693
It's not about you.

38
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:35,949
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.

39
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:39,786
It's about what we choose
to leave behind for future generations.

40
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,998
And that's why for the next year
and for the first time since 1974,

41
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,501
the best and brightest men and women

42
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,545
of nations and corporations
the world over

43
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,131
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

44
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:55,260
to leave behind a brighter future.

45
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,095
It's not about us.

46
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:01,140
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything,

47
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:03,768
is welcome back to the Stark Expo.

48
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:10,191
And now,
making a special guest appearance

49
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:12,694
from the great beyond
to tell you what it's all about,

50
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:15,280
please welcome my father, Howard.

51
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:20,577
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

52
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,954
<i>Better living, robust health,</i>

53
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:28,001
<i>and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.</i>

54
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,003
<i>So, from all of us here
at Stark Industries,</i>

55
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:34,882
<i>I would like to personally introduce you
to the City of the Future.</i>

56
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:38,720
<i>Technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind,</i>

57
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:41,639
<i>and will one day rid
society of all its ills.</i>

58
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:45,310
<i>Soon, technology will affect the way
you live your life every day.</i>

59
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:46,978
<i>No more tedious work,</i>

60
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:51,691
<i>leaving more time for leisure activities
and enjoying the sweet life.</i>

61
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:54,527
<i>The Stark Expo. Welcome.</i>

62
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,619
We are coming to you live
from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,

63
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,580
where Tony Stark
<i>has just walked offstage.</i>

64
00:10:05,664 --> 00:10:07,248
<i>Don't worry</i>
if you can't make it down here tonight

65
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,751
because this Expo goes on
all year long.

66
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,836
<i>And I'm gonna be here
checking out all the attractions</i>

67
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,465
<i>and the pavilions and the inventions</i>
from all around the world.

68
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,413
<i>So make sure you join me...</i>

69
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,009
All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.

70
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:20,928
- Open up, let's go.
- Hey! Nice to see you.

71
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:23,556
- All right. Thank you. I remember you.
- Tony, Tony...

72
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,183
Hey, hey...

73
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,727
- Call me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

74
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,271
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

75
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:31,856
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.

76
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,024
This is Larry.

77
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:35,193
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

78
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:36,778
- Nice to see you.
- Call me. Call me.

79
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,655
- Larry King.
- Larry!

80
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:41,491
Yes, my people, my people.

81
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,117
Come on, Tony. There we go.

82
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:45,078
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

83
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:46,454
No, it was perfect.

84
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:48,039
Look what we got here, the new model.

85
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:49,832
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

86
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,251
- And you are?
- Marshal.

88
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,253
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

89
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:56,506
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

90
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:57,840
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

91
00:10:57,966 --> 00:11:00,677
- Looking for you.
- Yeah? You found me.

92
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:05,223
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

93
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:08,851
He doesn't like to be handed things.

94
00:11:08,977 --> 00:11:10,520
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

95
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:11,729
You are hereby ordered

96
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:14,065
to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

97
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:15,817
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

98
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,485
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

99
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,862
He likes the badge.

100
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:22,031
- You still like it?
- Yep.

101
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:27,537
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.? 250 miles.

102
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:36,170
Mr Stark, could we pick up now
where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.

103
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:37,855
- Yes, dear?
- Can I have your attention?

104
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:39,006
Absolutely.

105
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:42,051
Do you or do you not possess
a specialised weapon?

106
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,429
- I do not. I do not.
- You do not?

107
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:47,014
Well, it depends
on how you define the word "weapon."

108
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,767
- The Iron Man weapon.
- My device does not fit that description.

109
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:51,561
Well... How would you describe it?

110
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,689
I would describe it by defining it
as what it is, Senator.

111
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:58,568
- As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.

112
00:11:58,694 --> 00:11:59,694
That is... That is...

113
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:02,071
That's actually the most apt description
I can make of it.

114
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:04,031
It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr Stark.

115
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:07,236
Please, if your priority was actually
the well-being of the American citizen...

116
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:10,163
My priority is to get the Iron Man
weapon turned over to the people

117
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:13,624
- of the United States of America.
- Well, you can forget it.

118
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,962
I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.

119
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:20,506
To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself,

120
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:23,593
which is tantamount
to indentured servitude or prostitution,

121
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,344
depending on what state you're in.

122
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:28,389
- You can't have it.
- Look, I'm no expert...

123
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:32,268
In prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.

124
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:35,688
I'm no expert in weapons.

125
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:37,607
We have somebody here
who is an expert on weapons.

126
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:42,445
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer,
our current primary weapons contractor.

127
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:46,949
Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr Hammer entering the chamber,

128
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,367
and I am wondering

129
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:52,246
if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

130
00:12:56,126 --> 00:13:00,463
Absolutely. I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.

131
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,548
You're the wonder boy.

132
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,759
Senator, if I may.

133
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:09,305
I may well not be an expert,
but you know who was the expert?

134
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:12,016
Your dad. Howard Stark.

135
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:16,521
Really a father to us all,
and to the military-industrial age.

136
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:21,551
Let's just be clear.
He was no flower child. He was a lion.

137
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,053
We all know why we're here.
In the last six months,

138
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,266
Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.

139
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:31,185
And yet he insists it's a shield.

140
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,898
He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

141
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,235
I wish I were comforted, Anthony,
I really do.

142
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,447
I'd love to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house,

143
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:43,990
but this ain't Canada.

144
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,742
You know, we live in a world
of grave threats,

145
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:49,579
threats that Mr Stark
will not always be able to foresee.

146
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,081
Thank you.

147
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,917
God bless Iron Man. God bless America.

148
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,129
That is well said, Mr Hammer.

149
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,173
The committee would now like to invite

150
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,384
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
to the chamber.

151
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:04,969
Rhodey? What?

152
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,562
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.

153
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,273
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

154
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,441
I just...

155
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,007
- Drop it.
- All right, I'll drop it.

156
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,529
I have before me a complete report
on the Iron Man weapon,

157
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,282
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record,

158
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:29,444
can you please read page 57,
paragraph four?

159
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,821
You're requesting
that I read specific selections

160
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,197
- from my report, Senator?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:35,199
It was my understanding
that I was going to be testifying

162
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,452
in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.

163
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:39,162
I understand.
A lot of things have changed today.

164
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,538
- So if you could just read...
- You do understand

165
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:43,102
that reading a single paragraph
out of context does not reflect

166
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,419
- the summary of my final...
- Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

167
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:48,880
Very well.

168
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,093
"As he does not operate within
any definable branch of government,"

169
00:14:56,096 --> 00:15:00,183
"Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation"

170
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,684
"and to her interests."

171
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,644
I did, however, go on to summarise

172
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:06,439
that the benefits of Iron Man
far outweigh the liabilities.

173
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,691
- And that it would be in our interest...
- That's enough, Colonel.

174
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:09,942
- To fold Mr Stark...
- That's enough.

175
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:11,569
Into the existing
chain of command, Senator.

176
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:15,031
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

177
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,784
We can amend the hours a little bit.

178
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,203
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,

179
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,455
the imagery
that's connected to your report.

180
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:25,416
I believe it is somewhat premature
to reveal these images

181
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:27,293
- to the general public at this time.
- With all due respect,

182
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:28,586
Colonel, I understand.

183
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,757
And if you could just narrate those
for us, we'd be very grateful.

184
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,801
Let's have the images.

185
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:39,472
Intelligence suggests
that the devices seen in these photos

186
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:42,433
are, in fact, attempts
at making manned copies

187
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:43,976
of Mr Stark's suit.

188
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:49,106
This has been corroborated by our allies
and local intelligence on the ground,

189
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:54,320
indicating that these suits are quite
possibly, at this moment, operational.

190
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:58,407
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

191
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,994
Boy, I'm good.
I commandeered your screens.

192
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:05,498
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

193
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:07,500
- Now, let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

194
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,837
If you will direct your attention
to said screens...

195
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:12,505
I believe that's North Korea.

196
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:23,599
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

197
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:24,851
Iran.

198
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:32,358
No grave immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?

199
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,902
How did Hammer get in the game?

200
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:37,613
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

201
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:42,201
<i>Okay, give me a left twist.
Left's good. Turn to the right.</i>

202
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,331
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, shit!</i>

203
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,583
Wow.

204
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:53,337
Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, 10 years away.

205
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:54,714
Hammer Industries, 20.

206
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:57,425
I'd like to point out
that that test pilot survived.

207
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,051
I think we're done,
is the point that he's making.

208
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:02,346
- I don't think there's any reason...
- The point is, you're welcome, I guess.

209
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:05,266
- For what?
- Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.

210
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,893
It's working.
We're safe. America is secure.

211
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,895
You want my property?
You can't have it.

212
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,397
But I did you a big favour.

213
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:15,067
I've successfully privatized world peace.

214
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,448
What more do you want? For now!

215
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:24,118
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

216
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,580
You, Mr Stark... you, buddy.

217
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,790
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.

218
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,168
- Okay.
- You've been a delight.

219
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:40,259
<i>My bond is with the people.</i>

220
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:45,598
<i>And I will serve this great nation
at the pleasure of myself.</i>

221
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,266
<i>If there's one thing I've proven</i>

222
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:50,686
<i>it's that you can count on me
to pleasure myself.</i>

223
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,890
Wake up. Daddy's home.

224
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,558
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

225
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,519
<i>Congratulations on
the opening ceremonies.</i>

226
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:34,647
<i>They were such a success,
as was your Senate hearing.</i>

227
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,482
<i>And may I say how refreshing it is</i>

228
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:40,319
<i>to finally see you in a video
with your clothing on, sir.</i>

229
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,364
You!

230
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,158
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

231
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:48,828
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

232
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,580
How many ounces a day
of this gobbledegook

233
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,748
am I supposed to drink?

234
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,836
<i>We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.</i>

235
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,755
Check palladium levels.

236
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,009
<i>Blood toxicity, 24%.</i>

237
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,847
<i>It appears that the continued use
of the Iron Man suit</i>

238
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:10,349
<i>is accelerating your condition.</i>

239
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,228
<i>Another core has been depleted.</i>

240
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,275
God, they're running out quick.

241
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,027
<i>I have run simulations
on every known element,</i>

242
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:24,155
<i>and none can serve
as a viable replacement</i>

243
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,240
<i>for the palladium core.</i>

244
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:31,537
<i>You are running out of both time
and options.</i>

245
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,960
<i>Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive</i>

246
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,879
<i>is also killing you.</i>

247
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,798
<i>Miss Potts is approaching.</i>

248
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:45,801
<i>- I recommend that you inform her...</i>
- Mute.

249
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:50,473
Is this a joke?

250
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:53,559
- What are you thinking?
- What?

251
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:55,936
- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

252
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,355
And you're angry about something.

253
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,815
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

254
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,317
- Did you just donate...
- Keep your business.

255
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,945
Our entire modern art collection
to the...

256
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,655
- Boy Scouts of America.
- Boy Scouts of America?

257
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,532
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.

258
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:11,994
I didn't physically check the crates
but, basically, yes.

259
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,246
And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No offence.

260
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:16,373
No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled

261
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,042
to say "our" collection

262
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:21,337
considering the time that I put in,
over 10 years,

263
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,255
- curating that.
- It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

264
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,425
You know,
there's only about 8,011 things

265
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,469
that I really need to talk to you about.

266
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,012
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

267
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,555
The Bridgeport's
already machining that part.

268
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,016
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

269
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,352
I need you to wear a surgical mask
until you're feeling better.

270
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,596
- Is that okay?
- That's rude.

271
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,063
There's nothing more important to me
than the Expo.

272
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,481
It's my primary point of concern.

273
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,734
- I don't know why you're...
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

274
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,611
Wow. Look at that.

275
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:49,198
That's modern art. That's going up.

276
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,034
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

277
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,328
- This is vital.
- Stark is in complete disarray.

278
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,812
- You understand that?
- No. Our stocks have never been higher.

279
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:59,166
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,

280
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:00,751
- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.

281
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:02,419
- Let's move on to another subject.
- No, no, no, no.

282
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:04,213
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman

283
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,798
- and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.

284
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:07,162
I'm just replacing it with this.

285
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,592
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

286
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:11,804
My point is,
we have already awarded contracts

287
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:13,556
- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

288
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,724
- I'm already feeling gassy.
- And to the plastic plantation tree,

289
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,935
which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...

290
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,812
- Everything was my idea.
- And you won't make a decision.

291
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:21,605
I don't care
about the liberal agenda any more.

292
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,066
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

293
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,443
- You do it.
- I do what?

294
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:28,487
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

295
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:31,365
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

296
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:32,867
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

297
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,618
- give me the information...
- I'm not asking you to try...

298
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:35,828
- in order to...
- I'm asking you

299
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:37,121
to physically do it. I need you to do it.

300
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:38,956
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

301
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,958
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.

302
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,918
Why won't you let me?

303
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:46,463
- Have you been drinking?
- Chlorophyll.

304
00:21:48,383 --> 00:21:52,636
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

305
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:54,638
effective immediately.

306
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:58,726
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

307
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,771
I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought,

308
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:06,775
believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

309
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:10,738
trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.

310
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:12,615
And then I realised

311
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,703
it's you. It's always been you.

312
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:20,831
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

313
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,376
but actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.

314
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:27,087
My successor being you.

315
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:30,925
Congratulations?

316
00:22:32,677 --> 00:22:34,261
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

317
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:36,138
Don't think. Drink.

318
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:43,312
There you go.

319
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:26,313
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

320
00:23:26,856 --> 00:23:28,607
I'm on happy time.

321
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:36,143
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

322
00:23:36,157 --> 00:23:38,575
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

323
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,820
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

324
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:43,288
All right, put them up. Come on.

325
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:50,838
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

326
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:54,425
I need you to initial each box.

327
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,761
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...

328
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:01,265
<i>That's it. I'm done.</i>

329
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:03,767
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

330
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:05,436
Front and centre. Come into the church.

331
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,314
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
- If it pleases the court, which it does.

332
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:12,735
- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

333
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,458
What?

334
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:34,006
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

335
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:36,091
- Pepper.
- What?

336
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,595
- Who is she?
- She is from legal.

337
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,766
And she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit

338
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,018
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.

339
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:48,896
Yes, and I've got
three excellent potential candidates.

340
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:50,582
<i>They're lined up and ready to meet you.</i>

341
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:53,484
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.

342
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:54,651
No, it's not.

343
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:56,528
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

344
00:24:56,613 --> 00:25:00,574
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot
Camp? Crunch? Something like that?

345
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:04,411
- How do I spell your name, Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

346
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:08,916
- What, are you gonna Google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

347
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,669
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
- You're so predictable, you know that?

348
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:14,922
She's fluent in French, Italian,
Russian, Latin.

349
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:16,882
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

350
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:19,259
- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.

351
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:21,136
You can read Latin
or you can write Latin,

352
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:22,805
- but you can't speak Latin...
- Did you model in Tokyo?

353
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:24,640
- 'Cause she modeled in Tokyo.
- Well...

354
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,100
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.

355
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:29,812
Rule number one,
never take your eye off your opponent.

356
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:32,439
Oh, my God!

357
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:37,444
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

358
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:38,862
- I just slipped.
- You did?

359
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:41,281
- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.

360
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,828
Just... I need your impression.

361
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:48,622
You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.

362
00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:51,208
- I meant your fingerprint.
- Right.

363
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:57,589
- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

364
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:02,052
- You're the boss.
- Will that be all, Mr Stark?

365
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:04,096
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.

366
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,014
Thank you very much.

367
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:10,686
- I want one.
- No.

368
00:26:44,596 --> 00:26:46,972
You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,

369
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:48,307
- just go with it.
- Go with it? Go with what?

370
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:49,933
- Mr Stark?
- Hey.

371
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:51,226
Hello. How was your flight?

372
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:52,811
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.

373
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:57,065
We have one photographer
from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

374
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,234
- When did this happen?
- What? You made me do it.

375
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,862
- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile. Look right there.

376
00:27:01,946 --> 00:27:03,071
Stop acting constipated.

377
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:04,615
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

378
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:05,741
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

379
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,534
- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.

380
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:09,499
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

381
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:11,455
You have a 9:30 dinner.

382
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:13,339
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00.
- Absolutely.

383
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:15,209
- Is this us?
- It can be.

384
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:16,960
- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.

385
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:19,504
- Mr Musk. How are you?
- Hi, Pepper.

386
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:21,465
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

387
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:23,800
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

388
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:25,886
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea
for an electric jet.

389
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,054
- You do?
- Yeah.

390
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:29,181
Then we'll make it work.

391
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:31,016
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No,

392
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,559
- I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...

393
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:34,061
- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.

394
00:27:34,145 --> 00:27:35,312
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

395
00:27:35,396 --> 00:27:36,521
Thank you very much.

396
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:38,565
- Green is not your best colour.
- Oh, please.

397
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,192
Anthony! Is that you?

398
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:41,568
- My least favourite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.

399
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:42,945
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

400
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,822
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

401
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:48,325
You know Christine Everhart
from <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

402
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:49,609
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

403
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:50,869
- Yes.
- Yes.

404
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:52,120
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

405
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:56,250
BTW, big story.
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

406
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:57,654
- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.

407
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,171
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our <i>Powerful Women</i> issue.

408
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:02,422
- Can I?
- Sure.

409
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:05,008
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

410
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:07,010
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

411
00:28:07,095 --> 00:28:08,178
- Right.
- Right?

412
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:11,640
Well, she did quite a spread
on Tony last year.

413
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,058
And she wrote a story as well.

414
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:15,185
- It was very impressive.
- That was good.

415
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,312
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

416
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:18,877
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

417
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,399
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.

418
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:21,775
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

419
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:23,817
Can I ask you...
Is this the first time...

420
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:24,486
Fromage.

421
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,071
- Say, "Brie."
- that you guys have seen each other?

422
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:28,407
God, that's so awful.

423
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:30,867
Listen, is it the first time you've seen
each other since the Senate?

424
00:28:30,952 --> 00:28:32,619
Since he got his contract revoked...

425
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:34,985
- Actually, it's on hold.
- When you were attempting to...

426
00:28:34,998 --> 00:28:36,999
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"

427
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,917
- and "cancelled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?

428
00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:41,378
No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?

429
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:45,465
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

430
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,926
Well, if you invent something
that works,

431
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:49,428
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

432
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:51,722
- Mr Stark, your corner table is ready.
- Yes?

433
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:54,016
I actually have a slot this year.
Yes, I do.

434
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,269
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.

435
00:28:58,146 --> 00:28:59,313
We kid. We're kidders.

436
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:23,712
Got any other bad ideas?

437
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:29,092
Tony!

438
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,225
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

439
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,770
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

440
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:42,356
for Hammer Industries, you know?

441
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,776
- Everything that Tony and I do...
<i>- Well, what's the use of having...</i>

442
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,737
- is a healthy...
<i>- and owning a race car...</i>

443
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:51,782
- competition.
<i>- If you don't drive it?</i>

444
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,368
Is he driving?

445
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,335
Natalie. Natalie!

446
00:30:04,253 --> 00:30:05,462
- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?

447
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:07,756
This is the first that I have known of it.

448
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:09,591
This... This cannot happen.

449
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,343
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

450
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:12,677
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

451
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:14,638
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

452
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,516
Tony's... You know, he...

453
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,476
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

454
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,644
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

455
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:23,688
- can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.

456
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:24,981
- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.

457
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,316
But I have to make one quick phone call.

458
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:27,484
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

459
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:28,944
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

460
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,529
- I'll be right back.
<i>- Look!</i>

461
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:32,114
<i>That's Stark.</i>

462
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:31,358
Go, go!

463
00:32:34,946 --> 00:32:36,238
Hang on.

464
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:47,017
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

465
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:48,685
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

466
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:49,936
Car!

467
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:55,001
Oh, my God!

468
00:35:01,592 --> 00:35:04,135
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

469
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,138
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

470
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:09,224
- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

471
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,267
- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!

472
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:13,103
I was attacked! We need better security.

473
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:15,438
- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.

474
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:17,273
God, it's embarrassing.

475
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:20,360
First vacation in two years.

476
00:35:25,032 --> 00:35:26,449
Oh, my God!

477
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:29,786
- I got him!
- Hit him again. Hit him again.

478
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,746
Football.

479
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:36,251
- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!

480
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,002
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

481
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:39,921
Stop banging the car!

482
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,426
Calm down.

483
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,345
God! God!

484
00:35:49,932 --> 00:35:52,597
Give me the case! Please! Come on!

485
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:26,736
You... You lose.

486
00:37:33,077 --> 00:37:35,703
You lose. You lose, Stark.

487
00:38:29,258 --> 00:38:32,927
Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.

488
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,603
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

489
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:47,066
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

490
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:50,069
It's effective. Not very efficient.

491
00:38:51,113 --> 00:38:53,448
But it's a passable knock-off.

492
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,658
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,

493
00:38:55,743 --> 00:38:57,535
you could have made a solid paycheck.

494
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,789
You could have sold it
to North Korea, China, Iran,

495
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:04,500
or gone right to the black market.

496
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:07,545
You look like you got friends
in low places.

497
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:13,176
You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.

498
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,846
And now, like all guilty men,

499
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:20,391
you try to rewrite your own history.

500
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:26,064
And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.

501
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,485
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

502
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:33,488
My father. Anton Vanko.

503
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:36,866
Well, I never heard of him.

504
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:40,662
My father is the reason you're alive.

505
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:42,914
The reason I'm alive
is 'cause you had a shot, you took it,

506
00:39:42,998 --> 00:39:44,540
you missed.

507
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:45,833
Did I?

508
00:39:48,712 --> 00:39:50,838
If you can make God bleed,

509
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,717
the people will cease to believe in him.

510
00:39:56,053 --> 00:40:00,390
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

511
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:06,813
The truth,
all I have to do is sit here and watch

512
00:40:06,897 --> 00:40:09,399
as the world will consume you.

513
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:11,567
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

514
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:15,571
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

515
00:40:15,656 --> 00:40:17,949
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

516
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:21,411
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

517
00:40:38,846 --> 00:40:42,306
<i>It's just unbelievable. It proves
that the genie is out of the bottle</i>

518
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:44,851
<i>and this man has no idea
what he's doing.</i>

519
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:48,688
<i>He thinks of the Iron Man weapon
as a toy.</i>

520
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:53,609
<i>I was at a hearing
where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant</i>

521
00:40:53,694 --> 00:40:57,321
<i>that these suits
can't exist anywhere else,</i>

522
00:40:57,406 --> 00:40:59,949
<i>don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else,</i>

523
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:01,367
<i>at least for five to 10 years,</i>

524
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:06,080
<i>and here we are in Monaco realising,
"These suits exist now."</i>

525
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:07,331
Mute.

526
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:12,920
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

527
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:20,261
- What is that?
- This is your in-flight meal.

528
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:25,433
Did you just make that?

529
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:28,936
Yeah. Where do you think I've been
for three hours?

530
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:31,105
Tony,

531
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:35,526
what are you not telling me?

532
00:41:39,448 --> 00:41:42,450
I don't want to go home. At all.

533
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:47,413
Let's cancel my birthday party and...

534
00:41:47,498 --> 00:41:50,082
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

535
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:51,375
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

536
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,336
It's a great place to

537
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,966
- be healthy.
- I don't think this is the right time.

538
00:41:59,051 --> 00:42:01,302
We're in kind of a mess.

539
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,012
Yeah, but maybe that's why
it's the best time.

540
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:05,139
- 'Cause then we...
- Well, I think as the CEO,

541
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:06,349
I need to show up.

542
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:10,728
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

543
00:42:10,813 --> 00:42:12,146
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

544
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:14,774
- A retreat? During a time like this?
- Just a ride.

545
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:18,444
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

546
00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:21,280
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

547
00:44:33,246 --> 00:44:35,373
Hey, there he is.

548
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,541
There he is.

549
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:42,630
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.

550
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:44,757
Oh, goodness gracious.

551
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:48,386
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

552
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,973
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

553
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:55,851
I didn't want to make
a first impression like this.

554
00:44:55,936 --> 00:44:58,229
He's not an animal. Come on.

555
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:01,774
He's a human being. Thank you.

556
00:45:06,822 --> 00:45:08,239
We're fine.

557
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:11,575
My name is Justin Hammer.

558
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,996
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.

559
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,210
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?

560
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:24,630
- We have some salmon carpaccio.
- Salmon carpaccio.

561
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,925
Anything you want here, we got it.

562
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:32,096
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in from San Francisco.

563
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,056
It's Italian, though.

564
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:35,933
Organic ice cream.

565
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:39,937
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

566
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:44,650
What I saw you do to Tony Stark
on that track,

567
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:48,404
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

568
00:45:48,488 --> 00:45:50,614
that was... Wow!

569
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:52,241
You spoke to me with what you did.

570
00:45:52,325 --> 00:45:54,952
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

571
00:45:55,037 --> 00:45:56,579
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off

572
00:45:56,663 --> 00:45:59,457
to God knows where. It would have been
such a waste of talent.

573
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:00,875
But if I might make a suggestion,

574
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,669
you know,
you don't just go and try and kill the guy.

575
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:08,007
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.

576
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:10,176
That's what you kill.

577
00:46:10,302 --> 00:46:13,262
You and me,
we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

578
00:46:13,346 --> 00:46:17,975
The only difference between you and I
is that I have resources.

579
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:23,647
I think, if I may,
you need my resources.

580
00:46:23,732 --> 00:46:26,317
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

581
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:28,486
I'd like to be that guy.

582
00:46:40,373 --> 00:46:44,668
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

583
00:46:44,753 --> 00:46:47,588
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

584
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:49,090
Very good, man.

585
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:52,343
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

586
00:46:52,427 --> 00:46:53,552
Hey!

587
00:46:55,097 --> 00:46:57,264
- Hey.
- Yes?

588
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:58,933
I want my bird.

589
00:47:00,936 --> 00:47:04,605
- A bird? You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

590
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,357
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

591
00:47:06,441 --> 00:47:07,983
I want my bird.

592
00:47:08,068 --> 00:47:10,611
Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible. I could...

593
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:14,365
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird back in Russia?

594
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:17,493
Yes, but the fundamentals
of the company are still very, very strong

595
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:19,497
- despite the events in Monaco.
- Yes, of course.

596
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:23,040
- The AP wants a quote.
- Don't tell him. Fax them...

597
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,625
Where is he?

598
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,502
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
- He's downstairs.

599
00:47:26,586 --> 00:47:28,045
<i>- What happened in Monaco?</i>
- Yes, but...

600
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,631
<i>But his continuing erratic behaviour</i>

601
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:32,842
<i>may lead many people
to ask themselves,</i>

602
00:47:32,926 --> 00:47:34,760
<i>"Can this man still protect us?"</i>

603
00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:38,139
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.

604
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:43,811
<i>Query complete, sir.
Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist</i>

605
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:46,897
<i>who defected to the United States
in 1963.</i>

606
00:47:46,982 --> 00:47:51,152
<i>However, he was accused of espionage
and was deported in 1967.</i>

607
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:53,612
<i>His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,</i>

608
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:58,450
<i>was convicted of selling Soviet-era
weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,</i>

609
00:47:58,577 --> 00:48:01,036
<i>and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.</i>

610
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:03,247
<i>No further records exist.</i>

611
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:09,420
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

612
00:48:09,504 --> 00:48:11,755
and get on top
of this situation right now.

613
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,842
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

614
00:48:16,178 --> 00:48:19,013
trying to talk them out
of rolling tanks up the PCH,

615
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:21,974
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

616
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,101
They're gonna take your suits,
Tony, okay?

617
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:26,103
They're sick of the games.

618
00:48:26,188 --> 00:48:29,398
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

619
00:48:29,482 --> 00:48:32,693
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.

620
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,112
It's not theoretical any more.

621
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:38,365
Are you listening to me?

622
00:48:40,493 --> 00:48:42,119
- Are you okay?
- Let's go.

623
00:48:46,499 --> 00:48:49,043
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

624
00:48:51,379 --> 00:48:54,757
- You all right?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

625
00:48:54,841 --> 00:48:56,967
- See that cigar box?
- Yeah.

626
00:48:57,344 --> 00:48:58,969
It's palladium.

627
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:07,436
Is that supposed to be smoking?

628
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,815
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.

629
00:49:15,528 --> 00:49:17,655
You had this in your body?

630
00:49:22,494 --> 00:49:26,330
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

631
00:49:26,414 --> 00:49:27,831
Road rash.

632
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:32,586
Thank you.

633
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:47,518
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

634
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:50,646
You wanna do
this whole lone gunslinger act

635
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,850
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

636
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:55,067
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

637
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:57,403
But you've gotta trust me.

638
00:49:57,529 --> 00:50:01,281
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

639
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,334
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

640
00:50:12,419 --> 00:50:15,879
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be kind of fun to be dead, right?

641
00:50:15,964 --> 00:50:17,381
No pressure.

642
00:50:17,465 --> 00:50:20,467
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

643
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:22,032
I may have done a few miscalculations

644
00:50:22,095 --> 00:50:24,096
and rushed the prototype
into production.

645
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:26,056
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

646
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:28,434
Go ahead, take a look around.

647
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:35,149
You don't wanna do that.

648
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,859
You'll be able to access that

649
00:50:36,943 --> 00:50:38,863
as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.

650
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:41,030
Can we generate
some encrypted pass codes?

651
00:50:41,114 --> 00:50:44,241
Get some of those
encrypted pass codes, Jack.

652
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,077
Never mind, I...

653
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:51,623
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

654
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:56,420
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

655
00:50:58,673 --> 00:50:59,923
Well...

656
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:02,843
You're good.

657
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:06,263
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

658
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:10,392
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

659
00:51:10,477 --> 00:51:12,436
Go ahead, take a look.

660
00:51:13,313 --> 00:51:15,939
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

661
00:51:16,024 --> 00:51:18,025
You know,
those are really just for show and tell.

662
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:23,113
They're $125.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.

663
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,118
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

664
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:31,538
That's where the pilot goes.

665
00:51:31,623 --> 00:51:35,667
I'm having a tough time
finding volunteers.

666
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:38,921
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

667
00:51:39,005 --> 00:51:40,506
What you want them do?

668
00:51:40,632 --> 00:51:45,803
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

669
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:47,930
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

670
00:51:48,014 --> 00:51:49,214
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

671
00:51:49,224 --> 00:51:51,141
I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.

672
00:51:51,226 --> 00:51:52,643
You know what I'm talking about?

673
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:54,895
- I can do that. No problem.
- Yeah?

674
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,147
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

675
00:51:57,232 --> 00:51:59,942
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

676
00:52:09,536 --> 00:52:11,995
Do you know which watch
you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

677
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,331
I'll give them a look.

678
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,669
I should cancel the party.

679
00:52:19,754 --> 00:52:21,004
- Probably.
- Yeah.

680
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:23,715
- 'Cause it's...
- Ill-timed.

681
00:52:23,842 --> 00:52:25,300
Right, sends the wrong message.

682
00:52:25,385 --> 00:52:26,885
Inappropriate.

683
00:52:32,725 --> 00:52:35,018
Is that dirty enough for you?

684
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,773
Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

685
00:52:40,275 --> 00:52:41,733
Bring them over here.

686
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:47,197
I'll take that. Why don't you...

687
00:52:59,252 --> 00:53:01,587
I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.

688
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,047
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

689
00:53:06,759 --> 00:53:08,886
Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?

690
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,262
Bit odd.

691
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:13,932
If this was your last birthday party
you were ever gonna have,

692
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:15,601
how would you celebrate it?

693
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:22,441
I'd do whatever I wanted to do
with whoever I wanted to do it with.

694
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:55,265
<i>- Good evening.
- Good evening.</i>

695
00:53:56,184 --> 00:53:58,143
Yes, sir, I understand.

696
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:02,481
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

697
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:04,900
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,

698
00:54:04,984 --> 00:54:06,818
Iron Man will be back on watch.

699
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:15,619
Hey, Pepper.

700
00:54:15,954 --> 00:54:18,038
I'm going to go get some air.

701
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:19,498
What's wrong?

702
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,626
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

703
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,440
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
- No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

704
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:33,428
This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

705
00:54:33,513 --> 00:54:34,763
I know. I know. I get it.

706
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:36,098
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.

707
00:54:36,182 --> 00:54:39,142
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

708
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:41,979
You know, the question
I get asked most often is,

709
00:54:42,063 --> 00:54:44,564
"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom
in the suit?"

710
00:54:47,986 --> 00:54:49,403
Just like that.

711
00:54:53,032 --> 00:54:55,993
Does this guy know
how to throw a party or what?

712
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:00,706
I love you.

713
00:55:00,832 --> 00:55:03,458
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.

714
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:07,504
Tony, we all thank you so much
for such a wonderful night.

715
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:11,591
And we're gonna say good night now,
and thank you all for coming.

716
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:12,884
No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.

717
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:14,761
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.

718
00:55:14,846 --> 00:55:17,639
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

719
00:55:17,724 --> 00:55:20,058
- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.

720
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:21,268
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be

721
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:22,561
- happy about this.
- Come on, you know you want to.

722
00:55:22,687 --> 00:55:24,021
You just peed the suit.

723
00:55:24,105 --> 00:55:25,564
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

724
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,065
You could drink that water.

725
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:30,736
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

726
00:55:30,862 --> 00:55:32,571
- If you say so.
- Okay.

727
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:34,865
I'll take this, you take that.

728
00:55:36,242 --> 00:55:37,868
Pepper Potts.

729
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:40,704
She's right. The party's over.

730
00:55:40,788 --> 00:55:43,749
Then again, the party was over for me,
like, an hour and a half ago.

731
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:47,377
The after-party starts in 15 minutes.

732
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:55,093
And if anybody, Pepper,
doesn't like it, there's the door.

733
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:02,934
Yeah!

734
00:56:07,315 --> 00:56:08,565
Hit!

735
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,417
Pull!

736
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,595
I think she wants the Gallagher!

737
00:56:47,939 --> 00:56:49,856
I'm only gonna say this once.

738
00:56:53,361 --> 00:56:54,694
Get out.

739
00:57:01,202 --> 00:57:04,287
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

740
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:07,082
Goldstein.

741
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:09,543
Yes, Mr Stark?

742
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:12,879
Give me a phat beat
to beat my buddy's ass to.

743
00:57:16,676 --> 00:57:18,677
I told you to shut it down.

744
00:57:29,188 --> 00:57:32,774
Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.

745
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,740
Really?

746
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:52,127
Sorry, pal,
but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

747
00:57:52,712 --> 00:57:54,963
Sidekick this!

748
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:04,973
Had enough?

749
00:58:05,892 --> 00:58:07,350
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

750
00:58:07,435 --> 00:58:09,561
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.

751
00:58:09,645 --> 00:58:11,688
You know what?
Ever since you came here...

752
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:16,443
Pepper!

753
00:58:17,987 --> 00:58:19,321
Get out of here. Get out of here.

754
00:58:25,578 --> 00:58:28,330
You want it? Take it!

755
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,789
Put your hand down.

756
00:59:10,873 --> 00:59:13,083
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

757
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:14,459
We don't have to do this, Tony.

758
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:16,419
You wanna be the War Machine,
take your shot.

759
00:59:16,504 --> 00:59:18,338
- Put it down!
- You gonna take a shot?

760
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:19,673
- Put it down!
- No!

761
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:21,216
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it.

762
01:00:32,246 --> 01:00:34,664
<i>Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant
Colonel James Rhodes,</i>

763
01:00:34,749 --> 01:00:37,959
<i>inbound from three miles east
at 5,000 feet...</i>

764
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,713
Colonel.

765
01:01:24,674 --> 01:01:25,924
Major.

766
01:01:26,676 --> 01:01:27,801
Wow.

767
01:01:29,011 --> 01:01:30,303
Yeah.

768
01:01:32,139 --> 01:01:34,057
Let's take it inside.

769
01:01:34,141 --> 01:01:35,642
Clear the area.

770
01:01:58,416 --> 01:01:59,624
Sir!

771
01:01:59,709 --> 01:02:02,168
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the doughnut.

772
01:02:06,215 --> 01:02:08,455
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

773
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,929
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

774
01:02:13,013 --> 01:02:16,224
- How's that working out for you?
- It's... It's... It's...

775
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:19,060
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

776
01:02:19,145 --> 01:02:20,937
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

777
01:02:22,064 --> 01:02:23,148
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

778
01:02:23,232 --> 01:02:25,567
I'm not sure if you're real
or if I'm having...

779
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:27,736
I am very real.

780
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,821
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

781
01:02:30,322 --> 01:02:33,575
- Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
- That's not looking so good.

782
01:02:34,326 --> 01:02:36,327
I've been worse.

783
01:02:37,997 --> 01:02:39,117
We've secured the perimeter,

784
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:42,000
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

785
01:02:45,588 --> 01:02:48,423
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

786
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:52,343
Tony, I want you to meet
Agent Romanoff.

787
01:02:52,428 --> 01:02:53,553
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

788
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:56,264
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

789
01:02:56,348 --> 01:02:58,183
I suggest you apologise.

790
01:02:58,267 --> 01:02:59,809
You've been very busy.

791
01:02:59,894 --> 01:03:03,146
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

792
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:06,232
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

793
01:03:06,317 --> 01:03:07,692
Now, if I didn't know better...

794
01:03:07,777 --> 01:03:09,778
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

795
01:03:09,862 --> 01:03:12,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

796
01:03:12,615 --> 01:03:15,825
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

797
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:18,710
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

798
01:03:18,788 --> 01:03:19,996
Is that possible?

799
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,707
Well, according to Mr Stark's
database security guidelines,

800
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:25,794
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorised usage.

801
01:03:28,589 --> 01:03:31,216
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you?

802
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,176
What do you want from me?

803
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,930
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

804
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:40,266
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the centre of my universe.

805
01:03:40,351 --> 01:03:43,394
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

806
01:03:43,479 --> 01:03:44,521
Hit him.

807
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:49,067
Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

808
01:03:49,527 --> 01:03:52,445
Could you please not do anything awful
for five seconds?

809
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:56,658
- What did she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

810
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:59,160
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

811
01:03:59,245 --> 01:04:01,120
We're trying to get you back to work.

812
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:03,289
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

813
01:04:03,374 --> 01:04:05,291
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

814
01:04:05,376 --> 01:04:07,877
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

815
01:04:07,962 --> 01:04:10,171
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

816
01:04:10,256 --> 01:04:12,632
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

817
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:17,136
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

818
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:20,306
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

819
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:24,894
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

820
01:04:24,979 --> 01:04:26,521
Candygram.

821
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:32,193
I brought you something.

822
01:04:32,778 --> 01:04:34,529
Oh, yeah.

823
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:38,908
We got you the bird, pal.

824
01:04:38,993 --> 01:04:40,326
This is not my bird.

825
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:42,829
What do you mean?
That's the bird. This is the bird.

826
01:04:42,913 --> 01:04:45,707
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

827
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:47,083
This is a great bird.

828
01:04:47,167 --> 01:04:49,794
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

829
01:04:49,879 --> 01:04:52,338
Hey, man, this not my bird.

830
01:04:54,675 --> 01:04:58,595
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

831
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:01,472
I mean, you know, look,
don't get so attached to things.

832
01:05:01,557 --> 01:05:03,266
Learn to let go.

833
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,521
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

834
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:12,191
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

835
01:05:20,701 --> 01:05:24,245
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

836
01:05:25,205 --> 01:05:27,325
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

837
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,918
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

838
01:05:30,002 --> 01:05:31,842
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

839
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:35,131
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

840
01:05:35,215 --> 01:05:37,884
See, Ivan?
He can't put his head in there.

841
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:42,347
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

842
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:45,808
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

843
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:48,269
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

844
01:05:48,354 --> 01:05:50,939
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

845
01:05:51,023 --> 01:05:52,815
People make problem.

846
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,776
Trust me. Drone better.

847
01:05:55,235 --> 01:05:59,405
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

848
01:06:00,282 --> 01:06:02,116
You said, "No problem."

849
01:06:02,201 --> 01:06:05,119
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

850
01:06:05,204 --> 01:06:07,997
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

851
01:06:08,082 --> 01:06:10,083
Like Iron Man. You understand?

852
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:13,294
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

853
01:06:14,129 --> 01:06:15,463
Hey, man.

854
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:19,592
Don't get too attached to things.

855
01:06:20,302 --> 01:06:22,011
Learn to let go.

856
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:28,101
These drones
better steal the show, Ivan.

857
01:06:28,727 --> 01:06:32,146
You understand?
Better rock my world, Ivan.

858
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,408
Unbelievable.

859
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:46,536
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

860
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:49,998
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

861
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:53,751
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

862
01:06:54,753 --> 01:06:55,795
Sir?

863
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:58,506
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

864
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,216
We'd like this to introduce it.

865
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,884
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

866
01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:04,762
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

867
01:07:04,847 --> 01:07:07,890
- We've got to make this happen.
- Yes, General, but...

868
01:07:07,975 --> 01:07:09,976
It's also an order.

869
01:07:10,352 --> 01:07:11,686
Yes, sir.

870
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:15,523
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

871
01:07:15,607 --> 01:07:17,233
Thank you, sir.

872
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:27,118
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

873
01:07:27,202 --> 01:07:28,244
No, it was finished.

874
01:07:28,328 --> 01:07:32,457
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturised it and put it in my...

875
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:34,667
No. Howard said the arc reactor

876
01:07:34,752 --> 01:07:36,502
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

877
01:07:36,587 --> 01:07:41,090
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

878
01:07:41,592 --> 01:07:42,717
He was on to something big,

879
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:46,262
something so big that it was gonna
make the nuclear reactor

880
01:07:46,346 --> 01:07:48,347
look like a triple-A battery.

881
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:50,933
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

882
01:07:51,018 --> 01:07:54,103
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

883
01:07:54,188 --> 01:07:56,230
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

884
01:07:56,315 --> 01:07:58,691
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

885
01:07:58,776 --> 01:08:00,693
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

886
01:08:00,778 --> 01:08:02,320
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

887
01:08:02,404 --> 01:08:05,156
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

888
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,784
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

889
01:08:07,868 --> 01:08:11,996
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

890
01:08:12,372 --> 01:08:13,706
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

891
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:16,000
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

892
01:08:16,085 --> 01:08:20,338
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

893
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:22,465
to finish what he started.

894
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:24,050
He said that?

895
01:08:24,218 --> 01:08:26,844
Are you that guy? Are you?

896
01:08:26,929 --> 01:08:32,225
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

897
01:08:36,522 --> 01:08:37,980
I don't know
where you get your information,

898
01:08:38,065 --> 01:08:40,316
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

899
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,800
What do you remember about your dad?

900
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,569
He was cold, he was calculating.

901
01:08:43,654 --> 01:08:46,405
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,

902
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,074
so it's a little tough for me to digest

903
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,678
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

904
01:08:50,702 --> 01:08:53,663
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

905
01:08:53,747 --> 01:08:54,997
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

906
01:08:55,082 --> 01:08:56,582
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

907
01:08:56,667 --> 01:08:57,750
That's not true.

908
01:08:57,835 --> 01:09:00,503
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

909
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:04,590
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

910
01:09:04,675 --> 01:09:05,842
What?

911
01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:08,469
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

912
01:09:08,554 --> 01:09:10,114
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

913
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,931
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

914
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:13,891
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

915
01:09:13,976 --> 01:09:17,228
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

916
01:09:17,312 --> 01:09:20,231
- And you remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

917
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:22,150
And Tony,

918
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,404
remember, I got my eye on you.

919
01:09:32,452 --> 01:09:35,705
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

920
01:09:35,789 --> 01:09:37,165
Good luck.

921
01:09:41,253 --> 01:09:42,503
Please.

922
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:46,299
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

923
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:48,551
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

924
01:09:48,635 --> 01:09:51,220
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

925
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:52,430
I'm not here for that.

926
01:09:52,514 --> 01:09:53,994
I've been authorised by Director Fury

927
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:56,517
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

928
01:09:56,602 --> 01:09:59,228
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

929
01:09:59,313 --> 01:10:02,523
I will tase you and watch Supernanny
while you drool into the carpet.

930
01:10:02,608 --> 01:10:04,859
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

931
01:10:04,943 --> 01:10:06,819
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

932
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:34,805
Think this is the power source?

933
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:39,685
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

934
01:10:40,812 --> 01:10:42,146
Yes, sir.

935
01:10:42,564 --> 01:10:43,856
Oh, yes!

936
01:10:44,274 --> 01:10:46,192
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

937
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:48,027
Is it my birthday?

938
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,739
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?

939
01:10:54,868 --> 01:10:57,703
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

940
01:10:57,788 --> 01:11:00,873
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

941
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,541
What am I going to do for you?

942
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:05,706
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

943
01:11:05,754 --> 01:11:08,756
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

944
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,175
I'm talking about firepower.

945
01:11:12,678 --> 01:11:14,762
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

946
01:11:16,056 --> 01:11:19,350
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

947
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,979
Too downtown? I agree.

948
01:11:23,522 --> 01:11:25,773
M24 shotgun, pump action.

949
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,692
Five-round magazine.

950
01:11:27,776 --> 01:11:29,176
You know what? You're not a hunter.

951
01:11:29,194 --> 01:11:31,279
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

952
01:11:31,363 --> 01:11:33,823
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

953
01:11:33,907 --> 01:11:36,200
They do make something
better than waffles.

954
01:11:37,035 --> 01:11:39,161
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

955
01:11:39,246 --> 01:11:40,538
so I'm gonna put it right here.

956
01:11:40,622 --> 01:11:43,666
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

957
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:46,794
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

958
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:48,379
You're tough.

959
01:11:48,463 --> 01:11:50,965
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

960
01:11:51,049 --> 01:11:52,550
Don't let anyone tell you different.

961
01:11:52,968 --> 01:11:56,262
This is an M1347 .62 Minigun.

962
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:59,807
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

963
01:11:59,891 --> 01:12:02,018
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho,

964
01:12:02,102 --> 01:12:04,478
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

965
01:12:07,482 --> 01:12:08,566
Okay.

966
01:12:10,485 --> 01:12:14,280
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

967
01:12:15,949 --> 01:12:17,867
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle

968
01:12:17,951 --> 01:12:22,246
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

969
01:12:22,831 --> 01:12:26,334
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

970
01:12:26,418 --> 01:12:28,586
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

971
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:32,089
A book that would make Ulysses
look like it was written in crayon.

972
01:12:32,674 --> 01:12:33,924
It would read it to you.

973
01:12:34,593 --> 01:12:36,093
This is my Eiffel Tower.

974
01:12:36,178 --> 01:12:39,263
This is my Rachmaninoff's Third.
My <i>Pietà.</i>

975
01:12:39,347 --> 01:12:42,433
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

976
01:12:42,517 --> 01:12:47,229
And it's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

977
01:12:48,315 --> 01:12:50,232
I call it the Ex-Wife.

978
01:12:55,363 --> 01:12:57,281
That's the best I got.

979
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,038
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

980
01:13:04,122 --> 01:13:08,084
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
- I think I'll take it.

981
01:13:08,376 --> 01:13:11,045
- Which one?
- All of it.

982
01:13:13,006 --> 01:13:14,048
All of it.

983
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:55,089
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

984
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:57,716
<i>Better living, robust health</i>

985
01:13:57,801 --> 01:14:03,639
<i>and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.</i>

986
01:14:04,141 --> 01:14:05,391
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

987
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:09,478
<i>and everything you'll need for the future
can be found right here.</i>

988
01:14:09,604 --> 01:14:12,606
<i>City of the Future?
City of Tomorrow? City of...</i>

989
01:14:18,446 --> 01:14:19,572
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

990
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:23,576
<i>and everything you'll need in the future
can be found right here.</i>

991
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:26,495
<i>So, from all of us at Stark Industries,</i>

992
01:14:26,621 --> 01:14:28,914
<i>I would like to personally...</i>

993
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:31,750
<i>Tony, what are you doing back there?
What is that?</i>

994
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:35,462
<i>Put that back.
Put it back where you got it from.</i>

995
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:37,840
<i>Where's your mother? Maria?</i>

996
01:14:38,258 --> 01:14:40,176
<i>Go on. Go, go, go, go.</i>

997
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:44,680
<i>All right, I think we got...</i>

998
01:14:45,015 --> 01:14:46,849
<i>I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...</i>

999
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,688
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

1000
01:14:54,482 --> 01:14:59,111
<i>So, from all of us at Stark Industries,
I'd like to personally show you</i>

1001
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:00,946
<i>my ass.</i>

1002
01:15:01,031 --> 01:15:03,115
<i>I'd like to... I can't... This is...</i>

1003
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,534
<i>I can't... We have this, don't we?</i>

1004
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,621
<i>This is a ridiculous way...</i>

1005
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:10,539
<i>Everything</i>

1006
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,042
<i>is achievable</i>

1007
01:15:13,835 --> 01:15:15,711
<i>through technology.</i>

1008
01:15:28,183 --> 01:15:29,308
<i>Tony?</i>

1009
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:31,310
<i>You're too young
to understand this right now,</i>

1010
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:34,396
<i>so I thought
I would put it on film for you.</i>

1011
01:15:36,233 --> 01:15:38,067
<i>I built this for you.</i>

1012
01:15:39,069 --> 01:15:41,654
<i>And someday you'll realise
that it represents a whole lot more</i>

1013
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:45,741
<i>than just people's inventions.
It represents my life's work.</i>

1014
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,245
<i>This is the key to the future.</i>

1015
01:15:52,207 --> 01:15:57,002
<i>I'm limited by the technology of my time,
but one day you'll figure this out.</i>

1016
01:15:57,879 --> 01:15:59,588
<i>And when you do,</i>

1017
01:16:00,507 --> 01:16:02,591
<i>you will change the world.</i>

1018
01:16:04,052 --> 01:16:08,013
<i>What is and always will be
my greatest creation</i>

1019
01:16:10,392 --> 01:16:11,767
<i>is you.</i>

1020
01:16:32,747 --> 01:16:35,541
- $6. Six.
- I don't have any dough.

1021
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,209
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

1022
01:16:37,294 --> 01:16:38,460
No, it's fine. Take that.

1023
01:16:38,586 --> 01:16:40,587
- It's fine.
- No, <i>señor.</i>

1024
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:43,799
Take it. Take it.
I don't like people handing me things.

1025
01:16:43,883 --> 01:16:45,801
If you just drop that there,
that'd be great.

1026
01:16:46,136 --> 01:16:48,762
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

1027
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,639
We believe in you.

1028
01:16:51,099 --> 01:16:53,809
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

1029
01:16:54,227 --> 01:16:55,311
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

1030
01:16:55,437 --> 01:16:56,478
- Mr Stark...
- Is here.

1031
01:16:56,563 --> 01:16:58,397
- He refuses...
- I don't. It's fine.

1032
01:16:58,481 --> 01:17:01,066
- I'll just be a second.
- Listen, it's our position

1033
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:03,402
that Stark has and continues to maintain

1034
01:17:03,486 --> 01:17:06,238
proprietary ownership
of the Mark II platform.

1035
01:17:06,323 --> 01:17:09,074
<i>When Mr Stark announced
he was indeed Iron Man,</i>

1036
01:17:09,159 --> 01:17:11,327
<i>- he was making a promise to America.</i>
- No, the suit belongs to us.

1037
01:17:11,453 --> 01:17:13,329
<i>We trusted that he would look out for us.</i>

1038
01:17:13,455 --> 01:17:15,615
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
<i>- He obviously did not.</i>

1039
01:17:15,623 --> 01:17:17,916
<i>- And now we learn that his secretary...</i>
- Yes, it does.

1040
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:20,336
<i>A woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,</i>

1041
01:17:20,462 --> 01:17:23,172
<i>has been appointed
as CEO of Stark Industries.</i>

1042
01:17:23,256 --> 01:17:24,757
<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

1043
01:17:24,841 --> 01:17:25,924
- No.
<i>- Ms Potts is doing</i>

1044
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:27,176
nothing to manage this terrible...

1045
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,761
- Mute.
- No...

1046
01:17:29,596 --> 01:17:31,597
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.

1047
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:34,099
Don't tell me that we have
the best patent lawyers in the country

1048
01:17:34,184 --> 01:17:36,310
and then not let me pursue this.

1049
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:37,770
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1050
01:17:37,854 --> 01:17:40,689
Well, then, tell the President
to sign an order.

1051
01:17:41,483 --> 01:17:42,941
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

1052
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:46,028
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

1053
01:17:46,112 --> 01:17:48,989
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

1054
01:17:49,616 --> 01:17:51,867
- No, he will not. Bye.
- I would like to be.

1055
01:17:53,161 --> 01:17:54,203
- Got a minute?
- No.

1056
01:17:54,329 --> 01:17:57,039
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

1057
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,793
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

1058
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:02,544
I was just driving over here,

1059
01:18:02,629 --> 01:18:05,130
and I thought I was coming
to basically apologise, but I'm not.

1060
01:18:05,215 --> 01:18:07,976
- You didn't come here to apologise?
- Look, that goes without saying,

1061
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:09,635
and I'm working on that.

1062
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:13,722
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

1063
01:18:13,807 --> 01:18:14,973
and I just want to try to make good.

1064
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:17,393
Can I move this? This is crazy.

1065
01:18:17,477 --> 01:18:18,560
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1066
01:18:18,686 --> 01:18:19,966
- I'm trying to get some...
- No.

1067
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:24,900
Do you know how short life is?

1068
01:18:25,026 --> 01:18:28,070
And if I never got to express...

1069
01:18:28,154 --> 01:18:30,823
And by the way,
this is somewhat revelatory to me.

1070
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:33,325
And I don't care...
I mean, I care. It would be nice.

1071
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:35,077
I'm not expecting you to...

1072
01:18:35,161 --> 01:18:36,328
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1073
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:38,247
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Let me stop you right here, okay?

1074
01:18:38,373 --> 01:18:40,833
Because if you say "I" one more time,

1075
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:43,710
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

1076
01:18:44,254 --> 01:18:46,171
I am trying to run a company.

1077
01:18:46,256 --> 01:18:48,841
- Do you have any idea what that entails?
- Yes.

1078
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:51,927
People are relying on you to be Iron Man
and you've disappeared,

1079
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:55,347
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires
and taking the heat for it.

1080
01:18:57,934 --> 01:19:01,437
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

1081
01:19:05,191 --> 01:19:07,526
Did you bring me strawberries?

1082
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:12,030
Did you know that there's only
one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

1083
01:19:12,115 --> 01:19:14,408
Allergic to strawberries.

1084
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:17,953
This is progress, Pepper.

1085
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:20,789
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

1086
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:23,028
- I need you...
- I need you, too.

1087
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:25,711
- To leave now.
- That's what I'm trying to...

1088
01:19:30,884 --> 01:19:32,301
Ms Potts?

1089
01:19:32,927 --> 01:19:36,263
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1090
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:38,140
Thank you.

1091
01:19:39,934 --> 01:19:41,454
- Anything else, boss?
- I'm good, Hap.

1092
01:19:41,478 --> 01:19:44,605
No, I'll be just... another minute.

1093
01:19:45,607 --> 01:19:47,232
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1094
01:19:51,488 --> 01:19:52,571
No.

1095
01:19:54,741 --> 01:19:59,828
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?

1096
01:20:00,997 --> 01:20:03,248
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1097
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:06,251
I thought you two didn't get along.

1098
01:20:06,336 --> 01:20:09,671
- No. That's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

1099
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:12,257
- No? Nothing?
- Actually, while you're here,

1100
01:20:12,342 --> 01:20:15,427
maybe you and Natalie could discuss
the matter of the personal belongings.

1101
01:20:15,512 --> 01:20:16,970
Absolutely.

1102
01:20:23,436 --> 01:20:24,436
I'm surprised
you can keep your mouth shut.

1103
01:20:24,521 --> 01:20:25,604
Boy, you're good.

1104
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:28,273
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

1105
01:20:28,358 --> 01:20:30,192
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

1106
01:20:30,276 --> 01:20:32,528
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

1107
01:20:32,654 --> 01:20:33,695
Do you even speak Latin?

1108
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:38,534
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

1109
01:20:38,618 --> 01:20:41,870
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

1110
01:20:43,456 --> 01:20:44,873
You're good.

1111
01:21:44,642 --> 01:21:47,311
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form
a digital wire frame?

1112
01:21:47,437 --> 01:21:49,938
I need a manipulatable projection.

1113
01:21:57,238 --> 01:22:00,782
<i>1974 Stark Expo
model scan complete, sir.</i>

1114
01:22:02,994 --> 01:22:04,828
How many buildings are there?

1115
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:07,372
<i>Am I to include
the Belgian waffle stands?</i>

1116
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:10,000
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

1117
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:27,392
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.

1118
01:22:27,477 --> 01:22:30,979
In which case the nucleus
would be here.

1119
01:22:32,023 --> 01:22:34,149
Highlight the unisphere.

1120
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:47,954
- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
<i>- What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?</i>

1121
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:49,873
I'm discovering... Correction.

1122
01:22:49,999 --> 01:22:53,960
I'm rediscovering a new element,
I believe.

1123
01:22:54,712 --> 01:22:57,756
Lose the landscaping,
the shrubbery, the trees.

1124
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,175
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

1125
01:23:04,972 --> 01:23:10,977
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

1126
01:23:14,023 --> 01:23:15,190
<i>Dad.</i>

1127
01:23:36,421 --> 01:23:41,216
Dead for almost 20 years,
and still taking me to school.

1128
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:52,018
<i>The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.</i>

1129
01:23:52,103 --> 01:23:53,186
Thanks, Dad.

1130
01:23:53,271 --> 01:23:56,523
<i>Unfortunately, it is impossible
to synthesise.</i>

1131
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:04,614
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

1132
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:54,247
- I heard you broke the perimeter.
- Yeah.

1133
01:24:54,832 --> 01:24:56,750
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?

1134
01:24:56,834 --> 01:25:00,837
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

1135
01:25:00,963 --> 01:25:02,923
Hey, I'm playing for
the home team, Coulson,

1136
01:25:03,007 --> 01:25:05,091
you and all your
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1137
01:25:05,176 --> 01:25:07,096
Now, are you gonna have to let me work
or break my balls?

1138
01:25:09,305 --> 01:25:11,306
What's this doing here?

1139
01:25:13,142 --> 01:25:14,184
That's it.

1140
01:25:15,478 --> 01:25:17,604
- Bring that to me.
- You know what this is?

1141
01:25:17,688 --> 01:25:19,368
That's what I need to make this work.

1142
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:22,192
Lift the coil.

1143
01:25:22,693 --> 01:25:24,027
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

1144
01:25:24,779 --> 01:25:26,655
There you go. And...

1145
01:25:27,657 --> 01:25:29,616
Drop it. Drop it.

1146
01:25:32,787 --> 01:25:35,872
Perfectly level.
I'm busy. What do you want?

1147
01:25:35,998 --> 01:25:39,167
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.

1148
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:41,294
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

1149
01:25:41,379 --> 01:25:43,838
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
- So I'm told.

1150
01:25:43,965 --> 01:25:46,007
- Secret stuff?
- Something like that.

1151
01:25:47,385 --> 01:25:48,426
- Good luck.
- Bye.

1152
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:50,595
- Thanks.
- We need you.

1153
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,682
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

1154
01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:14,661
<i>Initialising prismatic accelerator.</i>

1155
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:23,169
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

1156
01:27:10,635 --> 01:27:11,885
That was easy.

1157
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:30,403
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

1158
01:27:32,114 --> 01:27:34,616
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

1159
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:46,378
<i>Sir, the reactor has accepted
the modified core.</i>

1160
01:27:46,462 --> 01:27:49,089
<i>I will begin running diagnostics.</i>

1161
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,304
Hey, Ivan.

1162
01:27:56,597 --> 01:27:58,223
<i>I got Senator Stern here.</i>

1163
01:27:58,307 --> 01:28:00,747
<i>Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

1164
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:03,019
The drone is not going to be ready.

1165
01:28:03,312 --> 01:28:04,521
Not ready? What do you mean?

1166
01:28:04,647 --> 01:28:08,066
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

1167
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:10,151
What the hell is the difference?

1168
01:28:10,277 --> 01:28:13,029
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1169
01:28:13,322 --> 01:28:15,156
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1170
01:28:15,282 --> 01:28:18,368
What can you make them do? I mean,
this is a weapons demonstration.

1171
01:28:18,494 --> 01:28:21,788
<i>- I can make salute.
- You can make salute?</i>

1172
01:28:21,872 --> 01:28:23,248
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1173
01:28:23,332 --> 01:28:27,419
<i>What the hell does that mean, lvan?
This is not what we agreed to, okay?</i>

1174
01:28:27,503 --> 01:28:30,130
<i>You promised me suits
and then you promised me drones.</i>

1175
01:28:30,214 --> 01:28:34,342
- Hey, man, everything will be okay.
<i>- This is not what I wanted.</i>

1176
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,065
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

1177
01:28:50,651 --> 01:28:56,239
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1178
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,577
You said it wasn't,
but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1179
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:04,581
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what? Take the bird.

1180
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:07,542
Hey!

1181
01:29:09,587 --> 01:29:12,255
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

1182
01:29:13,549 --> 01:29:15,467
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

1183
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:21,222
I took your stuff.

1184
01:29:21,307 --> 01:29:24,476
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?

1185
01:29:25,227 --> 01:29:27,896
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1186
01:29:29,815 --> 01:29:31,733
We had a contract.

1187
01:29:32,276 --> 01:29:34,110
I saved your life

1188
01:29:34,904 --> 01:29:36,905
and you give me suits.

1189
01:29:37,406 --> 01:29:39,157
That was our deal.

1190
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:41,284
And you did not deliver.

1191
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:46,623
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

1192
01:29:48,959 --> 01:29:52,295
Something really, really great
fell into my lap.

1193
01:29:52,922 --> 01:29:56,132
And if it hadn't,
I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1194
01:29:56,425 --> 01:30:00,178
Now I have a piece of Stark tech
that I pimped out myself.

1195
01:30:00,429 --> 01:30:02,180
And now your overpriced paperweights

1196
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:04,849
are gonna look like a backdrop
to my demonstration.

1197
01:30:05,351 --> 01:30:07,602
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1198
01:30:09,814 --> 01:30:14,108
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

1199
01:30:17,488 --> 01:30:19,364
I'm gonna leave now.

1200
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:22,534
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

1201
01:30:23,285 --> 01:30:25,119
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

1202
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:27,789
They are not to be trifled with.

1203
01:30:28,165 --> 01:30:30,041
When I get back,
we're gonna renegotiate

1204
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:32,460
the terms of our agreement.

1205
01:30:33,045 --> 01:30:35,129
And you're gonna make good
on our arrangement

1206
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:36,756
because if you don't,

1207
01:30:36,841 --> 01:30:39,259
you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you,

1208
01:30:39,343 --> 01:30:41,010
a dead man.

1209
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:42,512
You got that?

1210
01:30:43,472 --> 01:30:45,807
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1211
01:30:55,234 --> 01:30:57,610
Dummy, you, can we clean up
this mess? You're killing me.

1212
01:30:57,695 --> 01:30:59,135
- You know I don't...
<i>- Incoming call</i>

01:30:59,196 --> 01:31:00,947
<i>with a blocked number, sir.</i>

1214
01:31:01,031 --> 01:31:04,242
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.

1215
01:31:04,326 --> 01:31:05,846
Coulson.
How's the Land of Enchantment?

1216
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:08,580
<i>Hey, Tony, how you doing?</i>

1217
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:12,208
<i>- I double cycle.</i>
- You what?

1218
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:17,088
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

1219
01:31:17,423 --> 01:31:19,090
You sound pretty sprightly
for a dead guy.

1220
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:20,675
<i>You, too.</i>

1221
01:31:23,262 --> 01:31:24,596
- Trace him.
<i>- Sir.</i>

1222
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:28,433
<i>Now,</i> the true history of Stark name
will be written.

1223
01:31:28,517 --> 01:31:29,601
Jarvis, where is he?

1224
01:31:29,685 --> 01:31:33,813
<i>Accessing the Oracle grid.
Eastern Seaboard.</i>

1225
01:31:33,898 --> 01:31:38,026
What your father did
to my family over 40 years,

1226
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:41,529
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1227
01:31:41,697 --> 01:31:43,615
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.

1228
01:31:43,908 --> 01:31:45,241
<i>Tri-State area.</i>

1229
01:31:45,367 --> 01:31:47,577
<i>Manhattan and outlying boroughs.</i>

1230
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:49,579
I hope you're ready.

1231
01:31:52,374 --> 01:31:54,375
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

1232
01:32:04,929 --> 01:32:07,555
<i>- Sir...</i>
- You want to run some tests, run them.

1233
01:32:08,557 --> 01:32:10,516
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

1234
01:32:10,601 --> 01:32:13,441
<i>- We are unclear as to the effects...</i>
- I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

1235
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:19,525
That tastes like coconut.

1236
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:21,319
And metal.

1237
01:32:21,654 --> 01:32:23,237
Oh, wow, yeah!

1238
01:32:35,834 --> 01:32:37,669
I'll keep the car down here, all right?

1239
01:32:37,753 --> 01:32:39,045
Thank you, Happy.

1240
01:32:39,129 --> 01:32:43,925
<i>Justin Hammer. His presentation
will begin shortly in the main pavilion.</i>

1241
01:33:02,361 --> 01:33:03,611
Yeah.

1242
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:08,116
<i>That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.</i>

1243
01:33:08,701 --> 01:33:10,660
Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,

1244
01:33:10,786 --> 01:33:15,289
this country has had to place its
brave men and women in harm's way,

1245
01:33:15,457 --> 01:33:17,083
but then the Iron Man arrived,

1246
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:20,837
and we thought the days
of losing lives were behind us.

1247
01:33:21,672 --> 01:33:24,424
Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach.

1248
01:33:24,508 --> 01:33:26,843
That's not fair. That's not right.

1249
01:33:26,927 --> 01:33:29,178
- And it's just too bad.
<i>- Oh, Lord.</i>

1250
01:33:29,263 --> 01:33:31,347
<i>Regardless, it was
an impressive innovation,</i>

1251
01:33:31,432 --> 01:33:34,350
<i>one that grabbed headlines</i>
the world over.

1252
01:33:34,727 --> 01:33:36,352
Well, today, my friends,

1253
01:33:36,437 --> 01:33:39,897
the press is faced
with quite a different problem.

1254
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:42,900
They are about to run out of ink.

1255
01:33:48,449 --> 01:33:50,408
Get that out of here.

1256
01:33:51,368 --> 01:33:53,244
Ladies and gentlemen,

1257
01:33:54,288 --> 01:33:56,664
today I present to you

1258
01:33:56,957 --> 01:34:00,126
the new face
of the United States military.

1259
01:34:01,503 --> 01:34:02,795
The Hammer drone.

1260
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,758
Army!

1261
01:34:19,897 --> 01:34:21,064
Navy!

1262
01:34:31,283 --> 01:34:32,742
Air Force!

1263
01:34:40,626 --> 01:34:41,918
Marines!

1264
01:34:53,806 --> 01:34:56,432
Yeah!

1265
01:35:00,103 --> 01:35:03,022
That's a hell of a lot better
than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

1266
01:35:04,149 --> 01:35:07,026
<i>But as revolutionary
as this technology is,</i>

1267
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:10,822
<i>there will always be a need for man</i>
to be present in the theatre of war.

1268
01:35:11,406 --> 01:35:14,450
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I am proud to present to you

1269
01:35:14,535 --> 01:35:16,285
the very first prototype

1270
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:19,664
in the Variable Threat Response
Battle Suit

1271
01:35:19,748 --> 01:35:23,584
<i>and its pilot,</i> Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

1272
01:35:25,128 --> 01:35:26,260
What?

1273
01:35:48,277 --> 01:35:51,445
<i>For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries is reporting for...</i>

1274
01:36:07,588 --> 01:36:09,255
We got trouble.

1275
01:36:09,339 --> 01:36:11,048
<i>Tony, there are civilians present.</i>

1276
01:36:11,133 --> 01:36:13,759
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

1277
01:36:13,844 --> 01:36:15,136
Give them a wave.

1278
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,388
<i>Hey, all right. Yeah.</i>

1279
01:36:17,472 --> 01:36:19,515
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

1280
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,601
You gotta trust me
for the next five minutes.

1281
01:36:21,685 --> 01:36:23,769
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

1282
01:36:23,854 --> 01:36:25,897
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

1283
01:36:25,981 --> 01:36:27,607
Vanko's alive?

1284
01:36:28,817 --> 01:36:29,984
Yeah.

1285
01:36:30,068 --> 01:36:31,319
Where is he?

1286
01:36:31,695 --> 01:36:33,696
- What?
- Where's Vanko?

1287
01:36:34,156 --> 01:36:35,448
- Who?
- Tell me.

1288
01:36:36,074 --> 01:36:38,075
What are you doing here, man?

1289
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:39,827
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1290
01:36:44,207 --> 01:36:46,626
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

1291
01:36:47,711 --> 01:36:50,379
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!

1292
01:36:51,173 --> 01:36:53,454
Get out of here. Go! This whole
system's been compromised.

1293
01:36:54,718 --> 01:36:56,636
Let's take it outside.

1294
01:37:08,774 --> 01:37:10,024
No. No!

1295
01:37:19,993 --> 01:37:23,204
- Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1296
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,959
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

1297
01:37:28,043 --> 01:37:29,710
- On what?
- On you.

1298
01:37:34,716 --> 01:37:36,550
Tony, on your six!

1299
01:37:53,902 --> 01:37:56,237
- What's going on? What's happening?
- The software's been overridden.

1300
01:37:56,363 --> 01:37:57,571
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

1301
01:37:57,656 --> 01:37:58,990
- What does that mean?
- I think he slaved the drones.

1302
01:37:59,074 --> 01:38:00,157
That's impossible.

1303
01:38:00,242 --> 01:38:01,909
- Call the guards.
- All the phones are down, sir.

1304
01:38:02,035 --> 01:38:04,161
Well, then call their... Call their cells.

1305
01:38:04,246 --> 01:38:05,746
Their cell phones
are not working, either, sir.

1306
01:38:05,872 --> 01:38:07,081
He's locked us out of the mainframe.

1307
01:38:07,165 --> 01:38:08,332
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

1308
01:38:08,417 --> 01:38:10,001
Please, please, go away. Go away.

1309
01:38:10,085 --> 01:38:11,419
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

1310
01:38:11,503 --> 01:38:12,586
Yes, I do.

1311
01:38:12,713 --> 01:38:15,172
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't be happening.

1312
01:38:15,257 --> 01:38:17,591
So please, now go away. Thank you.

1313
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:20,344
Listen, we got to get
these bitches out of here.

1314
01:38:20,554 --> 01:38:22,013
What?

1315
01:38:22,097 --> 01:38:23,431
You tell me who's behind this.

1316
01:38:23,515 --> 01:38:28,060
- Who's behind this?
- Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1317
01:38:28,437 --> 01:38:31,063
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

1318
01:38:34,401 --> 01:38:36,027
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no!

1319
01:38:36,111 --> 01:38:37,391
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

1320
01:38:37,404 --> 01:38:39,280
- Don't call the authorities.
- Okay. Right away. Right away.

1321
01:38:39,406 --> 01:38:41,449
Step aside. Step aside.

1322
01:38:42,409 --> 01:38:44,076
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1323
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:54,462
- How are we doing, Jarvis?
<i>- Remote reboot unsuccessful.</i>

1324
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,481
This way.

1325
01:39:14,149 --> 01:39:15,983
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

1326
01:39:16,068 --> 01:39:18,319
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.

1327
01:39:18,403 --> 01:39:20,821
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- Fine. You want me to drive?

1328
01:39:20,906 --> 01:39:23,449
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1329
01:40:21,883 --> 01:40:23,551
Nice work, kid.

1330
01:40:25,345 --> 01:40:28,681
<i>- You got multiples coming in on you.</i>
- Let's get this away from the Expo.

1331
01:40:34,062 --> 01:40:36,480
When we arrive,
I need you to watch the perimeter.

1332
01:40:36,565 --> 01:40:40,234
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

1333
01:40:42,529 --> 01:40:45,156
- Watch the road.
- I got it. I got it.

1334
01:41:15,562 --> 01:41:16,604
Listen, listen.

1335
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:18,731
A pack just peeled off.
They're headed back to the Expo.

1336
01:41:18,815 --> 01:41:20,149
Got it.

1337
01:41:23,945 --> 01:41:25,404
I'm closing on you.

1338
01:41:25,488 --> 01:41:27,907
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.

1339
01:41:43,757 --> 01:41:46,425
- Stay in the car.
- I'm not staying in the car.

1340
01:41:46,509 --> 01:41:48,093
I said, stay in the car.

1341
01:41:48,261 --> 01:41:50,262
What are you wearing?

1342
01:41:51,514 --> 01:41:53,807
Look, I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

1343
01:41:53,934 --> 01:41:55,309
You want to help? Keep the car running.

1344
01:41:55,435 --> 01:41:56,685
Okay.

1345
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:02,483
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.

1346
01:42:02,943 --> 01:42:04,485
Hold on. Hey!

1347
01:42:49,197 --> 01:42:51,115
Each set of drones is communicating

1348
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,951
- in its own unique language.
- Well, choose one and focus on that.

1349
01:42:54,035 --> 01:42:56,036
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?

1350
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:02,084
<i>Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.</i>

1351
01:43:02,168 --> 01:43:04,420
<i>We got it. We're on our way.</i>

1352
01:43:45,879 --> 01:43:47,296
I got him!

1353
01:44:02,145 --> 01:44:04,188
- Rhodey, you still locked on?
- Yeah.

1354
01:44:04,272 --> 01:44:07,775
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

1355
01:44:09,944 --> 01:44:11,070
Wait, wait, wait!

1356
01:44:30,632 --> 01:44:32,091
He's gone.

1357
01:44:36,137 --> 01:44:38,180
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

1358
01:44:38,973 --> 01:44:40,808
What's your 20?

1359
01:44:52,445 --> 01:44:55,280
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1360
01:45:01,663 --> 01:45:02,704
Tony!

1361
01:45:19,222 --> 01:45:20,889
<i>Reboot complete.</i>

1362
01:45:21,558 --> 01:45:23,308
You got your best friend back.

1363
01:45:23,393 --> 01:45:26,770
<i>- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.</i>
- Well done with the new chest piece.

1364
01:45:26,855 --> 01:45:30,524
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

1365
01:45:30,608 --> 01:45:33,360
<i>Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.
Thank you.</i>

1366
01:45:33,445 --> 01:45:35,529
<i>What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you just say you're dying?</i>

1367
01:45:35,613 --> 01:45:37,364
<i>Is that you? No, I'm not.</i>

1368
01:45:37,449 --> 01:45:38,991
<i>- Not any more.
- What's going on?</i>

1369
01:45:39,075 --> 01:45:40,826
<i>I was going to tell you.
I didn't want to alarm you.</i>

1370
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:42,411
<i>You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?</i>

1371
01:45:42,537 --> 01:45:44,246
<i>- You didn't let me.
- Why didn't you tell me that?</i>

1372
01:45:44,372 --> 01:45:47,082
<i>I was gonna make you an omelette
and tell you.</i>

1373
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:50,127
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

1374
01:45:50,211 --> 01:45:51,795
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

1375
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:53,714
<i>- Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?</i>

1376
01:45:53,798 --> 01:45:55,007
<i>I am fine. Don't be mad.</i>

1377
01:45:55,091 --> 01:45:56,731
<i>- I will formally apologise...
- I am mad!</i>

1378
01:45:56,759 --> 01:45:59,720
<i>When I'm not fending off
a Hammeroid attack.</i>

1379
01:45:59,804 --> 01:46:01,244
<i>- Fine.
- We could have been in Venice.</i>

1380
01:46:01,306 --> 01:46:02,347
<i>Oh, please.</i>

1381
01:46:05,727 --> 01:46:07,102
Rhodes?

1382
01:46:07,562 --> 01:46:10,230
Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.

1383
01:46:10,982 --> 01:46:13,275
They're coming.
Come on, let's roll. Get up.

1384
01:46:16,571 --> 01:46:18,739
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

1385
01:46:22,243 --> 01:46:23,577
You okay?

1386
01:46:23,745 --> 01:46:25,287
Yeah, thanks.

1387
01:46:26,831 --> 01:46:29,249
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
- Don't be.

1388
01:46:29,334 --> 01:46:30,542
No. I should have trusted you more.

1389
01:46:30,627 --> 01:46:32,211
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

1390
01:46:32,295 --> 01:46:34,630
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1391
01:46:34,756 --> 01:46:38,008
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
Partner.

1392
01:46:38,259 --> 01:46:41,845
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

1393
01:46:42,472 --> 01:46:44,097
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

1394
01:46:44,182 --> 01:46:45,766
So let's put the biggest gun
up on that ridge.

1395
01:46:45,850 --> 01:46:47,142
Got you.

1396
01:46:47,977 --> 01:46:49,061
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

1397
01:46:49,145 --> 01:46:50,785
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

1398
01:46:50,855 --> 01:46:52,856
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.

1399
01:46:52,941 --> 01:46:54,316
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,

1400
01:46:54,442 --> 01:46:55,567
- all the bells and whistles.
- Yeah.

1401
01:46:55,652 --> 01:46:58,153
- It's called being a badass.
- Fine.

1402
01:46:58,863 --> 01:47:02,241
All right.
You go up top. I'll draw them in.

1403
01:47:02,325 --> 01:47:04,201
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

1404
01:47:04,285 --> 01:47:05,536
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?

1405
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:07,940
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

1406
01:47:58,339 --> 01:48:00,048
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

1407
01:48:08,057 --> 01:48:09,349
Rhodey?

1408
01:48:10,685 --> 01:48:12,185
Get down.

1409
01:48:22,405 --> 01:48:24,865
Wow. I think
you should lead with that next time.

1410
01:48:24,949 --> 01:48:28,285
Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

1411
01:48:30,705 --> 01:48:32,873
I told you that five minutes ago.

1412
01:48:34,208 --> 01:48:35,584
That's your guy here.

1413
01:48:36,919 --> 01:48:38,920
- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.

1414
01:48:39,047 --> 01:48:40,464
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

1415
01:48:40,548 --> 01:48:42,215
I'm trying to help here.

1416
01:48:46,304 --> 01:48:49,848
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

1417
01:48:49,932 --> 01:48:51,516
That's good. That's good.

1418
01:48:51,601 --> 01:48:54,561
You're starting to think like a CEO,
taking out the competition.

1419
01:48:54,729 --> 01:48:57,105
I like that. You think you're making
a problem for me?

1420
01:48:57,231 --> 01:48:58,273
I'm gonna make a problem for you.

1421
01:48:58,399 --> 01:49:01,401
I'm gonna be seeing you again real soon.

1422
01:49:05,573 --> 01:49:07,074
When they get here,
I think you should station them

1423
01:49:07,158 --> 01:49:09,993
at the south, east and both west exits.

1424
01:49:10,078 --> 01:49:12,162
We shut down the 7 train
in and out of Willets Point already.

1425
01:49:12,246 --> 01:49:15,040
Well, have city buses there
to ferry people to operating lines.

1426
01:49:15,124 --> 01:49:16,625
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

1427
01:49:16,751 --> 01:49:19,335
No, I'm gonna stay
till the park is clear.

1428
01:49:19,347 --> 01:49:20,212
Okay.

1429
01:49:21,964 --> 01:49:24,466
<i>Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.</i>

1430
01:49:24,592 --> 01:49:25,926
This one looks different.

1431
01:49:26,386 --> 01:49:28,762
<i>The repulsor signature
is significantly higher.</i>

1432
01:49:39,857 --> 01:49:41,525
Good to be back.

1433
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:43,485
This ain't gonna be good.

1434
01:49:47,031 --> 01:49:49,116
I got something special for this guy.

1435
01:49:49,283 --> 01:49:51,410
I'm gonna bust his bunker
with the Ex-Wife.

1436
01:49:51,494 --> 01:49:52,953
With the what?

1437
01:50:03,339 --> 01:50:05,841
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

1438
01:50:07,677 --> 01:50:09,261
I got this.

1439
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:04,191
Rhodes. I got an idea.

1440
01:51:04,567 --> 01:51:07,068
- You want to be a hero?
- What?

1441
01:51:07,403 --> 01:51:10,363
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

1442
01:51:10,448 --> 01:51:12,324
- This is your idea?
- Yep.

1443
01:51:13,034 --> 01:51:15,619
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!

1444
01:51:19,415 --> 01:51:20,499
Take it.

1445
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:50,487
You lose.

1446
01:51:58,037 --> 01:52:00,789
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.

1447
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:02,541
Pepper?

1448
01:52:42,707 --> 01:52:44,457
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.

1449
01:52:44,542 --> 01:52:45,959
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

1450
01:52:46,043 --> 01:52:47,460
- Look at me.
- My body, literally,

1451
01:52:47,545 --> 01:52:48,795
cannot handle the stress.

1452
01:52:48,879 --> 01:52:53,383
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself
or wreck the whole company.

1453
01:52:53,467 --> 01:52:55,468
I think I did okay.

1454
01:52:55,636 --> 01:52:57,679
I quit. I'm resigning.

1455
01:52:58,306 --> 01:52:59,681
That's it.

1456
01:53:00,266 --> 01:53:02,851
What did you just say? You're done?

1457
01:53:04,145 --> 01:53:07,647
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.

1458
01:53:08,065 --> 01:53:11,359
- You don't have to make any excuses.
- I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

1459
01:53:11,444 --> 01:53:12,569
You actually were just making excuses.

1460
01:53:12,653 --> 01:53:14,154
- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

1461
01:53:14,238 --> 01:53:15,572
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

1462
01:53:15,656 --> 01:53:17,991
- You deserve better.
- Well...

1463
01:53:18,075 --> 01:53:20,660
You've taken such good care of me.

1464
01:53:21,537 --> 01:53:23,955
I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so...

1465
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,290
Right?

1466
01:53:25,374 --> 01:53:26,625
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1467
01:53:27,418 --> 01:53:30,378
- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1468
01:53:30,463 --> 01:53:32,080
I'll handle the transition.
It'll be smooth.

1469
01:53:32,092 --> 01:53:33,131
Okay. What about the press?

1470
01:53:33,215 --> 01:53:35,091
Because you only had
the job for a week. That's gonna seem...

1471
01:53:35,176 --> 01:53:36,936
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1472
01:53:36,969 --> 01:53:38,369
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

1473
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:52,651
Weird.

1474
01:53:52,902 --> 01:53:54,422
- No, it's not weird.
- It's okay, right?

1475
01:53:54,487 --> 01:53:56,404
- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.

1476
01:53:56,489 --> 01:53:58,365
I think it was weird.

1477
01:53:58,783 --> 01:54:01,743
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1478
01:54:02,286 --> 01:54:04,746
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

1479
01:54:04,830 --> 01:54:07,332
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1480
01:54:07,416 --> 01:54:10,335
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

1481
01:54:11,253 --> 01:54:13,797
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

1482
01:54:13,881 --> 01:54:16,508
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

1483
01:54:16,592 --> 01:54:19,094
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

1484
01:54:19,178 --> 01:54:22,347
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

1485
01:54:22,431 --> 01:54:24,182
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1486
01:54:24,767 --> 01:54:26,017
It wasn't a question.

1487
01:54:31,607 --> 01:54:34,943
How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?

1488
01:54:55,423 --> 01:54:57,715
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1489
01:54:57,883 --> 01:55:00,051
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.

1490
01:55:00,136 --> 01:55:05,390
Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1491
01:55:06,642 --> 01:55:07,725
Read it.

1492
01:55:09,645 --> 01:55:13,648
"Personality overview. Mr Stark displays
compulsive behaviour."

1493
01:55:13,732 --> 01:55:15,900
In my own defence, that was last week.

1494
01:55:17,945 --> 01:55:20,780
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

1495
01:55:20,906 --> 01:55:23,491
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

1496
01:55:23,868 --> 01:55:26,703
"Textbook narcissism"?

1497
01:55:28,747 --> 01:55:29,831
Agreed.

1498
01:55:30,916 --> 01:55:32,292
Okay, here it is.

1499
01:55:32,376 --> 01:55:35,712
"Recruitment assessment
for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1500
01:55:35,796 --> 01:55:38,339
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

1501
01:55:40,885 --> 01:55:44,053
"Tony Stark not... "Not recommended"?

1502
01:55:45,264 --> 01:55:46,473
That doesn't make any sense.

1503
01:55:46,557 --> 01:55:49,476
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

1504
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,561
I got a new ticker.

1505
01:55:51,645 --> 01:55:54,647
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

1506
01:55:55,232 --> 01:55:58,151
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1507
01:55:58,986 --> 01:56:00,862
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1508
01:56:00,946 --> 01:56:04,115
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

1509
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,916
You can't afford me.

1510
01:56:15,252 --> 01:56:17,504
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer

1511
01:56:17,588 --> 01:56:20,465
in exchange for a small favour.

1512
01:56:21,425 --> 01:56:26,346
Rhodey and I are being honoured
in Washington and we need a presenter.

1513
01:56:28,182 --> 01:56:29,682
I'll see what I can do.

1514
01:56:31,393 --> 01:56:36,231
It is my honour to be here today
to present these distinguished awards

1515
01:56:36,315 --> 01:56:40,318
to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
and Mr Tony Stark,

1516
01:56:40,402 --> 01:56:43,738
who is, of course, a national treasure.

1517
01:56:45,908 --> 01:56:47,242
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

1518
01:56:47,326 --> 01:56:49,702
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1519
01:56:49,995 --> 01:56:51,996
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

1520
01:56:53,707 --> 01:56:54,999
Mr Stark.

1521
01:56:55,084 --> 01:56:59,170
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1522
01:56:59,255 --> 01:57:00,922
You deserve this.

1523
01:57:02,383 --> 01:57:04,842
Oh, sorry.

1524
01:57:04,927 --> 01:57:08,346
Funny how annoying
a little prick can be, isn't it?

1525
01:57:09,807 --> 01:57:11,599
Let's get a photo.

1526
02:04:37,754 --> 02:04:39,714
Sir, we've found it.
