1
00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:01,694
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,695 --> 00:00:04,425
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:05,295
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,461
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,462 --> 00:00:10,332
But secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

6
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,501
I fight crime and find other
meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:15,370
But I became lost in time.

8
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:17,271
It took everything in my friends' power

9
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:19,107
to bring me back, and in doing so

10
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:21,476
our world was opened up to new threats.

11
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:24,172
And I'm the only one fast
enough to stop them.

12
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:26,180
I am the Flash.

13
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,187
Previously on The Flash...

14
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:30,655
12 markers, 12 metas.

15
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,146
Your body's deteriorating faster
than the chair can handle.

16
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:34,660
I didn't just take Dominic's body.

17
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:35,713
I took his ability.

18
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:39,063
Sylbert Rundine can shrink objects
and return them to original size.

19
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:40,557
Deacon controls technology.

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,768
Becky Sharpe can manipulate luck.

21
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:44,869
There's nothing keeping him
from going in the meta wing

22
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,284
and absorbing the powers.

23
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,941
You should be able to change
into anyone you can think of.

24
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:49,874
How's this?

25
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:50,975
I believe you are looking for me.

26
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:51,769
It's Ralph.

27
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,011
Barry Allen is hereby
released immediately.

28
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,013
He only wants the bus metas.

29
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,187
He wants their powers.

30
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:58,095
Why is everyone looking
at me like I'm a dead man?

31
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,975
CENTRAL CITY POLICE

32
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:19,566
Addie, hey, what's going on?

33
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,034
I think you should talk to Kat.

34
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:22,102
About what?

35
00:01:22,103 --> 00:01:24,804
Just go see him, Allen.

36
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:27,440
Okay.

37
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:30,877
Tolerate the behavior that
the previous administration...

38
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:31,911
Addie said you wanted to see me.

39
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:33,546
Yeah, shut the door.

40
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:36,215
I promise you we will
root out all corruption

41
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:40,386
at all levels and restore your
faith in public servants.

42
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:44,658
The name Van Buren is a name
that has always stood for integrity.

43
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,659
I may be the Mayor...

44
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,528
We've got a problem that
I'm not sure how to fix.

45
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:50,397
All right.

46
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:52,532
Some people don't think you
should be back on the force.

47
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,543
Because of DeVoe?

48
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:55,868
I was cleared of all charges.

49
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:56,870
I didn't do anything.

50
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:58,237
He's alive.

51
00:01:58,238 --> 00:01:59,672
I know, and he's been cooperating,

52
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:01,174
coming in, answering questions.

53
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:02,508
So what's the problem?

54
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:04,544
Look...

55
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:07,346
People nowadays will believe anything.

56
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:09,148
Fake news, social media.

57
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,885
Allegations are treated as facts.

58
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:14,454
But DeVoe being alive?

59
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:17,123
Showing up in the courtroom
at your appeal hearing?

60
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:19,793
Some people in Central City
don't buy it's actually him.

61
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:21,094
Well, who do they think it was?

62
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:22,629
Who the hell knows?

63
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,097
But we live in a city
full of meta-humans.

64
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:26,600
It's a conspiracy theorist's dream.

65
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:27,633
So, what does this mean?

66
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:29,769
Are you... you firing me?

67
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,071
Not firing.

68
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:34,073
But I have been asked to
request that you take

69
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:36,077
a leave of absence.

70
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:38,346
By whom?

71
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:42,401
GREGORY WOLFE, WARDEN
OF IRON HEIGHTS, DIED A HERO

72
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:44,884
Thinks it'll be easier for everyone.

73
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:46,619
Restoring the faith and all that.

74
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,854
For how long?

75
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,723
Indefinitely.

76
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:52,058
Look, Barry,

77
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:53,226
if you want me to fight this thing,

78
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:54,694
I'll do what I can.

79
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,128
But this new Mayor, she's
got a lot to prove

80
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:58,398
since the Bellows debacle.

81
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,633
When do you think I can come back?

82
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:03,270
When everyone believes DeVoe
is really alive and well.

83
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,790
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

84
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:13,312
It's not permanent, is it?

85
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,881
I mean, he said it was indefinite.

86
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:16,016
They wouldn't have
given you your ID back

87
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:17,584
if it was for good.

88
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,353
I mean, maybe this is
for the best, Barry.

89
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,421
I mean, you need to prove
that DeVoe is still alive.

90
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:22,923
And you can do that now as The Flash.

91
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:24,324
Yeah, maybe.

92
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:26,159
How are we doing with him, by the way?

93
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,862
We know that we still have
four bus metas left to find.

94
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:31,197
And that DeVoe has absorbed
the powers of Killgore,

95
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,899
Hazard, Black Bison,
Brainstorm, and Dwarfstar.

96
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,301
Fallout is safe with Tracy.

97
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,437
But the Weeper is M.I.A.

98
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:38,571
Then DeVoe must have him.

99
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:39,906
Well, that just leaves Ralph.

100
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:41,341
Ralph is safe with us.

101
00:03:41,342 --> 00:03:43,076
But the other four metas aren't.

102
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:45,545
DeVoe will absolutely kill
them and take their powers.

103
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:46,946
But why does he need their powers?

104
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:47,947
I can't figure out his end game.

105
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:49,615
I don't know.

106
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:51,084
I just know that these last
four metas are the key.

107
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,185
That's why we need to find them.

108
00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:53,886
And find them we will.

109
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:55,087
Where have you guys been?

110
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:56,389
A little home away from home,

111
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,924
otherwise known as the bus depot.

112
00:03:57,925 --> 00:04:00,626
But I showed Cisco here an old P.I. trick

113
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,162
I learned from my mentor, Columbo.

114
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:05,731
Lost and found box from meta bus 405.

115
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:08,401
Question for the room,
how did I get stuck

116
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:10,103
doing the buddy system thing with Ralph?

117
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:13,006
It's the best way to
keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

118
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:15,708
Yeah, it's the best way
to keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

119
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,711
Well, clearly you've
never had to stay over

120
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:20,714
at an apartment that uses
neon beer signs for lamps

121
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:22,415
and the kitchen sink for a shower.

122
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,749
Ralph, I love you.

123
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,951
But you sleep on a futon.

124
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:26,152
Futon's not that bad.

125
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:27,320
It is when it's damp.

126
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:28,521
Why is it damp?

127
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:30,290
I sweat a lot when I sleep.

128
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,592
You nasty.

129
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:35,862
Oh, hey, my retainer.

130
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:36,863
Been looking for this.

131
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:39,966
Retainer.

132
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,267
Okay, you made your point.

133
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:42,835
Not that the point needed to be made.

134
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:44,170
I'll take the next shift.

135
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,405
You're a good man, Barry Allen.

136
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:48,875
Really? Who uses CDs anymore?

137
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:50,911
A musician trying to catch their break.

138
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:54,215
Izzy Bowen.

139
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:00,553
Country.

140
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:01,988
Music's tone deaf stepchild.

141
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:03,995
All right, remember anyone
on the bus with a fiddle?

142
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,232
There was a guy

143
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,861
with a cowboy hat on sitting
behind me. Maybe it was him.

144
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,682
Boy, I sure wish we had
a way of finding out.

145
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:10,997
IZZY BOWEN. DEMO TRACKS

146
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,036
Izzy Bowen.

147
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:25,313
THE BUSTED SADDLE SALON'S

148
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:30,483
Izzy, you wanna give
us one more mic check?

149
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:32,687
Check one, check, check, one two.

150
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:38,158
Okay, well, it's a her, not a him.

151
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,460
And she's playing a gig
at the Busted Saddle.

152
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,495
All right. Ralph, let's go.

153
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,698
No, no way. I hate country music.

154
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,833
Well, buddy system. It's my turn.

155
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:47,867
Come on.

156
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:48,836
If you insist.

157
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:22,935
She's good.

158
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:27,239
She's improving, but
she lacks refinement.

159
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,377
So you're not impressed by her at all?

160
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:34,548
The resting face of my current visage

161
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:38,885
may be more pleasant than
the one I used to display.

162
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:43,323
But I assure you, this
is not the look of a man

163
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:46,025
awed by symphonic greatness.

164
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:47,994
Clifford! Clifford!

165
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,268
This body, it's deteriorating rapidly.

166
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:57,070
The additional dark
matter in your system

167
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,639
from each of your new powers
is wearing down your host.

168
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,808
It's straining too much of
this body's new energy.

169
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:06,546
Then I must move into the next one.

170
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:08,214
But you said that Izzy
Bowen wasn't ready,

171
00:07:08,215 --> 00:07:09,749
that we needed to find another.

172
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,385
We don't have time.

173
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:14,855
We must act now.

174
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:18,125
We may be too late.

175
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:27,863
Izzy Bowen?

176
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,964
That's me.

177
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,099
My name is Barry Allen.

178
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,134
I'm with CCP...

179
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,031
Is that a label?

180
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:38,901
Maybe on another Earth.

181
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:40,669
Okay, well, you want an autograph

182
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,172
or a phone number, something?

183
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,707
No, no. Nothing like that.

184
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,443
Okay.

185
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:48,944
Well, if it ain't business
and it ain't pleasure,

186
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,580
then we got nothing left to talk about,

187
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:52,014
now do we?

188
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,217
- Do it again next week.
- Thank you.

189
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:56,252
Great work.

190
00:07:57,755 --> 00:08:00,123
Okay, I'm sorry. Let me explain.

191
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,367
Someone very smart and very dangerous

192
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,668
is coming after you.

193
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:15,070
Me?

194
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:16,073
Yep.

195
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:20,877
Okay, now, why in the name of God

196
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:23,512
would anybody dangerous
be coming after me?

197
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:25,481
Because you have powers.

198
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:26,749
Four months ago,

199
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,352
you were on Central City bus 405.

200
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:31,020
That bus got showered with dark matter

201
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:33,156
and made everyone on it a meta-human.

202
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:34,824
Now the person
responsible for doing that

203
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:37,993
wants those powers for themself.

204
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:39,929
Okay, and let me guess.

205
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,799
You boys are here to protect me.

206
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,133
Something like that.

207
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:46,569
Look, we can explain more later,

208
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,104
but now we just need you to come with us.

209
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:50,039
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

210
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,043
My daddy bailed. Mama
bailed not long after.

211
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:57,079
And I have been looking out
for myself my entire life.

212
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,848
This time it's different.

213
00:08:58,849 --> 00:08:59,849
You can't. Please.

214
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,283
We need to go.

215
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:02,652
I ain't going anywhere
with either of you.

216
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:04,120
I think you should reconsider that.

217
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:06,590
I don't give a damn what you think.

218
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,702
I guess now we know what her power is.

219
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:22,337
- What?!
- What?!

220
00:09:22,338 --> 00:09:24,441
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

221
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,572
BARRY EARDRUM
RALPH EARDRUM

222
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:29,845
You two are lucky.

223
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:31,180
Barry, your ear is almost healed,

224
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:32,949
and Dibny, yours just stretched.

225
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,950
Well, I still can't
hear all that great.

226
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,485
Consider that a blessing in disguise.

227
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:37,887
Less twang in your future.

228
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:39,755
Give it an hour. You'll be fine.

229
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,991
So Izzy Bowen can control music.

230
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:43,292
More like sound waves.

231
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,227
Soundwave. That's a great name.

232
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:48,597
It would be, if it wasn't
already taken by a Transformer.

233
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:51,100
Okay, well, it looks like
billions of tiny shrapnel

234
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:52,968
- ripped through this.
- Exactly.

235
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:56,239
Sound is just the force of
billions of tiny gas molecules

236
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,906
colliding into one another.

237
00:09:57,907 --> 00:09:59,942
So if you can harness and
amplify kinetic energy,

238
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:01,610
- you get...
- Molecular shrapnel.

239
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:02,945
Okay, well, we gotta keep searching.

240
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:04,513
If we can't track her down soon,

241
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:06,549
she's gonna fall right
into DeVoe's hands.

242
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,050
Speaking of tracking people down,

243
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:09,953
when's Harry getting back from Earth Two?

244
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,258
DA Cecille Horton.

245
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:17,693
Harry, hey.

246
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:18,728
When did you get back from the Earth?

247
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:20,062
Just got back.

248
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:21,163
Getting myself a little pick me up.

249
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:22,632
You and me both, kid.

250
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:24,901
- Okay, good talk.
- Yeah.

251
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,271
Actually, you know, I
don't think that...

252
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:30,172
pregnant people are supposed
to consume caffeine.

253
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:33,275
Yeah, doctor says
one cup a day is fine.

254
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:36,179
And lord knows I need it.

255
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,614
I need it more than you
could possibly imagine.

256
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:40,216
Apparently. Must be exhausting.

257
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:42,084
It is. He's keeping me up all night.

258
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:45,054
"He"? I thought Alan said
you were having a girl.

259
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:46,421
Yeah, and I'm not
talking about the baby.

260
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:47,390
I'm talking about Joe.

261
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:49,025
Joe is keeping me up.

262
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:52,463
No, Harry, come here.

263
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:58,667
My newfound ability to
hear people's thoughts.

264
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:01,103
- Oh, see, I thought...
- Yeah, I can hear...

265
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:04,507
Joe, his thoughts... I can
hear them while he's asleep.

266
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:06,576
- All night long.
- You hear his dreams.

267
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:09,411
Yep. And they are crazy and fast.

268
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,280
And oh so very loud.

269
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:14,950
It is like living in the middle
of an action movie, Harry.

270
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,652
I love Joe West with all my heart,

271
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:18,721
but I am telling you, I just...
I can't...

272
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:20,956
I'm so tired.

273
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:22,391
I can't take it anymore.

274
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:24,560
Yeah, well, that sucks,
DA Cecille Horton.

275
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,895
- Yes, it does.
- Okay.

276
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,832
Actually, I might be
able to build something

277
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,867
that can help you with that.

278
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:33,470
Oh, Harry, thank you.

279
00:11:36,606 --> 00:11:38,507
Satellite's been running all day,

280
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:42,511
but it's still not picking up
any irregular sound variances.

281
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:43,879
I checked the city. I can't find her.

282
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,980
Babe, you checked the whole city?

283
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:46,348
Yeah.

284
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:47,516
Look, we have to find her before DeVoe.

285
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:48,917
Her life's on the line.

286
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,018
She had another gig this week.

287
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,420
I doubt she'd skip town.

288
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,989
How would Dibny P.I.
suggest we find her?

289
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,091
Well, since you asked,

290
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,893
has anyone checked her web site?

291
00:11:57,894 --> 00:12:00,429
"Has anyone checked her web site?"

292
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,465
Dibs, of course we've
checked her web site.

293
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:07,536
No one has checked her web site?

294
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:09,104
- Iris!
- Yeah, I'm... I'm on it.

295
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,013
I'm looking now.

296
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:10,886
_

297
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,808
_

298
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:14,377
Guys, she's still in town.

299
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:15,878
"I just picked up the first
run of my next single

300
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,980
and love the geniuses at Saloon Sounds."

301
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,215
All right, Ralph. Take two.

302
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:21,817
Cisco, we might need Vibe's help.

303
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:23,285
Giddy up.

304
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:26,122
Come on, let's go. We're in a hurry.

305
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,292
Izzy Bowen, we need
you to come with us.

306
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:33,228
- Flash?
- You're in danger.

307
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:34,997
I know, everybody
keeps telling me that.

308
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:36,665
And you're gonna keep
hearing it until it sinks in.

309
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,534
You just have to trust us.

310
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:40,236
We're not gonna hurt you, but
we know someone who will.

311
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:41,837
Who is going to hurt me?

312
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,039
I am.

313
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:50,546
Y'all came to warn me about her?

314
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:53,483
DeVoe.

315
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:57,886
Hello, Flash.

316
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:00,289
You're gonna leave Izzy alone.

317
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,291
You know, you really don't
learn from our past encounters,

318
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,194
do you?

319
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:09,331
You're not smart enough to stop
me from getting what I want.

320
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,301
And what I want now is her.

321
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,572
That's not gonna happen.

322
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:18,440
It's three against one, genius.

323
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:20,676
Check your math, Vibe.

324
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:23,578
It's three against six.

325
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:28,084
Though I doubt I'll need to use
all of my powers against you.

326
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,502
You stay away from me!

327
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:58,914
You just hurt DeVoe.

328
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:04,253
Who the hell's DeVoe?

329
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:10,362
So you're telling me that
this three foot tall chick

330
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:15,501
that tried to kill me is
actually this Clifford DeVoe?

331
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:17,702
Oh, yeah. 100% dude.

332
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:20,672
DeVoe is transferring his consciousness

333
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,474
to the other bodies of
all the other people

334
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:24,543
who were on the bus and got
their powers with you.

335
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:27,313
Wait, this... this little
girl wants my body?

336
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:29,247
That's why we're trying to protect you.

337
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,850
DeVoe's already taken
most of his targets.

338
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:36,821
No, this ain't happening. Not now.

339
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,724
I only got my powers recently.

340
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:41,026
And now it's like I've
got a deeper connection

341
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:44,062
to my music than I've ever had.

342
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,165
I'm about to record the
rest of my new album.

343
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,999
- I'm about to go on tour...
- Izzy, your album can wait.

344
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,968
This threat is real.

345
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:52,003
So is my big break.

346
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:55,808
Do you have any idea how hard
I've had to work for this?

347
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,142
I left my home.

348
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,444
I lost friends and good men,

349
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:03,315
and I have put up with more
crap than you could imagine

350
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,017
so that one day I would get my dream.

351
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:09,053
And now you're telling me
that some pint-sized lunatic

352
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:11,189
is just gonna take it all away?

353
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,047
Which is exactly why we want
you to stay here at S.T.A.R. Labs.

354
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:14,993
Why?

355
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:16,895
Are y'all gonna protect me or something?

356
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:20,265
We're gonna train you.

357
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:22,667
- We are?
- We are?

358
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:24,936
Guys, her powers weakened DeVoe.

359
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:27,139
Izzy, that makes you our
best shot at stopping him.

360
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,541
No, no, this... this is all too much.

361
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,042
I don't even know who you people are.

362
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:33,445
We don't have time for this.

363
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:34,847
Flash!

364
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:39,184
You're that guy from before.

365
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:40,718
Yeah, Barry Allen.

366
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:42,921
And so are you, aren't you?

367
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:45,690
Yeah. Ralph.

368
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:47,058
Ralph Dibny.

369
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,427
I'm... Cisco. Cisco Ramon.

370
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:50,895
- It's nice to meet you.
- Okay, thank you.

371
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:53,565
Look, look, I... I don't need training.

372
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,033
Especially from you.

373
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:57,670
All I need is my life back.

374
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:01,340
I don't know, guys.

375
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:03,575
I kinda feel like if I just
followed her into that hallway

376
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,344
and just gave her one
of those "Hey, look,"

377
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:07,879
inspirational talks, I could
probably get her to stay.

378
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,314
Then what are you still doing here?

379
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:10,816
Sorry, I don't know if you, like,

380
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:12,050
drew straws for this stuff or something.

381
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,086
- No, go!
- Okay.

382
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:22,060
I'd watch out if I were you.

383
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:24,362
Sometimes killer robots
come out of there.

384
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:25,864
Keep walking, Stretch.

385
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:27,599
I don't talk to creeps in dark hallways

386
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,601
dressed in purple leather.

387
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:32,437
It's actually... more of a mauve.

388
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:35,140
And... I'm not a creep.

389
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:38,009
Look, Izzy, I know how you're feeling.

390
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,511
That day that you got your powers,

391
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:41,146
I was on the same bus.

392
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:46,184
So that evil chipmunk, she
wants to kill me, too.

393
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:47,686
Please.

394
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:50,955
I think I'd remember
seeing you on my bus.

395
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:55,960
Actually I was kind of...
big boned back then.

396
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:58,797
I was on a strict diet of
gin, donuts, and regret.

397
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:00,531
But I got another shot at it.

398
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:02,133
And I worked my tight butt off.

399
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,769
And now I'm the hottest
superhero in town.

400
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,338
Please.

401
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,673
My life, it's never been better.

402
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:10,275
Kinda like yours.

403
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,310
Yeah, but aren't you
afraid of losing it all?

404
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:14,779
Yeah, I am.

405
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,181
Which is why I'm a part of this team.

406
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:19,217
You said that your family bailed on you,

407
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,519
so I can understand why you
wouldn't trust someone

408
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,288
to look out for you, but, Izzy,

409
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:27,425
I can tell you firsthand
that these amazing weirdoes,

410
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:29,828
they won't bail.

411
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:32,898
They created a buddy system for me.

412
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:38,036
And if you'll stay,
they'll keep you safe.

413
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:40,973
I promise.

414
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:52,217
So? Who's gonna be my buddy, then?

415
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,887
I may have to pull some strings,

416
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:58,457
but I will see if I am available.

417
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,564
Subject nine's sonic powers

418
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:08,266
accelerated the deterioration
of your internal organs.

419
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:11,879
She merely disrupted my
atrial flutter and bradycardia.

420
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,505
This body is nearly drained anyway.

421
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:17,809
Its palliation is a waste of time.

422
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,979
I need these biometric scans
to fully assess your ailments.

423
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,050
Then you should have
built this to work faster.

424
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,253
I'm doing all I can.

425
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:32,491
Yet you achieved
precisely the opposite!

426
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,128
I couldn't idly stand by
and watch you be injured.

427
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,363
Your plan was failing.

428
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,901
Is it possible that the
repeated transference

429
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:44,369
has affected your cognitive functioning?

430
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:52,945
There is nothing wrong with my mind.

431
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:05,524
Next time I will keep a level head.

432
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:13,397
Izzy, this will help focus your powers.

433
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:15,133
Well, this ain't much help in a fight,

434
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,869
unless you're dueling the devil.

435
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,971
Don't think of it like a weapon.

436
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:23,207
Just do what you've always
been dreaming to do.

437
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,776
Make your own sound.

438
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:35,720
Are you my new target, Stretch?

439
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,588
Yeah, 'cause I don't break so easy.

440
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:39,624
Please.

441
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,026
You're built like a twig.

442
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:18,063
DA Cecille Horton.

443
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:19,397
You look tired.

444
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:21,833
Yeah, that's 'cause I am tired.

445
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:23,701
This thing, it doesn't work.

446
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:25,637
It works because I built it.

447
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:27,438
And this thing, as you
so ineloquently put it,

448
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,541
happens to be a mental activity dampener

449
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:32,344
that is ten pounds of cerebellum proof

450
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:33,678
anti-telepathy somani steel.

451
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,847
Thank you very much.

452
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:37,215
Yeah, that's the problem.

453
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:40,852
It is... It's ten pounds of that stuff.

454
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:41,853
So?

455
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:42,855
Oh, gee... Okay.

456
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:51,729
And?

457
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,066
I can't sleep like this, Harry.

458
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,736
Does this look comfortable to you?

459
00:20:57,737 --> 00:20:59,570
I guess I was... While I was pulling

460
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:01,305
state of the art technology out of my ass

461
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:02,840
to help you with your problem,

462
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:04,675
I forgot to make things comfortable for you.

463
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:05,777
Are you kidding me with comfortable?

464
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:07,279
You know what else I forgot?

465
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,646
I guess I also forgot
while I was coming up

466
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:09,782
with a generational breakthrough...

467
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:12,884
And vibrational brainwave theory,

468
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:14,419
that I was working for the
Princess and the Pea.

469
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,655
Stop it! Stop!

470
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:17,656
Put it down.

471
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,226
Harry?

472
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:22,260
Put it down.

473
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:27,366
Oh, okay. Just...

474
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,902
What the hell is wrong with you?

475
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:32,037
I'm frustrated.

476
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:34,572
- You're frustrated?
- Yes.

477
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:38,710
You start yelling at
me and throwing things?

478
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:40,846
It is like every awful
thought that you have,

479
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:44,015
it just comes pouring out of
your mouth totally unfiltered.

480
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,351
I don't even under...

481
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:49,787
Is this normal behavior for you?

482
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:51,389
Sometimes behavior.

483
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,125
Okay. If I wanna hear a grown man

484
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:55,761
scream like a child,

485
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:57,262
I will go home and listen
to Joe's stress dreams

486
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:58,996
about showing up naked to math class.

487
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:00,064
Just...

488
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:01,467
Take your thing, Harry.

489
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:04,336
- See you later.
- It's heavy.

490
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,742
SIX HOURS LATER

491
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:14,378
You missed. Again.

492
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,314
Well, what do you expect, Ralph?

493
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:18,750
I've been doing this all day.

494
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:19,918
I need a water break.

495
00:22:24,456 --> 00:22:25,457
Maybe we should call it a night.

496
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,991
Not yet.

497
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,626
She's barely landed
another shot on Ralph.

498
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:30,061
She needs more time, Bare.

499
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:32,196
She held her own against DeVoe.

500
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:33,798
Totally on raw instinct.

501
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,500
Beginner's luck?

502
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:37,602
I mean, it took months to train Ralph.

503
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:39,204
We don't have months.

504
00:22:39,205 --> 00:22:42,841
Look, this is our chance
to get ahead for once.

505
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:44,643
If DeVoe shows up again...

506
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:47,212
We have to be ready.

507
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:51,749
All right, Ralph, I'm taking over.

508
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:53,485
Thanks, Bare, but we kinda got this

509
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:57,221
- covered over here and...
- Gotta push her, Ralph.

510
00:22:57,222 --> 00:22:59,524
All right, Izzy, I wanna
see if you can hit

511
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:00,992
a moving target.

512
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:03,061
- Okay.
- You ready?

513
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:13,371
Nice.

514
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:14,539
Take it up a few notches.

515
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,887
Barry!

516
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,612
BUS METAHUMAN BOARD

517
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:50,878
How's Izzy?

518
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:52,279
She just needs a couple stitches,

519
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,981
but she'll be okay.

520
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:55,583
Ralph won't leave her side.

521
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,118
I think he might really like her.

522
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,919
Ralph shouldn't be
bothering her at all.

523
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,922
I mean, she needs to stay focused.

524
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,058
Izzy might be scrappy, but, you know,

525
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,055
it's her first day training with
powers she's had for a little while.

526
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:08,529
I know.

527
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,331
Barry, don't you think you're
being a little hard on her?

528
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:12,399
No, I'm trying to teach
her how to protect herself.

529
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,027
No, it seems like you're
trying to turn her into a hero.

530
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:17,237
And that path just isn't
meant for everyone, Barry.

531
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:19,841
I mean, Izzy's just trying to survive.

532
00:24:19,842 --> 00:24:21,876
Well, she's not going
to if I don't push her.

533
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,645
You think this is the
only way to fight DeVoe?

534
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:27,115
It's not just about that.

535
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:29,917
Iris, you weren't at Iron Heights.

536
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:32,720
I saw up close what DeVoe did to Becky.

537
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,256
To all of them. They...

538
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:36,724
And I... I couldn't do anything

539
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,128
except just stand and watch it happen.

540
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:43,764
DeVoe is ruthless.

541
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:48,169
He's not gonna stop until he's
taken her powers and her life.

542
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,705
He's not gonna go easy on
her, so neither can I.

543
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,545
I am so sorry that you
had to experience that.

544
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:01,582
But Barry, we can't be
ruthless like DeVoe.

545
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:06,621
He's willing to sacrifice
anyone and anything.

546
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:09,089
Just remember that the next
time you're pushing too hard,

547
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,992
okay?

548
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:13,928
You of all people know that
heroes aren't made overnight.

549
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,871
Joe's not here.

550
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:25,473
Well, I don't wanna talk to Joe.

551
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:27,975
I kind of figured after
our last conversation

552
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,645
you would never wanna speak to me again.

553
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,081
You do know I can hear
your thoughts, right?

554
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,716
Right.

555
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:37,752
No, Harry, I'm not
gonna yell at you again.

556
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:40,321
- Just...
- All right, good.

557
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:42,490
Here.

558
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:46,060
- That's the...
- Mental activity dampener.

559
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:49,230
Sorry version 2.0.

560
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,098
Just adhere it to
your supraobital ridge.

561
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:52,332
You'll block West out.

562
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,169
Look, I'm sorry about...

563
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:58,172
You know, I just recently
can't seem to stop DeVoe,

564
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,074
can't stop my daughter
Jessie from hating me,

565
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,842
can't seem to stop blowing it
when I'm trying to befriend

566
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:03,110
someone who's my own age.

567
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,612
Did you just say befriend?

568
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:05,913
That's what you've been trying to do?

569
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:07,648
You've been trying to befriend me?

570
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,251
Well, yes, through transitive property.

571
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:12,653
I respect West, West respects you, so...

572
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,523
Harry, that was borderline sweet.

573
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:16,724
Thank you.

574
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:18,825
Okay, well, let's talk.

575
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,561
When?

576
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:22,196
- Now.
- Okay.

577
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:23,731
Okay.

578
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:25,333
- I'm not much...
- Come on, Harry.

579
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:28,236
Okay.

580
00:26:30,104 --> 00:26:31,339
What do you wanna talk about?

581
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,873
Oh, okay. I'll start.

582
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,042
You wanna tell me how this thing works?

583
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:38,312
Like, does it... does it keep
Joe's brainwaves blocked out?

584
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:40,480
Does it keep my mind
reading waves locked in?

585
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:42,950
It mostly disrupts
inbound brain activity,

586
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:47,789
but I suppose actually if you
were to reverse the polarity...

587
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:53,193
Wow, that is interesting.

588
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,263
- Also.
- Yes.

589
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:56,296
Harry, you have to do that.

590
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:58,399
- Right.
- Right now.

591
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,967
- Okay, good chat.
- Yeah.

592
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,569
Okay.

593
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,773
Should be good to go.

594
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,975
Might be a little scar, though.

595
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:10,010
Wouldn't be my first, doc.

596
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:11,612
Probably won't be my last.

597
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,547
It will be, if I have
anything to do with it.

598
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,584
Why would you have
anything to do with it?

599
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:19,588
I'm gonna go.

600
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:26,060
Wh... What are you doing?

601
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,095
The way I see it, I've
gotten more hurt here

602
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:29,730
than I ever did fighting DeVoe,

603
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,366
so I'm not going to spend
another second training.

604
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:36,270
Okay, that is a really bad idea.

605
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:38,071
I've already hurt DeVoe.

606
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:40,474
By myself, without y'all.

607
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:42,243
I can do it again.

608
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,213
Izzy, the only way for you
to stay safe is for you

609
00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:46,881
to stay with us.

610
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:50,985
It's the buddy system, right?

611
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:53,854
You're not my buddy, Ralph.

612
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:56,524
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

613
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,427
Don't do this.

614
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:12,707
Sorry, Ralphie.

615
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:17,778
Initially I envisioned the
mental activity dampener

616
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,781
as just disrupting inbound
brainwave broadcasts,

617
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,583
but I talked to DA Cecille Horton

618
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:25,085
and we had the idea to invert
the polarity allowing this

619
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:28,422
to disrupt outbound brainwave
broadcasts as well.

620
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:29,086
So we...

621
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,824
We could use this against DeVoe.

622
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,393
We could use this against DeVoe.

623
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:33,860
That's brilliant.

624
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:35,562
I'm totally on board.

625
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:37,864
Except... mental activity dampener?

626
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:39,133
Ramon, the name's no good.

627
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,102
Which is why... drum roll, please...

628
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:46,240
I have decided to rename
this the cerebral inhibitor.

629
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:49,210
This is where we came up
with the cerebral inhibitor

630
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:50,745
to use against DeVoe.

631
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:53,681
What's that? What are you guys doing?

632
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,816
What are... What are those faces?

633
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,585
When Savitar came to S.T.A.R. Labs,

634
00:28:57,586 --> 00:29:00,488
he said we would build a
device to use against DeVoe.

635
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,189
The cerebral inhibitor.

636
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,891
I wish I had known that
before I spent all this time

637
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:05,159
trying to come up with the second name.

638
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,393
Naming is hard.

639
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:08,061
Okay, so we can use this on DeVoe

640
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:09,964
to keep him from projecting
his consciousness

641
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,399
- into new bodies.
- Precisely.

642
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,666
How does it work?

643
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,934
Just affix it to his forehead.

644
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:15,736
It activates. Simple as that.

645
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:16,937
I'll make a few adjustments,
you'll be good to go.

646
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:18,438
All right.

647
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:20,241
Okay, when Harry's done,
we go after DeVoe.

648
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:23,244
I mean, we have Izzy's powers,
the cerebral inhibitor...

649
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:25,045
I mean, we have everything
that we need to stop him.

650
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:26,747
Except that we don't.

651
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:28,082
Izzy's gone.

652
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,182
What? What happened?

653
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:30,084
What did you say to her?

654
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:31,785
- Me?
- Yeah.

655
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:34,254
Rookie, Homeslice hit
the road because of you.

656
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:36,524
She's convinced she can
take on DeVoe by herself.

657
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,259
That's what she's gone to do.

658
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,994
You kept pushing and pushing her.

659
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:41,595
Pushed her right out the door, man.

660
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:42,564
Okay, that's not fair.

661
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:43,730
No, it's all right.

662
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:45,165
I did, I pushed her too hard.

663
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,433
It's my fault that she's out there.

664
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,035
But if DeVoe gets to her before we do...

665
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,572
That cannot happen.

666
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:54,375
Cisco, you need to use your
ESPN and find out where she is.

667
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,443
Give me that thing.

668
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:03,984
Hey, blondie!

669
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:06,554
You want trouble? Here I am.

670
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,893
Well!

671
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,664
Look who finally decided
to show her sorry face.

672
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:23,337
Nobody likes a peeping Tom.

673
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:25,573
Good-bye, Mr. Ramon.

674
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,148
Cisco, are you okay? Can you hear me?

675
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,350
She's at the warehouse district.

676
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:37,684
DeVoe's there.

677
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:38,752
I can't go with you guys.

678
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,254
I gotta take care of Cisco.

679
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,321
All right, Ralph, it's just me and you.

680
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:42,491
Come on.

681
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,657
Bravo, Ms. Bowen.

682
00:30:48,658 --> 00:30:49,857
Of all my subjects,

683
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:51,292
you're the only one to mount

684
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,394
a credible defense against me.

685
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:57,300
Darlin', you talk too much.

686
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:07,376
A modicum of bad luck
at a time like this.

687
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:09,878
How unfortunate.

688
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,480
You're quite the fiddler.

689
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:14,849
The fiddler, Mr. Ramon might say,

690
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,885
nailed it and won.

691
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:24,026
Ralph? You came after me.

692
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:25,994
We all did.

693
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:28,329
Hey, Ralph, I'll keep DeVoe busy.

694
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,031
You just get the inhibitor on.

695
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:32,034
Hello, Mr. Allen.

696
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:34,570
DeVoe, you're not getting her.

697
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:48,784
Flash!

698
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:54,056
Poor Dominic.

699
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:57,793
He didn't know he could affect
minds as well as read them.

700
00:31:57,794 --> 00:32:01,964
Now I've taught you what a
brain aneurysm feels like.

701
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:05,000
Get out of here.

702
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:18,447
Ah, crap!

703
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:28,190
Thank you, Mr. Rundine.

704
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,663
That'll teach you to
mess with a country girl.

705
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:38,100
Cerebral inhibitor's attached.

706
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:39,468
Is it working?

707
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:40,469
Oh, it's working.

708
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:45,474
How did Mr. Deacon put it?

709
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:48,143
Ah, yes.

710
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:50,713
Call me Killgore.

711
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,587
DEVICE MALFUNCTION

712
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:56,584
The hell?

713
00:32:56,585 --> 00:32:57,986
Did she hack the inhibitor?

714
00:32:57,987 --> 00:32:59,154
No, no, no, that's impossible.

715
00:32:59,155 --> 00:33:00,588
There's a kill switch microchip

716
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:02,257
that prevents the patch from networking.

717
00:33:02,258 --> 00:33:07,062
I can hear your radio signal, Mr.
Wells.

718
00:33:07,063 --> 00:33:10,966
You told me once I wasn't
as smart as I thought.

719
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:13,636
Wrong again.

720
00:33:19,842 --> 00:33:20,843
Izzy!

721
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:31,453
- Ralph?
- Hey!

722
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:34,289
Get her out of there!

723
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,325
Ralph, we can't.

724
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:37,659
Get her out!

725
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:41,864
We can't.

726
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:51,407
Izzy, just look at me.

727
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:07,522
Izzy!

728
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,024
Keep looking at me!

729
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,053
Much better.

730
00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:44,392
Oh, please inform Mr. Ramon
that, while I had no need

731
00:34:44,393 --> 00:34:46,594
for all six of my powers,

732
00:34:46,595 --> 00:34:48,830
I now have a seventh.

733
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:52,400
I'm afraid I'm gonna be busy
with my wife this weekend,

734
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:53,369
Ralphie.

735
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,770
No.

736
00:35:33,604 --> 00:35:35,572
- How's Ralph?
- Not great.

737
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,276
This shouldn't have happened.

738
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:41,278
DeVoe wasn't supposed
to walk away from this.

739
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:42,779
Yeah, well, he did.

740
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,181
- Because of me.
- We all tried to protect her.

741
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:46,650
I built the inhibitor, Snow.

742
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:47,718
If it failed, it's my fault.

743
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,119
And I don't even know why.

744
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,687
Maybe I overestimated
the micro-combustion

745
00:35:50,688 --> 00:35:52,689
infrastructure, or maybe I underestimated

746
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,191
the amount of time between
each synapse router, or...

747
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:56,793
Maybe it didn't malfunction at all.

748
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:59,196
Guys, Savitar said that we would use

749
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:01,064
the cerebral inhibitor against DeVoe.

750
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:02,565
Yeah, he didn't say it was gonna work.

751
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:03,734
Yeah, well, it didn't work.

752
00:36:03,735 --> 00:36:04,968
'Cause...

753
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:08,171
I'm not smart enough to make it work.

754
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:09,439
Harry!

755
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,176
- Where are you going?
- Out.

756
00:36:12,177 --> 00:36:13,310
Guys, we have to find DeVoe again.

757
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:14,845
How?

758
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:16,113
Cisco tracked down DeVoe
in his Vibe state,

759
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:17,180
and he almost got himself killed.

760
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:18,948
Actually...

761
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:21,384
We might have a different
way of pinpointing him.

762
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:24,154
Check this out.

763
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:28,091
Space. The final frontier.

764
00:36:28,092 --> 00:36:29,526
Now you see it...

765
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:32,396
Now you don't.

766
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:33,430
That's exactly what it looks like

767
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:35,065
when DeVoe disappears.

768
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:38,335
That is the warping
signature of someone moving

769
00:36:38,336 --> 00:36:41,471
into a pocket dimension.

770
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:43,640
Does someone wanna
explain what that means?

771
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:46,009
Einstein postulated that it
was theoretically possible

772
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,813
for a region-specific fold
in the space time to exist

773
00:36:49,814 --> 00:36:52,982
between the four dimensions
that we typically think of.

774
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:53,917
Yeah, that doesn't help.

775
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:55,118
It's...

776
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,953
It's another dimension.

777
00:36:56,954 --> 00:37:01,091
One that you can enter or exit
at any location in the world.

778
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:03,026
Like how DeVoe captured
me in that alley

779
00:37:03,027 --> 00:37:05,729
but then he brought me back out
to somewhere above the city.

780
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,431
Are you saying that DeVoe's
lair is in a pocket dimension?

781
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:09,433
Cisco, this is great.

782
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:10,767
Can we track him?

783
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:12,802
That I'm... still working on.

784
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:13,670
Okay, work faster.

785
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,776
Just do your best, all right?
Let's find him.

786
00:37:19,777 --> 00:37:21,444
- All right.
- I'm gonna go check on Ralph.

787
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:22,513
All right.

788
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:27,483
You were right.

789
00:37:27,484 --> 00:37:31,655
As much as I wanna get DeVoe,
get back to our lives,

790
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:33,523
I can't rush this.

791
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:35,358
It's gonna be a little
hard for a speedster.

792
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,227
Especially an unemployed speedster.

793
00:37:38,228 --> 00:37:40,330
Don't worry. You're
gonna find something.

794
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:42,299
And until then?

795
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,234
You can start by kissing your wife.

796
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:52,509
Someone looks busy.

797
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,644
Yep, just a little bit of work.

798
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:55,712
Why don't you have a...

799
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:57,280
Okay.

800
00:37:57,281 --> 00:37:58,782
- Harry.
- Yes?

801
00:37:58,783 --> 00:38:00,350
- I wanted to say thank you.
- For what?

802
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:02,819
The MAD 2.0. It works like a charm.

803
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,953
I am rested.

804
00:38:03,954 --> 00:38:05,388
If you could just do something

805
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:06,690
about these swollen
pregnant ankles of mine...

806
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:07,691
I think that's a normal thing.

807
00:38:07,692 --> 00:38:09,026
Drink lots of water.

808
00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:09,994
Don't cross your legs when you sit.

809
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:11,194
- Okay.
- Okay.

810
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:12,462
Thank you for the info.

811
00:38:12,463 --> 00:38:14,065
Least I could do after all the...

812
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,067
Rage. I have a problem with rage.

813
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:21,504
Apparently it tends to crop
up when I make mistakes.

814
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:22,905
Makes it tough to be human.

815
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:25,508
Well, humans are a tricky species.

816
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:26,709
Anyway, I apologize.

817
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,478
Apology accepted.

818
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:30,647
You just needed somebody to talk to.

819
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:32,083
Yeah, well, I...

820
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:32,994
I guess you...

821
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:35,718
Are you doing that thing where
you're reading my mind?

822
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,620
You're reading my mind, aren't you?

823
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:40,223
Maybe. Yeah, yeah, I am.

824
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:41,925
You should call her, Harry.

825
00:38:41,926 --> 00:38:43,727
Jessie's on a different
planet, DA Cecille Horton.

826
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:45,495
But this problem isn't
gonna just go away.

827
00:38:45,496 --> 00:38:46,763
What if she...

828
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:49,199
What if she doesn't come?

829
00:38:50,935 --> 00:38:52,402
You're not gonna know
unless you invite her.

830
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:12,055
That was beautiful.

831
00:39:12,056 --> 00:39:15,592
And a welcome change from
the derivative pabulum

832
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:17,828
this body subjected us to before.

833
00:39:19,162 --> 00:39:21,464
Our plan is back on schedule.

834
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:23,733
Indeed it is.

835
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:26,303
Only a few more bus metas left to locate.

836
00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:53,396
Hey, man.

837
00:39:53,397 --> 00:39:54,731
I can come back if...

838
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:56,800
No, it's... it's okay.

839
00:39:59,036 --> 00:40:01,137
Look...

840
00:40:01,138 --> 00:40:04,442
I totally understand if you need
some time away from the team.

841
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:11,782
I mean, to lose someone
right in front of you...

842
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:13,650
Especially someone you care about...

843
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:18,321
Izzy was... very special.

844
00:40:18,322 --> 00:40:19,556
She was.

845
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,060
But... But now...

846
00:40:24,795 --> 00:40:27,998
DeVoe's still out there.

847
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:30,834
And until that threat's over...

848
00:40:30,835 --> 00:40:32,636
We gotta keep this buddy system going.

849
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:36,973
I thought you might say that, Allen.

850
00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:39,743
Which is why I got you this.

851
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:43,222
BARRY ALLEN
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

852
00:40:44,148 --> 00:40:45,749
You want me to be your partner?

853
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,250
Oh, hey, come on.

854
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:49,986
This... this Turner don't need no Hooch.

855
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:51,521
But...

856
00:40:51,522 --> 00:40:54,156
I do know what it's like
to get fired from CCPD

857
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:56,125
when you didn't even
really break the law.

858
00:40:56,126 --> 00:40:57,927
You absolutely broke the law.

859
00:40:57,928 --> 00:41:02,098
And I remember after I lost my job,

860
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,168
felt like I lost a piece of my identity.

861
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:08,204
And now you won't have to
deal with that problem.

862
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:09,606
So the next time we're out in the field

863
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:11,107
and somebody asks you who you work for,

864
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:13,076
you won't have to get all stammery.

865
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:16,479
You like me.

866
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,948
You really like me.

867
00:41:20,617 --> 00:41:23,153
Don't go getting all
soft on me now, rookie.

868
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:26,222
You and I, we gotta stand up,

869
00:41:26,223 --> 00:41:27,824
and we gotta fight back.

870
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:29,425
Just like Izzy would have wanted.

871
00:41:29,426 --> 00:41:31,862
That's right.

872
00:41:31,863 --> 00:41:33,997
There's three more people out
there who need our help,

873
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:37,466
and we need to find
them before DeVoe does.

874
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:39,869
And after we do that...

875
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,523
I'm gonna take DeVoe down.

876
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:45,461
