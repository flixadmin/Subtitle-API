1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,755
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,216
<i>an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:08,426
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,261
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:12,931
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,058
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed</i>

7
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,143
<i>by the body I had sworn
my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,728
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:21,106
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:22,732
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:25,777
<i>they will be
remembered as legends.</i>

12
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,115
<i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,282
I am a Time Master.

14
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,636
Making discrete alterations
to the timeline is what I do.

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,911
Half of what you've told us

16
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,955
about this mission
turned out to be lies.

17
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,959
<i>Lewis Snart, convicted of
larceny, armed robbery.</i>

18
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:44,170
<i>You and your entire family
are criminals.</i>

19
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,673
Things are complicated
with family.

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,360
<i>The Lazarus Pit brought me back,</i>

21
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:50,760
<i>but it left me
with this need to kill.</i>

22
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,262
You're Priestess Chay-Ara,

23
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:53,930
<i>I'm Prince Khufu,
and we're lovers.</i>

24
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,432
I know you're worth the wait.

25
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,813
<i>Well, I say
we kick Savage's ass.</i>

26
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,148
- For Carter.
- For Carter.

27
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:39,517
Who are you?

28
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,565
The man who's here to kill you.

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,553
<i>We've arrived in
Leipzig, Germany,</i>

30
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:59,662
<i>the most current location
for Vandal Savage.</i>

31
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,309
<i>And by the way, Captain, you are
urgently needed in the MedBay.</i>

32
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,543
- I thought she'd stabilized.
- As did I.

33
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,217
Carter! Where's Carter?

34
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,094
He's gone, Kendra. I'm so sorry.

35
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,472
Gideon, turn that
bloody noise off!

36
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:18,908
<i>- Yes, Captain.</i>
- What happened?

37
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,534
Ms. Saunders appears
to have had a complication.

38
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:22,278
Yeah, I know,
but what kind of complication?

39
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:23,937
<i>How could you leave him?</i>

40
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,107
- Is she...
- MedBay gave her a sedative.

41
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,902
But obviously her condition
is worsening.

42
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,406
Pieces of the dagger
have apparently broken off

43
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,159
and are, as we speak,
en route to her heart.

44
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:39,994
Can't we just time-jump
into the future

45
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,597
where they got the stuff
that can fix her?

46
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,141
This ship is from
that very same future

47
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,416
and has, thus far,
been unsuccessful in saving her.

48
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,919
Kendra wouldn't survive
the time-jump anyway.

49
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,004
I pay attention.

50
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:51,840
To sum up, Carter Hall's dead.

51
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,591
The girlfriend's
not too far behind.

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,886
Vandal Savage is sitting pretty
in 1975,

53
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:58,471
which we're all now stuck in.

54
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,849
That how the plan's
supposed to work, Rip?

55
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,434
Obviously, not.
But the mission is simple.

56
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,271
We stop Vandal Savage
here in the past

57
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,106
and we save the future.

58
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,553
Simple don't mean easy, Captain.

59
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,775
Oh, I never said it was.

60
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,753
The benefit of being
a Time Master is

61
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,088
that the length
and breadth of history

62
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:16,281
gives one perspective.

63
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,450
I've seen darker days.

64
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:24,497
I've seen men of steel die
and dark knights fall.

65
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:28,001
And even then, I accomplished
my mission, no matter what.

66
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,629
Gideon, what is our status?

67
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,108
<i>When the</i> Waverider
<i>was attacked by Chronos,</i>

68
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:35,717
<i>the Jumpship was damaged.</i>

69
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:37,886
<i>Unless you make repairs,
we will be unable to--</i>

70
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,345
Wait, wait. "Jumpship"?

71
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:40,781
It's a small
expeditionary vessel

72
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,223
at the belly of the <i>Waverider.</i>

73
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,142
You're a mechanic!
You have a look at it.

74
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:46,978
Auto-mechanic. Uh...

75
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:48,897
Spaceship.

76
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,484
Okay, if you've got
a set of wrenches,

77
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,652
I'll see what I can do.

78
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,864
What about the rest of us?
Do we just sit?

79
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,198
Capital idea, Mr. Rory.

80
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,165
You're not nearly as thick
as most people say.

81
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:05,747
Thick. Does that mean "stupid"?

82
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,714
Is that your son?
He looks like you.

83
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,926
Sorry. Trained by
the League of Assassins.

84
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,653
Sneaking up on people
is kind of our thing.

85
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,179
I'd like to be alone
for a moment.

86
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,182
You don't actually
have a plan, do you?

87
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,185
And that speech wasn't about
convincing us.

88
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,937
It was about convincing you.

89
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,188
Didn't work, did it?

90
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,357
Not particularly, no.
Hence my desire to be alone.

91
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:36,235
Well, we can't kill Savage.

92
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:39,049
Oh, I see you've grasped the concept
of immortality. Well done.

93
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,907
Maybe we can slow him down.

94
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,242
Ra's al Ghul taught me
a thing or two

95
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,745
about fighting
powerful adversaries.

96
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:47,872
"If you can't kill your enemy,
weaken him.

97
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,540
"If you can't cut off his head,

98
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,126
"take his heart."

99
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:54,295
Mr. al Ghul was quite the poet.

100
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,048
Back at the weapons auction,

101
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,927
Savage was trying to
sell his nuke.

102
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:03,471
Money is power.

103
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:04,806
Take away Savage's fortune,

104
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:07,892
and he's just a regular guy
with a really long life span.

105
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,516
It certainly would set
his plan for world domination

106
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,646
back a few decades.

107
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:16,067
So, where does Vandal Savage
keep his money in 1975?

108
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,545
<i>The broken knife
fragments are moving through</i>

109
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,779
her circulatory system.

110
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,072
And if you'll notice these,

111
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,907
they're closing in
towards her heart.

112
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,660
- So, what do we do?
- The fragments are minuscule.

113
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,955
Even the ship's technology isn't
capable of neutralizing them.

114
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:31,082
Fortunately, there's
a technology onboard that is.

115
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,668
The Atom suit.

116
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,962
I can shrink down,
slip into her bloodstream

117
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:38,232
and use the photon canons
to vaporize the knife fragments.

118
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:39,566
You'd be pushing
the suit's limits.

119
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,590
We should run some tests,

120
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,069
make sure
this is the best plan of action.

121
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,821
This isn't the ivory tower,
Professor. We don't have time.

122
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,406
- Listen to me, Raymond.
- I'm not your student anymore.

123
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,514
You were never my student!

124
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:47,908
Just because
you don't remember me--

125
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,934
If you had been my student,
I'd have taught you

126
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:51,821
the principles of using
scientific analysis,

127
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,604
not this bravado!

128
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,315
There isn't time. I'm going in.

129
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:02,613
Gideon, where's Savage's money now?

130
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,991
<i>Dr. Boardman theorized
that Savage entrusted it</i>

131
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:06,784
<i>to the Brümberg Group,</i>

132
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,119
<i>the oldest bank in the world.</i>

133
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:09,680
I'll go tell
the rest of the team.

134
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,122
That won't be necessary.

135
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,624
I'm going alone.

136
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,185
I can't have any more blood
on my hands.

137
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:19,589
Except for your own? You can't
go in there without backup.

138
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:23,134
Look, I brought you all with me
under false pretenses.

139
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,303
Carter would still be alive

140
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,804
if I hadn't convinced him
to come.

141
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,782
No one's on the ship
that doesn't want to be here.

142
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,725
But I can't risk the whole team.

143
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,435
Fine. Just me.

144
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,955
And if it helps,
I'm not giving you a choice.

145
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,206
I'm going with you to that bank.

146
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,356
Somebody say "bank"?

147
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,126
<i>Your services
aren't required, Mr. Snart.</i>

148
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,350
This is purely reconnaissance.

149
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:44,030
We know how to case banks.
We're practically bankers.

150
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,490
Except we take the money out.

151
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,658
Yes, and when I need someone
to steal something,

152
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,535
you'll be the first to know,
I assure you.

153
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:50,703
Listen, Englishman,

154
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,998
I'm getting bored
being stuck on this tin can.

155
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,542
And when I get bored,
I make bad decisions.

156
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,462
Now, now, now, we're all
on the same side here.

157
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,509
My hotheaded friend and I
just wanna be helpful,

158
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,965
that's all.

159
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,425
Duly noted.

160
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:10,890
You should've let me punch him.

161
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,643
Yeah, then we
wouldn't have gotten this.

162
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:15,770
Mmm-hmm.

163
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,773
- You ready?
- Yes.

164
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,713
All right, where am I headed?

165
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,257
You're exiting
the tracheal artery.

166
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,092
You should see
the first fragment.

167
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,659
<i>No sign of it. Did I miss it?</i>

168
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:48,838
It's the size of an iceberg.

169
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,850
It seems highly unlikely
that you could miss it.

170
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,173
That's probably what they said
on the <i>Titanic.</i>

171
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,143
I think I found it.

172
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,372
Looks like all those years
of playing <i>Asteroids</i>

173
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,397
is about to pay off.

174
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,532
Her vitals are improving.
It seems to be working.

175
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,331
There are still
19 more fragments.

176
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,169
<i>Raymond. Raymond,
you're not done.</i>

177
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,671
I'm losing core containment.

178
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,631
Plot me a course
out of here, now!

179
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,820
Excuse me.

180
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,823
We'd like to deposit
some family heirlooms.

181
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,950
I'm sorry, we're a private bank.

182
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,995
We don't secure valuables
worth less than $10 million.

183
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,872
Well, I'm sure
this will suffice.

184
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,223
<i>Doubloons from the
wreck of the</i> Esplinade.

185
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,296
They've been appraised
at $10 million, apiece.

186
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,930
Such a pleasure.
You won't regret your decision.

187
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,433
The Brümberg Group is known
for its discretion.

188
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,912
I'm sure there'll be a fair deal
of paperwork to sign.

189
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,772
Not too much. We like to
cut through the red tape here.

190
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,066
Let me get this to one of
our safe deposit boxes,

191
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,902
and I'll get my secretary
moving on this paperwork.

192
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:40,498
Interesting.

193
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:42,425
There are records here
referring to something

194
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,668
called the Vessel.

195
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,336
We have a problem.

196
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,314
Yes, I know. None of
Savage's funds are in this bank.

197
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,006
I'm working on
locating this Vessel,

198
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,485
but I'm not sure if I'll do so
before our new friend returns.

199
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,718
To kill us.

200
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,554
The receptionist had
a silent Beretta under her desk.

201
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,390
<i>The guards,
South African mercenaries.</i>

202
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,558
<i>You can tell by the
initiation burns on their neck.</i>

203
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,228
<i>And our new friend here
has calluses on his right hand</i>

204
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:04,355
consistent with being
a Kuroda-trained swordsman.

205
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,523
How do you know?

206
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,983
Because I have
the same calluses.

207
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,543
Which means
they've probably figured out

208
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,152
that we are not Rockefellers

209
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,759
who just came into
their inheritance.

210
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:12,862
Oh, don't be so alarmist.

211
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,909
Calluses are hardly
definitive proof of anything.

212
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,659
Pretty sure they made us.

213
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,684
Well, if this is how
you treat your customers,

214
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,710
we might just have to take
our business elsewhere.

215
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:30,047
I thought I specifically
said "no weapons."

216
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,424
You can thank me later.

217
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:43,894
Exactly how many knives
do you have?

218
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,857
Seems you brought a knife
to a sword fight.

219
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,588
Sara.

220
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,759
Sara. Sara, don't!

221
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,194
I didn't get anything
from the computer.

222
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,303
We need him alive!

223
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,408
What the hell
happened back there?

224
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,077
You know I'm a killer.

225
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,923
That's why you put me
in your little group.

226
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,789
I didn't witness just
a killer at work, Sara.

227
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,123
What I saw was an animal.

228
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,918
You are the last person
on this ship to judge anyone!

229
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,171
This is not judgment, Sara.
It is concern.

230
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,675
I thought you knew
how I was resurrected

231
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,636
and what it did to me.

232
00:11:58,803 --> 00:11:59,946
I know you were
restored by something

233
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,971
called the Lazarus Pit.

234
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,807
Well, apparently,
there's a downside

235
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,642
to being brought back to life.

236
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,979
My friend Thea
calls it a bloodlust.

237
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,650
And I think that's being
too generous.

238
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:15,361
And so is calling me an animal.

239
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,656
I'm a monster.

240
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,996
- Ah! Nice ride.
- Huh.

241
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:29,333
Yeah, it can hit a Mach 3
in a walk. Pretty cool.

242
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,001
How do you know
so much about it?

243
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,712
Little thing called
an instruction manual.

244
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,048
Did you read the part
about how to fly this thing?

245
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,551
Maybe. Why?

246
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,011
We're gonna take a
little sojourn to Central City.

247
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,388
There's a priceless jewel

248
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,723
that needs to be freed
from captivity.

249
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,810
You want me to help you steal
something. No, man, I'll pass.

250
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,021
Not exactly asking, Jax.

251
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:55,067
Wow. Carter is dead. Kendra is
this close to joining him,

252
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:56,514
and Vandal Savage is still alive

253
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,529
and out there doing
God-knows-what.

254
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,901
And all you can think about
is stealing some diamond?

255
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,116
It's an emerald.

256
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:05,369
Is there anything you think
about other than yourself?

257
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:06,996
Yes, money.

258
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,375
No, I'm not helping you guys
steal anything.

259
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,502
So, if you want to shoot me,
then shoot me.

260
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,712
Can I shoot him?

261
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,214
You got a pair on you, kid.
I respect that.

262
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,716
So, no shooting.

263
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:22,386
Look, you don't actually have to
help us steal anything.

264
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,472
We just need to
get to Central City.

265
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,040
We'll be there and back before
anyone knows we're even gone.

266
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:31,729
Man, even if I wanted to help,
and I'm not saying that I do,

267
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,231
this thing's got
a security lock-out.

268
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,900
<i>We need an access key.</i>

269
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,279
You can't tell me you don't wanna see
what this baby can do.

270
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:47,203
I believe I've determined a way
to more efficiently track

271
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,246
the fragments still inside
Ms. Saunders' body.

272
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,081
Next time,
you'll be better prepared.

273
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,416
There won't be a next time.

274
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,751
Can't you fix the suit?

275
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,252
It's not the suit.

276
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,922
Raymond, you mustn't
be discouraged.

277
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,842
We're scientists. We learn
from failure and we keep going.

278
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,809
Kendra isn't a lab experiment.
She's a person.

279
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,095
I know.

280
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:09,099
You need to have confidence
this will work.

281
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,353
Well, I don't. I can't save her.

282
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,773
Based on what evidence?
Are we not empirical thinkers?

283
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,609
Dr. Palmer, exactly
how many people have you lost?

284
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:22,571
One.

285
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,866
Who did you lose?

286
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,577
<i>Someone close to you.</i>

287
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,748
Who was she, Raymond?

288
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,377
For someone who
doesn't remember me,

289
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:39,129
you sure have a lot of
personal observations to offer.

290
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,383
Fine.

291
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:46,595
Don't talk to me,
but fix the suit.

292
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,432
It's the only chance
that poor girl has.

293
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,945
I'm gonna make this very simple
for you, Mr. Blake.

294
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,323
You tell me where Vandal Savage
is hiding his fortune,

295
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,826
and we will let you
leave here unmolested.

296
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,619
"Vandal Savage."

297
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,664
Is that the name
you know him by?

298
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,750
Let's assume so, yes.

299
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:20,045
And what is your name, Gareeb?

300
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,340
- Will you give us a moment?
- "Gareeb"?

301
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,843
It's a legend passed down
for 4,000 years,

302
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,303
<i>when my master
was first bestowed</i>

303
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,096
the gift of eternal life.

304
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,931
<i>An enemy tried to kill him.</i>

305
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,184
<i>Every myth has
its monster, its devil.</i>

306
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,022
For those of our order,
it's him. The Gareeb.

307
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,749
I would stop talking now
if I were you, mate.

308
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,275
If I were you, I'd run.

309
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,819
Your friend has already failed
to kill my master once.

310
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,821
He won't be able to protect you.

311
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,197
In fact,

312
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,326
I highly doubt he's ever
been able to protect anyone.

313
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,045
What did he mean you already
tried to kill Savage?

314
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,379
Leave it be, Sara.

315
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,214
No, if you want us to do this--

316
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,741
Yes, okay? Yes, I had the chance
to kill Savage once before.

317
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,511
I had him dead to rights,
and I hesitated.

318
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:31,075
Get off me!

319
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,369
I asked you a question!

320
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,039
Who are you, Gareeb?

321
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:42,002
Killing is never easy,
especially for a good man.

322
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,421
The man killed my wife and son,

323
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,308
and God knows how many
other wives and sons,

324
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:47,424
and yet I couldn't...

325
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,595
Killing people doesn't
make you a monster, Sara.

326
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:55,224
But having the chance to avenge
your family and not taking it,

327
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,768
that does.

328
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,801
<i>Let's try this again.</i>

329
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,471
Back for more.

330
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,849
Where's Savage's fortune?

331
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,255
And I'm particularly interested

332
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,852
in this thing
called the "Vessel."

333
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,481
The Vessel is my master's
most treasured possession.

334
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,150
Excellent. And where can we find it?

335
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,693
The Greyhill Building.

336
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,529
There's a gathering tonight
in celebration of it.

337
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,657
And clearly, you want us to go
so we can get ourselves killed.

338
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:55,868
Clearly.

339
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,286
What is the Vessel?

340
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:59,830
It's the remains of Prince Khufu
of the Middle Kingdom.

341
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,791
I believe you know him
as Carter Hall.

342
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,964
What is Savage going to do
with Carter's body?

343
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,009
Well, there's only one way
to find out, isn't there?

344
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,679
Gideon, locate the Greyhill
Building, and set a course.

345
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,849
Wait, we have a plan.
Going after Savage's fortune.

346
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,058
Well, not anymore.

347
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,020
I won't let Carter's remains
be desecrated by that monster.

348
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,438
I won't let him win again.

349
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,608
And when Kendra wakes up,
and she will wake up,

350
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,502
she can give her soul mate
a proper farewell.

351
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,488
Then let us at least go in
with the rest of the team.

352
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,448
Hmm. Gideon.

353
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,034
<i>Sir, Mr. Snart, Mr. Rory
and Mr. Jackson</i>

354
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,869
<i>are no longer aboard the ship.</i>

355
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,871
That's what I call
a clean heist.

356
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,208
And thanks for not setting
the museum on fire, partner.

357
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,044
And you, thanks for being
our getaway driver.

358
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,131
Speaking of, let's get the hell
back to the ship.

359
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,547
No. One more stop.

360
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,609
What are you
talking about, boss?

361
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,635
1629 Hadley Avenue.

362
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,886
What's on Hadley Avenue?

363
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,387
It's where we grew up.

364
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,681
That's why you wanted to
steal the Maximilian Emerald.

365
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,016
Mick, enough!

366
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,368
You wanted to give it
to your old man,

367
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,853
so he wouldn't go to jail
trying to steal it for himself.

368
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,897
Your father was a thief too?

369
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,066
And unfortunately,
not a very good one.

370
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,377
Didn't Rip say something about
not messing with the timeline?

371
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,404
You could accidentally
blink yourself out of existence.

372
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,657
You're screwing
with history here, man.

373
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:19,409
Yeah, well, history
screwed with me first.

374
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,585
I know how it feels.

375
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,754
What?

376
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,339
To have a crisis of confidence,

377
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,925
as unlikely as that
may seem, I know.

378
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:39,096
It was 2002. I was teaching
quantum mechanics.

379
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:42,599
And I had one particularly
gifted student.

380
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,602
He was able to
solve the Ehrenfest Theorem

381
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,604
in less than an hour.

382
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,546
He was quite frankly
the only student

383
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,692
in all my years of teaching

384
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,570
who ever made me feel inferior.

385
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,282
That student was you.

386
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,077
You were exceptional.

387
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,286
Suddenly, just like that,

388
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,852
you remember having me
in your class?

389
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,123
I always remembered.

390
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,458
I just enjoyed taking you down
a peg or two.

391
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,253
Why tell me now?

392
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,255
Because I cannot
for the life of me reconcile

393
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:16,133
that cocksure student I remember

394
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,385
with the man who believes
he doesn't have

395
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,888
what it takes to save
Ms. Saunders' life.

396
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,640
Who did you lose, Raymond?

397
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,228
My fiancée, Anna Loring.

398
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:32,065
She was killed two years ago
in the Starling City Siege,

399
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,442
right in front of me.

400
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,278
<i>I couldn't stop them.
I couldn't do anything.</i>

401
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,655
My leg had been broken.
I couldn't get to her.

402
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,574
I could only watch

403
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,286
as they broke her neck.

404
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,749
I built the suit because
I promised myself that night

405
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,169
that I would never be powerless
to save anyone again.

406
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,589
So when that fragment broke free
and damaged my suit, I

407
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:57,674
panicked,

408
00:20:58,675 --> 00:20:59,843
froze.

409
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,181
Raymond, you couldn't save Anna,

410
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,018
but you can save Kendra.

411
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,439
I believe it.
I believe in that student.

412
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,360
I just need him
to believe it too.

413
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,871
Let's do it.

414
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,884
Ah, Mr. Blake, welcome. I take it
Mrs. Blake is out of town.

415
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,557
That's a very
pointed observation.

416
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,902
If you're going to find
the Vessel, you'll need my help.

417
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,321
No, I think we're
quite good without it.

418
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:02,864
Sara.

419
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,581
<i>I came down
for a glass of water.</i>

420
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,461
I am Leo.

421
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,255
Are you friends with my daddy?

422
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,716
Kind of.

423
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,885
I think my daddy's sleeping.

424
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,310
Can I tell you something, Leo?

425
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:15,812
It's important.

426
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:21,318
Don't ever let anyone
hurt you. Ever.

427
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,406
Not here. And especially,

428
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:28,742
not here.

429
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:35,123
No matter what, you always have
to look out for yourself, okay?

430
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,626
Understand?

431
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:39,753
I think so.

432
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,090
You get the hell away from
my boy, you son of a bitch.

433
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,888
Why don't you go on up to bed?

434
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:51,807
<i>Go on.</i>

435
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,282
Talk fast, or you take a bullet.

436
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,284
What are you doing in my home?

437
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,829
A favor. For you.

438
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,540
Watch it.

439
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,042
Relax.

440
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,416
How the hell did you get--

441
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,171
Two days from now, you try to
steal this and you get arrested

442
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,799
and you spend five years
in Iron Heights.

443
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,551
What are you talking about?

444
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:28,718
Cut the crap.

445
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,971
We both know if I go down
to the basement right now,

446
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,557
I'll find floor plans
for the Central City Museum.

447
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,393
Let's just say
I've saved you the trouble

448
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,353
and from being arrested.

449
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:40,647
How do you know all this?

450
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,233
The same way I'll know if you
even think of raising a hand

451
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,901
to your wife and son.

452
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:48,405
I know who you are.
I know the man you become.

453
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:49,739
<i>And it's all I can do to keep</i>

454
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,408
from ending you
right here, right now.

455
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:52,993
But if I do, that means

456
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,371
my sister's never born,
so you get a pass.

457
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,710
Your sister?

458
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,359
Looks like you didn't write
yourself out of the timeline.

459
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:09,843
- Looks like.
- But?

460
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,237
I don't know.
I just thought maybe

461
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,596
things would feel differently.

462
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,015
The Englishman says it takes
time for time to change.

463
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,725
What were you trying to change?

464
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,244
My dad was never
Father of the Year,

465
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:20,770
but at least he never raised
a hand to any of us.

466
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:24,691
Until he went to prison,
which now he won't.

467
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,568
Let's get out of here.

468
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,697
Maybe we should've had Blake
show us around.

469
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:31,948
Hmm.

470
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,742
Perhaps there's
a less conspicuous way

471
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,785
for us to do reconnaissance.

472
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,287
May I?

473
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:40,248
I'm not much of a dancer.

474
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:41,583
I'll lead then.

475
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,806
Well, for a monster, you dance
quite gracefully, Ms. Lance.

476
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,808
- Don't make fun.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

477
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,102
Nor do I consider you a monster.

478
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,980
All I see is someone
who's tortured

479
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,982
by an appetite that
she cannot control.

480
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,069
There's no magical cure
for what's wrong with me.

481
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,987
Of course there is!
It's called "being better."

482
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,014
When my family was killed,
I thought

483
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,326
there was no way
that I could go on.

484
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,161
But I did.

485
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,597
The truth of our existence
is that

486
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,741
we're all blessed and cursed

487
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,084
with the drive to move forward,
live the next day.

488
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,003
To get better.

489
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:29,965
And you will too, Sara.

490
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:41,351
Well, maybe I can start by
managing not to kill these guys.

491
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,812
They're scarred up
like our friends at the bank.

492
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,857
South African mercenaries.
Why didn't you say so?

493
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,609
Ladies first.

494
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,453
This area's restricted, folks.

495
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,706
I'm just looking
for the ladies' room.

496
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,407
Hope you have a plan
to get him out of here.

497
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:28,874
Yep, there's
a maintenance elevator

498
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,025
that leads to a loading bay.

499
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,068
I'll have Gideon
fly the <i>Waverider</i> down.

500
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:35,030
I just wish we knew what Savage
was gonna do with Carter's body.

501
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,324
Why not stay and find out?

502
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:42,162
Ah, the Gareeb. Mr. Blake
has told us so much about you.

503
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,420
I've located three fragments.

504
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:55,216
Okay, I see them.
Man, they're big!

505
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,386
Remember, the initial blast
will create smaller pieces.

506
00:27:58,553 --> 00:27:59,553
You need to--

507
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,240
<i>How does Jax put up with
having you in his head?</i>

508
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:04,017
I believe he finds my presence
rather comforting.

509
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,769
I doubt that very much.

510
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,901
The targeting system's
overloaded.

511
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,653
Focus, Raymond.
Remember, you can do this.

512
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,782
It's not the suit. It's you
that Kendra needs right now.

513
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,957
Well done!
Just one more fragment to go.

514
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,419
I see it.
It's the biggest one yet.

515
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,009
You did it!

516
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:55,443
Well done. I couldn't possibly
be more proud.

517
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:56,903
Well, maybe if you actually

518
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,947
remembered me
being your student.

519
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,158
Right around the subclavian
artery, I remembered something.

520
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,261
How I figured the solve
for the Ehrenfest Theorem

521
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,454
two years after I was
in your class.

522
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,783
Why did you tell me you
remembered me when you didn't?

523
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,333
Because you needed a push.

524
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,353
So all that stuff about me
being exceptional...

525
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,962
Was probably true.

526
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,047
The fact of the matter is

527
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,800
I had many exceptional students
over the years.

528
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,261
I couldn't possibly
remember them all.

529
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:22,971
I was pretty amazing.

530
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,639
If that were true,

531
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,606
I suspect I would've given you
a higher grade.

532
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,935
I meant tonight.

533
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,645
Oh, yes.

534
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,566
On that score,
I cannot disagree.

535
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,954
What are you planning on doing
with Carter's body?

536
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,915
Oh. You'll see. Mr. Blake informs us

537
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:53,082
<i>that you were hoping to steal
our master's fortune.</i>

538
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,919
<i>But while money has its uses,</i>

539
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,838
it is not the source
of his power.

540
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,089
Then what is?

541
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,424
Let us show you.

542
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,972
Our numbers are legion,

543
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:09,976
all drawn to the man
who is immune to death.

544
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,604
Wealth is not power.

545
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,316
Belief is.

546
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,082
Hello, Gareeb.

547
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:38,296
How long has it been?
4,000 years?

548
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,548
You look well.

549
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:51,100
When you and your friends
attacked my estate in St. Roch,

550
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:55,063
I was afraid I wouldn't get the
chance to meet you once again.

551
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:59,984
Well, if there's something that
I've learned in 4,000 years,

552
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,445
it's patience.

553
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:06,115
And this time, I only
had to wait one short day.

554
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,288
You're probably wondering
what my plans are

555
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,999
with your friend's body.

556
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,460
I already have
his life's essence,

557
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:20,922
but his blood still
has its uses.

558
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,973
Jack the Ripper
showed me the virtues

559
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,976
of severing the carotid artery.

560
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:37,981
Okay, what's this now?

561
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,874
Centuries ago, I discovered that

562
00:31:57,041 --> 00:32:00,336
although immortality
is mine alone,

563
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,508
I can share a taste
with my faithful,

564
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:09,304
help them live
an extra 100 years or so.

565
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:28,990
They're in trouble.

566
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:30,908
She appears to be hallucinating.

567
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:34,579
Rip and Sara, you have to
save them. Vandal. Carter!

568
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:37,540
Greyhill Building.
Carter, Rip, Sara!

569
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,877
Gideon, search
"Greyhill Building."

570
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,896
<i>I've already searched for it
on behalf of the captain,</i>

571
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,422
<i>who's there now with Ms. Lance.</i>

572
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:45,923
What? They left without us?

573
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,730
<i>It's a mansion
several miles away.</i>

574
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,528
<i>Apparently, there's some
sort of private event.</i>

575
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:51,512
How the hell could Kendra
know that they're there?

576
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,399
You have to save them!

577
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:56,392
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

578
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:03,441
When we first met, I asked you
who you were, remember?

579
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,069
That was the wrong question.

580
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:11,407
I should've asked you why.
Why did you seek to kill me?

581
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,868
What could I have
possibly done to deserve

582
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,745
that hatred I see
burning in your eyes?

583
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:17,789
Did I take something from you?

584
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,416
Someone?

585
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:28,591
Get your hands off that.

586
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:32,261
Oh. Your wife, I take it.

587
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:35,431
Oh, she is lovely.

588
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,600
The boy has your eyes.

589
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:41,270
I'll be sure to
keep their picture close.

590
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,940
I don't remember killing them

591
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,275
yet.

592
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:51,114
It seems like I have
a lot to look forward to.

593
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,077
- Gideon, get me Jefferson.
<i>- Mr. Jackson is not aboard.</i>

594
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,453
Oh, don't tell me.

595
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,765
<i>He's with Mr. Snart
and Mr. Rory on the Jumpship.</i>

596
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,082
<i>I'm patching you through.</i>

597
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,333
Jefferson?

598
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,252
<i>Jefferson, where are you?</i>

599
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,838
Well, it's not a short story.

600
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,774
<i>There's no time.
Gideon will upload you</i>

601
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,508
<i>coordinates to
the Greyhill Building.</i>

602
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:12,468
Rip and Sara are in danger.

603
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:15,263
We're on our way, Professor.

604
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:16,973
This is a perversion.

605
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:22,311
No, this is the power
you have no hope of defeating.

606
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:27,483
Everyone here has sworn to live
and die at my command!

607
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:31,154
Why? 'Cause to them, I am a God!

608
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,366
I pity you.

609
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,619
You have no idea
what it's like to have people

610
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:42,457
willing to follow you up
to the gates of hell.

611
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:47,795
Actually, I have
a little bit of an idea.

612
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,301
Let's get this party started!

613
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:54,802
Here's our invitation.

614
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,715
Well, this is different.
I didn't have you

615
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,871
pegged as the
<i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> type.

616
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,168
- Gun.
- Here.

617
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,260
You came.

618
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,679
We're a team.
Next time, remember that.

619
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:40,681
Enough!

620
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,522
Get Carter's body
out of here. Sara.

621
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,773
I got this.

622
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:12,922
Go. I'll deal with Savage.

623
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,465
Good luck with that.

624
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,619
This is for Miranda and Jonas!

625
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,294
At least I know their names now.

626
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:54,630
Miranda and Jonas.

627
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:55,798
Jonas.

628
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:05,975
I will heal,
and then I will rise.

629
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,020
Then I will simply wait.

630
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:13,983
I am looking forward
to meeting them.

631
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,994
Sara. Sara. Sara!

632
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:41,636
Gideon, I need a check
of the timeline. Vandal Savage.

633
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,482
<i>The timeline is
unchanged, Captain.</i>

634
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,657
<i>You know better than anyone
that Savage is immortal.</i>

635
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,600
<i>He cannot be killed
through conventional means.</i>

636
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,494
Which is why I need
you to work on finding out

637
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,854
where history records
seeing him next.

638
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,315
- How is she?
- Better.

639
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:58,819
Thank you for
what you did for Carter.

640
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,489
Oh. Believe me,
it was a team effort,

641
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:03,699
as was apparently your recovery.

642
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:06,452
Oh, well, actually, I did most
of the physical work,

643
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,955
and the professor was there
for emotional support.

644
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:10,373
You're welcome.

645
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:12,625
Now if we could
just figure out a way

646
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,962
to wrest the Amon Dagger
out of Savage's hand into yours.

647
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:19,215
I don't think I'm exactly up to
taking him on right now.

648
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:23,302
No, but you will be.
And we'll help you get ready.

649
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,979
Maybe you didn't understand me.

650
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,022
<i>I asked for
the new timeline, Gideon.</i>

651
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,025
<i>This is the new timeline.
Two days from now,</i>

652
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,312
<i>your father will be arrested</i>

653
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:40,842
<i>trying to sell
the Maximilian Emerald</i>

654
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,183
<i>to an undercover police officer.</i>

655
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,073
Stupid son of a bitch.

656
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,534
<i>He'll be sentenced to five years
in Iron Heights.</i>

657
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:49,495
<i>Despite your intervention,
his future remains unchanged.</i>

658
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,624
Hey, you tried to save him.

659
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,002
That's gotta count
for something.

660
00:38:56,794 --> 00:38:58,337
Turns out it doesn't.

661
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,631
Come on.

662
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:02,174
Where are we going now?

663
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,427
To say goodbye.

664
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:13,394
Uh...

665
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,857
The other day, I tried to find
some words of inspiration.

666
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:22,737
Words that would restore hope
to us in the wake of our losses.

667
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:27,241
But it is all of you who
have inspired me.

668
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,911
Beginning with Professor
Boardman, and then with Carter.

669
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,622
Their heroism is

670
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:36,333
an inspiration to us all,

671
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,586
<i>and a reminder</i>

672
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,881
that one person acting alone
can't save the world.

673
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:11,827
Come back to me.

674
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:19,835
Thank you.

675
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,296
Both of you.

676
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,924
Sorry for your loss, Kendra.

677
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,014
I believe Anna would be proud,

678
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:33,724
as am I.

679
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,316
Gideon, ready us for takeoff.

680
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,128
Whoa. Are we being chased
or something?

681
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:46,112
No, but I imagine that
right about now,

682
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,548
the museum has realized that
their prized emerald is missing.

683
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:50,032
You want me to say "I'm sorry"?

684
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,076
Sorry, I don't do sorry.

685
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:56,122
Which is fine, Mr. Rory, because
you are owed the apology.

686
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,404
<i>I should've told you all before</i>

687
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,684
that this wasn't
my first attempt

688
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,377
to vanquish Vandal Savage.

689
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:03,408
But the reason I failed before--

690
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:05,172
Was because you
didn't have all of us.

691
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:08,092
Well, obviously, Dr. Palmer
and I had our hands full

692
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:11,387
tending to Ms. Saunders, but now
that she's back on her feet--

693
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:12,674
We're back to full strength.

694
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,266
Or as strong as we can be
without Carter.

695
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:17,726
Quite true.

696
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:21,063
But there is no point in us
continuing any further

697
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:25,067
unless we are all,
and myself included,

698
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:29,029
committed to working in concert.

699
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,449
You don't ditch us,
we won't ditch you. Deal?

700
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:35,536
<i>Sir, I've completed
my review of the timeline.</i>

701
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:40,207
<i>I calculate a 98% likelihood
that Savage reappears in 1986.</i>

702
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,084
Chart a course, Gideon.

703
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,461
Guess we're headed to the '80s.

704
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:46,130
Better break out
your parachute pants.

705
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:47,617
What the hell are
parachute pants?

706
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:30,174
