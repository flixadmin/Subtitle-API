1
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,635
Legend tells of a legendary warrior,

2
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,847
whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,768
He travelled the land
in search of worthy foes.

4
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,030
I see you like to chew.

5
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,284
Maybe you should chew on my fist.

6
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,621
The warrior said anything
for his mouth was full.

7
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,748
Then he swallowed.

8
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,586
And then he spoke.
Enough talk. Let's fight.

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,843
He was so deadly in fact,
that his enemies will go blind,

10
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,512
from over exposure to pure
awesomeness.

11
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,598
My eyes!
He's too awesome!

12
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,309
And attractive.
How can we re-pay you?

13
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,437
There is no charge for awesomeness.

14
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,689
Or attractiveness.

15
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:53,197
It mattered not how many foes he faced.
They were no match for his voracity.

16
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,963
Never before had a panda
been so feared, and so loved.

17
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,926
Even the most heroic heroes
in all of China,

18
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:19,306
The Furious Five.
Bowed in respect to this great master.

19
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,308
We should hang out.

20
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,268
Agreed.

21
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,314
But hanging out would
have to wait.

22
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:31,360
Cause when you're facing the ten
thousand demons of demon mountain.

23
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,614
There is only one thing
that matters and that’s...

24
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,325
Get up!
You'll be late for work.

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,836
Po...
Get up!

26
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:06,812
Hey, Po.
What are you doing up there?

27
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,814
Ahh.. nothing.

28
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:17,030
Monkey, Mantis, Crane, Viper,
Tigress ... Roarrrr!

29
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,699
Ahh...

30
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,163
Po. Let's go.
You're late for work.

31
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,207
Coming!

32
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,218
Sorry Dad.

33
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,138
Sorry, doesn't make the Noodles.

34
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,599
What were you doing up there?
All that noise?

35
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,393
Oh...nothing.
Just had a crazy dream.

36
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,313
About what? Uh?
What were you dreaming about?

37
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,023
What was I...aah...

38
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,984
... I was dreaming about a...

39
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,154
Noodles.

40
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,908
Noodles?
You were really dreaming about noodles?

41
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,368
Uhh... Ya,
what else would I be dreaming about?

42
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,913
Oh, careful.
That soup is - sharp!

43
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:11,335
Oh... happy day.
My son finally having the noodle dream.

44
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:16,715
You don't know how long
I have been waiting for this moment.

45
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,759
This is a sign, Po.

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,928
Uh... a sign of what?

47
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:25,015
You are almost ready to be
entrusted with the secret ingredient,

48
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,726
... of my secret ingredient soup.

49
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:32,773
And then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant.

50
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,318
Just as I took over from my father
who took over from his father.

51
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,820
who won it from a friend
over a game of mahjong.

52
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,448
Dad, dad, dad.
It was just a dream.

53
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,201
No, it was the Dream.

54
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,579
Wu Xiang noodles.
Po, broth runs through our veins.

55
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,834
But Dad, didn't you ever
wanted to do something else?

56
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,669
Something, beside noodles.

57
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,630
Actually, when I was young
and crazy.

58
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,759
I thought of running away
and learning how to make tofu.

59
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,177
So why didn't you?

60
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,429
Oh, because it was
a stupid dream.

61
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,432
Can you imagine me making tofu?

62
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,935
Ha, ha, ha. Tofu!

63
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,856
No, we all have our place
in this world.

64
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,860
My is here and yours is...
... I know "is here".

65
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,196
No, it’s tables 2, 5 ,7 and 12.

66
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,699
Service with a smile.

67
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,479
Well done, students...

68
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,565
... if you were trying
to disappoint me.

69
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,735
Tigress, you need more ferocity.
Monkey greater speed.

70
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,696
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis... Master Shifu...

71
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,531
Master Shifu... What?

72
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,910
It...its Master Oogway,
he wants to see you.

73
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:22,382
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

74
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:32,809
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

75
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:38,190
So, nothing is wrong?
Well, I didn't say that.

76
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,042
You were saying?

77
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,711
I have had a vision.

78
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,298
Tai Lung will return.

79
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,639
That is impossible.
He's in prison.

80
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,517
Nothing is impossible.

81
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:18,230
Zeng, fly to Chordom Prison.
Tell them to double the guards,

82
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,774
Double the weapons.
Double everything.

83
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,609
Tai Lung does not leave
that prison.

84
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,444
Yes, Master Shifu.

85
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,201
One often meets his destiny on
the road he takes to avoid it.

86
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:34,037
We have to do something. We can't
just have him march in the valley.

87
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,164
And take his revenge.
He'll, he'll...

88
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:40,294
Your mind is like this water
my friend. When it is agitated...

89
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,921
... it becomes difficult to see.

90
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:49,469
But if you allow it to settle,
the answer becomes clear.

91
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,891
The Dragon's scroll.

92
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,852
It is time.
But who?

93
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:00,647
Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

94
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,651
To become the Dragon Warrior.

95
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,529
I don't know.

96
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,574
Excuse me. Sorry.

97
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,868
Oo...oo sorry.
Hey, watch it Po.

98
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,996
Sorry.
Aah... Oop!

99
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,665
Sorry, a thousand pardon.

100
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,626
What?

101
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,713
Master Oogway is choosing
a Dragon Warrior, today.

102
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,466
Everyone, everyone, go!
Get to the Jade Palace!

103
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,676
One of the five is going
to get the Dragon's Scroll.

104
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,763
We have been waiting a thousand
years for this. Just take the bowl!

105
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,517
This is the greatest day in Kung Fu
history! Don't worry about it. Just go!

106
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,019
Po! Where are you going?

107
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,939
To the Jade Palace.

108
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,608
But you're forgetting your noodle cart.

109
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:49,029
The whole valley will be there and
you will sell noodle to all of them.

110
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,657
Selling noodles?

111
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,452
But Dad. You know I was kind
of thinking, maybe I...

112
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,247
Ya?
I was kind of thinking, maybe I...

113
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,040
Ahh...Haa..?

114
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:06,505
Could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

115
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:10,217
That's my boy!
I told you that dream was a sign.

116
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,387
Ya...
I'm glad I had it.

117
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,018
Almost there.

118
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,770
What?
No!

119
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,565
No! No!

120
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,195
Sorry Po.
We'll bring you back a souvenir.

121
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:19,077
No, I'll bring you back a souvenir.

122
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,669
It's a historic day.
Isn't it Master Oogway?

123
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:32,591
Yes. The one I feared
I would not live to see.

124
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:36,845
Are your students ready?
Yes, Master Oogway.

125
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,431
Now know this old friend...

126
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:47,022
Whomever I chose will not only bring
peace to the valley, but also to you.

127
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,988
Let the tournament begin!

128
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,798
No, no, no, wait!
I'm coming.

129
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,764
Hey! Open the door.

130
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,060
Let me in!

131
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,771
Citizens of the Valley of Peace.

132
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,732
It is my great honour
to present to you,

133
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:35,779
Tigress, Viper, Crane, Monkey, Mantis.

134
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,365
The Furious Five!
Ah...Ah...Ahh...

135
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,297
They're The Furious Five!
Aah..aah... ouch!

136
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,174
Warriors prepare!

137
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:59,511
Blast, No, Quick Po.
Ready for battle.

138
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,808
The thousand tons of fire!
Ho...ha...howw!

139
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,270
Wow... Look at that!
Hey! Get out of the way!

140
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,901
Uhh...Oh...ohh!
Ah...ah...aah!

141
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:26,413
Hiyaah...ouch!

142
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,432
And finally, Master Tigress.

143
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:50,979
Believe me citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

144
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,397
I know!

145
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:58,362
Master Tigress faces Iron Arms
and its Blades of Death.

146
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:14,086
I sense the Dragon Warrior
is among us.

147
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,135
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

148
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:27,266
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior.

149
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,018
Hah...butta...
No, no, no wait!

150
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,021
Yaa...ahh.

151
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,865
Ha...ha...haah!

152
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:52,082
Ha...ha...haah.
Po! What are you doing?

153
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,834
What does it look
like I'm doing?

154
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,171
Stop! Stop!
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior.

155
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:04,928
But I don't understand,
you finally have the noodle dream.

156
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,891
I lied.
I don't dream about noodles, Dad.

157
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:17,316
I love Kung Fu...uuu!

158
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:31,496
Oh come on son.
Let's get back to work.

159
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,750
Heay...okay.

160
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,921
Ahh...aahh...aah.

161
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:43,175
Po!...Heay...heay...hey.
Oh...Somebody...

162
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:09,326
Oh. What's going on?

163
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,996
... Where?

164
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,667
Why are you pointing...?

165
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:22,965
Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted
to see who the Dragon Warrior was?

166
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,300
How interesting?

167
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,136
Master, are you pointing at me?

168
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,265
Him.
Who?

169
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,560
You.
Me?

170
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,357
The universe has brought
us the Dragon Warrior.

171
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:44,236
What? What?
What? What!

172
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,540
Stop wait.
Who told you to...

173
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:06,925
Master Oogway, wait.

174
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:11,263
That crabby panda can't possibly
be the answer to our problem.

175
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,100
You were about to appoint the Tigress.
and that thing fell in front of her.

176
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,521
That was just an accident.
There are no accidents.

177
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,289
Forgive us Master.
We have failed you.

178
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:42,419
No. If the panda has not quit by
morning, then I would have failed you.

179
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,609
Wait, wait, wait!

180
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,529
I bring a message from Master Shifu.

181
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:17,829
What? Double the guard.
Extra precautions.

182
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,874
Your prison may not be adequate?

183
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,505
You doubt my prison security?

184
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,174
Absolutely not!

185
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:32,052
Shifu does.
I'm just the messenger.

186
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:35,889
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

187
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:40,060
Escape from Chordom prison
is impossible.

188
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,567
Impressive isn't it?

189
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,988
Yes, very impressive.
It is very impressive.

190
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:53,782
One way in.
And one way out.

191
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,953
One thousand guards
and one prisoner.

192
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,416
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung.

193
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,921
Take us down.

194
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:19,391
Ahh...ahh...ahh...ahh
Oh...oo...oh..

195
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,525
Oh my...

196
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:35,032
Behold Tai Lung.

197
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,244
I'll umm...I'll just
wait right here.

198
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:43,582
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

199
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,834
Both posts.
At the ready.

200
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,672
Hey tough guy.
Did you hear...

201
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,258
Oogway is finally going to give
someone the Dragon Scroll...

202
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,177
...and it's not going to be you.

203
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,012
What are you doing?
Don't get him mad.

204
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,680
What is he going to do about it?

205
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,267
I've got him completely immobilised.

206
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,937
Haa...haa...haa...haa!

207
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,815
Oh...Did I step on
the wooly kiddy's tail?

208
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,777
I'm gonna... I've seen enough.

209
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,238
I'm gonna tell Shifu that he
has nothing to worry about.

210
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,949
No, he doesn't.
Okay I'll tell him that.

211
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:19,952
Hmm...
Can we please go now?

212
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,894
Oh. Wait a second.

213
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,818
I think there has been
a slight mistake.

214
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,820
Err...Everyone seems
to think I'm err...

215
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,659
Ahh...The sacred Hall of Warriors.

216
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,661
No way.

217
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,580
Look at this place.

218
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,292
Master Flying-Rhino's armour.

219
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,002
With authentic battle damage!

220
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,506
Wow...the Sword of Heroes.

221
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,926
Said to be so sharp, you can cut
yourself just by looking ... Aah!...Oww!

222
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,264
The invisible Dragon of Destiny.

223
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,144
Uuhhs... I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

224
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:33,108
Aah...ah...ha...ha...ha...
Heeyah...yah.. Aah...ah...ah..

225
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,861
Noo..! Ho...oh, oh, oh...

226
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,364
The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors.

227
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,910
Said to contain souls of the
entire Tenshu army.

228
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,124
Hello?
Have you finished sightseeing?

229
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,418
Sorry. I should have
come to see you first.

230
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,337
My patience is running thin.
Ohh?

231
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:56,381
Well. I mean, it's not like
you are going anywhere.

232
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,592
You turn around.
Sure.

233
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:02,930
Hey, how is it going?
How do you get 500...Master Shifu!... Ooh!...

234
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,556
Ohh...whooo...

235
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:08,393
Someone broke that...
But I'm going to fix it...I...

236
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,772
Do you have some glue...
Whooo....

237
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,066
Aah...ouch...ooo!
I've a splinter.

238
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,195
So you are the legendary Dragon Warrior?
Hmm...

239
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,365
Ahh, I guess so?
Wrong!

240
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:24,660
You are not the Dragon Warrior.
You will never be the Dragon Warrior...

241
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,622
... until you've learned the secret
of the Dragon scroll.

242
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:32,793
Wow...so...
How does this work?

243
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,963
Do you have a ladder?
a trampoline or...?

244
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,757
Umph...You think it is that easy?

245
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:42,344
That I'm just going to hand you
the secret to limitless power?

246
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,387
No! I...

247
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,306
One must first master the highest
level of Kung Fu

248
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:50,435
and that is clearly impossible
if that one is someone like you.

249
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,979
Someone like me?
Yes!

250
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:56,149
Look at you!
This fat blob. Flabby arms.

251
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,861
Those are sensitive.
in the flabby parts.

252
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,572
And this ridiculous belly.
Hey...whooo...

253
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:05,951
And utter disregard for personal hygiene.
Now wait a minute.

254
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:09,329
That's a little uncalled for.
Don't stand that close. I can smell your breath.

255
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,789
Listen, Oogway said that I was the...

256
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,083
Uh... the Wushi Finger Hold.

257
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,459
Never... Master Shifu don't...

258
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,130
Haa...oh... You know this hold?

259
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,133
Developed by Master Wushi in the
3rd dynasty. Yes.

260
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,969
Oh. Then you must know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

261
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,637
No, no, no...

262
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:30,475
You know the hardest part of this?...
The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.

263
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,604
Humm...
Okay. Okay, take it easy.

264
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,939
Now listen closely, Panda.

265
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:39,234
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,...

266
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:42,529
I promise you,
you're going to wish he hadn't.

267
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,198
Are we clear?

268
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:47,242
Yes, we're clear, we're clear.
We are so clear.

269
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,996
Good. Hmm, Hmm, Hmm.
I can't wait to get started.

270
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:31,870
Let's begin.

271
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,121
Wait, wait, wait.

272
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,544
Now?
Yes now.

273
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:42,548
Unless you think that the great Oogway was
wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

274
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:48,262
Okay. Well, I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

275
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,390
Well, if we don't try,
we will never know, will we?

276
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,310
Yes, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

277
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,563
And what level is that?
Well you know...

278
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:01,608
I'm not a master, but
let's just start at zero.

279
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:06,864
Level zero.
There is no such thing as level zero.

280
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,949
Hey, maybe I can start with that.

281
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,952
That. We use that
for training children.

282
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,538
And popping the door
open when it is hot.

283
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,499
But if you insist.

284
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,835
Wow... The Furious Five.

285
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,421
You're so much bigger
than your action figures.

286
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:25,132
Except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

287
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,469
Go ahead, Panda.
Show us what you can do.

288
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,684
Ahh...Are they going to watch? Or should I just
wait until they get back to work or something?

289
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,730
Hit it.
Okay, I mean, I just ate,

290
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,902
and so I'm still digesting, so my
Kung Fu may not be as good as later on.

291
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,987
Just hit it.

292
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:52,451
What'd you got?
You've got nothing cos' I got it right here.

293
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:55,704
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to fell the thunder.

294
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:58,248
Come on, crazy feet.
What're you going to do about crazy feet?

295
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:01,293
Come on. I'm a blur. I'm a blur.
You've never seen Bear style.

296
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,128
You've only seen Praying Mantis.

297
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:07,758
Or Monkey style.
Imagine snake-kiddy Snake.

298
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:09,760
Would you hit it!

299
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,888
Alright. Alright.

300
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:21,939
Why don't you try it again?
A little harder.

301
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,192
How's that?
Oohhh...

302
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,328
Oh, that hurts!

303
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:45,754
This will be easier than I thought.

304
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:49,132
Feeling a little nausea...
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

305
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:56,098
Oohh... My tenders.

306
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,711
How did I do?

307
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:29,423
There is now a level zero.

308
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:34,595
Don't deny that.
I don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking.

309
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:39,474
Poor guy is going to get himself killed.
He is so fighty.

310
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:44,479
The Dragon Warrior fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

311
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,149
When he walks,
the very ground shakes.

312
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:52,487
One would think that Master Oogway would
choose someone who actually knew Kung Fu.

313
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:56,950
Yes. Or could at least touch his toes.
Or even see his toes.

314
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,768
Okay.

315
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,278
Great.

316
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,243
Ooouuch!

317
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,294
Oh hey. Hi.
You're up?

318
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:54,091
Am now.
I was just..er...someday...eh?

319
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,470
The Kung Fu stuff is hard work, right?
Your biceps sore.

320
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:04,268
I've had a long day and rather
disappointing day, so...er...

321
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,730
Ya...I should probably get to sleep now.

322
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,858
Ya... Ya...of course.
Okay. Thanks.

323
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:13,443
It's just, I'm such a big fan...

324
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:16,572
You guys were so totally amazing
at the battle of the Weeping River.

325
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:20,409
Outnumbered. A thousand to one.
But, you didn't stop. You just,....

326
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,538
Oh. Sorry about that.

327
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:28,750
Ahh... Look you don't belong here.

328
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:33,005
Er...I know, I know.
You're right.

329
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:36,425
I don't have it.
It's just, my whole life, I dream of...

330
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:40,137
No, no, no. I meant you don't
belong here, I mean in this room.

331
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:44,641
But this is my room.
Property of Crane.

332
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:48,020
Oh, okay right, right.
So...

333
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,523
Ya, you want to get to sleep.
Keeping you up.

334
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,400
We've got big things tomorrow.

335
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,613
Alright. You are awesome. The last thing
I'm going to say. Okay, bye-bye.

336
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,369
What was that?
I didn't say anything.

337
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:08,248
Okay. Alright. Goodnight.
Sleep well.

338
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,419
Seem a little bit awkward.

339
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,965
Master Tigress, didn't mean
to wake you. Just a...

340
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:19,801
You don't belong here.
Ah ya...ya, of course...

341
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:24,473
This is your room...
I mean you don't belong in the Jade Palace.

342
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:28,769
You're a disgrace to Kung Fu and if
you have any respect of who we are,

343
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:33,398
and what we do,
you will be gone by morning.

344
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,614
Big fan.

345
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:51,333
I see you've found the Sacred Peach
Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

346
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:55,462
Is that what this is?
I'm so sorry.

347
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:58,298
I thought it was just
a regular peach tree.

348
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:03,262
I understand, you eat
when you are upset.

349
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,307
Upset? I'm not upset.
Why would I be upset?

350
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:11,270
So, why are you upset?

351
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:20,112
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of Kung Fu.

352
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,197
In the history of China.

353
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:23,907
In the history of sucking.

354
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,577
Probably.
And the Five...man,

355
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,121
you should have seen them,
they totally hate me.

356
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:32,082
Totally.
How's Shifu ever going to turn me

357
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,668
into the Dragon Warrior?

358
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:39,673
I mean I'm not like the Five,
I've got no claws.

359
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:41,758
No wings,
no venom.

360
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:45,262
Even Mantis got those thingies.

361
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:49,683
May be I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

362
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:58,150
Quit. Don't quit.
Noodles. Don't noodles.

363
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:03,739
You are too concerned with
what was and what will be.

364
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:08,619
There's a saying.
Yesterday is history,

365
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,665
Tomorrow is a mystery,
But today is a gift.

366
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:17,628
That is why it is called the "present".

367
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,659
Oh No!
What's happening?

368
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:52,162
To your battle stations!
Go! Go! Go!

369
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:03,423
Fire Cross-Bow!
Fire!

370
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,761
Fire!

371
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,063
Tai Lung's free. I must warn Shifu.

372
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,107
You are not going anywhere.
Neither is he!

373
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,484
Let go of me.
Bring it up!

374
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,738
Wait! Bring it back!

375
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,467
He's going this way.
He won't get far.

376
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,761
Archers!

377
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:59,164
We Dead.
So very, very dead.

378
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:02,417
Ha..Ha. Not yet, we're not.
Now!

379
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:53,051
Can we run now?
Yes.

380
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:15,741
I am glad Shifu sent you.

381
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,786
I was beginning to feel
I'm being forgotten.

382
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:26,168
Fly back there and tell them, the
real Dragon Warrior is coming home.

383
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,057
Good Morning, Master.

384
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,768
Panda!

385
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:45,354
Panda! Wake up!

386
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:50,192
Hmm, hmm, hmm...
He's quitted.

387
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:54,696
What do we do now Master
with the Panda gone?

388
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,740
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

389
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,743
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time...

390
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,955
the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.

391
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,916
What are you doing here?

392
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,252
Haa...hey.
Good Morning Master.

393
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:10,420
I thought I'll warm up a little.

394
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:16,176
You're stuck.
Stuck?...No...What?...Stuck?

395
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:19,888
No...This is one of the...
Ya...I'm stuck.

396
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,641
Help him.
Oh dear.

397
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:26,562
Lift me on three.
One, two, ....

398
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:31,066
Thank you.
Don't mention it.

399
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,402
No really. I appreciate it...
...Ever.

400
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:38,532
You actually thought you could
learn to do a full split in one night.

401
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:42,744
It takes years to develop
ones flexibility.

402
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:46,957
And years longer to apply it in combat.

403
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,676
Put that down!

404
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:02,181
The only souvenirs we collect down here
are bloody knuckles and broken bones.

405
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:05,809
Yaa...ha...ha...ha.
Excellent!

406
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,644
Let's get started.

407
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,940
Are you ready?
I was born ready...Oww!

408
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:16,320
Oww!...Oh!. I'm sorry brother.
I thought you said you're ready.

409
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,531
That was awesome!
Let's go again!

410
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:50,187
I've been taking it easy on you Panda
but no more. Your next opponent...

411
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,940
...will be me.
Alright. Ya...Let's go!

412
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,486
Step forth!

413
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:01,031
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness.

414
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:03,116
And make him suffer for it.

415
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:07,829
Oh yeah. To take his strength
and use it against him.

416
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:11,458
Until he finally falls or quits.

417
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:16,463
But a real warrior never quits.
Don't worry Master, I'll never quit.

418
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:30,060
If he is smart he won't
come back those steps.

419
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:33,981
But he will.
He's not going to quit, is he?

420
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,692
He's not going to quit bouncing.
I'll tell you that.

421
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,832
Oouch! I thought you said
accupuncture will make me feel better.

422
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:55,377
Trust me it will.
It's just not easy finding right nerve points

423
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,963
under all this...fat?
Fur!

424
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:00,090
I was going to say fur.
Sure you were.

425
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,551
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size?

426
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:06,763
So I mean, look at me.
I'm over here.

427
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:10,225
Haa...aah...
Maybe you should take a look at this again.

428
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,020
Ohh... Okay.

429
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,982
Oouch!
Stop! Stop it!

430
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,233
Eee...ouch!

431
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,612
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all.

432
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:25,449
But if I didn't know any better
I'll say he's trying to get rid of me.

433
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,290
I know he can seem like heartless.
Aaahh...!

434
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,459
But you know he wasn't
always like that.

435
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:41,256
According to legend there was once a time
when Master Shifu actually used to spy...

436
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:44,676
No...
Yes, but that was before...

437
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:47,846
Before what?
Before Tai Lung.

438
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:50,682
Aah...ya.
We are not really suppose to talk about him.

439
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:53,936
Well if he is going to stay here
he should now.

440
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:56,104
Guys, guys,
I know about Tai Lung.

441
00:39:56,104 --> 00:40:01,485
He was a student. The first to ever
master the 1000 scrolls of Kung Fu.

442
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:05,572
And then he turned bad
and now he's in jail.

443
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,950
He wasn't just a student.

444
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,207
Shifu found him as a cub.

445
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,086
And he raised him as his son.

446
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:24,925
And when the child showed
talent in Kung Fu

447
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:28,178
Shifu trained him.

448
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:33,642
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

449
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,230
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

450
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:41,817
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

451
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:45,779
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

452
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:49,825
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the Valley.

453
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,454
He tried to take the Scroll by force.

454
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,792
And Shifu has to destroy
what he had created.

455
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:02,546
But how could he?

456
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:20,272
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he
has never love anyone before.

457
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:30,073
What's it?

458
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:41,543
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

459
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:43,837
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

460
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:46,089
And he is stuck with you.

461
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:50,636
A big fat Panda who
treats it like a joke.

462
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,722
Ohh... That's it!
Wait! My fault!

463
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:55,807
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerves.

464
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,437
And may have also stopped his heart.

465
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:06,109
Inner peace.

466
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:09,780
Inner peace.

467
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:17,371
Inner...in...in...in
inner peace.

468
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:24,545
Look whoever is making that
flapping sound quiet down.

469
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:31,051
Inner...Quaaa!

470
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:36,932
Oh, Zeng, excellent.

471
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:40,018
I could use some good news now.

472
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,189
Aaahh....

473
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:49,069
Master. Master.
Hmm...

474
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:53,448
I...I..have ...It's a...
It's a very bad news.

475
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:59,663
Aah... Shifu. There's just news.
No good or bad.

476
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:03,083
Master, your vision was right.

477
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:06,628
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

478
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:10,465
That is bad news...

479
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:15,220
... if you do not believe that
the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

480
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:19,516
Panda? Master, that Panda
is not the Dragon Warrior.

481
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:22,769
He wasn't even meant to be here.
It was an accident.

482
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:25,606
There are no accidents.

483
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:29,610
Yes, I know.
You said that already.

484
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:33,947
Twice.
Well, that was no accident either.

485
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:36,450
Thrice.
My old friend.

486
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:41,371
The Panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you, yours.

487
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:44,917
Until you let go of the
illusion of control.

488
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,294
Illusion?
Yes.

489
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:49,630
Look at this tree, Shifu.

490
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,508
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me.

491
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:56,011
Nor make it bear
fruit before it's time.

492
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:58,680
But there are things
we can control.

493
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:02,518
I can control when
the fruit will fall.

494
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,232
I can control where
to plant the seed.

495
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:11,818
That is no illusion, Master.

496
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:16,990
Ah...yes, but no matter
what you do

497
00:44:17,115 --> 00:44:19,952
That seed will grow
to be a peach tree.

498
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:22,913
You may wish for an
apple or an orange.

499
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:28,418
But you will get a peach.
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung.

500
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:36,176
Maybe it can, if you are willing
to guide it, to nurture it.

501
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:38,095
To believe in it.

502
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:42,224
But how? How?
I need your help, Master.

503
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:46,186
No, you just need to believe.

504
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:52,150
Promise me, Shifu.
Promise me, you will believe.

505
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:57,948
I... I will try.
Hmm...Good.

506
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:02,619
My time has come.

507
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:08,584
You must continue your journey
without me.

508
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,461
What?...what?...what are you...
Wait!

509
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:14,339
Master.

510
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:16,675
You can't leave me.

511
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,599
You must believe.

512
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,227
Master.

513
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:59,301
I'm not scared...yet.
Sound like fun. He maybe a wolf.

514
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:02,346
You may be the scariest bandit
in Harjin Province.

515
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:05,057
But you're a lousy tipper.
Really.

516
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:08,018
So, how did you
get out of there alive?

517
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:14,566
I mean I didn't actually said that,
but I thought it, in my mind.

518
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:17,986
If he could read my mind
he would have been like...what?

519
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:20,364
Order up!
You like it?

520
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,159
This is really good.

521
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,037
Now, come on. You should try
my dad's secret ingredient soup.

522
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:29,623
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

523
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:32,125
What are you talking about?
This is amazing.

524
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,670
Wow...you are really a good cook.
I wish my mouth was bigger.

525
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,922
Tigress, you got to try this.
Hmm...

526
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:41,218
It is said that the Dragon Warrior can
survive for months at a time on nothing

527
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:45,639
but the dew of a single Gingko leaf
and the energy of the universe.

528
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:50,060
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

529
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:55,983
I need lard more than dew
and the universe juice.

530
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:03,198
What?
Oh nothing, Master Shifu.

531
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:05,492
Ha...ha...ha...ha!

532
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:09,121
You will never be the Dragon Warrior
unless you lose 500 pounds.

533
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:12,541
and brush your teeth.
What is the noise you're making?

534
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:14,501
Laughter?
I have never heard of it.

535
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:19,840
Work hard Panda and maybe someday
you'll have ears like mine.

536
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,968
That's good.
Oh...oh, yup.

537
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:25,721
Ears?
It's not working for you.

538
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:27,806
I thought they're pretty good.
It's Shifu!

539
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,267
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

540
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:35,397
Master Shifu.
Aahh...

541
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:40,569
You think this is funny!
Tai Lung has escaped from prison!

542
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:42,362
And you all are acting like children!
What?

543
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:46,700
He's coming for the Dragon Scroll and
you're the only one who can stop him.

544
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:53,040
Ha...and here I am saying you've
got no a sense of humour.

545
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,002
I am gonna... step down.
What? You're serious?

546
00:47:57,044 --> 00:48:01,590
And I have to...aaa...not...
Master Oogway will stop him.

547
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,593
He did it before. He'll do it again.
Oogway cannot!

548
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,804
Not anymore.
Haa?

549
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,807
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

550
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,434
The Panda?
Yes, the Panda!

551
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:16,188
Master please, let us stop Tai Lung?
This is what you train us for!

552
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:21,276
No! It is not your destiny to defeat
Tai Lung! It is his!

553
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:23,529
Where did he go?

554
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:33,330
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quit!

555
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:35,332
Watch me!

556
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:40,337
Come on! How am I suppose
to beat Tai Lung?

557
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:42,464
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

558
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:45,634
You will beat him because
you are the Dragon Warrior.

559
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:47,761
Ouch!
You don't believe that!

560
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,680
Oh! You never believed that.

561
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,683
From the first moment I got here,
you've been trying to get rid of me.

562
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:55,102
Yes, I was!

563
00:48:55,102 --> 00:49:00,315
But now I ask you to trust in your Master
as I have come to trust in mine.

564
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:04,862
You are not my Master.
And I am not the Dragon Warrior.

565
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:08,407
Then why didn't you quit?
You knew I was trying to get rid of you.

566
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:11,493
Yet you stayed.
Ya. I stayed.

567
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:15,038
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

568
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,708
Or said I smelled, it hurt!

569
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:23,172
But it could never hurt more than it
did everyday in my life just being me.

570
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:31,513
I stayed because I thought if anyone
could change me, could make me not me...

571
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:36,310
...it was you. The greatest
Kung Fu teacher of all of China.

572
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:41,982
But I can change you! I can turn
you into the Dragon Warrior. And I will!

573
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:46,570
Come on, Tai Lung is
on his way right now.

574
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,780
And even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here.

575
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,493
How are you going to change
this into the Dragon Warrior?

576
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:54,953
Hah?

577
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:58,665
How?

578
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,084
How?

579
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:06,256
How?
I don't know!

580
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:15,724
I do not know

581
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:24,983
That's what I thought.

582
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:04,815
This is what she trains for it

583
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,490
Tigress!

584
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:18,871
Don't try and stop me.

585
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,959
We are not trying to stop you.
What?

586
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:26,003
We are coming with you.

587
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:42,120
What?
I eat when I am upset, okay!

588
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,957
Oh! No need to explain.

589
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:49,044
I just thought you might be monkey.
He hides his almond cookies in the top-shelf.

590
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:11,817
Don't tell Monkey.

591
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,485
Look at you.
Yaaa..!

592
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:18,198
I know I disgust you.
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

593
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:23,412
I don't know,...I...
I don't know. Just get the cookies.

594
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:28,876
And yet you are 10 feet off the ground
and have done a perfect split.

595
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:34,673
No, this?
This is just an accident!

596
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:53,233
I know you are trying to be
all mystical and Kung Fu-ee.

597
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:57,196
But could you least tell me
where we are going?

598
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:12,461
You drag me all the way
out here for a bath?

599
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:20,677
Panda, we do not wash our pits
in the pool of sacred tears.

600
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:22,930
Uuh?...The pool of...

601
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:27,851
This is where Oogway unraveled
the mysteries of harmony and focus.

602
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:32,105
This is the birth place of Kung Fu.

603
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:48,455
Do you want to learn Kung Fu?

604
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:52,543
Yes
Then I am your Master.

605
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:54,503
Okay!

606
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:58,340
Don't cry.
Okay.

607
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:09,476
When you focus on Kung Fu,
when you concentrate, you stink.

608
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:14,648
But perhaps that is my fault.
I cannot train you the way I trained the Five.

609
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:19,361
I see now that the way to get
through to you is with this.

610
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:22,447
Aah great, cause I am hungry.

611
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:26,910
Good, when you have been trained
you may eat.

612
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:30,038
Let's begin.

613
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:41,693
After you, Panda.

614
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:46,740
Just like that.
No sit-ups. No, ten-mile hike.

615
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:52,204
I vowed to train you and you've been
trained. You are free to eat.

616
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,585
Enjoy

617
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,215
Hey!
I said you are free to eat.

618
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:06,093
Have a dumpling.

619
00:57:14,643 --> 00:57:17,437
You are free to eat.
Am I?

620
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:19,064
Are you?

621
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,151
I am not hungry.

622
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,240
Master.

623
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:24,064
Cut it!

624
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:44,209
Where is the Dragon Warrior?
How do you know you are not looking at her?

625
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:47,171
You think I'm a fool.

626
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:50,883
I know you are not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

627
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:54,344
I heard how he fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire.

628
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:58,974
But he's a warrior unlike anything
in the world has ever seen.

629
00:59:58,974 --> 01:00:02,436
Po?
So that is his name.

630
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,229
Po!

631
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:07,608
Finally, a worthy opponent.

632
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:10,777
The battle will be legendary.

633
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:32,382
We got this, help her.

634
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:58,992
Monkey!
Jump!

635
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:13,090
Mantis!

636
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,762
Now!

637
01:02:04,308 --> 01:02:06,852
Shifu, taught you well.

638
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:11,899
But he didn't teach you everything.

639
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:19,031
You have done well, Panda.
Done well?

640
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:22,910
Done well!
I have done awesome!

641
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:27,331
The mark of a true hero is humility.

642
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:31,502
But yes,
you have done, awesome.

643
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:41,637
Five?
Fives!

644
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:43,764
They're dead.
No, they are breathing.

645
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:45,974
They're asleep?
No, their eyes are open.

646
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:48,101
We were no match for
his nerve attack.

647
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:50,395
He has gotten stronger.

648
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:52,814
Tai Lung?
Stronger!

649
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:56,944
He's too fast.
Sorry, Po.

650
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:02,032
I thought we could stop him.
He could have kill you.

651
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:04,243
Why didn't he?
So you can come back here...

652
01:03:04,243 --> 01:03:07,871
...and strike fear into our hearts.
But it won't work.

653
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:11,667
It might. I mean a little.

654
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:15,212
I'm pretty scared.
You can defeat him, Panda.

655
01:03:15,212 --> 01:03:19,341
Are you kidding?
If they can't... They're Five Masters.

656
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:20,759
I'm just one me.

657
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:24,555
But you have the one thing
that no one else does,

658
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,895
You really believe I'm ready.

659
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:35,357
You are, Po.

660
01:04:24,656 --> 01:04:27,993
Behold, the Dragon Scroll.

661
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:30,996
It is yours.
Wait.

662
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:33,832
What happens when I read it?
No one knows.

663
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:37,211
But legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wings beat.

664
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:40,130
Wow! Really? That's cool.
Yes!

665
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:45,511
And see light in the deepest cave.
You will feel the universe in motion around you.

666
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:49,431
Wow! Can I punch through walls?
Can I do a quadruple back flip?

667
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:52,684
Focus. Focus. Focus!
Oh, ya...yah.

668
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:55,687
Read it Po.
And fulfill your destiny.

669
01:04:55,687 --> 01:05:01,151
Read it and become the Dragon Warrior.
Wow...!

670
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:08,492
It's impossible to open.

671
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:16,166
Thank you.

672
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,544
Probably, loosen it up for you.

673
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,922
Okay, here goes.

674
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:30,472
Aargh...!

675
01:05:33,392 --> 01:05:35,102
It's blank.
What?

676
01:05:35,143 --> 01:05:38,564
Here, look.
No, I am forbidden to look upon it.

677
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:49,950
Blank!
I don't...I don't understand.

678
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:56,832
Okay. So like Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

679
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:59,960
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

680
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,922
Oh, come on.
Face it. He picked me by accident.

681
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:06,717
Of course I'm not Dragon Warrior.

682
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:08,927
Who am I kidding?

683
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:12,431
But who will stop Tai Lung?
He will destroy everything.

684
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:15,434
And everyone.
No.

685
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:19,563
Evacuate the Valley.
You must protect the villagers...

686
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:21,106
... from Tai Lung's rage.

687
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:22,983
What about you, Master?

688
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:24,526
I will fight him.
What?

689
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:28,322
I can hold him off long enough
for everyone to escape.

690
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:31,200
But Shifu, he'll kill you.

691
01:06:31,283 --> 01:06:34,203
Then I would have finally
paid for my mistake.

692
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:36,580
Listen to me, all of you.

693
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:40,417
It's time for you to continue
your journey without me.

694
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:43,045
I am very proud to have
been your master.

695
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:06,610
We got to get them out safely.

696
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,946
Come little one, let's find your Mama.

697
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:12,533
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

698
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:14,409
Crane, light the way.

699
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:36,223
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

700
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:46,525
Hey Dad.

701
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:48,694
Po!

702
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,451
It's good to have you back son.

703
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:02,583
Good to be back.
Let's go Po.

704
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:10,966
For our next shop, it's time to face it.
The future of noodles is diced cut vegetables.

705
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:15,429
No longer slices.
Also, I was thinking...

706
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:20,475
... maybe this time we'll have
a kitchen you can stand up in.

707
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:22,936
Hmm!
You like that?

708
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:36,491
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out.
It just wasn't meant to be.

709
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:44,666
Po, forget everything else.
Your destiny still awaits.

710
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:49,671
We are noodle-folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

711
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:56,345
I don't know dad. Honestly,
sometimes I can't believe I'm your son.

712
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:04,978
Po, I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

713
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:07,397
... a long time ago.

714
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:09,441
Okay.

715
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:14,696
The secret ingredient of
my secret ingredient soup...

716
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:21,078
Ohh...
The secret ingredient is...

717
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:23,997
Nothing!
Hah?...

718
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:26,542
But you heard me.
Nothing!

719
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:29,586
There is no secret ingredient.

720
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:32,840
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup.

721
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,259
You don't add some kind
of special sauce or something.

722
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:37,803
Don't have to.
To make something special...

723
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:40,722
...you just have to believe it is special.

724
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:53,527
There is no secret ingredient.

725
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:16,925
I have come home, Master.

726
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:20,679
This is no longer your home
and I am no longer your master.

727
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:24,474
Yes, you have a new favourite.

728
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:28,145
So where is this Po?

729
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:33,400
Did I scare him off?
This battle is between you and me.

730
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:40,032
So that's how it's going to be.
That is how it must be.

731
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:57,758
I rotted in jail for 20 years...

732
01:10:57,758 --> 01:11:01,678
...because of your weakness!
Obeying your master is not weakness!

733
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:04,932
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!

734
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:11,021
You always knew.
But when Oogway said otherwise...

735
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:16,068
What did you do?
What did you do!

736
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:21,448
Nothing!
You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior.

737
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:24,660
That was not my fault!
Not your fault!

738
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,037
Who failed my every dream?

739
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:29,540
Who told we should train
until my bones cracked?

740
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,835
Who denied me my destiny?!!

741
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:44,596
It was never my decision to make!

742
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,854
It is now.

743
01:11:56,733 --> 01:11:59,987
Give me the Scroll.

744
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:01,905
I would rather die!

745
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:56,168
What I ever did,
I did to make you proud!

746
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:59,338
Tell me how proud you are Shifu?

747
01:12:59,463 --> 01:13:04,218
Tell me!
Tell meeee!

748
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,189
I...I have always
been proud of you.

749
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:23,612
From the first moment
I have been proud of you.

750
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:28,408
And it was my pride
that blinded me.

751
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:32,454
I love you too much
to see what you were becoming.

752
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:37,543
What I was turning you into.

753
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:41,839
I'm... I'm sorry.

754
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:54,977
I don't want your apology.
I want my Scroll.

755
01:13:56,478 --> 01:13:58,272
What?

756
01:13:57,896 --> 01:14:00,023
Where is it?

757
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:05,279
Dragon Warrior has taken Scroll
half way across China by now.

758
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:09,658
You will never see
that Scroll, Tai Lung!

759
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,618
Never!

760
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:15,581
Hey!

761
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:22,045
...Stairs.

762
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:25,549
Who are you?

763
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:30,345
Buddy...
I am the Dragon Warrior.

764
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:35,267
You?

765
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:37,394
Him?
He's a Panda.

766
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:39,646
You're a Panda.
What are you going to do, Big Guy?

767
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:41,899
Sit on me.

768
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,901
Don't tempt me.

769
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:47,738
Now, I'm going to use this.

770
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:50,657
You want it. Come get it.

771
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:52,868
Finally.

772
01:15:18,769 --> 01:15:21,146
That Scroll is mine!

773
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,906
The Scroll has given him power.

774
01:17:32,194 --> 01:17:35,531
Finally.
Oh yes.

775
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:41,870
The power of the Dragon Scroll
is mine!

776
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:48,085
It's nothing!

777
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:53,090
It's okay. I didn't get
it the first time either.

778
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:58,929
What?
There is no secret ingredient.

779
01:18:00,848 --> 01:18:03,141
It's just you.

780
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:15,070
Stop it! Ho, ho, ho.
I'm going to pee.

781
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:20,826
Don't...don't...don't.
Ha...ha...ha...

782
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:32,231
You can't defeat me.

783
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:44,660
You...you're just a big
fat Panda!

784
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:46,995
I'm not a big fat Panda.

785
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:50,707
I'm the Big Fat Panda!

786
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:55,587
The Wushi finger hold?
Oh, you know this hold.

787
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:59,383
You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
Shifu didn't teach you that!

788
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:02,928
No, I figured it out.

789
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:04,680
Skedush...!

790
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:26,159
Ah... look!

791
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:24,324
The Dragon Warrior.

792
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:56,607
That's my boy!
The big lovely Kung Fu warrior is my son!

793
01:20:58,483 --> 01:21:00,402
Yes.

794
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:03,906
Thanks Dad.

795
01:21:12,164 --> 01:21:14,541
Hey guys.

796
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:21,840
Master.
Master.

797
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:27,804
Master?
Master Shifu?

798
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:45,155
Master!
Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?

799
01:21:46,365 --> 01:21:49,701
Po.
You are alive.

800
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:51,537
Or we are both dead.

801
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:53,539
No Master, I didn't die.

802
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:56,792
I defeated Tai Lung.
You did?

803
01:22:00,754 --> 01:22:06,218
... Wow!
It is as Oogway foretold.

804
01:22:06,677 --> 01:22:10,514
You are the Dragon Warrior.

805
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:15,477
You have brought peace
to this Valley.

806
01:22:18,522 --> 01:22:21,900
And to me.
Thank you.

807
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:26,488
Thank you, Po.

808
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:30,534
Thank you. Thank you...

809
01:22:34,788 --> 01:22:37,457
No, Master...

810
01:22:37,457 --> 01:22:39,960
No, no, no!
Don't die Shifu, please!

811
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:45,132
I'm not dying, you idiot!
Aah... Dragon Warrior...

812
01:22:46,258 --> 01:22:51,722
I'm simply at peace.
Finally.

813
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:57,019
Oh...So I should stop talking.

814
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:59,521
If you can.

815
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:20,417
Do you want to get
something to eat?

816
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:23,712
Yes
