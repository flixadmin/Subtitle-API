1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
<i>Previously on</i>The Flash
<i>and</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,880
- I love you, Jesse.
- I love you too.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,000
Jesse's breaking up with me.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,640
She told me she needs
to focus on herself.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,040
You and Ms. Lance?

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,360
I think there's something
real there, she's special.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,320
I'm guessing that's bad.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,480
Those are tears
in the fabric of time itself.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,120
The first totem bearers
imprisoned a great evil

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,920
and time is his cage.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,480
The more the timeline's corrupted,

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,400
the weaker the prison
holding Mallus becomes.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,680
Maybe these totems
are the keys to stopping him.

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,440
The good news is, we already have
the Air, Earth, and Fire Totem.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
Death Totem?

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,320
The most volatile
of all of the totems.

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,440
Whoever wields it
has dominion over the dead.

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,520
We need to make sure we keep
that Death Totem on lock.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,880
You thought I forgot about you.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,560
It's okay.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Hey, I'm right here.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
It's okay.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,680
Here I thought you gave nightmares,
not have them.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,840
First time for everything.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Want to talk about it?

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,760
No, I'm... I'm fine.

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,360
So, who's John?

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
What?

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,720
Soon as you called his name
out in your sleep

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,320
and I was trying very hard
not to be jealous.

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
No, it's probably John Constantine.

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,000
He's a Demonologist
that helped me with Mallus.

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,520
And he kinda looks like Sting.

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,120
And he's just a... just a friend?

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,080
Yeah, you could say that.

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,320
You know we did sleep together.

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,240
It was the 60s,
and everybody was getting wild.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,240
The 60s, huh?

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,520
I thought I waited a long time
between partners.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,400
The year was 1969, but...

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
it was, like, three weeks ago.

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,320
Three weeks?

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,880
Yeah, well, three weeks
before I had a girlfriend.

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,960
Did you just call me your girlfriend?

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Maybe.

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,440
I mean, why not?

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,600
John's fun.

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,240
Oh, please don't talk about John.

49
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,040
Well, he is no Ava Sharpe.

50
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,400
<i>Pardon the interruption, Captain,
but you're needed on the bridge.</i>

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,200
Oh, come on.

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Hey.

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Morning, Captain.

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,600
Where's Mrs. Captain?

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,080
Ava had to work.

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,280
With all the new anachronisms,
the time tears are getting worse.

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,560
Yeah, I thought we were calling
them time cracks.

58
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,880
Hey, what happens
if we don't repair history?

59
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,160
Working theory:
time is frapped together

60
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,520
{\an5}like a smoothie,
so instead of just dealing

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,520
{\an5}with Julius Caesar in Aruba,
we have to fight off Genghis Khan,

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
a herd of wooly mammoths,

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,640
{\an5}and a swarm of locusts
from the Old Testament.

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,000
And Mallus is freed from time jail,

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,920
so he could rule over
this giant mess.

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,160
So, worse than Flashpoint?

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,920
{\an5}Is that what we're calling
the thing that Barry did?

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,280
I think it's something similar.

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,120
All right, enough hand wringing.

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,560
{\an5}Mallus and his team are doubling down
on anachronisms, so, so are we.

71
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,840
{\an5}From now on, we're going
to do our repairs in teams.

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,160
Where's Rory?

73
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
Wally, wait.

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,720
Nice robe.

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Who dressed me?

76
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Me.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,360
FYI, Heat Wave sleeps in the nude.

78
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, tried to warn you, kid.

79
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,280
{\an5}As riveting as this conversation is,
Gideon, please.

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,040
So, Z and Amaya,
you take the Time Courier

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
to Billings, Montana in 1997.

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,760
The Mona Lisa is about make
a very special appearance

83
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,080
on the Antiques Roadshow.

84
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,040
Nate and I will pick up Einstein
in the Ice Age,

85
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,960
and you two are on the Jumpship
to find and return a dog named Laika

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,640
to the Soviet space program.

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,360
No.

88
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Excuse me?

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,320
I'm not chasing a Ruskie pooch.

90
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,920
I could actually use Mick's help
reforming the Fire Totem.

91
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Fine.

92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,760
Nate, you go with Wally,
and I'll go get Einstein alone.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Are you okay?

94
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Yeah, do...

95
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
I'm fine.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
All right, that's it.

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,280
No snazzy send-off.

98
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,520
Mama's got a headache.

99
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,080
Even when you don't try,
you still got it.

100
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,680
My hypothesis is that the Fire Totem

101
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,240
can only be reignited
if it reaches Big Bang conditions.

102
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,440
Which is where this handy-dandy
cold fusion reactor comes in.

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,400
We will be two of the only people
to have ever experienced

104
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,760
cold fusion in action.

105
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,920
Can you even imagine?

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,560
I'm bored.

107
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,280
Wait, where are you going?

108
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,720
What if I need your help?

109
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,000
{\an5}I... I just put a mystical
totem into a nuclear reactor.

110
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,360
Don't you wanna see what happens?

111
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
No.

112
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,400
{\an5}Do me a favor, Gideon,
get John Constantine on the line.

113
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,760
{\an5}<i>I'm afraid Mr. Constantine
does not currently own a phone.</i>

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,320
{\an5}Because God forbid
he'd do anything normal.

115
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,960
It calls to you, doesn't it?

116
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,480
The Death Totem chose you.

117
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
- You're...
- You.

118
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
After you died.

119
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,640
This is the Death Totem.

120
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,840
It yearns for a new bearer.

121
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,840
Imagine all you could do
with dominion over the dead.

122
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,520
You could banish
that little girl from your dreams,

123
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,160
bring back your sister.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm no totem bearer.

125
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,320
You've conquered your demons.

126
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,800
You're strong enough to wield it.

127
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,640
Pick up the totem, Sara.

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,320
It's the only way to defeat Mallus.

129
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,240
The six totems
need six totem bearers.

130
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,480
Who else on your team
was born to wield death?

131
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,400
Wait, wait, so the Mona Lisa
was a self-portrait?

132
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,880
Da Vinci in drag.

133
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Mick?

134
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,920
What, what, what?

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, at least he's wearing clothes.

136
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,120
- True.
- Hey, Ray, we're back.

137
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,560
You read me, Schmience guy?

138
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,080
Gideon, where's Ray?

139
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,000
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Tomaz, but all of my
internal monitoring systems</i>

140
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,160
<i>have been disabled.</i>

141
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
<i>I've been rendered blind, I'm afraid.</i>

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Ray!

143
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,600
I can't tell if he's breathing.

144
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,440
I have a pulse.

145
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,640
It's smoking.

146
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,040
This just happened.

147
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,600
Whoever did
this is still on the ship.

148
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,680
Gideon, run a scan.

149
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,720
<i>Dr. Palmer has suffered
a collapsed lung,</i>

150
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,240
<i>three broken ribs,
a shattered femur and...</i>

151
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Okay, okay, okay, we get it.

152
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,280
Just fix him and find out
who disabled your cams.

153
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,840
I take one lousy nap...

154
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,000
<i>If I was capable of rage,
I would feel it.</i>

155
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,920
<i>The saboteur must be punished.</i>

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,480
You stay with Ray,
Mick and I will search the ship.

157
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,760
Wait, guys, you don't know
what's out there.

158
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,280
Second thought, you got this.

159
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,320
Gideon, we need to reach Sara.

160
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,680
Is there any way to message her
in the Ice Age?

161
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
<i>There's no need.</i>

162
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,520
<i>The Jumpship never left its hangar.</i>

163
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,840
Holy mother of God.

164
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,800
Sara, what happened?

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,200
Sara Lance is lost to you.

166
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,320
I am...

167
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Death!

168
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,040
Sara, I know you're still in there.

169
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Amaya?

170
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,800
She can't hear you.

171
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Mallus.

172
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,280
You've always secretly feared
you're a monster.

173
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,880
And now, a monster
is what you've become.

174
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,600
Sara, please, no!

175
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,520
Amaya, what happened?

176
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,480
It's Sara,
she's wearing the Death thingy.

177
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,680
The Death Totem, why would
Elvis' totem make Sara evil?

178
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,160
The totems work by amplifying
the true nature

179
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,720
of, of whoever wears them.

180
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,680
But Constantine warned Ray
that Mallus' power was inside Sara.

181
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,640
Maybe he's taken her over.

182
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,880
So, if Elvis could raise
the dead with a totem,

183
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,120
what could a former assassin
connected to a demon be capable of?

184
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,280
<i>Captain Lance, I strongly recommend
you reconsider this command.</i>

185
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Hey.

186
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,320
So, I was thinking about the whole
GF conversation we had earlier,

187
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
and I...

188
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
You look...

189
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,360
Good, great.

190
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,360
Just, sometimes these holo-feeds
can really wash out your skin.

191
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,960
Did you do something
different with your hair?

192
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,400
What the hell is going on here?

193
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,960
Mr. Rory, would you please move?

194
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,240
Sara's bonded with the Death Totem.

195
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
What?

196
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,680
We think Mallus tricked
her into wearing it.

197
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
Look, the woman
on that bridge was not Sara.

198
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,120
All I care about right
now is getting her back.

199
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
We need to find John Constantine.

200
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,800
The demonologist?

201
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,560
Yeah, I know, he wears his tie
a little too loose for my liking,

202
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,040
but he has saved Sara
from Mallus before.

203
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,760
Gideon, can you up
my pain medication?

204
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,440
My leg is killing me.

205
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Gideon?

206
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,560
<i>The Nostromo sequence
has been activated</i>

207
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,200
<i>and will commence
in T minus three seconds.</i>

208
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,000
<i>T minus two seconds.</i>

209
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,240
Gideon, un-commence.

210
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,880
<i>That option has expired.</i>

211
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Door's locked.

212
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,800
I'm gonna kill that witch!

213
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
If you kill her, then Sara dies too.

214
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,560
- Better her than me.
- Dude, how can you say that?

215
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,000
- By moving my lips.
- Hey guys?

216
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,920
And where were you when Ray
was getting the crap beat out of him?

217
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Day-drinking again?

218
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,200
Better than kidnapping a dog!

219
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,960
- We rescued the dog, Mick!
- I'm claustrophobic!

220
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,720
Everyone, just stop yelling.

221
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,080
Guys, everyone just relax.

222
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,080
I'm gonna knock her out, tie her up,
and no one gets hurt.

223
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,720
Oh, we're screwed.

224
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Wally.

225
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Hey.

226
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,840
Never thought
we'd see each other again.

227
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
You look good.

228
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,520
This isn't you, you're not real.

229
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,960
You sure about that?

230
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Yeah.

231
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,960
I've seen apparitions before.

232
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,160
You know, I remember the first night
I said, "I love you."

233
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,160
We were in the back seat of your car.

234
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,360
You acted like you couldn't hear me.

235
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
Yeah, because I couldn't understand
why someone like you would love me.

236
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Why not?

237
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,160
Oh, come on, Jesse.

238
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,080
Wally, you're a good-looking guy.

239
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,480
Great smile.

240
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,560
I know you've had girlfriends
before me.

241
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,760
None of them were you.

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're everything.

243
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,480
You're, like, an actual genius,
and...

244
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,520
the family you come from,
and then I...

245
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,520
You're just a speed junkie
with a drug addict for a mom?

246
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,480
I wonder why it didn't work out
between us.

247
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,680
So, you're just here to hurt me?

248
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,040
Well, you can't.

249
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm, I'm actually glad
that you broke my heart.

250
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,000
You know, I traveled because of you.

251
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,600
I found some kind of inner peace.

252
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,760
I made new friends.

253
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,560
One day I'm gonna fall
in love with someone,

254
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,520
and that person isn't gonna be you.

255
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Well said.

256
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,040
Unfortunately...

257
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,440
I can hurt you.

258
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,840
NEW YORK CITY, 2018

259
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,840
John Constantine, age 36,

260
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,600
one older sister,
both parents deceased?

261
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
He's part of the Newcastle crew.

262
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,000
He accidentally summoned a demon
that dragged a child,

263
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,880
Astra Logue, into Hell.

264
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,560
Sounds like a real weirdo.

265
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,840
He's a Warlock.

266
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,280
You know, I happen to be
a level nine Warlock.

267
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,080
Dungeons and Dragons
doesn't count, Gary.

268
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Stay back.

269
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Don't move, Gary.

270
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
-Gonna get you. I'm gonna...
-What the...

271
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
All right, all right.

272
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,960
Just, go on, go, go!

273
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Okay.

274
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,040
Hey, do us a favor,
give us a hand, will you?

275
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000
Grab it, grab it, grab it!

276
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
Oh, there you are.

277
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800
All right, nice one, lad.

278
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,680
Hey, you're a feisty little bastard,
aren't you?

279
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,680
Are you guys from Housing co-op?

280
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,440
Because it's perfectly legal
to win an apartment in a duel.

281
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,000
We're here about Sara Lance.

282
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
Right, well,

283
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,200
Mrs. Veras, we will have
to continue the ritual tomorrow.

284
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,560
But not to worry, love.

285
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,760
We'll have your son married
in no time, all right?

286
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,400
<i>Gracias,</i> Señor Constantine.

287
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Okay.

288
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,440
It's a gig economy.

289
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,800
I have to take the work
where I can find it, you know?

290
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,880
Now, let me guess.

291
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,760
Sara has succumbed
to the demon Mallus.

292
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,560
I sensed his power growing,
but not to worry,

293
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,480
I gave Ray very specific instructions
to kill her if that ever happened.

294
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,760
- What?
- Eggs and omelets, love.

295
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,640
And extreme measures.

296
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, I'm here to save Sara.

297
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,720
She's bonded with the Death Totem.

298
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,640
- Oh, bollocks.
- What does that mean?

299
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,040
Oh, it's a British expletive
used to...

300
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,360
I know what bollocks means, Gary.

301
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
What did you mean by it?

302
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,320
Well, about this so-called
Death Totem.

303
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,840
Recently, whilst heavily influenced
by ayahuasca,

304
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,120
I came to learn why
the sixth lost tribe of Zambesi

305
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,440
was stricken from the oral record.

306
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,360
This lost tribe,

307
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,480
which had been entrusted
to watch over

308
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,160
the domain of the dead,
sided with Mallus

309
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,480
while the other five tribes
rallied to imprison him

310
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,240
perhaps explaining
why the Death Totem

311
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,720
is inextricably linked
with our demon friend.

312
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,160
Wally, can you hear me?

313
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,160
Wally, talk to me, man.

314
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Kid's dead.

315
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,160
I gotta go after him.

316
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,560
Just be careful out there.

317
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,080
If I'm not back in five minutes...

318
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Just wait longer?

319
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,600
No, come rescue me.

320
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,640
Okay, guys, this is ridiculous.

321
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
We can't just wait here.

322
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,760
Sara's gonna take us out one by one.

323
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,800
But I can decouple the Jumpship
from Gideon's mainframe.

324
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,600
We are getting off of this ship.

325
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,160
Sara's soul is likely trapped
in Mallus' realm.

326
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,560
Usually...

327
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,760
I'd have to cast the demon
into myself to rescue her,

328
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,200
but luckily, I already
have a link to Sara's soul.

329
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,200
So, I'll enlist Aken,

330
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,800
the Egyptian ferryman of the dead.

331
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,400
What do you mean you already
have a link to Sara's soul?

332
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,880
Well, let's just say
our souls have been one.

333
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Leaves a metaphysical
connection, love.

334
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,640
- Don't call me, "love."
- Oh, pardon me, pet.

335
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Sara and I also share a very,

336
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,320
very strong metaphysical
connection, so...

337
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,480
Wait. I can't believe...

338
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,520
You both slept with Captain Lance?

339
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,640
- Gary.
- Did we now?

340
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,920
Well then, we both have
excellent taste in damaged women.

341
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,400
- Sara's not damaged.
- Yeah.

342
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,960
And I'm the bloody Pope.

343
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,720
You know what,
let's get on with this.

344
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,600
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

345
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,480
You're going after Sara,
I'm coming with you.

346
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,920
To the realm of Mallus?

347
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,520
Start chanting.

348
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,760
Very well, give me your hand.

349
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,720
Are you serious?

350
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Deadly.

351
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,800
<i>Mallus, Aken, Ka, Ren, Ba, Ib, Sheut,
Mallus Aken Ma'at.</i>

352
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,680
<i>Mallus, Aken, Ka, Ren, Ba, Ib, Sheut,
Mallus Aken Ma'at.</i>

353
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,400
John Constantine.

354
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,640
You dare enter my realm?

355
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,680
So, any sign of the Captain, Nate?

356
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,280
No, but I found Wally.

357
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,640
- Is he...
- Alive.

358
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,200
Sara must have shot him
with the anti-speedster gun.

359
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
We're gonna need a bigger Medbay.

360
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,880
Don't worry, guys, I'm almost there.

361
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,560
Just get ready to meet me
at the Jumpship.

362
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Sorry, Giddy, this is gonna hurt you
more than me.

363
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Zari?

364
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,000
Behrad.

365
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,360
I can't sleep.

366
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,120
Will you read me a story, Zari?

367
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,320
No, no, this is...
this is the Death Totem

368
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,200
messing with my mind,
you're not real.

369
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Of course I am.

370
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,280
Please, you know the one.

371
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,160
"The Prince of Timbuktu."

372
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Please stop.

373
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,960
"The Prince of Timbuktu took
a swim in the ocean blue."

374
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,840
-"He met a tortoise
-"He met a tortoise

375
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,560
-who told him his purpose
-who told him his purpose

376
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,400
-was to be the king of Timbuktu."
-was to be the king of Timbuktu."

377
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
-Behrad.
-Behrad.

378
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Goodbye.

379
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
Sara, stop, please.

380
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,320
Sara.

381
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,720
You have to fight Mallus.

382
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,600
Stop!

383
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,560
You're hurting me.

384
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,400
Impressive.

385
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,920
But no one can fight Mallus forever.

386
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
What have you got on
your socks there, squire?

387
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,960
Oh, it's Beebo.

388
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,400
My Aunt Stacy bought them for me,
you like Beebo?

389
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,800
Once, when I was on a massive bender,

390
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,320
I put a spell on that
toy to make him talk.

391
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,160
He told me things
that'll make your toes curl.

392
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,560
Oh, like what?

393
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,800
Okay, Sara's soul is trapped
in the realm of a demon

394
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,720
and her ship and entire crew
are lost in time.

395
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,240
Who cares about Beebo?

396
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,040
Well, his Aunt Stacy does.

397
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,640
You're wound tight as a bloody drum,
aren't you, love?

398
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,280
Pardon me, pet.

399
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,600
You know, you need to loosen up.

400
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,480
And then the work just flows.

401
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,760
Oh, is that work you're doing?

402
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Sorry, I couldn't tell.

403
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,080
There isn't exactly
a paint-by-number spell

404
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,400
for locating a spaceship
floating through a temporal stream.

405
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,800
My business card says,
"Master of the Dark Arts,"

406
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,920
not "Doctor Ruddy What's-His-Face."

407
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
- Who?
- Who?

408
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Exactly.

409
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,640
What, okay, you know what, Gary?

410
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,160
Let's just get outta here
because Mr. Constantine

411
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,560
- has wasted enough of our time.
- Oh, that's where you are.

412
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,760
You beauty.

413
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,960
Okay, so you have a foot,
but you don't have a phone?

414
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,240
I, I just... I really don't
understand how Sara could've...

415
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,920
What, shagged me
in a mental institute?

416
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh, my God!

417
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Ah, you have nothing
to be jealous about.

418
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,920
I am not jealous, I'm just...

419
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
Okay, maybe I'm a little bit jealous.

420
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,280
Ah, we were just trying to find
some calm in the storm.

421
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,320
I don't understand,
who sleeps with a Warlock

422
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,560
and then turns around and starts
calling me her girlfriend?

423
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,320
She called you her girlfriend?

424
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,960
Yeah, and I really wanna believe her.

425
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,280
- But?
- But I don't think that

426
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,520
Sara's really a one-woman woman.

427
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,760
Well, if the price of admission
is looking like a fool

428
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,920
or getting your heart broken

429
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,520
then well, I'd say Ms. Lance
is pretty well worth it.

430
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Okay.

431
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,160
Boys, there has to be a way
to find the Waverider.

432
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,120
I have an idea.

433
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,240
We're all ears, mate.

434
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,360
The Legends remind me
of my D and D group.

435
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,400
- Don't laugh.
- Too late.

436
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,960
And last year, we were on a campaign,

437
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,440
"The Trials of Eagan."

438
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,280
Our party was made up of a monk...

439
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,520
a druid...

440
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,920
a half-orc rogue...

441
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
a bard,

442
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,600
and like, a... like, a cheerful gnome

443
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,000
who was also
a very accomplished wizard.

444
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,040
With two men down, we were trapped
in the Tomb of Ruination,

445
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,520
and we were being hunted
by Zanatar the Unburnt.

446
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,600
We were exhausted,
running low on food.

447
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,200
Hungry.

448
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,840
Zari, come in.

449
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,480
<i>Zari, do you copy?</i>

450
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Our sorceress was missing,
feared dead.

451
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,160
Gary, how does any of this help us
find Sara and the Legends?

452
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,400
Hey, hey, hey.

453
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,640
Let the man finish his story,
all right?

454
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
As you were, mate.

455
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,000
Zanatar the Unburnt
wielded the Death Sword,

456
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,920
one of the Six Swords of Sorrow.

457
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,240
To defeat him, we needed...

458
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,120
Another of the Six Swords.

459
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,320
The best way to defeat a totem bearer
is with another totem.

460
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,440
Yeah, that worked out well for Z.

461
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,360
Seeing as I am out of commission,

462
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,240
one of you two needs
to wield the Earth Totem.

463
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,080
Which turned Blackbeard's
lady friend into a zombie.

464
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,640
It merely manifested
the pirate queen's true nature.

465
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,800
A righteous warrior has nothing
to fear from wielding a totem.

466
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,640
A righteous warrior, count me out.

467
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,800
All right, well,

468
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,240
Earth Totem...

469
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
meet Steel Man.

470
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,360
So, how did your D and D crew thingy
find one of the six Swords of Sorrow?

471
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,880
We didn't, we died a grizzly death
at the hands of Zanatar.

472
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,760
-Gary!
-But, but...

473
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,040
that's because we weren't
working in concert.

474
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,880
The Legends will be fine as long
as they just don't split up.

475
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,720
Mick and I will find Zari.

476
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,960
All right,
and I'll go get the Earth Totem.

477
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,160
You're gonna die.

478
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,920
- Hey.
- Thanks, Mick.

479
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,080
You can do this.

480
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,880
The point of my story is, even though
we were defeated by Zanatar,

481
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,120
we were able to track
the mystical object he was wielding.

482
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,160
The Sword of bloody Sorrow.

483
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,200
You are a bloody genius, Barry.

484
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Gary.

485
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,720
Gary, right.

486
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,560
I need the vile from my desk,

487
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,400
Mother's tears,
and my ruination stones,

488
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,080
and from you, Ava, I'm gonna need...

489
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,840
- Oh, please don't say it.
- The foot.

490
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,200
Sorry, can we just pretend
for a moment that I have no idea

491
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
what you two are doing?

492
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,680
Well, it's like our Gary said

493
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,040
the easiest way to locate
the Legends' ship

494
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,080
is to locate the Death Totem.

495
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,760
You know, it's a shame that you had
to join the family business.

496
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,280
You were a sweet kid.

497
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,720
Last time we were here,
I was a little girl,

498
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,480
but I was never sweet.

499
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,840
Your friend, Oliver, made sure
of that when he killed my father.

500
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,800
Oliver's not responsible
for the path that you chose.

501
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
You're right.

502
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,120
You see, Sara, you and I...

503
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
we're alike.

504
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,000
The darkness
has always been within us.

505
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,560
Please.

506
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,480
Ra's Al Ghul will never know
you let me live.

507
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Papi!

508
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,000
Once a killer, always a killer.

509
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,120
Why are you crying, Sara?

510
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,920
You've done nothing wrong.

511
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,400
Imagine what you could do
if you just released your guilt.

512
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,040
You can't erase your past, Sara,
so just embrace it.

513
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,400
You want me to join your team.

514
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,800
It's your destiny.

515
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,760
Eons ago, the sixth tribe of Zambesi
defended Mallus from their brethren.

516
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,360
Their tribe wielded the Death Totem.

517
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,680
Now the cycle's starting again.

518
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,480
You weren't just born to wield
the Death Totem, Sara.

519
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,200
You were born to wield
the Death Totem for Mallus.

520
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Z.

521
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,400
I'm all right, barely.

522
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,800
Nathaniel, we have Z.

523
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,280
Did you find the Earth Totem?

524
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,320
Actually I did, but, guys,
Sara found me.

525
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,680
Nathaniel, where are you?

526
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
<i>Nathaniel?</i>

527
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,480
What's the matter, Nathaniel?

528
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,080
You look like you've seen a ghost.

529
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Nathaniel?

530
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,000
Nathaniel, where are you?

531
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,600
Right, the Fire Totem's
our last chance to defeat her.

532
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,040
Oh, and here I thought escaping
to the Jumpship was a good plan.

533
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
I don't care what she's done.

534
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,840
I'm not abandoning Sara
or anyone else on this team.

535
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,200
Too bad, you're down a leg,

536
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,120
and you look like a cat stuck
in a dryer.

537
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,600
That's not funny, I love cats.

538
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,800
I'll wield the totem.

539
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,240
Let's just get to the lab.

540
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,680
Here's hoping Ray
knew what he was doing.

541
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,720
Get a grip, Nate.

542
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,400
That's not your grandfather.

543
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,360
Houston, 1970.

544
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,240
I wanted to be with my wife and son,

545
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,800
but you convinced me
that was impossible.

546
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,240
You were relieved
when I blew the cargo bay door.

547
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,440
I didn't want you to die.

548
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,880
You were desperate
to save your own hide.

549
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,120
And what have you made
of yourself, boy?

550
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,200
You're a damn disappointment
to your father

551
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,440
and you're sure as hell
a disappointment to me.

552
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,440
You think Amaya loves you?

553
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,560
You're not worthy of her love.

554
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
There.

555
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,680
Haircut nuked the stone.

556
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,600
This totem wasn't meant for me.

557
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,600
You have to use it.

558
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,360
- Forget it.
- You've spent your entire life

559
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,920
obsessed with fire and heat.

560
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,240
What if this is the reason why?

561
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,480
How many times do I have to tell you
I'm not a hero?

562
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,800
Sara's a hero

563
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,600
and look what the Death Totem
did to her.

564
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,080
That was the work of Mallus.

565
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,760
Most people who've seen
what you've seen

566
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
would've succumbed to darkness,
but you didn't.

567
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,880
You chose to become a Legend.

568
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,280
You may try and hide it, Mick,
but you're a good man.

569
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,680
What if you're wrong?

570
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,280
There's only one way to find out.

571
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,960
<i>Exorcizamus te,
omnis immundus spiritius.</i>

572
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,960
<i>Omnis satanic potestas,
omnis infernalis adversarii,</i>

573
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,080
<i>in nomine at virtute Domini.</i>

574
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,600
Hit her with the holy water.

575
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,400
There's somebody
who wants to talk to you, John.

576
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
John?

577
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,960
You glamoured your voice.

578
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,480
That's the oldest bloody trick
in the book.

579
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,440
You don't remember me?

580
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,080
I know it's been a long time.

581
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,040
- Astra.
- Mallus will free me from hell,

582
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,800
but you have to give him Sara.

583
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,200
A life for a life.
You know, better than anybody.

584
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,760
Magic always has a price.

585
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,880
I wanna speak to Sara.

586
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
Okay.

587
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,360
All right, Astra.

588
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
I'll do it.

589
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,040
Give me your hand, Astra.

590
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Come on.

591
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
It's all right, love.

592
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,320
It's just me.

593
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
It's Johnny.

594
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,760
No one escapes Hell.

595
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,280
The sacred cross commands you
to free this woman from your prison.

596
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,320
To free this woman from your prison.

597
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,760
Wielding a totem's bad enough.

598
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,320
Now, you want me to wear a necklace?

599
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,960
There's no time, Mick.

600
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,840
See? Doesn't work.

601
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,560
Are you still with me, Mick?

602
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
Sara!

603
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,840
Sara? Sara?

604
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,120
Does Ava know
who you really are, Sara?

605
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,720
What you've done?

606
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,840
What are you gonna tell her?

607
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,800
That the totem was wrong?

608
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,040
You aren't a killer?

609
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,080
The totem's power is within you,
Sara, all you have to do is decide.

610
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
A life...

611
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,760
free of pain and regret with us,

612
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,040
or the tormented half-life
you're living now?

613
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
Sara?

614
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,760
I know you are still in there.

615
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,200
You are the strongest,

616
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,680
most fearless person I've ever met
and you never back down.

617
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,720
Don't you remember?

618
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,640
When did a Legend ever go quietly?

619
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,920
I'm here.

620
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,440
I'm here, Sara,
and I need you to come back to me.

621
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,200
I need you to come home.

622
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,280
Sara, can't you feel me?

623
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
No.

624
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,440
You're making a mistake.

625
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,040
No, to a life without pain or regret.

626
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,720
No, to being a demon's lackey

627
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,320
and no, to bringing more death
into this world.

628
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,280
I owe that little girl at least that.

629
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,480
You could have everything.

630
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,120
You saved me again.

631
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
I had a little help.

632
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,720
Well, while we're here.

633
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
A light?

634
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,160
Chin chin.

635
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,920
I should definitely come
to your aid more often.

636
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,560
Well, at this point,

637
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,840
I might as well just make you
a bed on the ship.

638
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Tempting.

639
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,240
If you thought Mallus
really would've freed Astra,

640
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,240
you would have traded me,
wouldn't you?

641
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,600
- In a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

642
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,440
Well, what can I say?

643
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,640
I'm a nasty piece of work.

644
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,560
So am I.

645
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,800
- You survived, love.
- For now.

646
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,840
You know, there's a reason why
I prefer to walk this path alone.

647
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
It's...

648
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,160
So, I don't have to share
with anyone how lost I really am.

649
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,360
But you're not alone, are you, Sara?

650
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,600
Maybe I should be.

651
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,200
She's a good one.

652
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,480
Try not to hurt her.

653
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,880
That's what I'm afraid of.

654
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Pinch me.

655
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
Okay.

656
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Sara.

657
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,840
Is it the real Sara?

658
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,840
Yeah, it's me.

659
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm sorry, Ray.

660
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
I'm...

661
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,680
I'm sorry, everyone.

662
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm really sorry.

663
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,480
It's good to have you back, Captain.

664
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,280
Yeah, because evil you is a pain
in the ass to fight.

665
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,040
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around this mess.

666
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,720
Why would Mallus want
to show me Jesse?

667
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,920
- Or me my grandpa?
- I don't know.

668
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,840
Mallus was trying
to recruit me to his side

669
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,960
and using my darkest fears.

670
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,920
Maybe that's just what he does,
he looks into our hearts and...

671
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,400
broadcasts our deepest secrets.

672
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,200
That's terrifying.

673
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,520
Okay. You up.

674
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,920
I need your speed
to re-couple the mainframe.

675
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,200
Music to my ears.

676
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,200
Oh, although,
I was really digging the silver hair.

677
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Hey.

678
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,000
We need to talk.

679
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,960
No good conversation
ever started that way.

680
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,640
- Ava, I'm sorry.
- Listen...

681
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,400
I can't pretend to understand
what you went through

682
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,600
or... or what happened to you
but I know that wasn't you, Sara.

683
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
That's just it.

684
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
That was me.

685
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,720
Just like fire is to Rory,
there is part of me that...

686
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,160
it's always been there.

687
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,160
And I really tried to pretend
that that wasn't true.

688
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,440
But deep down...

689
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,760
I am death.

690
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,960
No, Sara, okay, so...

691
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,800
so we can fight that part
of you together,

692
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,120
- just tell me what to do.
- Hey.

693
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,480
Ava, you read my file.

694
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,080
But I still showed up
at that restaurant,

695
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,000
in that horribly uncomfortable
dress trying to impress you

696
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,320
because I don't care
about your past, Sara.

697
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,640
Well, maybe you should.

698
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,400
You are wonderful.

699
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
And I...

700
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,320
and I've never been this happy
in my life.

701
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,520
But this doesn't look happy.

702
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,560
Look, I don't deserve you.

703
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,720
- Yes, Sara, yes, you do.
- No, Ava, I don't.

704
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,600
You deserve better,
you deserve so much better.

705
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,240
And I care about you, but...

706
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,200
I'm not gonna do this. I won't.

707
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,760
- Sara.
- I'm sorry.

708
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,400
Fresh from a successful crusade,

709
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,880
our team knew
the fight was far from over.

710
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,280
In fact, the true battle
was only just beginning.

711
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,040
This spot reserved for the girlfriend
of Sara Lance

712
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,600
In order to defeat the demon
and his cabal of evil,

713
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,640
we need to be at full strength,

714
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,280
which is going
to be hard given the losses

715
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,480
we sustained on our last quest.

716
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,640
Some wounds are so deep,
they never truly heal.

717
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,920
So, the question is,

718
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,160
are you prepared to join us
on this mission most deadly?

719
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,680
Well, tonight, squire...

720
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,560
I'm all yours.

721
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,200
18 2 20 14
