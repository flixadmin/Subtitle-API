1
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,761
Good morning, Sergeant.

2
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,231
Good morning, Paisa.
What have you got for us?

3
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:04,241
I've got plumbing valves,
a bunch of clean towels,

4
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,402
and extra uniforms for the guards.

5
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,045
Let him go. He's been checked.

6
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,053
Continue. Continue, Paisa.

7
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,850
Thank you, Sergeant.

8
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,723
- Good day.
- Good day.

9
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,193
- Good day, Paisa.
- Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.

10
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,976
<i>Escobar's prison was called La Catedral,</i>

11
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,876
<i>but we nicknamed it "Club Medellín."</i>

12
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,047
<i>It was the embodiment of "the big lie."</i>

13
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,879
<i>it was even bum
to look old and shitty on the outside.</i>

14
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,389
<i>But inside, it was anything but.</i>

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,955
<i>The other inmates?
Escobar's</i> sicarios.

16
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,792
<i>Hand-picked killers from his hometown.</i>

17
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,668
You're here, my friend!

18
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,432
- How you doing, Velasco?
- Good, brother. How was the trip?

19
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,474
Fine, fine.
What a long drive!

20
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,270
- Really?
- It's really hot.

21
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,674
Did you encounter any problems?

22
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,440
Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.

23
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,678
I brought everything, including
the special items requested by Pablo.

24
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,480
- What's going on, buddy?
- Blackie!

25
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:25,182
- I thought you forgot about us.
- Let me show you.

26
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:31,623
Oh, my God. All right, boys!
Get a ladder over here!

27
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:35,758
<i>The</i> sicarios <i>weren't the only guys
in the prison who worked for Escobar:</i>

28
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,426
<i>The guards did, too.</i>

29
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,937
-  Welcome to La Catedral.
-  Hello.

30
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,839
- Come on down, ladies.

31
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,035
We'll take care of you.

32
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,981
<i>By the terms of his deal,</i>

33
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,955
<i>no cops or military were allowed
within two miles of the prison.</i>

34
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,050
<i>As much as I fucking hated this guy,
I had to hand it to him...</i>

35
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,220
<i>he had a pretty sweet deal.</i>

36
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:20,338
Come on! Hurry up!
What? Is it heavy?

37
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,673
- That looks delicious, Paisa.
- All right, lobsters.

38
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,746
<i>Escobar hadn't built
himself a prison at all.</i>

39
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,417
<i>He'd built himself a fortress.</i>

40
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,961
<i>But no matter how you decorate it...
a cage is still a cage.</i>

41
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,260
Excuse me, boss.

42
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,387
I've got a report.

43
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,160
Moncada and Galeano are
reporting that we got 10,000 kilos

44
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,565
through Mexico and the Caribbean.

45
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,729
Did they pay the war tax?

46
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,104
Yes, boss, but ever since
you settled things with the government,

47
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,473
a lot of other people
have been complaining.

48
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:05,784
My expenses in and out of the prison
must be covered by everyone.

49
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,011
Understood.

50
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,983
Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel
are preparing for a ceasefire.

51
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,657
Mm.

52
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,122
As am I.

53
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,695
We're going to negotiate a truce.

54
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,667
But first,
we're going to kill a few of his men.

55
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:31,299
I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel
is going to take that as an act of war,

56
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,139
don't you think?

57
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,651
The purpose of war...

58
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,621
is peace.

59
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,028
<i>If there was one benefit
to Escobar's imprisonment,</i>

60
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,123
<i>It's that peace
had finally come to Bogotá.</i>

61
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,137
<i>Connie and Hook advantage
and began adoption proceedings.</i>

62
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,537
<i>The war had left many orphans.</i>

63
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,199
<i>One... we could do something about.</i>

64
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,213
Oh, you like the pink ones,
don't you? Yeah, you do.

65
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,840
Oh, orchids, look!

66
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,081
What's this one? <i>"Cattleya."</i>

67
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,079
It means "graceful." Hm.

68
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,422
- That describes me perfectly.

69
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:30,065
Oh, buying baby things
and plants for the apartment...

70
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,102
we're a family.

71
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,229
We're domesticated animals.

72
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,931
- You want this one?
- Yeah.

73
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,703
- You want that one? Yeah.

74
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,214
How about Elizabeth?

75
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,052
After my mother?
Are you kidding?

76
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:54,016
What is "Elizabeth" in Spanish?
Is it "Isabel"? Isabel's nice.

77
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,525
- I've always liked "Olivia."
- Olivia's OK.

78
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,797
Fuck.

79
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,229
- Shit!

80
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,808
- What's the deal?
- Steve...

81
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,410
Look what you've done to my car.

82
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,376
- Where?
- Look at this traffic jam.

83
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,780
- Look what you did to my car!
- Ah! It's nothing.

84
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,715
- How am I gonna drive this?
- It's nothing.

85
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,651
Look at the fucking traffic jam
this is causing.

86
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,584
Yeah, man!

87
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,919
And you don't even speak Spanish?
Get out of here.

88
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,929
- Don't mess with me, asshole.
- Easy, man.

89
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:36,661
Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me?
What the hell have you come here for, fag?

90
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,336
I deserve respect, you son of a bitch.
So that's it, then.

91
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:42,134
What, are you gonna hit me'?
You and who else?

92
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,240
Oh, my...

93
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:48,072
OK, take it easy.
It's all right. It's OK now.

94
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,083
- Calm down, asshole.
- OK?

95
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,676
- Relax, man. OK.
- OK?

96
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,686
OK, calm down.

97
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,352
Have some tolerance.

98
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,006
Yeah, I like "Olivia."

99
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,639
- Do you hear that?
- What?

100
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,578
People. Children. Laughter.

101
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,081
Even the vendors are back out.

102
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:14,054
And all because we gave Escobar
the keys to his own prison.

103
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,287
You did the right thing.

104
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,986
You think?

105
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,155
You should be happy.

106
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,329
Finally, people can return
to their normal lives.

107
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,305
Finally... we are at peace.

108
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:56,464
We spoke with Pablo,
and he is willing to negotiate.

109
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,841
Ten of my men have just been killed.

110
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,636
Is that how you guys
begin negotiations?

111
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,045
Two things, Pacho.

112
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:15,948
First... Mr. Galeano and I
had nothing to do with those deaths.

113
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,355
And the second thing...
this is war, Pacho.

114
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:24,485
There are deaths everywhere,
and we have casualties as well.

115
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,359
We are willing
to pay three million dollars

116
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,904
- to settle the dispute in Los Angeles.

117
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,738
Pablo won't accept anything
under $12 million, Pacho.

118
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,911
Twelve million is nothing to you.

119
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,051
Do you want to know something?

120
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,588
It's over.

121
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,884
What's over?

122
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:59,191
- The Medellín cartel.

123
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,664
No, you're wrong, Pacho.

124
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,858
We export twice the amount you do.

125
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,701
You invited me here
to give me this line of bullshit?

126
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:14,736
Pablo put a war tax on the two of you
for $250,000 a month.

127
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,745
That's how he treats
his friends and associates?

128
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:21,942
Don't forget that, thanks to
Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

129
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,353
extradition was abolished.
That serves you very well, doesn't it?

130
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,958
He was the one
who got us into this mess.

131
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:33,895
Killing politicians and cops,
bombing street corners and airplanes.

132
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,091
He started this fucking war.

133
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,363
Are we going to negotiate or not?

134
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:49,372
<i>As part of Escobar's surrender deal,
Search Bloc was disbanded,</i>

135
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,550
<i>and Colonel Carrillo
was transferred out of the country.</i>

136
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:57,247
<i>For the time being,
Carillos war was over.</i>

137
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,154
I don't see why
they're sending you to Spain.

138
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,725
It's not like the cocaine war is over.

139
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,624
Galeano and Moncada
are fronting for Escobar.

140
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,727
My superiors say I play too rough.

141
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:13,896
At least Escobar is in jail and... you can
leave knowing you helped put him there.

142
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,005
Jail?

143
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,670
I know you gringos
aren't allowed to do flyovers, but um...

144
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,175
I got some photographs,
courtesy of the Colombian military.

145
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,649
I want you to look at 'em,
tell me if this qualifies as a jail.

146
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,123
He's got a fucking soccer field.

147
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,265
Escobar is moving more coke than ever.

148
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,528
Without the Colombian government
breathing down his neck,

149
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,001
all he's gotta worry about
is the Cali cartel.

150
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,872
Let's face it, fellas...

151
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,104
he won.

152
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,315
We're here, gentlemen!

153
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,549
- Gentlemen!
- What a bumpy ride, Paisa.

154
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,889
Where did you learn to drive?

155
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,494
We closed the deal at ten million dollars.

156
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,899
This takes care of the problem
we had in LA and ends the war.

157
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,631
Sounds like a good proposition.

158
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,970
Do you know what this means, boss'?

159
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,842
We can maintain our infrastructure
and the government won't be the wiser.

160
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,213
That way, we can... double our exports
in less than a month, Pablo.

161
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,050
How did he behave...

162
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,083
when he offered you the money?

163
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,227
What do you mean,
"how did he behave"?

164
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,061
What was his attitude?

165
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,400
Well... he was respectful, Pablo.

166
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,333
Respectful in what way?

167
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,500
- He wants peace, just like us.
- Yes, but...

168
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,601
how did he react
when you told him our solution?

169
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,369
In a positive manner.

170
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,779
He just offered you the money,
just like that?

171
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:11,052
Well... he started
at three million dollars. Right?

172
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,121
- Mm.
- But we said no,

173
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,950
and told him
you wouldn't take less than 12.

174
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:19,257
So he offered ten,
and we felt that was a fair deal.

175
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,699
Offered you three million?

176
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,895
He was feeling us out.
He knew we wouldn't accept that.

177
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:33,874
If he really respected me,
he would be grateful if I accepted 20.

178
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,480
That's right, buss.
Ask for 20. In one shot.

179
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,223
Tell him I'm not happy
with less than 30.

180
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,257
The Cali cartel wont accept that, Pablo.

181
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,660
Thirty million...
if Cali wants peace.

182
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,448
Very good.

183
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,795
I also need to raise the war tax.

184
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,968
From now on,
a million a month,

185
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,706
for both of you...
and all our other partners.

186
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,690
Good move beating him,
you son of a bitch.

187
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,159
If we get solid proof that Escobar
is violating the terms of his surrender,

188
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,859
then they have to send him
to a real prison,

189
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,799
but we need more
than these aerial shots.

190
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,134
Can you get us satellite communications
or wire intercepts?

191
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,800
There's a no-fly zone over the prison,
with antiaircraft guns

192
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,070
manned by the Colombian army
to enforce it.

193
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,076
You're playing with fire
if Noonan finds out.

194
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,169
We don't got shit on him
without intercepts.

195
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,238
- Don't need 'em.
- What? The hell we don't.

196
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,011
They're not using phones.

197
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,318
- The hell is that?
- I could spot a coop a mile away.

198
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,414
That's how they're sending messages.

199
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,489
<i>To avoid our high-tech spy planes,</i>

200
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:36,432
<i>Pablo chose the most
low-tech form of communication.</i>

201
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,729
<i>Never said the guy wasn't crafty.</i>

202
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,902
- You see anything yet?
- No, man.

203
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,866
You're blind as a bat.
Give me those.

204
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,791
- Oh, one's goin'.

205
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:06,056
- Ten o'clock. Comin' in low.
- I got it.

206
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:07,963
- You got it'?
- Yeah.

207
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,089
Low.

208
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,695
Ah...

209
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,902
That's a fast fucking pigeon.

210
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,607
Give me the gun.

211
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,908
- You trying to say I'm a lousy shot?
- Yes, I am saying you're a lousy shot.

212
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,277
Here.

213
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,711
You're a shit shot.

214
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,751
- Heads up, heads up.
- I got it.

215
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,756
- One o'clock.
- I got it.

216
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,819
Shoot.

217
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,626
Shoot!

218
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,091
Ever been duck huntin'?

219
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:51,298
No, I have not been duck hunting,
you... fucking hillbilly.

220
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,845
- Bingo.

221
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,316
It's in Spanish. Read it.

222
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:13,760
"Delivery due
with El Paisa in the tunnel."

223
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,198
The son of a bitch
built a tunnel under the jail.

224
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,532
We talked with Pablo
and reached an agreement.

225
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,972
- Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

226
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,534
We agreed to...

227
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,275
- one million dollars.
- What?

228
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,149
Right.

229
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,219
What about the house in Cartagena?

230
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,123
That's not happening, right?

231
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,527
Do you want your house in Cartagena?

232
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,294
- Of course.
- OK... you will have it.

233
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,858
Don't you see
things are improving?

234
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,904
No, I see things
are getting more complicated.

235
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:59,576
Instead of getting better...
things are getting worse.

236
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:01,740
Mm-hm.

237
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,481
Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.

238
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,544
Now, what about this war tax
he's charging you?

239
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:14,489
$250,000 was a lot of money.

240
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,687
And now a million?
Ridiculous.

241
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,857
What do you think I should do'?
Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?

242
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,265
- Obviously not.
- Then I don't understand.

243
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:29,430
- What do you want me to do?
- It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.

244
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,445
Look, I... adore Pablo.
I adore him.

245
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,748
But the thing is, I don't know
what's going on with him these days.

246
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,021
I don't know.
Maybe he's depressed.

247
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:57,959
We're here in a Jacuzzi...

248
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,867
free.

249
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,099
- Do you love me?
- Oh...

250
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,703
Stop fucking around.
You make me angry.

251
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:19,113
Against orders, we did
high-altitude flyovers of the prison

252
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,589
- with our infrared cameras.
- No tunnels.

253
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,493
Tomography report indicates nothing.
Seismic measuring, <i>nada.</i>

254
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,120
Can we measure radio frequency energy?

255
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,822
Well, we could try.
Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.

256
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,960
If he's bringing shit into this tunnel,
you can bet your ass he's going out that way.

257
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,766
If there's a tunnel there,
he must have dug it to China.

258
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,305
Good luck.

259
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,777
Maybe we can...

260
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,923
We can ask the military
to do light detection and ranging.

261
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,187
We got a better chance of Noonan
authorizing a divining rod.

262
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,327
- All right, man, I'm calling it a night.
- Nah, finish up.

263
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,423
No, you can't even smoke in here.

264
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,370
No luck?

265
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:14,201
These aerials don't indicate
a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.

266
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,802
Hm.

267
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:19,042
Well, the only thing I can see
in all of them is this truck.

268
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,316
- Are you finished with that, honey?
- Yeah.

269
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,203
What happened?

270
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
Did it stop?

271
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,580
Good morning.

272
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,347
- What's up?
- Are you "The Paisa"?

273
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,356
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.

274
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,586
Do me a favor
and get out of the truck.

275
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:09,356
- What's going on'?
- Don't be afraid.

276
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,861
Up against the truck.

277
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,544
Let's go.

278
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,711
Do me another favor.

279
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,273
Open it up.

280
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,251
Go on.

281
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,630
We just missed a very important delivery.

282
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:55,210
Sex toys, back issues of <i>Hustler,</i>
a waterbed, a legal correspondence course.

283
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,541
He's bored shitless in there.

284
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,949
Look, gringos...
you don't have the right to do this.

285
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,385
Of course we have the right.

286
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:10,450
You just press the button in the truck
and we will do the rest, OK?

287
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:15,464
If the boss finds out that I let you
put cameras in the truck, he'll kill me.

288
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,624
What did he say?

289
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,927
He says if Pablo finds out,
he'll kill him.

290
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,128
<i>Amigo...</i>

291
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,843
Pablo's your boss?

292
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,243
Yeah? Yeah.

293
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:43,518
I am your boss. Yes?

294
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,186
It's OK, it's OK!
I'll do whatever you say.

295
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,628
Yeah?

296
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,534
Are you OK, friend?

297
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,133
Good day.

298
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,551
So what is this?
What am I looking at exactly?

299
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,648
- Club Medellín.
- This was all shipped in to La Catedral.

300
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,025
We got some big-screen TVs,
nice stereo equipment.

301
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,255
That's a roulette wheel,
a little bit of liquor.

302
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:59,063
Glad to see the judges could come down
with the official from the airport.

303
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,898
Javi's pretty keen on this Jacuzzi.

304
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,068
Don't forget the jukebox
with the hookers.

305
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,335
Of course, the lobster.

306
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:15,182
- This is a--
- Yes, it's a roulette wheel.

307
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,346
He has a casino
right there at La Catedral.

308
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:23,258
- Where did you get these pictures?
- From the DEA.

309
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,191
Of course.

310
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,196
It's not just these pictures.

311
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,028
They also have pictures of judges,
local government people,

312
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:35,061
other narcos, prostitutes...
Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.

313
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:40,800
- Who else has seen these?
- No one, as far as I know.

314
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:45,211
- That's why we have to act now.

315
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,275
Do you think the DEA is capable
of leaking the photos to the media?

316
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:54,119
The DEA is capable of anything.
That's why we have to do something now.

317
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:01,629
At one time, Escobar...
used to own all of Colombia.

318
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,728
Now he's just the owner
of his own prison.

319
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:12,075
If I had to choose
between prostitutes at La Catedral...

320
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,740
or bombings in the country...

321
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:23,815
I would be eternally grateful
to these women.

322
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,455
Happy birthday, Pablo!

323
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,761
- Watch your step.
- Careful with the little girl!

324
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,926
How are you? Welcome.

325
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,264
- Happy birthday.
- Hello, sweetheart.

326
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,960
They're the ones I hired?
I don't believe you.

327
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:16,200
They are really good, Blackie.
I like them.

328
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:21,404
Come on, Pablo, tell us...
what are you doing these days? Hm!

329
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,413
- How do you spend your time?
- Aside from missing his family?

330
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,979
Oh! Of course.

331
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,742
- He's writing a book.
- Mm!

332
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,843
- Mother.
- What?

333
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,423
Isn't it true?
You are writing a book.

334
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,524
Please, Mom.

335
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,252
Well, then, you tell them.

336
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,000
- It's a collection of magazine articles.
- Many articles.

337
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,202
- Clippings. It's a book of cartoons.
- Oh, cartoons!

338
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:54,938
From newspapers and magazines
all over the world.

339
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,613
And you know what?
People write him every day.

340
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,112
- It's because they love him.
- I can imagine.

341
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,345
You have to find ways
to keep your mind occupied around here.

342
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:08,048
Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband
and Galeano to help you with the business.

343
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,356
Yes, on that note,
Kiko is so grateful to you

344
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,794
for all the responsibilities
you have given him.

345
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,387
Thank you very much.

346
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,225
- We were in Cartagena--
- Where?

347
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,599
- We were in Cartagena last week.
- Oh, yeah?

348
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,034
Oh, yes, we spent
some beautiful days there relaxing.

349
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,972
It must feel good
to be able to relax like that.

350
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,370
- How nice.
- Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine.

351
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,072
But I'll tell you,
Cartagena is really expensive.

352
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,945
Oh, it's unaffordable.

353
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,451
Besides, this whole "war with Cali" thing,

354
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,613
it's tough, you know,
with the tax we have to pay.

355
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,955
We understand it's not easy,
but there's not much we can do.

356
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,585
It's OK.

357
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,132
Kiko complained about that?

358
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,807
He mentioned it.

359
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,005
He didn't complain, Pablo,
he didn't complain.

360
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:10,280
Everyone here is absolutely aware
of the huge sacrifice that you're making,

361
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,115
for God's sake.
So I think it's normal, right?

362
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,950
It's normal that
we'd give you our support.

363
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,594
Well, I think it's normal...
I really do.

364
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,865
Juan Pablito, go play with your dad
for a little while, OK?

365
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,802
Honey, you should
play with the kids a little bit.

366
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,813
Leave the gift here.

367
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,879
I'll look after it.

368
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:04,807
The word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn't
gonna do shit about Escobar's violations.

369
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,143
Carrillo was right. He won.

370
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,515
What are those?

371
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,180
These are a list of, uh...
my accomplishments.

372
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,568
You shred these.

373
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,946
Apologize!

374
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,213
Apologize!

375
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,952
- Were you watching?
- Yes.

376
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,618
You apologize!

377
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,627
I'm sorry, boss.

378
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,565
I didn't mean it.

379
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,164
- Relax.
- Are you all right, boss?

380
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,572
Relax. That's how the game goes.

381
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,237
Go on, go on.
You guys continue.

382
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,941
Are you all right, sir?

383
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,414
Boss.

384
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,486
Excuse me, boss,
but I need to speak to you.

385
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,991
Everything OK?

386
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:07,827
- Boss, we have a problem.
- What problem?

387
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,795
You remember that Moncada and Galeano
had a large shipment

388
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:14,531
- that was seized in Boyacá?
- Yes.

389
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,607
- 250 kilos.
- Exactly.

390
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,974
Can you imagine, a farmer found
three million dollars buried in a field?

391
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,478
Do you know where that was, boss?

392
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,515
In Rionegro.

393
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:32,513
<i>True story. And pay attention,
because it changes a lot of lives.</i>

394
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:37,224
<i>Remember how I told you that
the cartel was making so much money</i>

395
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,158
<i>that they had to bury it?</i>

396
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,491
<i>And Blackbeard had the treasure map.</i>

397
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:45,365
<i>Well, after we got him,
he gave a lot of it up...</i>

398
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,300
<i>but not all of it.</i>

399
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,307
<i>It just so happens that one day,
out in a field in Rionegro,</i>

400
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:56,005
<i>a farmer who worked
for Galeano and Moncada found one.</i>

401
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,741
<i>At first, the poor guy
thought he dug up a body.</i>

402
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,213
<i>Over the years, plenty of 'em
had been buried out in the fields.</i>

403
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,848
<i>The farmer knew right away
it was narco money.</i>

404
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:09,723
<i>He was terrified he might
get buried himself if he took it.</i>

405
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:12,555
<i>So he took the money
to a guy who was connected,</i>

406
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,927
<i>who took it to another guy...</i>

407
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,196
<i>who took it to Pablo's</i>
sicario<i> lieutenant... Velasco.</i>

408
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,895
There's cash buried everywhere.

409
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,935
The guerillas, the paramilitary,
the narcos...

410
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:31,608
- Everybody's burying cash.
- Yes, I know.

411
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,749
But right on Moncada
and Galeands property?

412
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,944
Don't you think that's strange, boss?

413
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,857
I think it's strange.

414
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,821
Look. All this cash...

415
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:18,088
was found in a field.

416
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,661
- That's good luck, Pablo.

417
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:26,102
Or it could be bad luck.
For you both.

418
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,442
It was on your property,
in Rionegro.

419
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:39,081
But Pablo,
those lands are over 300 acres,

420
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,277
and most of us rent out to the farmers.

421
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,483
Mm.

422
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:52,022
You told me that you had
a 250-kilo shipment seized.

423
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,596
That's true.

424
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,958
The shipment equaled that amount of cash.

425
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,430
Who told you to open your mouth?

426
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,832
Not true? Hm?

427
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:06,037
Pablo, do you think
we're stealing from you?

428
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,975
That we made up that whole story
about the seizure?

429
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:12,015
If you'd like,
check with the cops in Boyacá.

430
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:16,483
Right, because cops in Boyacá
are so honest, right?

431
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,647
Keep in mind that
we bought that property from Gustavo.

432
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:27,797
I even remember Gustavo saying
that you had cash stashed in every corner.

433
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:35,738
Gustavo...
would never forget where he buried cash.

434
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:41,504
Who's putting this shit
in your head, Pablo? These assholes?

435
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,976
These fuckers
would sell their own mother.

436
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:47,844
- We are partners and friends.
- Mm.

437
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:53,982
Maybe that cash was lost
because I raised the tax?

438
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,160
Bullshit.
I paid the tax and never complained.

439
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,525
That's a lie.

440
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:05,491
- Because you complained to your wife.
- I haven't complained.

441
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,697
You have no idea
what I talk about with Judy.

442
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,507
I understand
this is difficult for you, Pablo--

443
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,167
What is difficult for me?

444
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,868
Well, managing all of this.
That's why you hired us.

445
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,916
- So we can manage it and look after it.
- Mm.

446
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,521
You trust us, right?

447
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,614
I understand this makes you anxious--

448
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,626
- Do I look anxious?
- No, I didn't mean that.

449
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,421
- You said with certainty that--
- No, no, what I meant to say was--

450
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:39,764
- I think you're the one who's anxious.
- We didn't do shit, Pablo!

451
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:47,039
With that tone of yours...
you're telling me you didn't do shit?

452
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,106
Like I was some kind of idiot.
Is this my cash or not?!

453
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,248
No, Pablo.

454
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:58,253
Did you take it and bury it
in Rionegro or not?!

455
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,286
For sure,
these guys hid your cash, boss.

456
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,254
- It's the truth, you pair of liars.
- Of course, he--

457
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,590
- Shut up, motherfucker!
- You're petty thieves!

458
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,564
You shut up, motherfucker!
Don't you disrespect me!

459
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,231
Pablo, look at me, man.

460
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,336
We're family.

461
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:25,244
You're my daughter's godfather.

462
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,614
And also godfather to Galeands kids.

463
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,347
What's going on?

464
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,328
We're like brothers.

465
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,926
We're partners and friends.

466
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:47,103
We've been in this
our whole lives, Pablo.

467
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,765
We made our first trip to Miami together.

468
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:56,711
We made so much cash together that
we don't even know what we spent it on.

469
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,804
What's the problem?

470
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,948
What's happening?

471
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,551
The two of us love you very much.

472
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,853
And we're very grateful.

473
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,240
All right.

474
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,683
Being stuck in here...

475
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,848
can make someone paranoid.

476
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,932
- Paisa! Paisa!

477
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,742
Well, man,
these things happen, right?

478
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,282
We're here for whatever you need.
Trust us.

479
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,284
I'm going to make a trip to Miami.

480
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:16,382
I'll bring you a few little things
to keep you entertained, OK?

481
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,426
Don Pablo.

482
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,459
Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!

483
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,489
You're a dog.
you son of a bitch!

484
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,160
What does it feel like
to take a shit on your own empire?

485
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,935
You want us to tell you
that we stole the money?

486
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:44,178
At the end of the day, you'll believe
whatever you want, motherfucker.

487
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,516
Goodbye, Kiko.

488
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,328
Kill me if you're such a man,
motherfucker.

489
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,666
Kill me with your own fucking hands!

490
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,069
Who are you talking to, asshole?

491
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,735
Motherfucker!

492
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,394
Wait a second!

493
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,499
Be careful, man.

494
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,570
Look what the dead guy gave me.

495
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,388
What the fuck!
You're going to burn all the meat!

496
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,090
What is wrong with you'? Can't you see
I'm doing it to cover the smell?

497
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:12,396
- Yeah, but let's not burn it all.
- What are we gonna do with all this meat?

498
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:15,370
- What are you going to do?
- What am I supposed to do?

499
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,201
What?

500
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,247
Boss, are you OK?

501
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,813
Do you need anything, boss?

502
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,786
We're grilling some meat.
Do you want some?

503
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,431
No. I'm not hungry.

504
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,361
Navegante.

505
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,854
Boss.

506
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:20,258
- Do you want me to wax it?
- No, relax.

507
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,100
This one's my favorite.
I enjoy it.

508
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,637
This is a beautiful car.

509
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,172
Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?

510
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:35,707
Looks like the rumors are true, boss.

511
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,119
It's a shame.

512
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,659
I warned them.

513
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,721
As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.

514
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,640
Do you still have that DEA contact'?

515
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,304
Javier Peña? Of course.

516
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,348
I want you to contact him
and confirm the rumors.

517
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:10,075
They're just as interested
in screwing Escobar as we are.

518
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,989
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.

519
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,888
I've called everyone.
I'm so worried.

520
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:22,328
Pablo told me
that they left La Catedral.

521
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,388
Just relax, sweetie.

522
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:26,997
Your husband is fine.

523
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,400
No. No, thank you.

524
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:37,510
Maybe... they had to go
somewhere else urgently?

525
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:39,443
Or maybe they left
without saying anything.

526
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,616
The way our men usually do.

527
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:44,243
Yes, but it's a little strange,
don't you think?

528
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:48,688
Kiko was very clear that he had
a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.

529
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,350
He said he would be home later.

530
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:55,019
We're trying to have another baby.
I think I told you that.

531
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,793
No? We're trying to have another baby,
and the time is right,

532
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,235
so we had a very important date to keep.

533
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:07,436
Are you sure that Pablo
told you that Kiko left La Catedral?

534
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,643
Are you telling me
that my husband is a liar?

535
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,213
I want my husband back.

536
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:24,321
If Pablo told Tata that they left...

537
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,721
it's because they left.

538
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,829
Listen...
Pablo is your kids' godfather.

539
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,301
He would never hurt them.

540
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,982
Let's talk about Don Pablo Escobar.

541
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,479
There are rumors that
he killed Galeano and Moncada.

542
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,283
Where, in jail?

543
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,689
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:47:03,788 --> 00:47:05,665
"In jail."

545
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,760
That doesn't make any sense.
They're partners.

546
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,869
Maybe there is not such thing as sense
with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

547
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:18,503
Bullshit. Where'd you get it?

548
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:23,849
The relatives of the men he killed...
are up in arms.

549
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:28,319
The poor fellows went in,
but they never got out.

550
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,785
I want to ask you gentlemen
a serious question now.

551
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,564
How bad do you want Escobar?

552
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,501
How far are you willing to go
in this matter?

553
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,733
What are you proposing?

554
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:51,004
Well, we both have access to information
that could benefit the other.

555
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,840
No.

556
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,082
No, we don't trade information.

557
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,083
- Just hold on a second.
- No.

558
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,245
He's an informant, Javi.

559
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,324
Whatever you got cookin', it stinks.
I don't want it.

560
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,486
Appreciate the tip. Let's go.

561
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,830
Your partner here...

562
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,737
may need some convincing now.

563
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:27,043
Moncada and Galeano going
into La Catedral, last stamped 9:20.

564
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:32,113
Every return from this day forward...

565
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:36,918
no Moncada, no Galeano.

566
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:48,267
<i>Personally, we couldn't have cared
less about a couple of dead narcos.</i>

567
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:51,906
<i>It meant more chaos and confusion
in the Medeilín cartel.</i>

568
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,609
<i>But we wanted Escobar out of that
piece of shit excuse for a jail,</i>

569
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,647
<i>in a real prison, not a fortress...</i>

570
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:02,149
<i>where his enemies could get payback.</i>

571
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:04,943
You sure?

572
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,922
We can either play politics
or we can do the job.

573
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,387
Well, we were never any good
at playing politics anyway.

574
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,790
What do you think?

575
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:25,472
These photos are worth looking into.

576
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,303
And believe me, I'm going to.

577
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:38,314
If it's true, this is
gonna cause a shit storm, you know?

578
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,263
- Be right back.
<i>- Gracias</i>.

579
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,864
Well...

580
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:54,868
Fuck President Gaviria.

581
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,799
Fuck Noonan.

582
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,031
Fuck La Catedral.

583
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,945
And fuck Pablo.
