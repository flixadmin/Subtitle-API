1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,166
No, no. There is no damn way
I'm going in there.

2
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,708
Go get the tank.

3
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,958
This is a fucking rattrap.
We won't get out.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,791
You come out the way you go in. Simple.

5
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,833
What the fuck is that smell?

6
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:29,208
They must have put pesticides,
bleach and shit that's toxic.

7
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,708
I'm not going in there.

8
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,958
- It's just water.
- Yeah, toxic water.

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,333
Go sit down.

10
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll sit, but I'm not going in.

11
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,666
Fine.

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,333
It would be easier to train in a pool,
but we're not gonna be in a pool.

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,166
It's gonna be way scarier
than getting in here.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,583
And you can't go in scared.

15
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,000
That's good because I'm not scared.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,708
You're fucked, kid.

17
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,125
Thanks.

18
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,250
You're scared because you're a father.

19
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,500
Look.

20
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,583
I think you actually have a point, Bogotá.

21
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,583
Before you had your son,
you'd have jumped in an open grave.

22
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,958
Now you've got something to lose.

23
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,458
Before, if something happened,
it was just me that was fucked. You know?

24
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:15,625
Now, there's things I don't want to do.
Like get in a fucking sewage tank.

25
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,708
I don't want to.

26
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,416
Do you how to be a good father?

27
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,250
No, I don't.

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,875
Behave like you did before
you were a father.

29
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:29,708
Sure, go to the clubs
and crawl home fucked up on a Wednesday.

30
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,958
If you like getting fucked up
on Wednesdays, then keep doing it.

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,041
I don't know.

32
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,458
You gotta stay consistent
or you'll end up hating your son.

33
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:41,666
That's what makes a bad father.
Believe me.

34
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,875
Jesus Christ. Do you know
what you should do, Bogotá?

35
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,166
You should write a book.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,166
- Sure.
- Yeah.

39

Seven.

40
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,708
- You serious?
- This it look like I'm lying?

41
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,916
Emilio, my oldest, lives in Venezuela.
Julián, he's in Mexico City.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,875
He almost has a mustache now.
He calls me "<i>güey</i>."

43
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,291
Erik's a tough bastard, he's in Iceland.

Hanna, in Finland. Violinist.

00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,375
She's gorgeous.

46
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,333
Drazen in Montenegro. He's dumb as fuck.

47
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,250
Yaris, in Greece, she's a character.

48
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,083
Ivanna, she's got a temper,

49
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,291
but she's an artist.

Seven.

52
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,291
So I guess you weren't lying.

53
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,125
But I still feel ashamed just to know you.

54
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,875
Look, I take care of all of them.

55
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,500
But I'm still me.

56
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,541
I don't go see the school play,
or his games,

57
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,416
or whatever they do in… in Iceland.

58
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,166
I don't.

59
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,458
I show up after six months or a year
and I don't ask for anything.

60
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,916
Not a hug or their love.

61
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,416
But they throw their arms around my neck.

62
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,333
Why?

63
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,500
- Huh?
- I don't know. Why?

64
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,666
'Cause I'm their fucking father.

65
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:01,958
Their father.

66
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,000
You can't give up DNA.

67
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:07,875
Never.

68
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,333
If you are a thief, keep being one.

69
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,500
And if you risked your life,
then keep risking it.

70
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,458
Sweeties, honeys, darlings…

71
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,208
Look what I brought you.

72
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:37,041
Look at these little earrings
that I found. Look at them, huh?

73
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,875
All shiny and golden! Can I pull this off?
Check this out.

74
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,166
What? You wanna hold them?

75
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,208
- Come on!
- Here, take them, kid.

76
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,416
It's like you've never seen gold before.
Come on, get to work.

77
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,000
There's a lot more where that came from.

78

That little ass could warm up my balls.

Why don't you go warm your balls

It's not funny.

Why would you talk to me like that? Huh?

Colonel, let's think.
Why don't we start by doing a sweep?

- They can't hack everything.
- They can hack whatever they want.

128
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,333
They have one billion euros.
Do you know what ITU's budget is?

Sixteen million.
And the whole CNI? 282 million!

130

282 million against a billion.
They've even tapped the janitor.

We only have evidence that they tapped
communications at the--

Not even a typewriter.

There are no secure networks,
not the army's or the ministry's.

infected by Christ knows what.

159
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,416
{\an8}The last thing the ITU are gonna do
is read your texts.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,375
{\an8}Give me the fucking phone!

161
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,541
{\an8}Goddamn it!

162
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,041
{\an8}Put the countdown until the security lock
at the bank is open on that screen.

163
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,375
{\an8}Let's go!

164
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,375

174
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,958
There we go. That's it.

175
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,041
That's it.

176
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,750
{\an8}All done.

177
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,333
{\an8}- Saline.
- Thank you.

178
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,208
{\an8}Stay still.

179
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,250
{\an8}That's it. There we go.

180
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,750
{\an8}Okay. You're okay.

181
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,166
{\an8}Okay, that's it.

182
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,291
<i>Palermo.</i>

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,125
<i>Palermo, it's urgent.</i>

184
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,750
{\an8}Professor. It's Tokyo.

185
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,500
{\an8}How is Palermo?

186
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,875
{\an8}Operational, señor.

187
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,583
{\an8}<i>They found out</i>
<i>we had them bugged.</i>

188
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,416
{\an8}We had to speed everything up.
But keep calm.

189
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,125
{\an8}Keep calm?

190
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,208
{\an8}Calm is what you can be
in your van, sweetheart.

191
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:54,291
In here, we're surrounded by the army.
We don't know when they'll enter.

192
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,791
And we don't know where.

193
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,291
Has Bogotá already started?

194
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,625
Yeah, he's slaving away down there.

195
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,833
Cutting that door will take more
than an hour. Maybe more than two.

196
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,333
Professor, how much time do we have?

197
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,500
- Fourteen minutes.
- What?

198
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,958
They really fucked us and they know it.
Let's go for another move.

199
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,416
I even have doubts about Prieto.

200
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,833
That fucker Tamayo
is gonna ignore rules and protocols.

201
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,458
What does that mean?

202
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,833
It means they're gonna enter as soon
as they unblock the doors.

203
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,041
Fine.

204
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,375
I guess the only alternative
is to use the dolphin. Isn't that right?

205
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,250
Exactly. You have it?

206
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

207
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,166
Flipper is in here with us.

208
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,625
Colonel, radio waves
are coming in and out of the bank.

209
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,166
Shortwave signals.

210
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,833
Put them on the speaker,
I wanna hear them.

211
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,541
What the fuck is this?

212
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,041
It looks like an encrypted radio system.

213
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,708
Once inside, the big question is,

214
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,500
how do we communicate with each other?

215
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,666
Palermo.

216
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,500
Boom!

217
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,750
A bomb exploded.

218
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,375
We're all dead.

219
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,833
Laser sensors.
Technology is fantastic, huh?

220
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,625
Internet, hidden IP clones.

221
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,916
With the money we have,
we could buy a satellite in Kazakhstan.

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,708
But it all leads us to the same place.

223
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,625
The exact same shit.

224
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,500
Because technology
is fought with technology.

225
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,833
And the state can win that battle. Now…

226
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,875
There's something
that they can't compete with,

227
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,416
a trip back in time, hmm?

228
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,083
1941.

229
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,416
Made in England.

230
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,000
With gadgets like this,

231
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,708
the BBC broadcasted
from Great Britain to the whole world.

232
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,791
Shortwave, ladies and gentlemen.

233
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,208
No technology can stop this frequency.
We'll talk with this.

234
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,416
With that thing, anyone can listen to us.

235
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,166
Yes, Nairobi, that's true. Any asshole
with a walkie-talkie can listen.

236
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,875
However,

237
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,000
actually understanding us

238
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,083
is a different story.

239
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,666
Cyber encryption, huh?

240
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,750
Used for the broadcast and reception.

241
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,875
It's not simple.

242
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,916
It's going to be encoded in 2,300 layers.

243
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,833
Even 200 million Chinese hackers

244
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,833
wouldn't be able to decipher it.

245
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,375
Synchronicity.

246
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,583
The monks. "The Spirit of the Creator."

247
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,500
<i>Mentes tuorum visita.</i>

248
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,708
<i>Imple superna gratia.</i>

249
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,208
They will be there,

250
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,583
peeling back layer after layer,

251
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,458
cursing our mothers.

252
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,500
Their tech team

253
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,041
will be desperate.

254
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,958
They'll waste tons
of government funds for nothing.

255
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,625
Because for every call we make,

256
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,333
we will encode 2,300 more layers.

257
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,541
Call,

258
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,208
encrypt.

259
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,625
Call,

260
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,333
encrypt.

261
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,291
If it is an encryption system,
what do we do? Decipher it.

262
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,208
Have entire technological research unit
come if necessary.

263
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,083
And start working on it, now!

264
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,166
Okay then.

265
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:39,500
I want everyone to get their vests
and masks on in two minutes.

266
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,666
We're also giving you weapons.

267
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,916
Fake ones. Don't get too excited.

268
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,958
Amanda, right?

269
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,250
- I'm--
- Miguel.

270
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,208
You knew?

271
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,833
Well, I knew
because I heard you say to the robber.

272
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,916
I put away your lunch once.
Do you remember that?

273
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,333
You know?

274
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,583
Not really.

275
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,000
Put on your vest now!

276
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,500
You're going to need it.

277
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,708
Don't put it on.

278
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,666
Huh?

279
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,625
Don't put it on.

280
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,500
- No.
- Do not put it on. Don't put your vest on!

281
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,375
They wanna use us as human shields.

282
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,166
It's true. Don't put it on.

283
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,708
We found him.

284
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,041
The head of the class.

285
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,833
The honor student.

286
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,708
- It's not like that.
- It's not?

287
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,041
What's your name, Einstein?

288
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,625
- Miguel, Miguel.
- Miguel, Miguel.

289
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,250
Miguel, I'm Mr. Denver.

290
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, Mr. Denver. Miguel.

291
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,708
Good. You like movies?

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,250
No, sir. I watch TV.

293
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,500
I want you to get suited up
because we're gonna play a little game.

294
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,458
Put on your vest!

295
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:45,875
Give me that.

296
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,166
It's backwards, Miguel. Other way.

297
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,166
Good.

298
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,083
You're gonna put this on, too.

299
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,333
If you don't, this will hurt.

300
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,583
Faster!

301
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,416
Good.

302
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,291
I'm gonna take seven steps

303
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,791
and then I'm gonna shoot. Okay?

304
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,500
If you guess the movie
before I turn around,

305
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,791
maybe I won't shoot you.

306
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,291
Sir, please.

307
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,666
Miguel is a robot.

308
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,208
One.

309
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,333
Two.

310
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,458
Three. Nothing Miguel? Come on.
I'll give you another clue.

311
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,875
I am also a robot.

312
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,041
Four.

313
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,583
<i>WALL-E.</i> <i>WALL-E.</i>

314
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,166
I come from the future
with no clothes on, Miguel.

315
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,708
<i>- WALL-E.</i>
- No, no, no.

316
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,916
<i>WALL-E.</i>

317
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
<i>WALL-E?</i>

318
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,625
You calling me <i>WALL-E,</i> Miguel?

319
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,000
No. No, Mr. Denver.

320
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,333
<i>Terminator.</i>

321
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,166
I'm the <i>Terminator.</i>

322
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,041
Hasta la vista, baby.

323
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,958
The show's over! Come on!
Let's go! I want two lines.

324
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,708
Get along.

325
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,291
Let's go.

326
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,916
- Come on.
- Come on, masks on.

327
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,458
Put them on, I'm not kidding.

328
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,291
Who the fuck forgot
to turn off their phone?

329
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,666
Forgive me, it's mine.

330
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,833
{\an8}HIDDEN NUMBER

331
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,500
Yes?

332
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:40,416
<i>Colonel Prieto, it's</i>
<i>Professor.</i> <i>I hope you're feeling better.</i>

333
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,666
Hello, Professor.

334
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,125
<i>Sorry I disrupted</i>
<i>your dental appointment.</i>

335
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,000
<i>I hope that I'm not causing you</i>
<i>too much trouble.</i>

336
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,750
You are never any bother, Professor.

337
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,083
<i>Help me out.</i>
<i>I'm a little confused.</i>

338
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,666
Are you in charge of this operation?

339
00:16:58,958 --> 00:16:59,958
Or is it Tamayo?

340
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,375
Colonel Tamayo speaking.

341
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,625
<i>- From this moment, I'm in charge.</i>
<i>- </i>Nice to meet you, Colonel Tamayo.

342
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,500
NEGOTIATION

343
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,500
If that happens, we will call them.
Never the reverse.

344
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,916
And we'll call on the telephone but
they will not be able to track our calls.

345
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,458
And why?

346
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,125
Here, we're also going
to travel back in time.

347
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,416
I had that phone for five years
and only charged it once.

348
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,958
Second-generation cell phones.

349
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,500
Without Internet and,
most importantly, without GPS.

350
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,083
With each of these phones,
we will make one call.

351
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,625
Only one, no more,
to an outside operative.

352
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,708
Marseille.

353
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,833
So the mute isn't going in?

354
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,708
- I'm not mute.
- Sure. Does your rat do the talking?

355
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:53,333
Something like…

356
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,791
She's not a rat.

357
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,416
Her name is Sofía.

358
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,750
Marseille
will have two terminals.

359
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,625
The first will receive my call

360
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,541
and the second

361
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,875
will dial the only number
saved in its contacts.

362
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,541
Our friend Colonel Prieto.

363
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,916
Those two phones will be our firewall.

364
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:15,916
Archaic.

365
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:18,791
<i>Rudimentary.</i>

366
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,375
But effective.

367
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,041
The police can locate
the phone that's calling

368
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,958
at the exact moment of the call.

369
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,500
But that's it, nothing else.

370
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,333
<i>There is no technology</i>

371
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,666
<i>that can track two cell phones</i>
<i>stuck in a box</i>

372
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,083
and constantly moving.

373
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,625
Besides, without GPS,

374
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,333
<i>without Internet…</i>

375
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,666
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>they will have is the repeater</i>

376
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,750
<i>the phone connects to</i>
<i>when making the call.</i>

377
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,166
A repeater located

378
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,791
<i>in the center of Madrid.</i>

379
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,666
<i>Right in front of their noses.</i>

380
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,500
<i>And that's the only thing they'll have.</i>

381
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,291
Which is…

382
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:05,958
nothing.

383
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,416
<i>Pardon me, since we don't know each other,</i>
<i>I wanted to ask you something.</i>

384
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,208
Are you in love?

385
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,916
I've been married for more than 17 years,
something that is no longer in style.

386
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,291
<i>That is an irrefutable</i>
<i>proof of love, Professor.</i>

387
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,666
Yes, I understand.

388
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,083
However, forgive me, but…
I don't believe you're actually in love.

389
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,416
When someone is in love,
they look through rose-colored glasses.

390
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,208
Everything is wonderful,
they transform into a soft teddy bear

391
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,333
that's smiling all the time.

392
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:39,000
And they do not shout and lose
their tempers and harass their coworkers.

393
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,208
That's why I was asking.

394
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,750
I know you've been listening to us,
you piece of shit.

395
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,291
Colonel,

396
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,916
do you remember
the last time you made love?

397
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Professor… You and your titillating
conversations, you can go fuck yourselves.

398
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,083
Colonel, since you've only just arrived,
let me remind you

399
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,625
{\an8}of the first lines of the NIC's manual
on hostage negotiation.

400
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,500
They say verbatim,

401
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:06,000
"Listen actively and understand
the psychology of the abductor."

402
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,958
"Show, you feel empathy towards him

403
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,625
and you understand his feelings."

404
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,125
You know what?

405
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,666
I think you've gone blind and deaf.

406
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,791
<i>That's why Prieto's phone rang a second</i>
<i>before he left.</i>

407
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,916
I'm beginning to think
you are fucked, Professor.

408
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,125
<i>This isn't the same as that tropical beach</i>

409
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,458
you must have been on
after the Mint, is it?

410
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,166
By the way, how did that getaway go?
How is Murillo?

411
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,291
Hello, Colonel Tamayo.

412
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,458
<i>Colonel Prieto.</i>

413
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,333
Ángel.

414
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,416
<i>I imagine you're there listening.</i>

415
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,333
Okay, were you able to track…
Just don't lose them.

416
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,750
Hello, Raquel. How are you?

417
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,250
<i>We've missed you here in the command tent.</i>

418
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,583
Thank you.

419
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,541
And I'm sorry for leaving like that,
without a word.

420
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,916
<i>How are you?</i>

421
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,583
Well, you know me. I…

422
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,708
I can put up with a lot.

423
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,000
And Mari Carmen is she okay?

424
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,625
Mari Carmen…

425
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:20,833
She left me.

426
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,041
A long time coming, don't you think?

427
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,083
I'm very sorry, Ángel.

428
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,875
Colonel, they're on
the Princesa Street repeater.

429
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,750
Look at those mother fuckers!
They're right next to us.

430
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,375
Raquel, can you tell me
what the fuck is going on?

431
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,958
<i>Are you sure this is what you really want?</i>

432
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:39,875
Listen…

433
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,250
This is my life now.

434
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,916
And do you know what?

435
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,083
It's a thousand times better than before.

436
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,083
Why, do you think
you're in a movie or something?

437
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,916
Listen to me, Raquel.

438
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,500
<i>Movies are fantasy, this is real life.</i>

439
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,791
You know I'm gonna
have to chase you, right?

440
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,916
Well, that's nothing new.

441
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,791
You've always chased me.

442
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,750
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Colonel, are you still there?

443
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,541
<i>Listen, I'll call you in an hour</i>

444
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:16,083
and I anticipate that, by then,
I'll have released five hostages.

445
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,250
We're going to do things right this time.

446
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,541
In an hour, I'll be smoking a cigar
in your honor in the governor's office.

447
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,250
Colonel, I'm recording this conversation.

448
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,041
It sounds like you don't care
about the hostages lives.

449
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,625
Well, since it's recording,
I'm going to give you a quick warning.

450
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,250
Take your little mask,
your Browning machine gun

451
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,500
and get ready.

452
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,666
Because the sky is about to fall.

453
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,000
What did we get on this phone call?

454
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,750
The call must be coming from an old phone.

455
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,708
It was impossible
to access their location,

456
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,916
but the conversation was picked up
on repeaters on Princesa and Callao.

457
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,750
- What does that mean?
- There's a lot of people on phones.

458
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,458
The signal jumps from one repeater
to another or they're moving.

459
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,500
You telling me that while we were talking

460
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,583
they were taking a walk,
holding hands, having ice cream?

461
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:12,458
I want all available units deployed
to identify every motherfucker out there.

462
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,583
Colonel, we're talking about more
than 400,000 people.

463
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,083
People are probably out there
spending the bills they dumped.

464
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:23,083
The lack of noise in the metallic voice
indicates they weren't on the street.

465
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,958
Maybe they're in a basement
or in a subway tunnel.

466
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,416
It's impossible to know.

467
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,500
Four hours.

468
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,833
Look at her, so innocent,
like she couldn't even hurt a fly.

469
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,625
- I want a child like him.
- Mm.

470
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,083
And those guys?

471
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,416
- What are they doing?
- How would I know?

472
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,333
They're trying to break a record.

473
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:38,166
I'm telling you, that guy
must do some freaky boyfriend shit.

474
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,125
Ooh.

475
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,041
What's wrong?

476
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,208
Nothing.

477
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,916
You have doubts, right? That's it?

478
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,458
You thinking about turning back?

479
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,208
In order to make it perfect…

480
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,125
the plan.

481
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:08,125
It'd take… It'd take at least four months.

482
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,250
- Four months?
- Four months.

483
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,625
And what will you say to Tokyo?

484
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,000
That the next time she sees Rio,
he'll be a vegetable?

485
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,833
We cannot help Rio

486
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,500
with a plan that doesn't work.

487
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:20,458
It doesn't work?

488
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,708
We've studied it together.
It's a perfect plan.

489
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:24,166
No, it isn't. No, it isn't.

490
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,833
You know what your problem is?

491
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,916
You're turning into an egomaniac.

492
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,291
You don't believe in the plan
because it's not yours.

493
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,541
It's your brother's,
but your brother believed in you.

494
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:38,958
Why are you suddenly so interested
in doing a robbery?

495
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,916
This deep need to be there.

496
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,333
I'm telling you, it's exactly the same
as the people who quit smoking.

497
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:48,750
They start to hate tobacco
and people who smoke…

498
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,583
and they become
the biggest anti-smoking Taliban.

499
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:53,458
That's like you with the police.

500
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:56,791
You hate the police
because they destroyed your life,

501
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,375
because they tried
to take away your daughter,

502
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:03,375
because there's a warrant out for you
and what you want this revenge.

503
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,583
You want revenge.

504
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:09,208
You're not thinking about Tokyo, or Rio
or Berlin. You're thinking about yourself.

505
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,500
And if that's the case,

506
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:13,583
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to be part of the plan.

507
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,750
I need more time.

508
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,708
Relax, I'll take care of this.

509
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:40,750
Hello.

510
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:41,750
This way, please.

511
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,791
Of course.

512
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,625
At your service, Inspector.

513
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,416
We know you know them well.

514
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,125
Uh-huh.

515
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:21,250
In the absence of Fonollosa, AKA Berlin,
who do you think has assumed command?

516
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,208
For what?

517
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:27,958
What do you mean?

518
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,041
What the hell do you care what it's for?

519
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:37,250
If we kill the boss first,

520
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,750
we might not have to kill them all.

521
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,208
Got it?

522
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,208
Denver.

523
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,000
No doubt. He's the most seasoned.
Moscow's son.

524
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,083
- Denver. I'm telling you.
- Are you sure?

525
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:59,291
Absolutely. I know them well.
Look, look, Helsinki is a war criminal.

526
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,833
He only obeys orders.

527
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,416
And Nairobi.

528
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,458
Nairobi staged a coup at the Royal Mint
and took power from Fonollosa.

529
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,083
- Professor would never put her in charge.
- And Tokyo?

530
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:12,625
Tokyo… Too unstable.
She's a hothead.

531
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,208
It was her fault that Moscow died. No.

532
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,833
Tokyo couldn't command shit.

533
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,666
Listen to me. It's Denver.

534
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:23,708
Denver.

535
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,541
What was that about?

536
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,958
To get you to talk to me.

537
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,041
And look, it worked.

538
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,708
You're not doing well, Denver.

539
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:53,625
Yeah.

540
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,333
Yeah, I know. But it's not…

541
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:59,750
It's not even about all that shit you said
about me being a sexist.

542
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:00,833
It's something else.

543
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,333
Hey.

544
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:14,791
What's wrong with you?

545
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,083
Come on, tell me.

546
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,791
- I know how this will end.
- No.

547
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:28,000
- There are a lot of ways it can end.
- My father was shot.

548
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,625
You know why?

549
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:35,416
Because somebody wanted to ride
on a motorcycle. Right, Tokyo?

550
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:39,875
He was a good man.

551
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,750
And he started acting like a father
in front of 200 policemen

552
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,416
with an M16 and no vest.

553
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,250
And now he's dead.

554
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,166
You understand what I'm saying?

555
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:52,750
If you're here,

556
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,166
the exact same thing
is gonna happen to me.

557
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,000
If I had to stand in front of
a bullet for you, I would…

558
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,750
in a heartbeat.

559
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,166
Because you are my family, Mónica.

560
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:06,958
You are my family.

561
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,041
That's why I didn't want you here.

562
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,791
Do you understand that?

563
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,416
Move.

564
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:20,208
Keep going. Come on. Step, step. Move.

565
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,500
Okay, I'll deal with the Browning.

566
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,916
Very good idea, Helsinki. Much luck.

567
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,291
Let's go. In you go.

568
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:43,791
You, too.

569
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,791
You have no idea what you're doing.

570
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,500
As soon as I touch the door,

571
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,166
the security system
will flood it in just minutes.

572
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,041
It's gonna flood? No.

573
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,541
It'll bring in more than
100,000 liters of water.

574
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:13,458
More than 100,000 liters of water?
Nairobi, listen to this guy.

575
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,541
Well, I hope you learned how to snorkel.

576
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,583
You're mistaken if you think I'm bluffing.

577
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,833
I know where you're taking me.

578
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,583
And for what?

579
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,708
I'm telling you now,

580
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,166
I don't plan on doing it.

581
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:33,791
Come on.

582
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:37,833
Put it on right now.

583
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:41,666
Please.

584
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:23,500
Madam,

585
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,333
step out of the line.

586
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:28,375
No, I can do it, I can do it.
I have strong hands. I'm okay.

587
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,125
Madam.

588
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,041
Step out of the line, please.

589
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,791
And the rest of you, keep working!

590
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,666
Thank you very much.

591
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,583
Tokyo.

592
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,791
The other heist, I was glued to the TV.

593
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:48,583
I know all of you.

594
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:50,291
Hmm?

595
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:54,708
Sit down.

596
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,541
Get the helicopters in the air.

597
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:08,875
Now.

598
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,250
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

599
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,458
Hurry up with those bags.
We gotta keep them moving.

600
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,625
If things go wrong,

601
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,458
then we end up
in the worst-case scenario possible,

602
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:32,875
which is the police is entering
before we've had time

603
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,583
to open that little door.

604
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:38,250
And opening that door… It'll take
a lot longer than the first one.

605
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,375
And he's the only one who can do it.

606
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,166
Two hours minimum.

607
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,125
Two hours.

608
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,666
And if we haven't opened it
before they come in, then…

609
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,041
Then we're dead.

610
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,416
But I'm sure we have a solution.

611
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,833
There's always a solution.

612
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,083
We have this tiny guy. Huh?

613
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:00,208
A dolphin.

614
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,750
Yeah, well, we ran out of toy divers.

615
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,583
We named him Flipper.

616
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:06,833
You remember Flipper, right?

617
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:09,583
The trained dolphin that gave high fives

618
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,583
and also saved lives.

619
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,250
In case we need it,
it would have to save ours.

620
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,708
The governor of the Bank of Spain
is the only person able to open that door

621
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:18,916
in three seconds.

622
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,125
This button will regulate the buoyancy.

623
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:29,375
I'll do it. Don't touch it
or you will end up stuck on the ceiling.

624
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:30,833
Hey!

625
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,125
Are you listening to me?

626
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:36,625
We have an emergency respirator.
Hopefully, you won't need to use it.

627
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,458
Hey, look at me.

628
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:40,791
Look at me!

629
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,958
Once in there,
you'll notice the change in pressure.

630
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:49,291
Don't panic and most important,
don't stop breathing.

631
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,291
But we've got a problem.

632
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,958
He won't do it.

633
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,791
His entire biography
shows he has principles.

634
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:00,666
Everybody has principles.

635
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,791
The question the governor
has to ask himself is "What's worth more?"

636
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,291
"My principles

637
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,458
or my life?"

638
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,583
We're running out of time.

639
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,875
Come on. Come on, let's fucking go.

640
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,583
Okay Governor, any questions?

641
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,083
I'm not going in.

642
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:20,833
I think you are.

643
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:22,541
- Into the tiny submarine.
- Let's go.

644
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:25,500
<i>Teams in position.</i>
<i>Locked and loaded, sir.</i>

645
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,916
Gentlemen,

646
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,875
two minutes and thirty seconds.

647
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,500
All right.
"Hasta la vista baby" with Stockholm.

648
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,791
The others with me. Now!

649
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,833
Come on. You heard her. Quickly.

650
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,083
- Move it!
- Move it!

651
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,833
All right, come on.

652
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:44,583
All the way to the back.

653
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,541
Let's go, come on.

654
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:54,333
If I have to put the mask on you,
it's gonna be fused to your face.

655
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:58,083
Put it on, Governor. Put it on.

656
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,250
Huh?

657
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,041
- The hard way, then.
- Let go of me!

658
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,833
I'm not going in there.

659
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,791
He's 60 years old
and has coronary heart disease.

660
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:11,833
Brilliant.

661
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,000
That works for us.

662
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,458
That's exactly right, coronary disease,

663
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,500
the bathyscaphe, the water pressure…

664
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:21,000
All of that collides in his head
and gives him extreme lucidity.

665
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,583
The whole plan depends
on the decision of one man.

666
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,708
And I can already say
with absolute certainty it'll be a "no."

667
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:30,625
And do you know when it will become
definitively clear for him?

668
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:35,250
Hmm? When he enters that flooded chamber

669
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,291
and understands that he has no escape.

670
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:41,666
When he realizes that his life depends on
whether we open

671
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,875
or we shut off the oxygen valve.

672
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:48,500
So Sergio, if you had to pick between
your integrity and oxygen,

673
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,791
what would you choose?

674
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,875
He won't go in.

675
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,250
He will go in.

676
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:59,375
With a little push.

677
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,541
He'll go in.

678
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:03,125
You're gonna regret that.
Matías, the bolt cutters.

679
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,375
Let's cut 'em off.

680
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:11,583
Either you give me the fucking key now
or you'll be counting bills

681
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,750
with your fucking stumps.

682
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,458
You're fucking kidding.

683
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,666
You're a brave man.

684
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,875
- Oh, fuck!
- Denver!

685
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,750
Denver, what the fuck did you do?

686
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,583
For Christ's sake!
Somebody tell me what's happening!

687
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,291
Take this.

688
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,541
Are you okay, Governor?

689
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,750
Governor? Mr. Governor?

690
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,041
Oh, shit! Motherfucker!

691
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,750
What's happening, Nairobi?

692
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,916
- He lost consciousness.
- Goddamn it!

693
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,333
Pulse is 130.
This guy's gonna have a heart attack.

694
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,666
- How much time do we have?
- One minute and 20 seconds.

695
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,583
That much?

696
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,833
Matías, the first-aid kit and the staples.
We have to close the wound.

697
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:53,875
- Come on!
- Denver!

698
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:55,375
Direct pressure on the wound!

699
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:56,333
Yeah, yeah.

700
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,333
Over here, Denver!

701
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,583
Fuck!

702
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,458
Okay, and what happens if,
for whatever reason,

703
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,125
he decides not to open that door?

704
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,875
There's always risks.

705
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,583
Little brother, please.

706
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,958
What would life be
without a tiny bit of risk?

707
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:17,208
Little brother,
that's what makes it exciting.

708
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,041
And, if something goes wrong,

709
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,625
we always have the C-4.

710
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:23,875
Bogotá.

711
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,250
Be careful, brother. Okay?

712
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,000
Come on, come on, come on. Ah…

713
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,875
That's it, come on.
Don't be a pussy, goddamn it. Go, go, go.

714
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,916
Come on, come on, come on.

715
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
150 beats per minute.
This guy's about to explode.

716
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,208
- <i>C-4 inside there?</i>
- <i>Cyclonite, also called RDX.</i>

717
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,125
- Popularly known as plastic explosives.
- You are crazy.

718
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,666
Well, it's unpredictable.

719
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,791
It would be crude, but so exciting.

720
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,416
It'll shake the whole world.

721
00:38:56,208 --> 00:39:00,083
Gentlemen, we're going in.
We know the primary objective.

722
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,083
We have the green light to open fire
against any member of the gang.

723
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:12,750
At least 100 hostages have been confirmed,
among which is the governor of the bank.

724
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:16,416
Streets have been closed and the whole
country is watching the Bank of Spain.

725
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,583
Reports are now coming
in that the governor…

726
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,333
{\an8}<i>…and assault vehicles are moving in.</i>

727
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:25,625
{\an8}<i>For the last few minutes,</i>
<i>helicopters have been circling the area.</i>

728
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,500
<i>Stay tuned for…</i>

729
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,833
Ten milligrams of Diazepam.

730
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:40,083
You goddamn
motherfucking son of a bitch.

731
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,000
No, no, no.

732
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,541
Come on, kid.

733
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:44,041
Okay.

734
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:47,125
<i>An expanding underwater wave,</i>
<i>50 meters deep,</i>

735
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,333
releasing a pressure of 40 atmospheres,

736
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:52,416
not even our Lord knows
what's gonna happen then.

737
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:57,125
Denver, remind me to beat
the shit out of you when this is all over.

738
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,791
You stupid son of a bitch.

739
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,166
A little big bang that'll create life.

740
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,583
No, it isn't going down.
Give me another one.

741
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,500
- Another!
- Come on, come on!

742
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,083
Okay, okay, okay. Come on.

743
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:41,625
It's true it might damage part
of what's inside the box,

744
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,041
but I assure you right now,
we're going to open it.

745
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,041
Oh, God!
