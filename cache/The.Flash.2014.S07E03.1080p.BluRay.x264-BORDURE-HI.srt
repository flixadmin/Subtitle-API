[softly] Frost. Frost...

00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:49,008
Barry.

00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,390
Barry.

8
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:59,644
Help her. Help her.

[whimpering]

10
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,063
Iris.

11
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,147
Iris.

12
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:13,575
Help her.

13
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:55,992
Is she gonna be okay?

14
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,871
When you pulled Iris out of
the Mirrorverse and she resisted,

15
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,789
it created a molecular anomaly.

16
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,167
All her neural pathways
are disjointed.

17
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,294
Looks like her brain's been remapped.

18
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:07,754
How do we get her back?

19
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,382
I don't know.

20
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:15,219
All we can do now is let her rest
while I run some more tests.

21
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:21,643
You gonna be okay?

22
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,105
I remember everything...

23
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,150
Hurting my own team,

24
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:33,029
forcing Iris through the portal,
leaving Kamilla and Singh trapped.

25
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,199
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:38,534
That wasn't you.

27
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:41,120
- Yeah it was.
- Man, no, it wasn't.

28
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,539
You were not yourself.

29
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,291
Trust me, we get that.

30
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,378
That's why we're going
to put it behind us.

31
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,713
We're going to move on, all right?

32
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:51,839
We're a team.

33
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,383
We've got each other's backs.

34
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:57,470
We're gonna figure out a way
to save Iris and Kamilla and Singh.

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,721
I promise.

36
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,807
Eva's still out there,
and I can't stop her

37
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,558
because I don't have
my speed anymore.

38
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:05,228
But you will.
I am running a full diagnostics

39
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,854
on the Artificial
Speed Force Machine.

40
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,439
It worked before. It can work again.

41
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,125
All we need to do is figure out.
I think...

42
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,110
No, I'm done with that thing.

43
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,611
You saw what it turned me into.

44
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,239
I'm not Thawne.

45
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,783
Connecting with something
artificial isn't gonna work for me.

46
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:23,204
And since the real Speed Force
is dead...

- [officer 1] C.C.P.D.

48
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,046
Wait. Your wife tried to attack you?

49
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,816
Why would your neighbor
try to make you look in the mirrors?

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,299
Hold on. C.C.P.D.

51
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,093
If he's not your uncle, who is he?

52
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,302
Let me get this straight.

53
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:41,180
You want to help bring
your daughter in,

54
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,016
Mrs. Dearbon,
so that I can arrest her?

55
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,852
Sue's in trouble.

56
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,770
We want to help her
see things more clearly.

57
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,523
People change, sometimes overnight.

58
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:54,736
Captain, can I speak with you?

59
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:56,946
It's relevant.

60
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,490
Excuse me.

61
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,544
Uh... Damn!

62
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,131
Sue, I thought you and Ralph
were laying low

63
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,549
until we can clear your name.

64
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,050
Yeah, Ralph's tracking a lead.

65
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,635
Arrest me if you have to.

66
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:20,719
I had to come.

67
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,972
You mind telling me
what's so important

68
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,390
that you would risk your freedom?

69
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:28,102
Those people in there,
those are not my parents.

70
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:29,479
I know it sounds crazy.

71
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,731
And when Ralph mentioned pod people
a while back,

72
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,734
I thought it was nuts, too.
But I'm telling you, that's not them.

73
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:35,735
No.

74
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:39,280
I believe you. I have gotten over
a hundred calls in the last hour.

75
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,866
Exact same complaint.

76
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,786
All saying that people
they've known for years

77
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,162
just aren't themselves anymore.

78
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,625
Do you think this has anything to do
with the craziness at McCulloch?

79
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,502
Damn.

80
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:53,961
I know what's happening.

81
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,255
Move.

82
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,554
What the hell.

85
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:19,195
After all that, at least Grandma Runk
is still my grandma, you know,

86
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,906
'cause I was at Jitters
ordering a Viva! ccino!

87
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,533
Next thing I know,
a pair of "T2" arms

88
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,618

trying to grab me.

89
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,412
Fortunately, Chester P. Runk
knows how to mind his surroundings.

90
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,496
[Cisco] Yo!

91
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,124
I just heard back from Joe.

92
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,088
Whatever is happening out there,
it's spreading.

93
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,479
Yeah, Eva's getting more powerful.

94
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:38,047
I'll say. I analyzed footage
from Eva's live interview.

95
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,424
It's not just mirrors
that she's manipulating.

96
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,386
It's any reflective surface now.

97
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:45,197
[Chester] Well, I guess
that makes sense.

98
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,698
Light photons
are elementary particles

99
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,266
that exist everywhere in nature.

100
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,434
So as long as there's light around

101
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:54,146
from either a natural
or artificial source...

102
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,148
Call Joe back,
we got to blackout the city.

103
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,312
He can get the mayor
to declare a state of emergency.

104
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,402
Okay, I am on it.

105
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,737
Why is Eva doing this?

106
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:03,757
I mean why does she want us
in the Mirrorverse?

107
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,221
[Barry] She wants us out of the way.

108
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,701
These aren't just abductions.

109
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,327
[sirens wailing in distance]

110
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,745
It's a full-blown invasion.

111
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:14,417
And with every person
that gets replaced, Eva's army grows.

112
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,085
Oh, man.

113
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:17,712
Body snatchers.

114
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:21,382
So, what are we gonna do?

115
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,561
Boss, you have to get better.

116
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,856
<i>The Citizen</i> doesn't work
without you.

117
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:41,903
So just please come back, okay?

118
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:46,574
Because we're not giving up on you,
especially Barry.

119
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:55,374
What you two have is amazing.
No matter how strong

120
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,794
you both are on your own,
you're even stronger together.

121
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,673
Don't let Eva McCulloch end
what you guys have.

122
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,511
The mayor is doing her best
shutting down the power.

123
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,138
Joe said it won't be 100 percent,

124
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,307
but I told him we'd take
whatever we can get.

125
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:16,604
In the meantime, initiating shutters
on all windows in S.T.A.R. Labs.

126
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,859
We should cover all the mirrors, too,
and kill the lights.

127
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:22,859
Yes, I'm on it.

128
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,446
Hopefully everybody in Central City
does the same thing.

129
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,951
If I had my speed, I could patrol,
help people keep safe.

130
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:35,873
There's got to be a way to save
them all, to get Iris back.

[Eva] <i>There is...</i>

[Eva] You're powerless, Flash,
but I can help you.

137
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,289
If you let me.

138
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
You want to help?

139
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,627
Tell me how to save my wife.

140
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,171
She needs to go back
where she belongs.

141
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,674
All of you do.

142
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,427
Back to the Mirrorverse.

143
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,262
You see, in the last six years,

144
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:36,726
I've watched people like Joseph
destroy the gift around you.

145
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,896
The glorious world
filled with wonder.

146
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,276
You and everyone else on this planet
have failed.

147
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,447
So now I'm filling it
with my children.

148
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,786
And you will treat it,
and everyone in it, with respect.

149
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,081
- And what happens to us?
- You adapt to your new world.

150
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:00,999
Same as I did.

151
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,211
Don't worry, Barry.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

152
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,421
I'm not your enemy.

153
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:13,054
What I am is a mother
to a newer, better world.

154
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,305
You want me to give in.

155
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,306
Just like Ramsey.

156
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,225
Ramsey thought he was a hero.

157
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,352
He wasn't.

158
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,730
You are.

159
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,442
Lead your people to the Mirrorverse.

160
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,693
They'll follow you.

161
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,862
- They'll be happy.
- Were you?

162
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,822
Stop fighting me!

163
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,365
You've been watching me, Eva.

164
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,453
You know I'd risk my life
to save this city.

165
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,706
Those are brave words, Flash.

166
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,919
But are you really willing to do
whatever it takes

167
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,089
to ensure the survival of humanity?

168
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,886
The applications of my reflective
chip technology are endless.

169
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,389
I can grow crops tenfolds
in abundance.

170
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,643
I can end starvation overnight.

171
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:03,020
Why haven't you?

172
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:09,485
Why haven't you done the work
that really matters?

173
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:15,324
Why haven't you made
this world a better place?

174
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,912
Because you can't.

175
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,501
I can. And I will.

176
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,129
I'm not human.

177
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,715
I'm something better.

178
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:36,846
That is why I am showing you mercy.

179
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:41,725
So please consider my offer

180
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,398
and make the right choice.

181
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,196
Satellites have him at McCulloch.

182
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,198
Barry, I am not losing you, too.

183
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,701
Frost is ready to come out.

184
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,040
Oh, thank Tupac.

185
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,584
How did you escape?

186
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,794
I didn't. Eva let me go.

187
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,630
- Why? What did she want?
- To tell us that we can't win.

188
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,507
Well, I hope you told her
where to go.

189
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,844
No, she's right. We can't.

190
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,399
[melancholic music playing]

191
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,835
Nash.

192
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,003
No.

193
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,714
My name is Harrison.

194
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,259
Dr. Harrison Wells.

195
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,312
Look, I don't know who you are,
but I saw Nash die.

196
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,397
All the other Wells died with him.

197
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,481
[Harrison] Exactly.

198
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:16,154
When Nash Wells gave his life
to power the artificial Speed Force,

199
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:21,242
he transferred all the multi-versal
particles of all the other Wells

200
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,536
into the Fusion Sphere,
except for 0.01 percent.

201
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,707
- And that's me.
- How do particles become a person?

202
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,294
I have a theory that when Nash
and all the other Wells

203
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,796
were removed from the timeline,

204
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,217
the universe required a...
balancing act.

205
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,221
One Wells to make up
for all of those lost.

206
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,431
Isn't that cosmic?

207
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,601
Crisis.

208
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,728
There was an event.

209
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:53,065
It took people from other planets
and brought them here together.

210
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,192
To the same planet in one timeline.

211
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:59,530
A temporal coalescence.
That could explain this.

212
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:10,291
Of all the Wells, you were
the one I wanted to meet the most.

213
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,336
- I'm...
- Barry Allen.

214
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,380
I know.

215
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:21,593
The other Wells may be gone
but they left an imprint. Memories.

216
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,347
And so let me just say
whatever is wrong,

217
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,562
let me help you
because they would want me to.

218
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:37,067
You can't. This enemy
that we're facing is all powerful.

219
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,988
Plus, my speed is gone.

220
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,489
Aren't you the Paragon of Love?

221
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,785
Look, anyone can save the world
with their speed, with their might,

222
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:52,791
but it takes a real hero,
a once-in-a-lifetime hero,

223
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,586
to do it with his heart.

224
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,339
What is that supposed to mean?

225
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:04,511
It means run, Barry, run toward love.

226
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:21,819
Nash?

227
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,154
No.

228
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,496
Allegra, Nash thought...

229
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,457
very highly of you.

230
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,591
A new Wells?

231
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,180
How's that possible?

232
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,892
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
you're here to save us, right?

233
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,728
Also, which one is he?

234
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,688
I'm the original.

235
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,488
[sirens wailing in distance]

236
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,198
Okay.

237
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,159
I had Allegra put out a <i>Citizen</i>
e-blast to warn the city about Eva.

238
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,328
- Good work.
- Thanks. [sighs]

239
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,749
What is it?

240
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,084
That window was blacked out.

241
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,545
Where is everyone?

242
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:27,761
I'm feeling
an overwhelming sense of passion.

243
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,179
Confidence.

244
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
Focus.

245
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,057
Joe, I... [gasps]

246
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,397
You may as well give up, Captain.

247
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,151
- Joe?
- Captain West requesting backup.

248
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,735
No one's coming, Captain.

249
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:44,903
Cecile, run!

250
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,204
- The windows...
- Um... Uh...

251
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,999
- [line beeps]
- My phone's not working.

252
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,584
She must've jammed the signal.

253
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,504
Unfortunate.

254
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:06,467
Wells, Wells, Wells, Wells, Wells,
Wells, Wells, Wells, Wells and Wells.

255
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,093
That's how I got here. Any questions?

256
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,013
- Uh, I don't get how...
- What!

257
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,389
[Sue] Help! Guys...

258
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,515
we need help.

259
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:15,933
Sue?

260
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:17,477
Ralph?

261
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,314
- [Dibny groaning]
- [Cisco] Holy Plasmus!

262
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,025
Dibs, where's your face?
It looks like mashed potatoes.

263
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,443
[Sue] Don't! Don't touch him.

264
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,904
His body temp
is a toasty 500 degrees.

265
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,865
Wait, you mean something actually
melted Elongated Man?

266
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,700
Holy sweet Hawking...

267
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,203
Ralph texted me to meet him
at McCulloch Labs.

268
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,580
He was looking for evidence
to clear your name, wasn't he?

269
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,209
Yeah. He figured security would
be down because of the blackout.

270
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,294
He was inside
when Eva blew the whole place up.

271
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,879
I got caught in the blast radius.

272
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,089
He walked out holding this.

273
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,676
Can you fix him?

274
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,346
Right, I'll get him in the mobile
Biogenic Containment Unit.

275
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,324
Okay, we're going this way.
Right this way, Ralph.

276
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,228
Come with me, Sue.
I'll take a look at your arm.

277
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,562
It's lookin' a little toasty.

278
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,605
Okay...

279
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,443
Anything?

280
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,320
I mean, not really...

281
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,113
- [device beeping]
- Wait...

282
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,574
[chuckles] Yeah, Ralph found
evidence to clear Sue's name.

283
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,161
Once a hero, always a hero.

284
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,495
Amen.

285
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,086
I know you're still
in there somewhere.

286
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,755
I'll never stop fighting
to reach you.

287
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,720
I may be the Paragon of Love, but...

288
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,808
that's only because you're my heart.

289
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,272
Please!

290
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:46,483
Come back to me.

291
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,587
[Cisco] I don't get it.

292
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,256
How are you supposed
to get your speed back exactly?

293
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,381
Iris...

294
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:11,674
Iris is the key.

295
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,303
Yeah. Still not following.

296
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,469
[Barry] The Speed Force...

297
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,180
We all thought it was dead, right?

298
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,851
I just felt a spark, with Iris.
Just now.

299
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,769
Barry, your speed is gone.

300
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:26,231
Yeah, but the Speed Force
is an elemental part of the universe.

301
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,317
So, theoretically...

302
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,446
Theoretically, it could've
never disappeared.

303
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,448
And you think it's still in Iris.

304
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,450
I always wondered why I was chosen

305
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,119
as the Paragon of Love
and how it related to my speed.

306
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,413
I think it's because
of my connection with Iris.

307
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,206
Our love is... [chuckles]

308
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,293
It's just as strong as the lightning
bolt that hit me seven years ago.

309
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,670
Plus, Iris did have speed once.

310
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,674
And Nora was a speedster whose
lightning was purple and yellow.

311
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,426
That is so romantic.

312
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:58,388
If Speed Force energy is still
in Iris, how do we get it out of her?

313
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,015
Well...

314
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:03,560
We repurpose the ASF
to tap into an organic source

315
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:04,746
instead of an artificial one.

316
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,896
I can help with that.

317
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,416
- I'm gonna need...
- [Harrison] I got it.

318
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,608
If this works,

319
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,611
we can all take the fight
to Eva together.

320
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,036
[sirens wailing in distance]

321
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,371
[people shouting]

322
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,754
Bring them a new life, my children.

323
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,426

00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,845
A true monarch knows that.

489
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,183
- [sirens wailing]
- [people shouting]

490
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,046
It's not working.

491
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,309
They've grown too strong
for me to control.

492
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,374
[glass shatters]

493
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,177
[sighs]

494
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:44,857
We did it.

495
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,490
What about the people we lost?

496
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,012
Chief Singh?

497
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,223
Sir, what happened?

498
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,767
- Are we...
- Dead?

499
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,187
No, officer. We're very much alive.

500
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,650
I'm pretty sure we owe our lives
to a certain speedster.

501
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,194
And his better half.

502
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,032
[Cecile] Joe.

503
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:48,838
[phone vibrating]

504
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:51,507
Is it really you?

505
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,677
No, it's Chewbacca.

506
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,388
It's Kamilla. The real one.

507
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:58,764
If she's back, then...

508
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,850
That means the rest
of Central City is, too.

509
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:02,852
Where are you?

510
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,645
I'm back at <i>The Citizen.</i>

511
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:06,981
I was in that other place.

512
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,774
I never thought I'd get out.

513
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,192
Don't go anywhere.

514
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,653
Imma kiss you like there's
no tomorrow.

515
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:15,823
I love you, Kamilla.

516
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,451
I love you, too.

517
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,456
Need a ride? I'm ice bridging.

518
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,790
Safest way to travel.

519
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,751
Knowing you,
I find that hard to believe.

520
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,088
So, what will you do now?

521
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,765
Go back to the Mirrorverse...

522
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,934
Do what I should've done
a long time ago.

523
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,187
Start over.

524
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,529
This time, my children
will be born of love,

525
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,239
not hate.

526
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,992
Free to choose their own path.

527
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,751
Good luck.

528
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,230
[Caitlin] Any sign of Eva?

529
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,695
Nope. Looks like Mirror Monarch
was serious about starting over.

530
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,572
Iris, what you did out there...

531
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,534
What if you're a meta now?

532
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:45,538
I'm pretty sure Eva took my mirror
powers back with her when she left.

533
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,974
Maybe when she went back to
the Mirrorverse it severed the link.

534
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,250
Without it, no powers.

535
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,461
Well, the pod people are gone,
and we got everyone else back.

536
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,380
Singh, Dearbons, Kamilla.

537
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:57,425
It's a good day's work,
people. [chuckles]

538
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,468
Oh wait, where's O.G. Wells?

539
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:00,928
With Cisco and Allegra.

540
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,513
They wanted to say
their own goodbyes.

541
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:03,806
[Chester] Ah.

542
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,060
Are you sure you have to go?

543
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,479
I heard Team Flash
always has a Wells.

544
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,231
Well, that's overrated.

545
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,316
Plus, Flash has his speed back,

546
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,235
Mirror Monarch is back
where she belongs.

547
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,030
- It's time.
- But, I need someone to train me.

548
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,490
Allegra, you have your own...

549
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,161
wavelength to follow,
and as it turns out,

550
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,454
somehow I have mine.

551
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,581
The universe gave me my life back,

552
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,667
somehow, and now I can see

553
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:36,213
all 92 years of that life.
Past, present and future...

554
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:37,757
simultaneously.

555
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:39,967
And somehow, can travel

556
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,219
to any moment I want.

557
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,888
Timeless Wells...

558
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:45,973
That's a new one.

559
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,642
It's amazing and utterly useless,

560
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,686
unless I can share it
with the woman that I love.

561
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,938
My wife, Tess...

562
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:57,568
We had four brilliant years together,
before she...

563
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,573
before we both were killed.

564
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,868
And so, I now have a choice between

565
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,954
moving forward
from this point without her...

566
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,708
or going back to her.

567
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:19,173
I'm going to relive those four years
we had together

568
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:24,136
over, and over, and over again,
until I'm out of time.

569
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,681
Good luck.

570
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,601
Allegra...

571
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:33,604
good luck to you.

572
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,319
[Cisco] I get that...

573
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,947
Wanting to be with
the person you love.

574
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,072
Hm.

575
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:47,243
If Kamilla and I are lucky enough to
share half of what you and Tess have.

576
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,369
You will.

577
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,709
- This is weird.
- No, we just met.

578
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,545
Right, it's like
I barely even know you.

579
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:58,671
Barely know each other.

580
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,757
I mean, you're nothing like him.

581
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:02,967
Like who? Oh.

582
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,553
The Harrison Wells you used to know.

583
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:08,138
Or, the man I thought
was Harrison Wells.

584
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:10,808
Of course, he turned out to be a...

585
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,518
- A jerk.
- Jerk!

586
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:15,688
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

587
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:16,771
[both chuckle]

588
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:21,151
How do you miss someone
you barely even know?

589
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,752
Before you go,

590
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:42,673
how exactly do you travel in time?

591
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:45,593
Easy.

592
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,136
Just...

593
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:50,514
like this.

594
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,110
[chuckles]

595
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:04,862
Just like that.

596
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:09,759
[Sue] <i>Well, we spoke to Captain West.</i>

597
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,035
<i>Actually, I did.</i>

598
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:12,679
Ralph's voice
would've freaked him out.

599
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:14,556
[Dibny in altered voice]
What's not to love about my silky tones?

600
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,498
Dude, you sound like a Dalek.

601
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,702
[Barry] Yeah, I feel like
the helmet's more Daft Punk.

602
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,462
What? You know I love to lose myself

603
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:22,981
- to dance every once in a while.
- Baby, do not do that.

604
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,006
- You love it.
- Do not.

605
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,969
Don't worry, Ralph. A few more days
in the B.C.U., you'll be good as new.

606
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:30,137
[Dibny] Either way, it's good
to have you back, Caity. Frost, too.

607
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,555
So, now that my parents are okay

608
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,849
and C.C.P.D. has evidence
to clear me,

609
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,059
thanks to Ralph...

610
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,019
We should celebrate.

611
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,813
Sue, did you ever think
about joining Team Flash?

612
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:41,649
We could use somebody
with your skills.

613
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,944
Me, teaming up with Dr. Perfect

614
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:45,985
and a squeaky-clean do-gooder

615
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,780
like Fleet-Feet here? [laughs]

616
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:48,989
Not my style.

617
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:51,992
Besides, Ralph and I have
some unfinished business.

618
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:54,429
Black Hole is dead, but there's
an organization just like them

619
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:55,996
in every country in the world,

620
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:58,040
preying on good people
like my parents.

621
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,517
[Dibny] And we're going to
pay them a visit...

622
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,626
And clean house.

623
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:03,754
Ralph, we've been through a lot
since you joined this team.

624
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,798
[Dibny] Save it, Barr.
This ain't goodbye.

625
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,359
I'll be back
when you least expect it.

626
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,177
And then Frost,
we'll go on that road trip, okay?

627
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,553
She says, "Hell, yeah!"

628
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,430
Well, if you ever need help,
just call.

629
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:14,514
I'll come running.

630
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:15,724
Thanks.

631
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,184
You do the same.

632
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:20,854
- Come on, Slick.
- Stay flashing. Dibny out.

633
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:22,648
They make quite the team.

634
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,154
So do we.

635
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,461
[electrical crackling]

636
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,425
[yells]
