<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,235
Did Walker
destroy Haven?

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,550
<i>This part of the op
is need-to-know.</i>

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,434
I come bearing gifts.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,558
Reunification with the mainland

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,313
<i>hangs on by a thread.</i>

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,076
<i>Toxic chemicals rain down onto
the city, and the government</i>

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,640
cuts us adrift for good.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,776
<i>The filtration system</i>

<i>that Lucius designed
is working.</i>

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,336
<i>It's not glamorous work,</i>

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,159
but we are helping to save the
lives of thousands of people.

13

<i>You're leaving Gotham.</i>

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,176
<i>I believe the time has come</i>

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,112
<i>for a change of scenery.</i>

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,114
You found a way out of Gotham?

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
It's a submarine.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,835
<i>Jim Gordon and
Lee Thompkins are man and wife.</i>

<i>He will never see you

20

Walker.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,152
Professor Strange'll have you
fixed up in no time.

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,274
<i>Rest easy, Eduardo.</i>

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,156
I made you a promise
when I found you

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,834
in that hole in Peña Dura.

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,151
<i>And I intend to keep it.</i>

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,270
To give you a true purpose

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,079
and the strength
to see it through.

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,593
However, I'm afraid
this process

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,920
will be agonizing
and, unfortunately,

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,279
quite lengthy.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,630
Apologies in advance.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,396
You're going to be reborn.

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,639
And then you'll be
the bane of the unjust.

37
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,474
The bane of the corrupt.

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,758
The bane of anyone
who opposes us.

39
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,915
Radio confirmation.

40
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,152
<i>General Wade's
landing craft docked.</i>

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,192
His convoy's
on the way here now.

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,312
Reunification day is today.

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,474
Harv, that is great news,
but then what?

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,480
Just 'cause we rebuild
some bridges

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,757
doesn't mean things are
gonna suddenly improve.

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,199
So, uh, future got you spooked?

47
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,039
Yeah, I guess.

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,056
I mean, I want to believe
things are gonna get better,

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,280
but sometimes it's just hard
for me to see it, you know.

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,120
Can't say I understand.

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,351
I don't have kids, at
least none that I know of.

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,634
<i>But you got
one coming,</i>

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,517
so we got no choice
but to believe.

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,681
It's got to be better than
what we've been through, right?

55
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,233
It damn well better be.

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,710
Seven days in a row of
.07 water toxicity levels.

57
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,200
Lucius' filters
did the job.

58
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,834
Eh, good work.
Hope it's not wasted.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,760
Is there a reason to
think there's a problem?

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
Jim's got a lot on his mind.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,720
What with Gotham
rejoining the world

62
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,599
and a baby coming
into the world next week.

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,796
Give it a rest,
Harvey.

64
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,394
All joking aside.

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,711
We're here because of you.
Mm-hmm.

66
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,315
And you're gonna be a father.
That's a future I'll take.

67
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,113
Over the past year,

68
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,919
you've all done good work.

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,396
We've made Gotham a safe place
for kids and families.

70
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,475
We've given people the food
and medicine they needed.

71
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,674
But it's not over yet.

72
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,953
So, no matter what
General Wade says today,

73
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,033
the work continues.

74
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,111
Give yourselves
one more round of applause.

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,713
And get back to work.

76
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,830
Here they come.

77
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Captain Gordon.

78
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,278
Nice to finally
meet you in the flesh.

79
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,592
General,
welcome to Gotham.

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,792
Good that you've reestablished
some semblance

81
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,474
of law and order around here.

82
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,200
Seems like
the Green Zone

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,477
stretches to every corner
of the island.

84
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,879
General, Wayne Labs
show toxicity levels

85
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,000
way below the threshold
the government set for us.

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,520
All due respect,
Mr. Wayne,

87
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,080
but I got to go with what
my people tell me on this.

88
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,396
Cutting it a little
close, aren't we?

89
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,029
Is that under 27 pounds,

90
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,079
<i>13 ounces?</i>

91
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,151
It can't possibly
make that big a difference.

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,256
It's only the difference
between getting off this island

93
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,873
or sinking to the bottom
of the river.

94
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,760
Well, then Pengy can off-load
a few of his knickknacks.

95
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,195
Not a chance.

96
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,394
Because you know what's worth
its weight in gold?

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,678
- Gold.
- Ah!

98
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,674
Congratulations!

99
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,354
Go to the clinic.
Go have your baby.

100
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,040
What? So the two of you
can hightail it

101
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,197
off this rock without me?
I don't think so.

102
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,398
I assure you we will not
launch without you.

103
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,199
Ed and I will finish
making preparations

104
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,829
and we will be ready to launch
the moment you get back here

105
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,997
with that little bundle of joy.

106
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,559
Or unless I should
drive you to the clinic

107
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,234
in light of your
delicate condition?

108
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,869
I can do it.
I'm not that delicate.

109
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,716
Remember that
if you even think

110
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,474
about double-crossing me.

111
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,256
It's very kind of you
to offer to drive her.

112
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,112
I knew she would
never accept my help.

113
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,456
Should I start the engine?

114
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,834
One less passenger
to worry about.

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,320
Oh, two, actually.

116
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,319
You are so right.

117
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Found it.

118
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,080
Ah, well done, Miss Kyle.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,195
All right, let's have a look.

120
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,873
Uh, here we are.

121
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,117
Oh, so this guy's the architect
who designed Wayne Manor?

122
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,475
Yes, right.

123
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,277
With the reunification,
a new Wayne Manor must follow.

124
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,632
And it'll be just
like the old one?

125
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,476
Oh, nothing is
just like it was.

126
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,878
So why are we looking
at the old plans?

127
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,434
Perhaps I'm not ready
to let go of the past.

128
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,640
Well, if it makes
you feel better,

129
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,155
I wish I could
blow up my past.

130
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,360
Well, maybe you will.

131
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,096
One day, when you
build something new,

132
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,555
the past will always
be part of it.

133
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,870
As for me,

134
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,833
now Master Bruce is grown,

135
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,349
building a new manor might be
my last great service to him.

136
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
A home.

137
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,195
And then what?

138
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,400
You retire?

139
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
No.

140
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,990
I will stand guard,
as I've always done.

141
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,034
I thought this was all settled.

142
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
This is bull.

143
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,834
My results are
accurate, Jim.

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,320
<i>We don't know this general.
Maybe he's with Walker.</i>

145
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,512
Let's not get carried away.
Bruce, go and check on the tech.

146
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,276
This is Gordon.

147
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,036
<i>It's Lee.</i>

148
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Everything okay?

149
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,915
Barbara just showed up here,

150
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
<i>in labor.</i>

151
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,870
You're kidding.

152
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,040
<i>You better come quick.</i>

153
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,875
Are you okay?

154
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,598
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,998
<i>I'll try to get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

156
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
<i>Try to.</i>

157
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,592
Um... try to wait for me.

158
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,477
It doesn't really work that way.

159
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
I know.

160
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Okay.

161
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,276
<i>Wait.</i>

162
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I love you.

163
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,789
I love you, too.

164
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Jim!

165
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

166
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
We did it.

167
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,120
You did it. We got
through it, Jim.

168
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
<i>Captain.</i>

169
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
All clear.

170
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,676
Congratulations.

171
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,879
Reunification can begin.

172
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,239
Well, I'm glad
I can make you so happy.

173
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,920
Funny thing is, sir,

174
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
that's just the second best
news I've gotten today.

175
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
What's that?

176
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,634
- Jim.
- Incoming.

177
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,680
Everybody get back!

178
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,275
Get inside! Get inside!

179
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Go, go.

180
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,756
Eduardo?

181
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,389
Not anymore.

182
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,712
All right, people, listen up.

183
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,160
I want squads
headed for Knights Stadium,

184
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,636
Yeavley Park,
and Granton Station.

185
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,310
Work your way out.
We got to find him, people.

186
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,639
Bloody hell happened?

187
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,869
Seems that Jim's
old army buddy

188
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,679
wasn't quite as dead
as we'd hoped.

189
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,873
I got squads
covering the north side.

190
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,240
<i>They're sweeping from Coventry</i>

191
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,216
down to Miller Harbor,
but they could be anywhere.

192
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,336
Well, give us an
area to search

193
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,714
- and we'll get it covered.
- Uh...

194
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,279
<i>Take Reatton,</i>

195
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,600
work your way
to South City Park.

196
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,070
Looks like you're not done
protecting Bruce yet, Alfred.

197
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Eduardo.

198
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,754
What did Walker do to you?

199
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,159
When I was
in Peña Dura prison, Jim,

200
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,233
<i>the guards played a game.</i>

201
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,273
They'd choose one of us...

202
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,874
and they buried us alive.

203
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,036
They'd take bets on whether
you could dig your way out.

204
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,079
But then they'd bury you deeper.

205
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,753
And play again.

206
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,994
I was the champion.

207
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,990
To survive that...

208
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,992
I had to stop being human.

209
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,310
I had to become...
something else.

210
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,516
I became Bane.

211
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,039
<i>Only I didn't know it yet.</i>

212
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,911
But she knew
and she showed me the way.

213
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,191
If the world is full
of monsters,

214
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,352
the only way to defeat them...

215
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,712
is to become one yourself.

216
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,069
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,633
You were a good soldier.

218
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Hmm.

219
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,274
Don't pity me, Jim.

220
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,672
We are building the future.

221
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,477
She's given me
a purity of mission.

222
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,559
And unlike the army,

223
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,035
she is willing
to carry things out.

224
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,997
A new world is coming.

225
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,040
Strong...

226
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,549
merciless...

227
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,350
unyielding.

228
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,353
I've heard it all before.

229
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
Not gonna happen.

230
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,720
And how are you going
to stop me, Jim?

231
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
<i>Not me.</i>

232
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,080
You kidnapped Bruce Wayne and
a general of the U.S. Army.

233
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,472
You talk about your future,
Eduardo, but you don't have one.

234
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,160
But Eduardo's dead, Jim.

235
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,919
There is only Bane now.

236
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Rise.

237
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,553
I said rise!

238
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,909
<i>Not so formal.</i>

239
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,159
Captain and I are acquainted.

240
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,154
Get the other one.

241
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,355
I recognize your voice,

242
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
but I don't know
what to call you.

243
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,679
<i>I know it's not Walker.</i>

244
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,234
So who are you?

245
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,831
That's a good question.

246
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,759
Perhaps Bruce Wayne can help us
figure that one out.

247
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
You okay?

248
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,320
Yeah.

249
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,595
You want hostages?

250
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,158
You've got me and a
general of the U.S. Army.

251
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,470
Let him go.

252
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,154
<i>This has nothing
to do with him.</i>

253
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,277
"This has nothing
to do with him"?

254
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,471
But, Captain, you don't
even know what "this" is.

255
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,072
This, everything
I have done here,

256
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,391
is about punishing Gotham.

257
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,199
For the sins
of Bruce Wayne.

258
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,759
You can start now.

259
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,000
No... no!

260
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,680
And again.

261
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
So...

262
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,240
Bruce Wayne.

263
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,357
I'm thinking of a name.

264
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,997
Can you guess whose it is?

265
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
What?

266
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,271
Wrong.
And again.

267
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,318
Want to take another guess?

268
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,879
Farewell, my beloved Gotham.

269
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,677
City of my birth.

270
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,992
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

271
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,472
Though I leave you today...

272
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,596
my heart will always remain.

273
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,874
I do so hate goodbyes.

274
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,919
Well, you're in luck.

275
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,456
- We're not going anywhere.
- What are you talking about?

276
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,836
Engine won't start; pressure
regulator valve's missing.

277
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
Or rather it's stolen.

278
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,311
Barbara!

279
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,435
Blood pressure's normal.

280
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,592
I'm glad something
about this is normal.

281
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,670
So how long's this gonna take,
Doc, soup to nuts?

282
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,880
Are you in a hurry
or something?

283
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,314
No, it's just that, uh...

284
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,994
I just feel like
you've been...

285
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,753
so great about this, and,

286
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,696
you know, it's been
awkward as hell for you,

287
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,792
and... I haven't even
really said thank you.

288
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,320
I don't expect a thank you
from you, Barbara.

289
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,936
Then perhaps the best
thank you would be for me

290
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,713
to get out of here
as soon as possible.

291
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,840
Whatever's on your mind...

292
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,192
the health of the baby
comes first.

293
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,789
I know that.

294
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,072
So, long haul or short,
we're here.

295
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,232
Until you have
a healthy baby in your arms.

296
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,635
That's all I want.

297
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,676
Okay.

298
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,155
Stop it!

299
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,711
A name, a person.

300
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,396
The reason
this is all happening.

301
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,477
Can't you guess yet?

302
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,632
I don't know!

303
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,070
If you want to punish
me, then do it.

304
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,595
Hurt me, not him.

305
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,960
I am hurting you.

306
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,874
There's nothing more painful

307
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,351
than seeing
your friends suffer.

308
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,199
But he's more
than just a friend,

309
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,953
isn't he, Bruce?

310
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,598
Jim Gordon's been
like a father to you.

311
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,356
Oh.

312
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,434
How awful it must be
to watch another father die.

313
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,236
Who am I doing this for?

314
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
Say the name.

315
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,516
When the ones you love die...

316
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,513
it's like a part of yourself
is cut off...

317
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,229
forever.

318
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,034
You know that.

319
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,037
So why do I hate you so much?

320
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,198
Who was cut away from me?

321
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,475
Last chance.

322
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,236
Yes.

323
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,120
Now you know.

324
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,279
Say his name.

325
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,310
Say it.

326
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,073
Ra's al Ghul.

327
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,396
This is revenge
for his death.

328
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,114
And who am I?

329
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,674
You're his daughter.

330
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,036
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

331
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,590
And revenge is just
the beginning of what I want.

332
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,910
<i>The League of Shadows
is everywhere.</i>

333
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,274
<i>Did you think my father's
mission would die with him?</i>

334
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,555
Humankind will be purged
of weakness.

335
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,274
I'm just starting
with you and yours.

336
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,235
You're right.

337
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,754
I killed Ra's.

338
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,552
So whatever you need to do...

339
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,949
do it to me.

340
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
No.

341
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,433
<i>You can't take all the blame
for killing my father.</i>

342
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,999
I mean, you did have
some help, right?

343
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,349
<i>Someone who quite literally
gave you a helping hand.</i>

344
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,673
What are you doing?

345
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,198
Well done, Barbara.

346
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,954
Go get Barbara Kean.

347
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Eduardo...

348
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,360
She's pregnant.

349
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,439
She's carrying a child.

350
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,914
A child.

351
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,071
One soul's future
weighed against the world's.

352
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,832
Your concern seems petty, Jim.

353
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,916
If he touches a hair
on that child's head,

354
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
I will destroy
everything you have.

355
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,034
I don't have anything left,
just my father's mission.

356
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,599
Bane wants you to join
that mission with us.

357
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,075
To see the world as he sees it.

358
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,560
- Never.
- Never say never,

359
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,279
<i>- Captain Gordon.</i>
- No!

360
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,033
<i>How does it feel, Bruce,</i>

361
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,950
knowing that all of this
is your fault?

362
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,998
Tell me.
I'd really like to know.

363
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,433
There must be something
you can give me.

364
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,432
We're out of the drugs
that you need.

365
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,959
It's okay. You're almost there.

366
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,536
I'll get you some ice chips
so you don't get dehydrated.

367
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,119
Gee, thanks.

368
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Lee.

369
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,230
Ed.

370
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,113
Don't worry,
I'm not here for you.

371
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,038
But for the record,
you stabbed me first.

372
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,359
If you two are quite done,

373
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,796
we are actually here
for Barbara.

374
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,351
Or more precisely,
what she stole from us.

375
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,776
I don't know what this is about,
and I don't care.

376
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,336
You two need to get
out of here right now.

377
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,794
Gladly.

378
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,189
<i>Just as soon
as Barbara</i>

379
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,040
gives us the...
What's it called?

380
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,714
- Pressure regulator valve.
- Right.

381
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
That.

382
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,510
I should have known that you
would try to screw us over.

383
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,151
You only noticed because you
tried to screw me over first.

384
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,119
Second, technically.

385
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,272
Okay, she's in the middle
of having a baby.

386
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,153
And we are in the
middle of trying

387
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,710
to leave Gotham,
and we can't do that

388
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,991
without a crucial part
of the submarine

389
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,357
which will ferry us
all away from here!

390
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,696
That's why you were
in such a rush

391
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,110
- to get out of here.
- As are we.

392
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,158
Hand over
the part... now.

393
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,193
Don't point that at the baby.

394
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,796
What? No, I did not!

395
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,556
I... I was merely trying
to make a general

396
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,080
threatening gesture
with a firearm.

397
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,776
But you did, though.
You pointed the gun at the baby.

398
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,714
All right, fine. I'm sorry!
Now give us what we want!

399
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,634
No! You think I'm stupid
enough to have the part on me?

400
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,797
It's hidden away,
somewhere safe.

401
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,078
And if you think you can torture
me into telling you where,

402
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,670
there is literally
nothing more painful

403
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,317
than what I am going
through right now!

404
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,199
<i>Hey, you stay out of here.</i>

405
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
This is a hospital.

406
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,679
Barbara Kean,

407
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,557
<i>your time is up.</i>

408
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,079
<i>There's no place
for you to hide.</i>

409
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,349
No one will save you.

410
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,034
No mercy that will spare you.

411
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,352
You simply cannot run
from your sins.

412
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,878
And you cannot run from me.

413
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,400
What do you want from me?

414
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,716
Let me let you in
on a little military secret.

415
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,637
It's called Special Order 386.

416
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,032
In the event that Gotham
is irretrievably lost,

417
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,916
a contingency plan
was put in place

418
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,079
to reduce the city to rubble.

419
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,719
No.

420
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,313
There are still
innocent people here.

421
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,314
You asked me what
I want from you.

422
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,717
I want you to suffer,
Bruce Wayne.

423
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,071
And then I want you to die.

424
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,158
Spend a little time
with that thought.

425
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,554
We'll be starting soon.

426
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,633
- Who are those guys?
- No idea.

427
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,117
Exactly how many people
have you screwed over?

428
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,039
Present company
excluded.

429
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,352
There are 79 people
in this building.

430
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
Well, fortunately, they seem
to only be trying to kill one.

431
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,111
So, by all means,
let's gather 'round the target.

432
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,316
All right.

433
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,160
Maybe we can cut through
the abandoned wing

434
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,080
and we can get
to the ambulance bay that way.

435
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,256
Might take some time, but...

436
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,896
Oh, if only there were
two able-bodied men

437
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
who could buy us some.

438
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,350
And why, pray tell, should we
risk our necks for you?

439
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Chivalry?

440
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,112
But if that's too much,
remember, if I die,

441
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,078
you will never find
that sub part.

442
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Fine.

443
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,200
We'll keep them busy.

444
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,840
We'll meet you at the docks.

445
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,116
Thank you.

446
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,873
- What?
- Keep them busy?

447
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,549
I only brought enough ammunition
for a light firefight,

448
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,229
not to repel
a paramilitary assault.

449
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,471
What should we use,
bedpans?

450
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,376
I was actually thinking
of something

451
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,074
a little more...
flammable.

452
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,878
Why, Captain Gordon,
how nice that you're awake.

453
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,150
You picked
the losing side, Strange.

454
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,472
The army's coming
to Gotham. Help me,

455
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,393
and you can do
what you do best:

456
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,030
survive.

457
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,760
I happen to think more

458
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,310
of Ms. al Ghul's chances
for success

459
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,960
than a man in your...

460
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
well...

461
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,235
position.

462
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,711
You really think
she can take on the entire army?

463
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,639
As a matter
of fact, I do.

464
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,479
With my help.

465
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,673
You are just
a few modifications away

466
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,560
from being a mighty soldier
in her forces.

467
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,833
Not unlike
your friend, Eduardo...

468
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,156
I will help you to realize
your full potential,

469
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,399
give you true strength.

470
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,319
I'll pass.

471
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,232
<i>Consent is hardly</i>

472
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,959
a prerequisite.

473
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,234
We will begin...

474
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,312
with, uh, physical improvements.

475
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Sorry.

476
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,957
And finish...

477
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,956
with certain mental adjustments.

478
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,936
Your contractions are
about a minute apart.

479
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,240
We've got to get you
out of here.

480
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,829
Nice shot!

481
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Keep breathing.

482
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,080
Some try to hide,
some try to cheat.

483
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,960
But time will let us always meet.

484
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,235
What am I?

485
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,439
- Pregnant lady with a gun?
- Death.

486
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,670
But close enough.

487
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,757
So, where to now?

488
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,554
Well, I believe...

489
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,999
we have a sub to catch.

490
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,079
How long have you had that?

491
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,016
Long enough to know she'd never
let it out of her sight.

492
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,318
And you stuck around long enough

493
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,918
to risk both of our lives
to save Barbara's?

494
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,669
Or was it to protect Lee?

495
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,960
Do you want me to answer that or
do you want sail away from here?

496
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,830
Bon voyage.

497
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,399
Oh, those bastards have
stolen the damn sub part!

498
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,596
You mean, stole it back.

499
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,558
Whose side are you on?

500
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,473
Clearly,
I'm on the baby's side, Barbara.

501
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,280
- Ooh!
- What was your plan, anyway?

502
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,720
You were going to be a fugitive
with Nygma and Penguin?

503
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,719
Well, I'm not exactly the stay-
at-home-and-bake-apple-pie type.

504
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,078
Yeah, running off on a submarine
seemed like a great alternative.

505
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,918
Barbara, you can live here.
You can have this baby here.

506
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,431
Jim is not taking
the baby away from you.

507
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,834
You really believe that?

508
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,276
You really think
Captain Jim Gordon

509
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,875
is gonna let a criminal
raise his kid?

510
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,673
People are already
shooting at my baby.

511
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,880
I have to protect him...

512
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
or her.

513
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,000
I have to be strong.

514
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,272
Right, being strong does not
mean you have to be a criminal.

515
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Jim will help you.

516
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,880
And so will I if you'll let me.

517
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,910
Well, that's just weird.

518
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
I know.

519
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,630
Hey, baby,
this is your Auntie Lee.

520
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,600
Mommy tried to kill her once,
maybe twice.

521
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,949
All right.

522
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,136
Okay, that's enough of that.

523
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,719
Come on. We got to keep moving.

524
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,000
I think this is happening now.

525
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,120
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

526
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,432
This is Bruce Wayne.
Can anyone read me?

527
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,075
This is Bruce Wayne.
Does anyone at the GCPD read me?

528
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,557
<i>This is Bruce Wayne.
Can anyone read me?</i>

529
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,075
Bruce, it's Alfred. Where
the devil are you? Over.

530
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,956
Some abandoned mansion
in North Side Park.

531
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
- On my way.
<i>- No.</i>

532
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,350
I'll get out myself.

533
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,840
I need you to get to the clinic.

534
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,919
The clinic?

535
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,593
<i>It's Ra's al Ghul's
daughter, Alfred.</i>

536
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,914
<i>She wants revenge.
She mutated Eduardo Dorrance</i>

537
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,275
<i>and sent him after Barbara.</i>

538
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,590
Oh, gosh.

539
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,316
I'm fine.

540
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,077
I need you to get
to Barbara and the baby.

541
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,998
Now, you're going to feel
a slight discomfort.

542
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,557
That's the stimulant I've given
you to prepare your muscles.

543
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,599
<i>You'll need it for
what comes next, which,</i>

544
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,719
I'm afraid, is going
to be excruciating.

545
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,798
Do you feel that?

546
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,270
Yes.

547
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,075
There's that fighting spirit

548
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,590
I've always admired so much.

549
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,910
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,</i>

550
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,033
there's an alarm I must sound.

551
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,256
- What the hell are you doing?
- Checking to make sure

552
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,476
Strange doesn't have one of
those chips in your head.

553
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,510
We need to hurry up,

554
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,360
get out of here
before he trips the alarm.

555
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Come on.

556
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,856
Alfred and GCPD are on their way

557
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,160
<i>- to the clinic.</i>
- Where's Nyssa?

558
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
<i>I don't know.</i>

559
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,440
But she's planning on using
the military to wipe out Gotham.

560
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,273
I can order them to stand down.

561
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,400
Then let's get you
out of here.

562
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,789
She's beautiful.

563
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,480
Congratulations.

564
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Hi, there.

565
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,512
Guess I'm-a have figure out
what to call you.

566
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Thank you.

567
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,317
- Come on.
- Get in the car now.

568
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
I'll hold him off.

569
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,320
<i>Alfred and I got this.</i>

570
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,760
<i>Selina, get in the car.</i>

571
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,958
<i>- Selina, get back in the car!</i>
- No.

572
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Go.

573
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,589
Oh, my, look at you.

574
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,360
You're a big'un, ain't you?

575
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,833
Bloody baby bully,
let's see what you got.

576
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,519
Dirty bastard.

577
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
No!

578
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Alfred.

579
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,435
Alfred.

580
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,751
Alfred. No.

581
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,040
Somebody help!

582
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,271
Somebody. Oh, no.

583
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,914
A-ten-hut!

584
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,790
<i>Welcome back, General.</i>

585
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,869
Get me a secure line
to the mainland now.

586
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,233
Jim! Hey.

587
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,516
Just got word from Lee.

588
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,431
She and Barbara made it
out of the clinic okay.

589
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,874
And your baby daughter, too.

590
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,155
- Congratulations.
- They're going to The Sirens.

591
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,514
You just had a baby girl, brother. Say something.

592
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,194
Just can't believe it.

593
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,439
We won, didn't we? It's over.

594
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,559
We did, and she's gonna have
a better world because of it.

595
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,956
She is. I promise.

596
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,639
Is Alfred with them?

597
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Didn't say.

598
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,199
This is General Wade.

599
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,116
I am authorizing
Special Order 386.

600
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,639
No!

601
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,871
Gotham City is lost.

602
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,838
Begin your bombing
run on my order.

603
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Arrest them.

604
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,994
You can't do this.

605
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
Take them away.

606
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,154
You can't do this!

607
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,349
Okay, nice and slow.

608
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,797
- Barbara Kean.
- Run!

609
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,956
It's nice to finally meet you.

610
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,590
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

611
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,510
I believe you knew my father.

612
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,616
I don't understand how the
general could have been chipped.

613
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,720
I didn't see a scar on the
back of his neck. Did you?

614
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,434
No. Strange must've hidden it.

615
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,274
Nyssa let us escape. She knew
we'd bring the general here

616
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,840
and do her dirty work for her.

617
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
What now, Jim?

618
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,632
Son, if you're gonna stick a gun
in my face,

619
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,679
you should at least know
you're doing it wrong.

620
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,474
Come on, let's go.
