1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,310
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:03,312 --> 00:00:06,330
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:07,798
<i>To the outside world,</i>

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,750
<i>I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

5
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:12,636
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs,</i>

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,090
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

7
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:18,058
<i>I hunted down the man who killed my mother,</i>

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,459
<i>but in doing so,</i>

9
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:21,628
<i>I opened up our world to new threats.</i>

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,965
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

11
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:27,067
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

12
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,154
<i>Previously on "The Flash" and "Arrow"...</i>

13
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:33,307
<i>The person who broke into my facility
last night was Harrison Wells.</i>

14
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:35,276
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon,

15
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:38,329
meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

16
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,830
I came here to help you, Barry.

17
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,149
He may not be Harrison
Wells from your Earth.

18
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:44,251
He has just as many
secrets as the one you knew.

19
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,171
I get these feelings
sometimes, these vibes.

20
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:50,508
I'm not sure what triggers
it. Sometimes it just happens.

21
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:54,828
<i>You can always talk to me.</i>

22
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,181
- Partners?
- Partners.

23
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,632
This is a million dollars.

24
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:00,885
That money is yours once you tell Oliver

25
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:03,170
that you've lost the baby.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,174
<i>I've been running a lot lately,</i>

27
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:09,560
<i>trying to go faster than
I've ever gone before.</i>

28
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:11,312
<i>Because there's someone out there</i>

29
00:01:11,314 --> 00:01:14,949
<i>who's better, faster,
and stronger than I am,</i>

30
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,951
<i>and I need to be ready.</i>

31
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:21,121
<i>But no matter how much I try
or how hard I push myself,</i>

32
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,457
<i>I keep running into the same problem.</i>

33
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,963
He just hit 1,375.

34
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:31,198
What's the fastest Barry's run?

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,035
Little over Mach two,
when he ran back in time.

36
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:36,637
That's not good.

37
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:40,224
<i>That's good, Barry.</i>

38
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,043
We have our work cut out for us.

39
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:45,479
- I'm not getting faster, am I?
- Well...

40
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,348
No, you're not.

41
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,600
All right, well, let's fix this, right?

42
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:51,235
I mean, I can't beat Zoom at this speed.

43
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,886
It felt like I was
standing still next to him.

44
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,071
That's because you practically were.

45
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,656
Zoom is at least three, four times

46
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,324
faster than you at this point.

47
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,944
How is he so much faster
than Barry is and Jay was?

48
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:04,331
Physiology, form, strength,
could be a number of things...

49
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,033
Attitude, diet.

50
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,002
Okay, all right, well,
there's got to be something

51
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:10,754
we can do about it, so
let's just figure it out...

52
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,373
fast, okay?

53
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,959
All right, I got to go. I'm meeting Patty.

54
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:18,295
I'll see you. Thank you.

55
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:20,080
So how are we going to help Barry?

56
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:21,632
I'm out of ideas,

57
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:23,083
and we've tried everything
you've suggested.

58
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:26,520
Well, not everything.

59

00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:48,942
Welcome home.

61
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:50,610
- Any trouble?
- Nah.

62
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:52,880
But believe it or not, we
got ourselves a stowaway.

63
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,614
- He give you his name?
- Didn't say.

64
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,616
Sat in the brig silent for three weeks.

65
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:59,119
He was all decked out in
this when we found him.

66
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:03,123
- Jeez, how many are there?
- 32.

67
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,392
And I'll polish them
all in blood before long.

68
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,929
I've waited a long time for this hunt,

69
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:12,466
and you have brought me
very close to my prey.

70
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:17,354
Mister, you're not going to do
any hunting in those handcuffs.

71
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:21,475
Oh, but, Captain, you're wearing the cuffs.

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,584
Who taught you that... Houdini?

73
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,369
Actually, I taught him.

74
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,201
Soon another sacrifice will be made.

75
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:08,372
I feel you out there.

76
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,134
Man, this was a bloodbath.

77
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,035
Done by one person.

78
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:23,587
One person did all this?

79
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,389
Oh, yeah, you can see
from the blood pattern.

80
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,642
This guy was shot first,
then the police chief,

81
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,427
then these three were stabbed

82
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:32,429
before finishing off the captain.

83
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:34,714
Wow. Do you think a meta-human did it?

84
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:36,316
I don't know, but I found this

85
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,268
in all of the stab victims' wounds.

86
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,053
It's some type of cryptocrystalline...

87
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:41,555
Flint, most likely...

88
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,557
Probably broke off the
blade during the fight.

89
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,325
I'll run it to make sure.

90
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,494
Let's see what stores sell
those kind of flint knives.

91
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,079
Will do.

92
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,665
And, uh, I'll call you later.

93
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

94
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,169
So cute.

95
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,538
You guys are trying not to be
affectionate in front of me.

96
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,541
Oh, no, we're just showing
some professionalism.

97
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,342
Yeah.

98
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,967
<i>♪ I know that you're
unstoppable, babe ♪</i>

99
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,720
Advantages of a trusting manager.

100
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,593
Oh, a lot's gone down in this place.

101
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:22,196
Nice.

102
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:23,363
So what's up?

103
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:27,284
I thought we were gonna go to dinner.

104
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,819
Whoa.

105
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,537
What's going on here?

106
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,073
I couldn't decide which
restaurant to go to,

107
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:36,243
so I thought we would create our own.

108
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:37,628
Voilà.

109
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,281
Short rib, Yukon gold puree, and asparagus.

110
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:42,616
Got to have a vegetable.

111
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:43,884
This is nice.

112
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,469
I like to cook.

113
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,754
I didn't know if you
like red or white, so...

114
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:49,056
I got you both.

115
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,557
Ooh, two bottles.

116
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,093
That's kind dangerous, don't you think?

117
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:54,978
You're not gonna run away
all of a sudden, are you?

118
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,098
Trust me, I'm staying by
your side as long as possible.

119
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,767
Good.

120
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:03,470
You know, it's been really great

121
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:05,322
hanging out these last few weeks.

122
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:08,575
And it's helped make the
move a lot easier, so...

123
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,643
thanks.

124
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:12,529
You're very welcome.

125
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:17,584
Sorry. How did you get in here?

126
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,203
Hey, man, this place is closed.

127
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:23,323
You are just as beautiful
in this life as any other,

128
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:24,591
Priestess Chay-Ara.

129
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,843
Priestess?

130
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,095
Uh, you're going to have to go, dude.

131
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,931
Oh, not without her...

132
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,499
dude.

133
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:34,768
Oh, my God. Cisco.

134
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,003
I don't understand. What do you want?

135
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:39,723
I believe I was clear.

136
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,509
_

137
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,179
_

138
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,982
Kendra's not going anywhere
with you, Highlander.

139
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:50,534
Oh, is that your name now?

140
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:54,154
Kendra... Quite boring.

141
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:57,241
I believe it allowed you
to blend in for a while.

142
00:06:57,243 --> 00:07:00,043
Now, give her to me, and
I'll make your death fast.

143
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,162
It ain't gonna happen.

144
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,867
You are done here, pal.

145
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,670
So is he!

146
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:24,685
Oh!

147
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:27,187
Thank God, Barry.

148
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:31,325
Dude, come on.

149
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,660
I can't believe you're The Flash.

150
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,829
And that you work with The Flash.

151
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,531
Yeah, let's keep that on the DL.

152
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:38,916
This is the same knife

153
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,500
that was used to kill the men at the docks.

154
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,785
Residue is a perfect match.

155
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:43,170
- So it is the same guy.
- Definitely.

156
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,205
But the thing is, these blades are old,

157
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:46,840
centuries old.

158
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,009
Do you have any idea why
this guy would be after you?

159
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,762
No, I've never seen him before in my life.

160
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,513
Well, he was certainly
acting like he knew you.

161
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,849
He kept calling her Priestess Chay-Ara.

162
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,083
That's Coptic.

163
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,852
- You mean Egyptian?
- That's right.

164
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,087
Well, I grew up in Wisconsin,

165
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,358
and I've never even left the States, so...

166
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,944
This guy, he's clearly
incredibly dangerous,

167
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:09,446
so I need you to at least
let us try to protect you.

168
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,781
I can put a detail on her.

169
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,098
You didn't see this guy, Joe.

170
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,317
No offense, but I don't think a cop

171
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,035
is going to be able to protect her.

172
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,372
No, but we do have a few
friends who could lend a hand.

173
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,939
But we're going to need
to leave Central City.

174
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,609
And go where?

175
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,544
You really want to go to Star City?

176
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,496
Come on, we don't need Team Arrow's help.

177
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:28,215
Yeah, I think we do, man.

178
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,833
Man, you've fought
meta-humans with abilities

179
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,501
a lot worse than knife-throwing.

180
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:32,970
I don't think this guy's a meta-human.

181
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,288
There's something different about him,

182
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,724
something, ah, mystical.

183
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,426
Mystical, really?

184
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,261
We stop meta-humans
because we're scientists.

185
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:43,180
We can figure out what
their weaknesses are,

186
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:45,799
but we don't have any experience
when it comes to guys like this,

187
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,601
with magic.

188
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:48,652
They do.

189
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:49,770
Mm, this wouldn't have

190
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:51,238
anything to do with Zoom, would it?

191
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,572
No.

192
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,807
I'm just trying to keep Kendra safe.

193
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,192
This is the best way to do that.

194
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:57,160
Right. Okay, I'm with you.

195
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,413
But how do we even know Oliver and them

196
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,114
even have time to help us?

197
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:02,582
How busy can they be?

198
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,374
Oh, gosh, that's fun.

199
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:12,292
I really could do this all day.

200
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:15,262
Open it up.

201
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,831
They could've at least tried
to hide this chemical bomb.

202
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,101
Serves them right, it getting
stolen and used against them.

203
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,307
Oh, you brought arrows to a gunfight.

204
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:29,142
What guns?

205
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,732
Oh, that was actually pretty clever.

206
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,784
Kill them.

207
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,712
"Felicity, the magnetic-arrow
gag will never work."

208
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,030
Yes, it will, my love,

209
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:53,300
because I am really smart.

210
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,502
And guess what, Oliver. It did work.

211
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:57,421
<i>Felicity, honey, it's a little hard to fight</i>

212
00:09:57,423 --> 00:09:58,972
<i>with you doing that in my ear.</i>

213
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,974
Oh, I totally forgot that
this was an open line.

214
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,310
Keep doing what you're
doing. Make smart decisions.

215
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,868
Ooh! You know, I got to be honest.

216
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,338
I really thought we'd be
doing this dance a lot longer.

217
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
Night-night.

218
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:41,915
What was that?

219
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,720
Damn it.

220
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:48,355
Every time.

221
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,307
It's The Flash.

222
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:52,809
Did I know we knew The Flash?

223
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:54,861
We know The Flash. Okay.

224
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,863
- I didn't know we knew The Flash.
- Thank you.

225
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,232
But I don't think you ran all
the way here to protect us.

226
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:01,768
No, not to protect you.

227
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,121
I need to protect a friend.

228
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:12,727
Wow.

229
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:15,730
Nice new digs.

230
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:17,399
Also, I just noticed, no sleeves.

231
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,934
Don't you get cold?

232
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:20,669
I spent the better part
of five years on an island

233
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:21,920
in the North China Sea.

234
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,288
I don't get cold, Barry.

235
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,406
Barry, it's so good to see you.

236
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,375
Felicity.

237
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:29,110
Good to see you, Felicity.

238
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:30,845
How come you didn't tell
me Zoom broke your back?

239
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:34,215
- I...
- Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

240
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:35,550
So this is what it's like dating her?

241
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:37,752
More bruises from her
than from Deathstroke.

242
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:41,806
Okay, S.T.A.R. Labs is
impressive, but this is...

243
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:44,526
This is completely wrong!

244
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,811
Did you guys even look
at the specs I sent over?

245
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:48,363
This is a tragedy.

246
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:50,365
I'm mourning for the death of engineering.

247
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:53,234
Copper wiring to handle
the processing speed

248
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,536
from the Palmer Satellite,

249
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:56,938
or else your system is gonna overload.

250
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,439
Yeah, but that hasn't happened.

251
00:11:58,441 --> 00:11:59,958
I mean, it hasn't happened since last week.

252
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,493
I mean, it didn't... It happened yesterday.

253
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:02,994
- Hi.
- I'm Felicity.

254
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:07,382
I'm Kendra Saunders. I'm Cisco's...

255
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:10,719
She's, uh, my, uh, new, beautiful friend

256
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,805
who kisses me occasionally.

257
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:18,093
Right. Um, I'm Thea.

258
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:20,428
This is John Diggle and my brother.

259
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,479
Oliver Queen.

260
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,897
- Yeah, I know.
- Hi.

261
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,649
Wow. Okay, first to meet The Flash

262
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:27,185
and now the Green Arrow.

263
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:28,570
Do you have any other surprises for me?

264
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:31,322
Please, no more surprises.

265
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:33,141
Barry said that you need our help.

266
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,193
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

267
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,829
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

268
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:39,814
What does this guy even look like?

269
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,983
Hold on.

270
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:48,590
Okay, this is him.

271
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:50,875
Yeah, see, that's something
I would never think of.

272
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:53,344
Hey, kind of rocking
that Dothraki look... hot.

273
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,346
Let's see if facial
recognition can find a match.

274
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,522
- That's him.
- Yeah, strange.

275
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,608
This picture's from 1975.

276
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,610
Which would make him about
80 years old right now.

277
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:11,196
Okay, what else can you tell us?

278
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:12,981
- He
- aid we've known each other for ages,

279
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:14,866
but I've never met the man before.

280
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:16,818
There has to be some kind of connection.

281
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,536
Not one I can think of.

282
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:21,206
I just moved to Central
City six months ago.

283
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,624
Why'd you move there?

284
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:25,293
I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.

285
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,528
Kendra, there is a reason
this guy's after you.

286
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,130
Think.

287
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,166
Look, man, we just came out
here to hide out for a bit

288
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,752
until we figure things out,
so you can just take it down...

289
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:35,086
You came here because you need our help.

290
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,805
This is what my help looks like.

291
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,757
Oliver, I just saved you
guys from whatever the hell

292
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,008
Flock of Seagulls was about to do.

293
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,209
The least you can do is...

294
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:42,977
Barry, none of us have superpowers.

295
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:44,646
You brought Kendra into our world

296
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:46,097
without knowing who she is

297
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,382
or what this dude that is
after her is looking for.

298
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:50,318
You made all of us unsafe.

299
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,820
So maybe you ask the questions.

300
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:54,939
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

301
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:57,659
- We're all friends here, right?
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:58,860
Why don't we go back to our place

303
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:00,995
and have some drinks, and we can talk?

304
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,447
Cool.

305
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,566
What you working on?

306
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:07,752
This is a formula

307
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:10,538
meant to increase a speedster's velocity

308
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,572
that I've been developing

309
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,842
since Zoom showed up on my Earth.

310
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:17,128
Ironically, this was meant
to help out Jay Garrick.

311
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,264
You want to give Barry a
drug to make him run faster?

312
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,217
Temporarily enhance the Speed
Force in his system, yes.

313
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:24,602
So you're trying to make
nitrous oxide for speedsters.

314
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:26,054
Good analogy. Yes, I tried.

315
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:27,889
Five times I tried. Five times I failed.

316
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:29,858
That's what you get when
your background is technology

317
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,025
and not biochemistry.

318
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:32,894
Well, then you are lucky I am here.

319
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,095
What does that mean?

320
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:35,429
You've been thinking of this

321
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:37,732
as a mechanical problem,
not a biomechanical one.

322
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:38,983
And what does that mean?

323
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,568
When a speedster runs, they consume

324
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,787
an extraordinary amount of oxygen,

325
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,656
so we just need something
to give an extra boost

326
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:45,907
of oxygen during that time.

327
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,575
Like an oxygen generator.

328
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:48,626
Exactly.

329
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,245
So we just need a chemical

330
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:52,780
that's rich in oxygen that would release it

331
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:55,583
as a nearly pure gas as it decomposes...

332
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:56,718
Something like...

333
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,303
Sodium chlorate.

334
00:14:58,305 --> 00:15:00,839
Then all we'd need is
heat to release the oxygen.

335
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:02,674
Which a speedster generates naturally

336
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:05,226
in the form of lightning.

337
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:06,978
I think something like
this just might work.

338
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,730
You think you can help me figure it out?

339
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:10,965
I can certainly try.

340
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:13,634
I'm not changing my nickname.

341
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:14,986
I like Speedy.

342
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,654
Are you familiar with my body of work?

343
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,907
If you are, then you know
I can come up with something

344
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:21,192
so much better than Speedy.

345
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:23,745
Why don't you get a haircut?

346
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:25,580
And then maybe we can talk about it.

347
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:27,248
I think you're just mad
because my conditioner game

348
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,499
is on point.

349
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:31,252
So the CEO of Palmer Technologies

350
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,037
is living with Oliver Queen.

351
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,540
It's insane how much life
can change in six months, huh?

352
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,208
Which you would know better than anyone,

353
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,160
considering that there's another Flash,

354
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:42,797
another Dr. Wells, from another... earth.

355
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,132
I mean...

356
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,167
Yeah. No, it's been trippy lately.

357
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:47,769
I wonder what Oliver's
doppelganger would look like.

358
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:51,505
- Bald, pot-bellied...
- Uh-huh.

359
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:55,843
Agreeable.

360
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:56,945
You seeing anyone?

361
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:59,197
- I am, actually.
- Good.

362
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,615
Patty is her name.

363
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,116
She's amazing.

364
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:04,018
You deserve someone amazing.

365
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,020
Thanks.

366
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:08,740
My pigs in a blanket!

367
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:10,875
Hey, Ollie, um...

368
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:13,828
look, I'm sorry that I
laid all of this on you.

369
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,630
- I know that it wasn't fair.
- It's okay.

370
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:17,365
I'm sorry if earlier I was a little...

371
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,000
Snippy?

372
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,418
I have been called worse.

373
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,669
No, but I'm glad that you're here.

374
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:23,037
I'm glad you reached out.

375
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,973
It shows a real maturity,
and I would know that

376
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,808
because I've never been that mature.

377
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:29,811
I'm always here for you.

378
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:31,145
Thank you.

379
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:33,147
I got to say, this isn't the same

380
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,715
Arrow team I'm used to seeing

381
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:36,517
or the same Oliver Queen.

382
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,936
- You seem really...
- Happy?

383
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,238
- Happy, yeah.
- I am happy.

384
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,156
I finally have everything
that I've ever wanted.

385
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:46,778
Being with Felicity has given
me a real sense of peace,

386
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,830
something that I haven't
had in a long time.

387
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:51,732
Didn't you tell me that guys
like us don't get the girl?

388
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:53,251
Yep.

389
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:54,702
I was wrong.

390
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,207
I would like to propose a toast.

391
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:03,044
I wish it wasn't just the dark
times bringing us together.

392
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:05,913
But it is friends like you

393
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,433
that make those dark times worth having.

394
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:09,684
What a guy.

395
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:11,386
Steals my drinks, steals my words.

396
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,471
As I was saying, it's good to see everyone.

397
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:14,555
- Yes.
- Cheers.

398
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:15,473
Cheers.

399
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,108
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

400
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,027
Mm.

401
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:22,313
Look, don't worry, all right?

402
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,364
We're gonna keep her safe.

403
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,366
- I promise.
- Yeah, I know.

404
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:27,902
Look, there's something I never told you.

405
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:31,272
The first time I kissed
Kendra, I got a vibe.

406
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:32,740
No, not like that kind of vibe.

407
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,959
- Like, I<i> vibed</i> vibed.
- Oh.

408
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:36,627
Remember the man with wings?

409
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:37,912
It wasn't a man.

410
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:39,580
It was Kendra.

411
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,582
She was, like, a bird.

412
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,134
You think that she's a meta-human?

413
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:44,952
Mm...

414
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:46,671
Wait. Why didn't you say
anything about this sooner?

415
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:47,922
Well, I didn't think it was related,

416
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:50,641
but I guess now it has to be.

417
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:55,296
Look, I don't want her
to know about my powers.

418
00:17:55,298 --> 00:17:58,632
I have this great thing going with her.

419
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:02,070
She laughs at my jokes,
and she loves movies,

420
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,272
and...

421
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:06,491
I just... I've never felt like this before,

422
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:09,810
and I don't want to sabotage it.

423
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:11,245
I get the feeling.

424
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:13,664
Look!

425
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,173
I will always find you, Chay-Ara.

426
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:27,879
- Don't move.
- Then how will I kill you all?

427
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:01,996
Yeah, I can do that too.

428
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:15,560
Thea, no!

429
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,185
What did you do?

430
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:26,053
I ended it.

431
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:30,558
This is why we ask questions.

432
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:37,832
Wait. W-where did he go?

433
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:42,120
Oh, boy.

434
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:51,376
Okay.

435
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:53,461
Thanks.

436
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:57,448
All right, Lance is gonna call
if he gets any information on...

437
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,634
whoever that is.

438
00:19:59,636 --> 00:20:01,920
I know where we can get some info.

439
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:09,794
Kendra, I have powers.

440
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:13,965
I get these vibes from people.

441
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:17,402
They're visions of meta-humans,

442
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:19,137
and I had one of you.

443
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:22,657
So, A, you're saying you're a meta-human,

444
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,325
and, B, she's a meta-human?

445
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:25,744
I don't know.

446
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:29,197
In these visions, you could fly.

447
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:32,917
It was like you were a bird of some sort.

448
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,420
- A bird?
- Yeah.

449
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:36,838
What else did you see?

450
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,625
That's it... just you with wings.

451
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:43,511
Oh, I did not see that one coming.

452
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,936
Oh, I think there's a
lot you didn't see coming.

453
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:54,672
- Great. More surprises.
- Who the hell is this?

454
00:20:54,674 --> 00:20:56,274
It's my dad.

455
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,652
I think I did it.

456
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:13,291
What do you know, Snow?

457
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:15,126
I think you did do it.

458
00:21:18,297 --> 00:21:20,698
- Velocity-6?
- Ah.

459
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,383
This is what was so urgent, Harrison?

460
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:25,503
You get me to come here so
I can take your speed drug?

461
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:26,805
That's right.

462
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,723
- You knew about this.
- Of course she did.

463
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:31,009
She figured it out.

464
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,044
I thought this was to help Barry.

465
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:34,646
It is to help Barry, which is why we need

466
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:35,980
to do test runs on subjects

467
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:38,183
who once had the Speed
Force in their system.

468
00:21:38,185 --> 00:21:40,051
The Speed Force doesn't work like that.

469
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:42,821
It's not something you can create in a lab.

470
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,906
How do you think you
became The Flash, Garrick?

471
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:46,357
By me and a lab.

472
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:49,494
Science is what did this
to you, to Barry, to Zoom,

473
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:51,329
and science is what we need to stop Zoom,

474
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:52,330
and this is our only option.

475
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:53,965
Find another one.

476
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,667
The Speed Force can't be
replicated or enhanced.

477
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:56,951
It's a living thing.

478
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:58,670
It's a gift that was given to me.

479
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:00,455
That drug... you have no
idea what it's gonna do.

480
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:01,923
I'm not going to let another
one of your experiments

481
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,424
mess with me again, Harrison.

482
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:05,176
You find someone else
to be your guinea pig.

483
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:06,628
Jay.

484
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,515
Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry.

485
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:12,383
- Where are you going?
- To pick up what we need.

486
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,585
Wait. Jay just said we
shouldn't give it to Barry.

487
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:17,755
We're gonna do what we need.

488
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:23,811
The man you're looking
for is Vandal Savage.

489
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:24,863
Vandal Savage? Never heard of him.

490
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:26,531
Well, who is he?

491
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,483
Some say he was the most
trusted adviser to Genghis Khan.

492
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:29,784
Others say he guided Julius Caesar

493
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:31,152
through the Gallic Wars.

494
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:34,739
But one thing the League knows for sure...

495
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:35,940
He was there for all of it.

496
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:37,292
So what are you saying?

497
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:38,576
He's like a vampire or something?

498
00:22:38,578 --> 00:22:41,496
Not a vampire, an Immortal.

499
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:43,581
Okay, we've officially
stepped into crazy town.

500
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,832
Immortality?

501
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,551
Wait. No, no, no, this makes sense.

502
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:50,471
This explains why he looks
the same as he did in 1975.

503
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:52,006
This can't be possible.

504
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:55,810
There's nothing you can do to save her now.

505
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:57,962
Kendra, do not listen to him.

506
00:22:57,964 --> 00:23:00,565
I... I just need some air.

507
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:07,655
Hey, we're gonna do

508
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:09,407
whatever we have to to keep Kendra safe,

509
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:11,276
whether you think we can or not.

510
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,860
Hey, Joe, it's Patty.

511
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,946
I just interviewed a weapons
expert about the flint knife

512
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:16,314
our attacker used.

513
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:18,366
Found out something pretty interesting,

514
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:20,285
uh, so call me back.

515
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:27,425
Harrison Wells?

516
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:28,793
Kendra!

517
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:32,347
Hey, you going to be all right?

518
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,265
It's just a lot to take in right now.

519
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:36,334
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about me before.

520
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:39,503
I didn't want things to
be different between us.

521
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,022
It's not that, Cisco.

522
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:42,890
If what everyone's saying is true...

523
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:44,609
And it's beginning to seem like it is...

524
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:47,478
My whole life just changed,

525
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,397
and I am so not ready for that.

526
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,483
I hear what you're saying. I do.

527
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:57,288
When I first learned about my powers,

528
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,241
I remember feeling that exact same feeling,

529
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:02,193
and sometimes I still feel that way,

530
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:05,529
and all I can say is...

531
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:10,385
every day gets a little bit more normal.

532
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:13,304
I promise you.

533
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:17,892
Thank you.

534
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:19,344
You're so welcome.

535
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,882
- Aah!
- Kendra!

536
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:27,068
Help!

537
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:38,127
Guys, did you find anything?

538
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:39,528
I'm on it!

539
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,364
Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is my house.

540
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:43,383
Don't worry. We're going to find her.

541
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:55,878
Wow. You look as beautiful as ever.

542
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,148
Chay-Ara, it's me, Khufu.

543
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:09,609
Do you remember?

544
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:11,560
Look at me.

545
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:15,248
- You need to wake up.
- What are you talking about?

546
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,732
I don't know who you are.

547
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:18,451
You will once you emerge.

548
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:20,119
Until then, you need to stay by my side

549
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:21,454
so that I can protect you.

550
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:23,289
Protect me? From what?

551
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:26,960
The man who's hunting you, Vandal Savage.

552
00:25:26,962 --> 00:25:28,795
I got them! 57th Street tower.

553
00:25:28,797 --> 00:25:30,380
I'm right near there.

554
00:25:30,382 --> 00:25:32,081
Always a pleasure watching you work, Smoak.

555
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,516
Yeah!

556
00:25:33,518 --> 00:25:34,884
- Ow.
- That was pitiful.

557
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:36,552
I know this is a lot to take in,

558
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:38,554
but you sort of just kind
of have to trust me on this.

559
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:39,956
I...

560
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:42,392
Just one second.

561
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:43,726
Stay right there.

562
00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:53,286
I got eyes on him.

563
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:11,220
- Give me the girl.
- Not gonna do that, Robin Hood.

564
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:14,090
- You're making a big mistake.
- I'll take my chances.

565
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,094
Barry, change of venue.

566
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:20,629
Birdman and Oliver are at
54th and Motor now... hurry!

567
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:21,814
On my way!

568
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,958
- We need to expose his wings.
- I'm open to suggestions.

569
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,461
- Now you're listening to me?
- It's your city, Oliver.

570
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:52,463
All right.

571
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:41,043
That's new.

572
00:27:41,045 --> 00:27:43,679
Yep, comes in handy.

573
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:51,270
We can't use that serum on Barry.

574
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:53,239
That's up to him, isn't it?

575
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:57,393
If Barry wants to stop
Zoom, this is what he needs.

576
00:27:57,395 --> 00:27:58,894
Jay said it could hurt Barry.

577
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:00,530
Well, Jay's a coward.

578
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:02,999
Jay's a scientist who knows
a lot about speedsters.

579
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:05,084
- You're a scientist, Snow.
- You've been watching Barry.

580
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:07,620
You know he's nowhere near
as fast as he needs to be.

581
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:10,006
This other mentor, this
other Harrison Wells,

582
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:12,592
did not want him to reach
his full potential... I do.

583
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:14,577
You know, you're really starting to sound

584
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:15,928
a lot like him.

585
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:21,634
Put your hands in the air.

586
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:24,053
- Who are you?
- You're under arrest.

587
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:25,188
Doctor McGee was right.

588
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,223
- She did see you.
- Christina McGee?

589
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:29,258
At Mercury Labs.

590
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,776
You're Harrison Wells.

591
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:32,028
Yes, I'm Harrison Wells.

592
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,262
I'm not the Harrison...
- Stop!

593
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:34,397
You move closer, and I'll shoot.

594
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,865
Give me that...

595
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:48,944
Oh, my God, what have you done?

596
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:49,946
Harrison?

597
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:52,248
Harrison, stay with me.

598
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,350
Harrison, Harrison, stay with me.

599
00:28:58,352 --> 00:28:59,968
Stay with me, Harrison, come on.

600
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,720
- Why did you shoot him?
- I thought that was a gun.

601
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:03,222
- I'm sorry. I'll call 911.
- No, don't!

602
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:04,857
- Why?
- Because this...

603
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:06,308
Didn't Joe West explain this to you?

604
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,976
- No.
- Just call Joe.

605
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:10,028
Okay.

606
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:24,960
Where is she?

607
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:26,161
What's your name?

608
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:27,713
You're putting her in danger,

609
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:29,164
and I'm the only one capable of saving her.

610
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,949
You have a very interesting perspective

611
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:32,668
on what the word "saving" means.

612
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,336
She's the love of my lifetime, sweetheart.

613
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:36,722
I was not gonna hurt her.

614
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:38,924
You need to let me go.

615
00:29:43,563 --> 00:29:44,596
Chay-Ara.

616
00:29:44,598 --> 00:29:46,798
My name is Kendra Saunders.

617
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,183
In this life.

618
00:29:48,185 --> 00:29:50,435
And I am... was Carter Hall,

619
00:29:50,437 --> 00:29:52,470
but that is not who we are.

620
00:29:52,472 --> 00:29:54,273
What does that mean?

621
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:56,909
You're Priestess
Chay-Ara. I'm Prince Khufu.

622
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,443
And we're lovers.

623
00:29:58,445 --> 00:29:59,862
Soul mates.

624
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,447
We've been partners for 4,000 years.

625
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:04,199
We're drawn to each other in
each life, and after we die,

626
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:07,252
we reincarnate to find each
other again and again and again.

627
00:30:07,254 --> 00:30:10,005
And now that I've found you, we
should really get out of here.

628
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:12,674
Okay, Romeo, why don't you pump the brakes?

629
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:15,511
These people cannot protect
you from Savage any longer.

630
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:19,014
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

631
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:23,051
In every lifetime, he
hunts us down and kills us.

632
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:25,170
He's done it 206 times,

633
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:27,105
and I'm not planning to make it 207.

634
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:28,891
Why does he kill you?

635
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:32,110
His life force is tethered to ours.

636
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:33,812
Every time he kills us,
he becomes more powerful.

637
00:30:33,814 --> 00:30:34,947
You do the math.

638
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:36,481
You're 0 for 206,

639
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:38,784
and you still think
you're her best bet, hmm?

640
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:41,286
Okay, so what we need
to do is just find Savage

641
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:43,155
and get rid of him.

642
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:45,741
Well, you can't get rid of him, my friend.

643
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,377
Oh, yeah? Watch us.

644
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,245
It might be harder than you think.

645
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:53,498
Is that the only way this
guy knows how to enter a room?

646
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,635
My associates tell me Savage
left Star City a few hours ago.

647
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,253
- For where?
- We're not quite sure.

648
00:30:58,255 --> 00:30:59,838
But I assume after his run-in with you,

649
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,040
he realized he needed
something more powerful

650
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:04,176
to complete his mission.

651
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:06,929
We think he's trying to
locate the Staff of Horus.

652
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,880
Sorry, what is that?

653
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:10,548
It's a relic from our past...

654
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,936
An ancient and powerful weapon.

655
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,854
If Savage gets his hands on it,

656
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:17,823
it's going to be nearly
impossible to stop him.

657
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:19,524
Since when did our lives suddenly become

658
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:21,243
an "Indiana Jones" movie?

659
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:22,560
- Felicity?
- Yeah?

660
00:31:22,562 --> 00:31:24,029
- Think you can find it?
- Yeah.

661
00:31:24,031 --> 00:31:25,563
It's probably at some museum somewhere.

662
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:28,867
I'll, uh, work my magic,
see what I can find.

663
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:31,253
We're running out of time.

664
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:33,839
You need to emerge now.

665
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:36,291
Come on, what is it gonna
take for you to believe me?

666
00:31:36,293 --> 00:31:37,876
You saw my wings.

667
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:40,245
I know you know this is true.

668
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:42,414
Please, just let me show you how.

669
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,440
- How's he doing?
- He's losing oxygen.

670
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,924
- I need you to leave.
- Joe, I...

671
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:55,811
Patty, go.

672
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,779
There's a bullet in a branch
of his pulmonary artery

673
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:00,732
that's blocking off most of the
blood flow from the left lung.

674
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,067
Are we able to get the bullet out?

675
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,735
Not without causing too much damage.

676
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:05,287
I need Jay's help.

677
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:19,685
So...

678
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,754
you just want me to jump.

679
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:25,057
Fall, jump, swan dive, whatever suits you.

680
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:26,975
Just, uh, do it.

681
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:29,261
Okay, this isn't the X Games.

682
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:30,979
And this is how she emerges...

683
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:34,316
She just falls towards her death?

684
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:37,402
Yep. 4,000 years of experience
says that's exactly how.

685
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:38,636
Just watch and learn.

686
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:39,988
No, I'm sorry. What are we doing?

687
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,940
Why are we listening to this guy?

688
00:32:41,942 --> 00:32:43,275
Come on, Oliver, you're supposed to be

689
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:44,860
the one who asks questions.

690
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:48,080
Okay, but after what we
saw, after what Cisco said,

691
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:51,316
I cannot believe I'm going
to say this, but it...

692
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:53,818
kind of makes sense.

693
00:32:56,989 --> 00:32:58,757
Hey, hey, hey!

694
00:33:03,263 --> 00:33:05,764
- I need to try.
- Are you serious?

695
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:07,849
Yes, she is.

696
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:10,802
Barry!

697
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:18,009
- What the hell was that?
- Saving her life.

698
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:19,177
You should have emerged.

699
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:20,696
Something is blocking you.

700
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,147
Well, we should just try
again and see what's...

701
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:23,448
- No!
- Yeah, no, no, no, no.

702
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,849
We're not doing that again.

703
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:26,118
Kendra, you don't have to do this.

704
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,153
Oliver, we can stop Savage, okay?

705
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:29,521
Barry. Barry!

706
00:33:29,523 --> 00:33:32,874
What?

707
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:36,027
Talk to you for a second?

708
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:36,995
Okay.

709
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:38,296
Keep an eye on him.

710
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:43,135
What is going on with you?

711
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:44,586
I'm trying to keep her alive.

712
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,722
- Then I think we let her jump.
- Are you kidding?

713
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,540
Barry, I get that you're desperate to help

714
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:49,758
and you want to be the hero

715
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,309
and you want to save her yourself,

716
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:54,212
but I think she has to
have a part in it too.

717
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,483
It's just... the rules keep changing.

718
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:00,152
One day I have to run through time,

719
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:02,104
the next I'm fighting a telepathic gorilla,

720
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,022
and now we're what?

721
00:34:04,024 --> 00:34:06,658
We're chasing down an
immortal madman on a rampage

722
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,828
against down a reincarnated
warrior priestess?

723
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,498
I just never thought I'd have superpowers

724
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,867
and feel more powerless than
I ever have in my entire life.

725
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:17,335
That part I understand.

726
00:34:17,337 --> 00:34:19,737
But you have already helped Kendra.

727
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,757
You have kept her alive.

728
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,375
So now let's help her get her wings,

729
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:26,344
and then she can give you
a lift back to Central City.

730
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:31,716
Central City.

731
00:34:31,718 --> 00:34:33,135
What?

732
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,053
You need to check Central
City for the staff.

733
00:34:35,055 --> 00:34:36,354
Kendra, you said you were drawn there.

734
00:34:36,356 --> 00:34:38,023
Yeah.

735
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:39,391
I think you're drawn to
things that destroy you

736
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:40,642
the same way you two
are drawn to each other.

737
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:41,810
That's why it wasn't

738
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:43,228
in any museum or private collection,

739
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,646
because it was consecrated eight months ago

740
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:46,148
at St. Mark's in Central City.

741
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,783
We've got to get it before Savage does.

742
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,652
- Carter, stay here.
- I'm not going anywhere.

743
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:52,070
Call Thea and Digg,

744
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:53,288
and we'll have them hold down the fort

745
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,623
in case Savage shows up.

746
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,708
Kendra, last year, I lost my powers.

747
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,460
The only way I could get them back

748
00:34:58,462 --> 00:35:00,712
is if I just forgot about
everything happening around me

749
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:02,497
and focused on who I was.

750
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:06,117
Just believe in yourself, and
your true self will emerge.

751
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,552
Thanks.

752
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:10,589
Hey, are you sure that you want to do this?

753
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:12,307
If this guy's immortal

754
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:16,144
and Merlyn's right about
how powerful this staff is...

755
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:17,646
We'll be fine.

756
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,980
Kiss her.

757
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:21,066
We'll be fine.

758
00:35:23,653 --> 00:35:25,570
- Careful.
- Let's go.

759
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:42,377
Now what?

760
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:43,712
His systolic pressure's dropping.

761
00:35:43,714 --> 00:35:46,131
He's gonna code.

762
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:47,799
How bad is it?

763
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:50,051
There's a bullet in his pulmonary artery.

764
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:52,220
Can you close the wound if I get it?

765
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:54,439
- Yes.
- How are you going to do that?

766
00:35:56,942 --> 00:35:58,276
What is that?

767
00:35:58,278 --> 00:35:59,778
It's a serum called Velocity-6.

768
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,363
It could give Jay temporary speed.

769
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:02,781
He can phase through Doctor Wells' chest

770
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:04,032
and remove the bullet.

771
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:05,400
Yeah, but I told you, I have no idea

772
00:36:05,402 --> 00:36:06,484
what's gonna happen if I use that.

773
00:36:06,486 --> 00:36:07,952
It's our only option.

774
00:36:07,954 --> 00:36:09,738
If you don't do this, Dr. Wells will die.

775
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,331
Ah!

776
00:36:22,668 --> 00:36:23,835
It's working.

777
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,901
BP and oxygenation is rising.

778
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:43,271
Blood flow's returning to his lungs.

779
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:45,990
Thank you.

780
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,295
I was just thinking...

781
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:54,632
all the moments of my
life when I felt different,

782
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:58,837
like something was wrong with me.

783
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:02,006
Now I know why.

784
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:05,009
It's gonna be all right.

785
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:06,928
Okay?

786
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,881
Look, I... I know what
it's like to have your life

787
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:12,350
suddenly change like this.

788
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:14,936
I... I can help you get through this.

789
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:17,922
I don't know if you can.

790
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:21,776
Cisco, there's a whole
other life inside me,

791
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:25,897
hundreds of lives, that
I need to know about.

792
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:30,201
I think I need to do it by myself.

793
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:32,237
I have to...

794
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,939
embrace my destiny.

795
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:38,243
I have to believe.

796
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:41,463
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

797
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:43,548
You don't have to do this.

798
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:51,789
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

799
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:54,175
I just like to speed into rooms, usually.

800
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:56,644
Uh-huh. Where do you
think we find this thing?

801
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:59,147
I haven't been in one of
these places in a while.

802
00:38:02,468 --> 00:38:04,102
We're too late.

803
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:06,604
Something you're not
used to saying very often,

804
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:08,573
I'd imagine.

805
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:11,326
You tried those arrows
once before, remember?

806
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:13,995
They didn't quite finish
the job, now, did they?

807
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:15,780
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

808
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:17,248
You're gonna leave Kendra alone.

809
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,533
I can't do that.

810
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:20,651
While my destiny is to live forever,

811
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:24,155
Chay-Ara's is to die, as is yours now.

812
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:39,938
- Any ideas?
- Oh, now you'll listen to me?

813
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,940
It's your city.

814
00:38:46,312 --> 00:38:48,313
All right, let's just try to get the staff.

815
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:51,015
- All right, on my mark.
- All right.

816
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,321
Carter was right.

817
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:57,789
Something's holding me back.

818
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,874
Maybe it's Central City or you

819
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:01,826
or what I thought my life was gonna be,

820
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:04,862
but I'm never gonna become who
I really am unless I let go.

821
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:06,047
I have to do this.

822
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:17,308
In all my countless years,

823
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,762
I've never encountered
anybody with your capabilities.

824
00:39:20,764 --> 00:39:23,381
Astonishing!

825
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:25,383
No!

826
00:39:33,493 --> 00:39:35,610
Chay-Ara.

827
00:39:35,612 --> 00:39:37,328
Oh, my God!

828
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:40,565
Whoo-hoo!

829
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:42,400
I used to enjoy slow deaths.

830
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:45,537
Now I just find them boring.

831
00:39:55,714 --> 00:39:57,515
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

832
00:39:57,517 --> 00:39:59,183
Any chance he blew himself up in there?

833
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:00,385
Not likely.

834
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:02,186
So that's, like, a tie, right?

835
00:40:02,188 --> 00:40:05,106
- I guess.
- I will take it.

836
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:06,108
Whoo!

837
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:20,788
Hey.

838
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,407
You okay?

839
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:26,210
I'm gonna have to learn
how to use these things.

840
00:40:26,212 --> 00:40:29,247
You'll get the hang of it, Hawkgirl.

841
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:38,306
Dr. Wells?

842
00:40:38,308 --> 00:40:41,792
You're gonna be okay.

843
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:43,678
That's good news.

844
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,649
You will probably be very sore
for a little while, though.

845
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:50,318
Sore is better than dead.

846
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,437
Yes, it is.

847
00:40:57,242 --> 00:40:59,744
How are you doing, Garrick?

848
00:40:59,746 --> 00:41:02,196
Your serum's out of my system,

849
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:05,500
and I will never take it again.

850
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:14,042
Jay...

851
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:15,793
thank you.

852
00:41:15,795 --> 00:41:20,014
You can thank me by keeping
that Velocity-6 away from Barry.

853
00:41:29,274 --> 00:41:30,775
That was Oliver.

854
00:41:30,777 --> 00:41:32,310
Savage has the Staff of Horus.

855
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:35,029
He wants us all in Central
City as soon as possible.

856
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:37,231
Okay, well, Laurel's already
there visiting her mom,

857
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:39,117
so I'll call her and let
her know we're coming by.

858
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,851
If Savage is in Central City,

859
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,487
then why are we going back there?

860
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:43,905
So we can end this.

861
00:41:43,907 --> 00:41:45,206
And if anybody's gonna take down Savage,

862
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:46,324
it's going to be Barry and Oliver.

863
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:47,709
Plus, you've emerged.

864
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:48,693
It's going to be much harder for him now.

865
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:50,044
And together, all of us,

866
00:41:50,046 --> 00:41:51,529
we can take him down once and for all.

867
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:55,133
Okay, so how are we gonna get there?

868
00:41:55,135 --> 00:41:56,467
Did I mention I'm the CEO

869
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:59,137
of a big company with a private jet?

870
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,549
Since when is that a thing?

871
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:13,851
About eight months.

872
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:17,105
Maybe if you save Star
City, you might get one too.

873
00:42:17,107 --> 00:42:20,558
By the way, we still need to get Savage.

874
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,743
We'll get him.

875
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,497
Watch yourself, buddy.

876
00:42:30,536 --> 00:42:31,703
You don't want to lose this guy.

877
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:33,237
- Thanks, Mister.
- Yeah.

878
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:56,979
