1
00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:01,474
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,475 --> 00:00:02,412
The Quadrant.

3
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,850
You know, I heard about these guys
when I was working undercover.

4
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:06,728
I never could get anyone
to confirm their existence.

5
00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:08,618
Yeah, well, they are real.

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,086
High-end
cartel ruled by moneyed families

7
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:11,988
with ties to all
things black market.

8
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,310
We think Diaz may be
helping her with that operation.

9
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:16,924
You said you were
an honorable man.

10
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:19,894
Now, I think you
know Diaz isn't.

11
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:21,663
Help me stop him.

12
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,431
I'm moving on
to plan B--

13
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:25,566
killing
Oliver Queen

14
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:27,902
and everyone
he cares about.

15
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:32,790
Uh, Dad, there's a shell
in this one.

16
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,493
Uh, yes, there is.

17
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:37,294
Oh, isn't the pan hot?

18
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:39,396
Ow. It's immensely hot,

19
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:42,132
but when we are doing
breakfast for dinner

20
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:44,401
at Chez Queen,
we do it right.

21
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:45,970
Salt me, please,
Felicity.

22
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:48,005
What?

23
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,487
Could you pass the salt, please, quickly
when you get a chance?

24
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,880
I can not put salt
on this if it's

25
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:57,982
gonna put that
expression on your face.

26
00:00:57,984 --> 00:00:59,950
It's not
about the salt, Oliver.

27
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:01,151
Ok.

28
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:03,153
Call me when dinner's ready.

29
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,227
Ok, well, you have
officially scared him away,

30
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,596
so, ahem, you want to tell
me what's going on with you?

31
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,865
Oliver, it's just you're
in here pretending

32
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,601
like you weren't almost put in prison
for the rest of your life.

33
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:19,136
Ok, we almost lost you.

34
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:20,638
And the man who tried
to put you there is

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,339
still out there
controlling the city,

36
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:23,941
and you're just in here
scrambling eggs, Oliver.

37
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:28,479
Yup. Ok, first,
I'm gonna stop him.

38
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:31,849
Second...

39
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:35,152
I am in here
scrambling eggs

40
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:37,254
because I just
wanted a night--

41
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:39,490
one night--
to remind myself

42
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:41,292
what I'm
fighting for.

43
00:01:41,294 --> 00:01:44,361
Ok, I guess I can
compartmentalize that.

44
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:46,163
I can help you
with that.

45
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:51,035
Arm strength's back.

46
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:53,270
Motor function's
restored.

47
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:57,274
All signs of the nerve
damage you had are gone.

48
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:59,677
Do you mind telling me
how you did this?

49
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:01,378
Sorry, doc. NDA.

50
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,147
So if he's in the clear,

51
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,848
does that mean
no more checkups?

52
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,650
Well, you guys
are good to go.

53
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:08,686
- Enjoy date night.
- Thank you.

54
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:10,020
Thank you, doctor.

55
00:02:10,022 --> 00:02:10,856
I'll take care
of the paperwork.

56
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:12,172
- Good.
- I think we still have time

57
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,924
to make
the Shabu Shabu place.

58
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,426
Good.

59
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:20,064
And over here is
the polyrase inhibitor.

60
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,899
Felicity and I had to
take out, like,

61
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:24,068
3 big loans just to buy
it, but it's great.

62
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,103
You know, when you asked me
to meet you at your work,

63
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,638
I, uh...

64
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,306
You thought that I had
a fantasy about

65
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:30,674
fooling around
in an office?

66
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:32,242
I thought it was your way

67
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:33,844
of milking another hour
out of work.

68
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:36,714
Well, I just thought
that you'd like to see

69
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:38,649
how I spend my days.

70
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:40,384
I mean, this is some pretty
cutting-edge tech.

71
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:42,920
Which is gonna make us
late for our reservation.

72
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:44,855
Ok, Mr. punctuality.

73
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:46,724
Let me just shut down
the rest of the equipment.

74
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:54,131
He shoots, he scores!

75
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,734
Nope. Off the post.

76
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:58,435
Ah, damn.

77
00:02:58,437 --> 00:03:00,104
Ok, you know what?

78
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:02,206
When everything
settles down,

79
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,842
I'm getting us
the best seats in the house.

80
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:06,744
You do know it's like
400 bucks a ticket.

81
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:09,546
Then they will have
obstructed views.

82
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:11,148
Nah! Anything for
my baby, ok?

83
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,850
Dad, quiet.

84
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:15,252
At least wait for a whistle
if you want to talk.

85
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:17,454
Ok, ok.

86
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:24,595
I'll give you the courtesy
of putting that back in

87
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,930
before we start this.

88
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,667
Does it have to be
in that order?

89
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,268
Hyah!

90
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:34,505
- You work for Ricardo Diaz.
- Who?

91
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,940
You want to play that game?

92
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:40,577
Good. I need to blow off
some steam.

93
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:44,314
My mom and I used to eat
breakfast for dinner

94
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:47,317
all the time,
except it wasn't ironic,

95
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,786
because she worked
nights, so...

96
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:50,287
I mean, not like that!

97
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,089
At least I hope not.

98
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,894
Are you gonna get it, Dad?

99
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,629
No. That's one of the perks
of being impeached.

100
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,930
No interruptions.

101
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:01,131
Oliver, get
the phone.

102
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:02,766
Get the phone.

103
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:04,268
Ok.

104
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:10,674
Who was it?

105
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:12,276
Anatoly.

106
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,114
Get down!

107
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:25,556
When I move, get
William into the bedroom

108
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:27,958
and shut the door, ok?

109
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:14,872
Are you two ok?

110
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:16,774
Yeah.

111
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,175
Are--are they dead?

112
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:22,880
No, but they're down.

113
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:40,197
Oh.

114
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:46,403
- What?
- Trouble.

115
00:05:58,384 --> 00:06:00,517
You know, you're gonna
wake up in a couple hours.

116
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,252
Your heads are
gonna be throbbing.

117
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:04,121
You're gonna regret
not talking.

118
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:09,793
Oh. You were just
the bait.

119
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:16,300
Lyla, behind you!

120
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,639
- I had him.
- I know you did, honey.

121
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,150
Look at me. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

122
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,457
Don't look.

123
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:47,030
One bullet,
back of the head.

124
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,599
You won't even feel it.

125
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:51,468
You know the cool thing
about sound waves?

126
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:56,807
They bounce.

127
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:12,856
Mr. Oliver?

128
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:15,158
Ohh. I'm glad you are
all right.

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
Thank you for coming
so quickly.

130
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:18,662
I was close.
Where are the men?

131
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:21,765
I tied them up.
They're unconscious.

132
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,533
Hey, I just spoke
to Rene, Dinah, and John.

133
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:25,302
They're ok.

134
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:27,304
Good. Wait.
What about Curtis?

135
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,839
He's ok.
His boyfriend isn't.

136
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,173
He has to go
into surgery.

137
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,975
Starling General
is not secure.

138
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:33,043
No, no. Lyla sent them to
the A.R.G.U.S. med-bay.

139
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:34,144
They're gonna be ok.

140
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:35,946
Quentin?

141
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:37,481
Quentin said that Diaz isn't gonna
attack the mayor.

142
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:39,283
He's too much in
the public eye.

143
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:41,318
But Laurel's
in the wind.

144
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,321
What about us?

145
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:45,956
That's why I
called Raisa, ok?

146
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,224
We're gonna put you into
A.R.G.U.S. custody.

147
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:48,558
They're
gonna keep you safe.

148
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,193
You're not coming, are you?

149
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,763
No. I have to stay here.

150
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,298
I have to finish this.

151
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,999
You're gonna go
with Raisa and Felicity.

152
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:57,167
Oh, actually,
buddy,

153
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:59,603
I'm not
coming either.

154
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,071
I would like you

155
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:02,806
far away
from here and safe.

156
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:05,375
Oliver, this is my fight
as much as it is yours.

157
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:07,511
I'm not going anywhere.

158
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:14,017
As the Green Arrow,

159
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:17,854
I have gone up against
some terrible people

160
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:20,123
who have tried to do
terrible things.

161
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,692
Hey, look at me.

162
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,160
And I'm still here.

163
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,595
That doesn't mean you
always will be.

164
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:27,197
You're right.

165
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:33,403
William, I just started
being your dad, ok?

166
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,672
I love being your dad.

167
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:38,842
And nothing is gonna
take me away from you,

168
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:41,111
especially not
Ricardo Diaz.

169
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:44,381
Kick his ass.

170
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,789
John and Lyla
are on their way?

171
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,458
Yeah. But why are you
having them come here?

172
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,195
Because our bunker
is not secure.

173
00:08:58,197 --> 00:09:00,130
Yeah. Why would
Diaz do all of this now?

174
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:02,099
He could've moved on us
months ago.

175
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:03,867
Diaz wanted me in prison

176
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:06,536
to avoid making a martyr
of the Green Arrow.

177
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:09,639
With me out of the picture,
he would've come after you.

178
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:11,308
It didn't go that way.

179
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,677
Well, I'm not
liking his plan B.

180
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:19,750
This is the feed
from our surveillance cameras.

181
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:21,385
Son of a bitch.

182
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:22,652
What are we doing
just watching?

183
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:23,987
Let's go there now.

184
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:25,889
There's no time, Rene.

185
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:29,092
Diaz has numbers, which means
he has tactical advantage.

186
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:31,495
John's right.

187
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,497
Bunkers and equipment
can be replaced.

188
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:35,432
We need to look at
the big picture.

189
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:37,067
Are our families on the way
to the safe house?

190
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:39,202
Better. NORAD bunker
in Colorado.

191
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,038
Oh, no, no. Not the--

192
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:47,277
Should've done this
months ago.

193
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:50,547
Torch it.

194
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,299
We leave now,
we could snag a couple,

195
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:10,700
send a message.

196
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:11,968
Don't worry. You'll
get your chance.

197
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,537
Just have
patience, Rene.

198
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:18,675
Dinah's right.
Diaz is making his move.

199
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:23,080
We will make ours
carefully and precisely.

200
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:27,279
End this tonight.

201
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:31,303

203
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:37,549
How much support can we
expect from A.R.G.U.S.?

204
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:39,165
I had to stretch
the rules to get

205
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,234
what little resources
John has now.

206
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:43,569
As big a problem as Diaz is
for Star City--

207
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:45,738
For A.R.G.U.S.,
he's small potatoes.

208
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,340
What John means is

209
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:49,408
A.R.G.U.S. isn't chartered
for law enforcement.

210
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,711
It looks like it's
just up to us, then.

211
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:53,379
Curtis.

212
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:57,818
How's Nick?

213
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,821
He's resting,
post-op.

214
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:05,792
It was pretty bad,
but he's gonna be ok.

215
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,027
We got lucky.

216
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:08,428
Oh, I'm so sorry.

217
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,264
He took those
bullets for me.

218
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:12,466
Don't worry. We'll give him
payback times 10.

219
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:14,401
Where do we start?

220
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:16,970
Well, we've got to get a direct Intel
on Diaz's location.

221
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,739
I'm working
on that.

222
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:20,207
All right. And we need
some major-league ordnance.

223
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,775
That A.R.G.U.S.
can help with.

224
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,911
Bennet and I, we're
a force multiplier.

225
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,179
You know,
if we keep going this way,

226
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:27,114
we're going to die
out there.

227
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:30,684
It doesn't matter how much
weaponry Lyla provides,

228
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:33,287
how angry we are, how much
adrenaline we have.

229
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:36,023
If we just--if we just
press ahead like this,

230
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:38,659
we're all gonna die
out there.

231
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:40,427
We haven't worked
together in months.

232
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:42,095
You know, Diaz is not
expecting that at least.

233
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:44,131
He's planned
for everything.

234
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,033
Us getting back together,
working as a team--

235
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:50,604
it's a start,
but this guy's got an army.

236
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:52,506
He has the city officials;
He's got the police.

237
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:54,007
He's got everything.

238
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,343
Please tell me
there's a "but"

239
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:58,212
coming out the end
of this pep talk.

240
00:11:58,214 --> 00:11:59,646
Anatoly Knyazev.

241
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:01,181
I thought he hated
your guts.

242
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:03,116
I think we've come to
an understanding.

243
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:05,052
I also think that
he might be

244
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:08,455
the one move Diaz
does not see coming.

245
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:10,057
Oliver, if that's our
tactical advantage,

246
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,358
we need to press it.

247
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,560
Let me set a meet with him, ok?

248
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:16,463
Let us make a move off
of his Intel.

249
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:20,867
But until we have it,
I want you guys to stand down,

250
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:24,638
and I...I'm asking you
to trust me.

251
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,809
I know that that trust
does not come easy

252
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:30,877
after everything that's
happened.

253
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:38,051
Let's put all of that aside
and get this done.

254
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:49,062
My family's alive
thanks to you.

255
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:50,831
Please save gratitude

256
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,267
for when I'm sipping on
umbrella straw on the beach,

257
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:55,936
safe and sound in Maldives.

258
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,340
I don't know how long

259
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:02,442
family's safety
going to last.

260
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:06,113
SCPD has instructions:
"Kill on sight."

261
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,115
Diaz's base of operations
is too secure.

262
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:11,885
We can't move on it
without losing people.

263
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:16,456
Agreed. Best bet
to get him on move--

264
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,191
in transit, so to speak.

265
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:20,227
Well, but he's gonna
expect us to hit back.

266
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:22,963
I'd expect him to stay
where he's secure.

267
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:25,832
Perhaps I can think of
something to motivate him.

268
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:28,769
I'm asking a lot of you.

269
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:32,139
I appreciate it.

270
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:36,310
You cannot wage revolution
in white gloves.

271
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:44,117
Lenin had many faults,
but he was right about that.

272
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,258
You want to stop pacing?
You're giving me a headache.

273
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,561
Funny. I was going to
say the same to you.

274
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:56,263
Your pitch to
the Quadrant was that

275
00:13:56,265 --> 00:13:57,931
you controlled
this city.

276
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,933
And I do.

277
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,601
Then why have you turned
it into a war zone tonight?

278
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:03,303
I thought we couldn't
let the vigilantes

279
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:04,871
be turned into martyrs.

280
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:06,707
The judge kicked the case

281
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:08,642
and let Oliver Queen walk.

282
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:11,545
So you've switched gears
from careful and precise

283
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:13,580
to loud and messy?

284
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:19,019
Your attitude
is what I find...

285
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:23,156
To be unwanted.

286
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,025
Be careful, Ricardo.

287
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:27,027
You've already given
us the city.

288
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:29,830
Hey...

289
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:35,469
Are you suggesting that
I'm replaceable?

290
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:38,839
I'm suggesting
no such thing.

291
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:47,414
Ms. Cassamento does not
appear to be pleased.

292
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,383
What happened tonight?

293
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:50,784
You underestimate
your enemy.

294
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:52,185
They are strong
and motivated.

295
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:53,620
They got lucky.

296
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:56,189
Luck, strength.
What does it matter?

297
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:58,959
You did not kill bees.

298
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:00,994
You merely poked
the HIVE.

299
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:02,696
The bees will be
agitated.

300
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:05,866
You think they're gonna
come here. That's fine.

301
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:07,100
Let them bring it on.

302
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:09,569
Bring them here, hmm?

303
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:15,942
This place--lovely
but not secure,

304
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:17,377
at least not enough

305
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,179
for what
you know they're

306
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:21,381
going to come
after you with.

307
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:29,222
Anatoly did it.

308
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:31,725
Diaz will be on his way
to the SCPD in an hour.

309
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:33,627
A.R.G.U.S. doesn't have
authority to arrest Diaz.

310
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:37,197
So once you have him in custody,
what's the next step?

311
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
Yeah, Lyla's right. We can't just
hand him over to the police.

312
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,601
And, no offense, but
your Lian Yu supermax

313
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:43,303
is kind of blown up.

314
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:45,472
One problem at a time.

315
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:47,274
Now, we need to end this.

316
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:48,975
And that means solving
our first problem,

317
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:52,078
getting Diaz.

318
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,382
Can I say it
for old time's sake?

319
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:57,818
Suit up.

320
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,231
In Russia, we travel
in nicer cars.

321
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:16,002
This girl ain't pretty,
but she's bulletproof.

322
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:23,643
What's that?

323
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:27,681
Construction?

324
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:32,652
Hold up, guys. We got
to move this forklift.

325
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:42,963
Get this under control now!

326
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:47,667
Did you forget your gun?

327
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:05,685
Uh! Uh!

328
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,687
Curtis, don't!

329
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:18,331
You hurt someone I care
about! Want some more?

330
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,200
Do you?

331
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:36,149
Uh! Uh!

332
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:49,829
Quadrant reinforcements with
SCPD and more on the way.

333
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:51,831
We got to pull out now.

334
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,693
We almost got
that son of a bitch.

335
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:13,587
How's Curtis?

336
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:15,222
He's resting with Nick.

337
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:17,947
One inch either way,
he would've bled out.

338
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:19,448
He got lucky.

339
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,350
- It wasn't just luck.
- What do you mean?

340
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:23,552
Diaz could've killed Curtis,

341
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:26,722
but he went for some
sort of necklace instead.

342
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,891
That must be one damn important
piece of jewelry.

343
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:30,459
More like a piece
of tech. Look.

344
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,661
It's a GRV-567,
solid state drive,

345
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:35,064
military grade,
dynamic encryption.

346
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:36,499
Whatever's on it, Diaz has
gone to some major trouble

347
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:38,567
to keep it secure
and close, though.

348
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,436
This looks like something we
should have our hands on.

349
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:41,737
Wait.
How do we know?

350
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:42,972
There could be
nothing on it.

351
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:44,940
You just said so
yourself.

352
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:46,842
I mean, Diaz went after this instead
of going after Curtis.

353
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,878
Your digital sniffer, can it
read the drive?

354
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,646
Yeah. If you get me close
enough, for sure.

355
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:52,381
But Diaz is headed to SCPD.

356
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:53,616
I'm sure he's gonna let us
stroll right in.

357
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:55,851
They'll let me.

358
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:57,753
What do you mean?

359
00:18:57,755 --> 00:18:59,488
Diaz knows that A.R.G.U.S.
is working against him.

360
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,023
The police still
have to keep up appearances.

361
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:02,758
Wouldn't look good
if they decline

362
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,960
a visit from the head
of a federal agency.

363
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,129
And if things go south,

364
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:08,631
I've got you to back me up.

365
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:11,567
I think that
this is a big gamble

366
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:13,302
for an unknown payoff.

367
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:14,970
It probably is,
Oliver,

368
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:17,506
but it might be
our only shot.

369
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:21,076
So we're
all onboard here?

370
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,878
Yeah.

371
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,780
Double
perimeter security.

372
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:27,149
Next time I see
Oliver Queen,

373
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:29,218
I want his head
on a spike!

374
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,686
You got it, boss.

375
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:32,254
Where's
the tech kid?

376
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,890
Crosby's over there.

377
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:40,696
Oh. Mr. Diaz.

378
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:42,731
I need to know if
what's on this is

379
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,200
still intact

380
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:46,602
without you looking
at the data.

381
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:48,537
Can you do that?

382
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:52,841
Your grandma's life
depends on it.

383
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,110
Yes, sir.

384
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,922
Close the door.

385
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:15,130
They knew!

386
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,266
Who? Knew what?

387
00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:19,201
That I was moving,

388
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:24,940
that my men were coming
for them tonight!

389
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:29,478
Laurel--she's
buttoned up, right?

390
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:33,282
Who could've told them?

391
00:20:33,284 --> 00:20:34,883
I do not know.

392
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:40,289
Hmm. You and Queen,
you go way back.

393
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:45,327
Yes, which is why his
betrayal hurt so much.

394
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:50,966
If it wasn't you...

395
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:59,441
Then who, hmm?

396
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:03,846
Who brought men and police
to help us tonight?

397
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:08,651
Cassamento.

398
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:11,654
How did she know
we'd be attacked?

399
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:15,691
I did not ask
for backup. Did you?

400
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:20,296
Why would she tip off Queen

401
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:24,099
and then drag our asses...

402
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:27,336
Out of the fire?

403
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:29,104
That doesn't make sense.

404
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:30,572
Yes, it does,

405
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:32,641
if she wants
leverage over you

406
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:34,877
to make you grovel.

407
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,347
Truth be telling,
I do many times before

408
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:39,715
in Bratva.

409
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:42,651
I don't grovel.

410
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:47,189
How's it going
with the sniffer?

411
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:49,825
Oh, just snifferific.

412
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:51,593
I am reprogramming it
to specifically couple

413
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:53,996
with the digital signature
of Diaz's drive.

414
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:55,631
I'll have to do some
on-the-fly programming

415
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:56,932
just to cut out the noise,

416
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:59,301
but totally
in my wheelhouse.

417
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:01,804
Does this absolutely have
to be done on site?

418
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:03,339
It absolutely does
if you

419
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:05,474
would absolutely
like it to work. Why?

420
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,112
Oliver, you do know

421
00:22:10,114 --> 00:22:11,714
I have been on
the field before, right?

422
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:13,782
Russia, twice.

423
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:16,518
Nanda Parbat,
Merlyn Global.

424
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,454
That all happened before
you were a parent.

425
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:20,322
Well, if it will make
you feel any better,

426
00:22:20,324 --> 00:22:22,391
I will not be the one infiltrating
the precinct.

427
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:24,293
That'll be Lyla,

428
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:26,195
the same Lyla who's
also a parent

429
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:27,996
and whose husband
didn't blink twice

430
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:30,232
when she volunteered
to go into Diaz's dragon den.

431
00:22:30,234 --> 00:22:31,834
Lyla's a soldier.

432
00:22:31,836 --> 00:22:33,669
Yeah, which is why she's
the one infiltrating

433
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:35,671
and I'm the one
hacking remotely.

434
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:39,942
I'm not gonna do
anything stupid.

435
00:22:41,512 --> 00:22:43,078
Do we have
a problem here?

436
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,382
No. Ready when you are.

437
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,228
All I have to do is position that
someplace central?

438
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,164
Yes, if Diaz's drive is in that building,
sniffer will find it.

439
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,832
I can monitor
the transfer from here,

440
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,434
but I need this back
for full pull.

441
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:07,035
How much time do you
need for the transfer?

442
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,537
A couple minutes, Max.

443
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:10,472
Copy that.

444
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,207
Everybody in position?

445
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:13,709
In position.

446
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:15,744
First hint anything's wrong,
signal us.

447
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:17,913
Copy.
We move in 5.

448
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:21,917
Everything ok?

449
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,986
Yeah. It's just--
it's so nice to see

450
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:25,954
how you and John, you know,
work when you're out in the field,

451
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,656
because you're so in sync.

452
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:29,124
How do you do it?

453
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,527
You're asking
for marital advice? Now?

454
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:33,362
Sorry. Yeah,
totally terrible timing.

455
00:23:33,364 --> 00:23:35,697
It's just that, like, Oliver
doesn't even want me here.

456
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:38,467
So I just thought maybe
a tip or two would work.

457
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:41,804
We always knew our lives
would be high risk.

458
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:43,772
Eventually we got
to a point

459
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:45,441
where worrying
about that

460
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:47,209
seemed less important

461
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:49,077
than enjoying the time
we have together,

462
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,813
even if that was
on a battlefield.

463
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:52,748
Oh, that's so sweet.

464
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,351
Also, getting divorced
helps.

465
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:14,269
Can I help you
with something?

466
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:15,871
Lyla Michaels.

467
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,272
Where can I find
your captain?

468
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:19,041
We're kind of
between captains

469
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:21,543
since our ex-mayor fired
the last one.

470
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,412
What's A.R.G.U.S.
doing here?

471
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:25,747
Investigating
Ricardo Diaz.

472
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:26,915
Never heard of him.

473
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,051
Well, be that as it may,

474
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,352
I'm gonna need to see your compstat
reports over the last 6 months.

475
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:32,221
Oh.

476
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:34,423
You do not want to make me
come back with a warrant.

477
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:36,358
Wait here.

478
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:47,936
You're on, Felicity.

479
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:51,507
All right. Locked on.
Give it a few minutes.

480
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:55,110
Data all seems intact,
Mr. Diaz.

481
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:59,014
We got a problem?

482
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:00,649
I'm not sure.

483
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:02,384
You better get sure.

484
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:05,454
Yes, sir.

485
00:25:05,456 --> 00:25:07,155
Guys, the encryption array,

486
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,057
it's Corto Maltesian
in origin.

487
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,126
What does that mean?

488
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:12,628
I mean, I don't know,
but if I was betting, financial records.

489
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,997
What if these are
all of Diaz's books,

490
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:16,465
everyone he has
on his payroll?

491
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:18,467
We could liberate
the city,

492
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:21,303
take down
his whole operation.

493
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:27,309
The data is being copied--
cloned, actually.

494
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:28,844
What?

495
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:30,812
It's happening onsite
somehow.

496
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:33,048
Some bitch from A.R.G.U.S.
is here.

497
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,484
She wants to look at our
compstat reports.

498
00:25:35,486 --> 00:25:37,553
No, she doesn't.

499
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:40,522
Lyla, we're done.
Grab the sniffer.

500
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:43,058
Agent Michaels, talk
to you for a minute?

501
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,827
They're on to us.

502
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:48,196
Forget the device.
Just get out of there!

503
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,972
Director Michaels,

504
00:25:56,974 --> 00:26:00,375
I heard you're
interested in me.

505
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:01,677
Honey...

506
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,712
You better get
in here.

507
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:08,016
Oh, frak it.

508
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:38,614
Hey.

509
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:40,716
Sorry, not sorry!

510
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:51,293
- Quick! Hurry.
- Ok.

511
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:58,637
That was an all-out
fight with the SCPD.

512
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:00,005
Totally nuts,
even by my standards.

513
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:01,607
Yeah, but it was
the only option.

514
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:03,509
I mean, this was
too important not to get.

515
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:05,511
How would you even know?
This is supposed to be encrypted.

516
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:07,379
Well, you can just call me an optimist
because I'm thinking

517
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:09,314
in 2-3 hours, all of us are
gonna be extremely happy.

518
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:11,016
Can you gather information
as it decrypts?

519
00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:12,518
It'd be nice to get
a jump on things.

520
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,053
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

521
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:15,854
This is an all-or-nothing
type deal, ok?

522
00:27:15,856 --> 00:27:17,589
We go in mid-decryption,
and the whole drive wipes.

523
00:27:17,591 --> 00:27:18,957
Nothing.

524
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,693
Felicity, may I speak
with you?

525
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,428
Yes.

526
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:33,651
I'm gonna just take
a wild guess and say

527
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,092
that this isn't one of
those conversations

528
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:36,893
that starts with, like,
"I love you. You were brave.

529
00:27:36,895 --> 00:27:38,461
You go. That was awesome."

530
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:40,129
No. This is
a conversation

531
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:41,797
that happens
because I love you.

532
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,199
Ok.

533
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:44,634
You promised me you
would stay put.

534
00:27:44,636 --> 00:27:46,469
Well, I didn't exactly
promise.

535
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:48,337
Fine. You promised
me you wouldn't do anything stupid.

536
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:50,173
You charged into
a firefight.

537
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:51,674
Which was a calculated risk.

538
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:54,844
Did you calculate how
close Ricardo Diaz came

539
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:56,479
to shooting you in
the back of the head?

540
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:57,647
We got what we wanted.

541
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:59,048
That's not--

542
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,318
And if I'm right,
what we wanted has

543
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,321
the list of everyone in
the city that Diaz controls.

544
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:10,359
This could help us get our
home back from Diaz, Oliver.

545
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:13,529
We could actually save
our city this time around.

546
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:15,164
I think that's a little bit
more important

547
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,699
than what ifs.

548
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:18,501
This is why I started
working alone again.

549
00:28:18,503 --> 00:28:20,469
Yeah. You know what?

550
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:21,971
I tried convincing myself
that that was the right move, too,

551
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:23,906
but it's not because
we're married

552
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:26,676
and we're supposed to be
each other's strength.

553
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:28,578
So there is no alone
for us anymore.

554
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,646
It's not that simple,
and you know it.

555
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:32,968
God. I'm really gonna
start needing you to see it that way.

556
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,460
Hey. What the hell are
you doing here?

557
00:28:44,462 --> 00:28:46,829
I heard Felicity might've got a hold
of Diaz's payroll,

558
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:48,497
so I hitched a ride
back with John.

559
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:50,166
I can help
with the decryption. Unh.

560
00:28:50,168 --> 00:28:52,168
Whoa, whoa, Curtis.
Hey, are you crazy?

561
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,703
You are in no shape
to be up and about.

562
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:55,705
A deranged madman
attacked everyone

563
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:57,106
I hold dear
and near to me.

564
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:58,708
I'll nap later.

565
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,110
He also made you
almost bleed out,

566
00:29:01,112 --> 00:29:03,713
so I need you to stop, ok?

567
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:06,015
Curtis...

568
00:29:06,017 --> 00:29:07,950
How is me resting gonna
help anything, Dinah?

569
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:10,953
Ok, but being reckless isn't
gonna help anything either.

570
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:13,055
He almost killed my man.

571
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:15,391
What do you expect
my reaction to be?

572
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:17,893
Exactly the same as mine.

573
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,595
I'm sorry. I...

574
00:29:19,597 --> 00:29:21,130
I wasn't thinking
about Vincent.

575
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:22,898
I'm so sorry, Dinah.

576
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Because you--you shouldn't
be thinking about Vincent.

577
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:26,902
You need to be thinking
about Nick.

578
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,472
Just please
don't go about this

579
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:33,643
the same way that I did,
Curtis, blind with rage.

580
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:36,145
Remember how you had
to talk me down?

581
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:38,814
I remember my advice
not really taking.

582
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:43,286
Yeah. But you're a lot
smarter than me.

583
00:29:43,288 --> 00:29:46,255
Look, Nick is lying
in a hospital bed right now.

584
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:48,691
If you don't take it easy,
you're gonna end up

585
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:50,259
right back in one.

586
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:51,661
We got this.

587
00:29:51,663 --> 00:29:53,162
Go be with him.

588
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,766
That's absurd.

589
00:29:56,768 --> 00:29:58,467
Why would I tip off
the Green Arrow

590
00:29:58,469 --> 00:29:59,969
only to save you from him?

591
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:01,604
You tell me.

592
00:30:01,606 --> 00:30:05,274
You're delusional.
You ought to be thanking me.

593
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:07,276
I hacked, and I
hacked, and I...

594
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:09,979
I--I back-traced where
Felicity Smoak took your cloned data.

595
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:11,647
We can get there
before she decrypts it.

596
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:14,950
Good work.

597
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:17,353
Call everyone.
We're going to war.

598
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:20,256
War? You've already
shot up two apartments

599
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:22,191
and a hospital to say
nothing about what happened

600
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:23,959
in your own police station.

601
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:25,027
Your point?

602
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:26,595
You're out of control

603
00:30:26,597 --> 00:30:28,531
and out of your depth,
Ricardo.

604
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:31,500
We accepted you into
the Quadrant because--

605
00:30:33,204 --> 00:30:35,771
So sorry.
I couldn't hear you.

606
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:38,541
You have something
stuck in your throat.

607
00:30:43,514 --> 00:30:45,381
Clean this up.

608
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:48,584
Felicity says that
the decryption is

609
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:50,353
only at about 40%.

610
00:30:50,355 --> 00:30:52,521
I'm sure she's working
as fast as she can.

611
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:54,190
I'm quite sure she is,

612
00:30:54,192 --> 00:30:55,991
but maybe we need to come up
with a backup plan

613
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:57,560
just in case this doesn't
pan out the way we think.

614
00:30:57,562 --> 00:31:01,430
I agree, and I'm open
to suggestions.

615
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:06,469
The first thing
is figuring out

616
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:08,471
what's going on
in your head.

617
00:31:08,473 --> 00:31:10,673
Yeah? What else
you guys talk about?

618
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:12,875
I may have
prodded her a bit.

619
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:15,311
But, Oliver,
I really didn't need to.

620
00:31:15,313 --> 00:31:17,546
Everyone could see
the tension between the two of you.

621
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:21,083
Well, John, I asked her
not to go into the field.

622
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:23,052
And she did.

623
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:25,354
And I'm sorry that she
thinks I'm changing the rules for her,

624
00:31:25,356 --> 00:31:27,523
but I am changing
the rules for her

625
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:29,358
because things
have changed.

626
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,926
William.

627
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:33,362
Well, Diaz's people
attacked us in our home,

628
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:36,966
sitting down for a meal
in our home,

629
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:40,336
so don't ask me to sit here and
pretend like things aren't different.

630
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:45,941
And you--you told me
that I had spread myself too thin,

631
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:48,010
and I listened
to what you said.

632
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:50,646
And I took it to heart,
and I made some changes.

633
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,649
She went into
the field tonight,

634
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,184
she split my focus,

635
00:31:55,186 --> 00:31:57,086
and it could've gotten
both of us killed.

636
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:58,888
- But it didn't.
- Well, it--

637
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,724
truth is you were there
for her tonight

638
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:06,028
the same way she's been
there for you as Overwatch.

639
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,432
And, look, when
I said that your focus was split,

640
00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:13,302
I didn't mean throwing
away everything and everyone

641
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:14,937
that gives you strength.

642
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:25,114
Diaz is here
with an army.

643
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:40,974
Oliver Queen doesn't
make it out alive!

644
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:48,329
- Tricelic gas is filling the building.
- This is Diaz.

645
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:51,623
His men breached the northeast entry.
Between that and the gas,

646
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:52,957
- we don't have a lot of time.
- Are there any other ways

647
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,270
- out of here?
- South corridor.

648
00:32:54,271 --> 00:32:55,870
There's a secret stairwell
that leads to street level.

649
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:57,172
If anything goes sideways,
Curtis rigged

650
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:59,207
the whole place
to go boom.

651
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,285
Let's hope it doesn't  come to that,
all right? We got to go--

652
00:33:01,286 --> 00:33:03,816
- not yet.
- Felicity, we have to go now.

653
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,717
The decryption is not done.

654
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:08,219
I'm not leaving until it's done.
Do not fight me on this.

655
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:10,255
Everyone else has to go.
We will catch up.

656
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,268
I'll cover you! Go!

657
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,829
Whoa!

658
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:53,698
Get out of here!
Go! Get out of here!

659
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,406
Get back!

660
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,648
Uh!

661
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:23,661
I had him, honey.
Let's go.

662
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:26,420
How much time
do we have?

663
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:27,046
5 minutes.

664
00:34:27,047 --> 00:34:28,412
We don't have
5 minutes, Felicity.

665
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:29,413
You have to get out of here.

666
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:31,215
No chance.

667
00:34:31,217 --> 00:34:32,583
Once this decryption's done,
I'm gonna email it to you

668
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:35,085
and basically
the entire world.

669
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:38,088
Hey, you ok?

670
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,823
This is our
last chance, Oliver.

671
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:41,892
This could be
our only chance to stop him.

672
00:34:41,894 --> 00:34:44,394
Let me try.
William needs you.

673
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:46,930
William needs us.

674
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:50,968
I'm gonna find
another way.

675
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:54,972
Come on.

676
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:57,307
How many flights
are there?

677
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:58,442
A lot.

678
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:08,952
Where's Oliver
and Felicity?

679
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:14,124
All right. We're almost
there, Felicity.

680
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:16,693
You can do this. Hey.

681
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:19,963
I got you. Up, up.

682
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,572
I was just
coming to kill you.

683
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:31,041
Looks like you met
me halfway.

684
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:44,021
What hurts more,
do you think,

685
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:47,824
killing her in front of you
or you in front of her?

686
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:50,694
Hyah!

687
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:57,668
You'll do anything to keep
her safe, won't you?

688
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:00,337
Love--

689
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:02,539
that's the real
king killer!

690
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,011
Click it.

691
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:18,255
Come on, Felicity.

692
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:31,001
Felicity, Oliver.
Let's get them out of here.

693
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,823
I'm so sorry about
your men, Lyla.

694
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:52,508
Bennet was a good soldier.
They all were.

695
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,443
We should go back.

696
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,345
I want to see
Diaz's body.

697
00:36:56,347 --> 00:37:00,315
I sent in
a forensics team.

698
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,719
He wasn't
there.

699
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,321
Son of a bitch
has 9 lives.

700
00:37:06,323 --> 00:37:07,956
I'm sorry.

701
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:11,593
Did Felicity finish
the decryption?

702
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:13,095
No.

703
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,932
No. She had to leave it.

704
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,901
Where does that put us?

705
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,337
Absolutely nowhere.

706
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,875
I know, buddy.
We miss you, too.

707
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,746
Well, it's gonna be
a few more days,

708
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,548
but we're...
We're safe, ok?

709
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,851
We're both safe.

710
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,920
Hey, we love you, William.

711
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,924
Bye, kiddo.

712
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,927
Is he ok? How's he doing?

713
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,428
He's ok.

714
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,297
He's scared,
but, you know,

715
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,599
he's safe and...

716
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,601
Just wants
all this to be over.

717
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,936
Yeah.

718
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,305
Don't we all?

719
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,776
Hey, I'm, uh...

720
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,646
I shouldn't have
pushed you away.

721
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:07,049
I should have trusted you

722
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,617
to keep yourself safe,

723
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,487
and I should have
trusted my abilities

724
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,755
to help keep you safe.

725
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:14,890
Thank you.

726
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,325
Yeah.

727
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,361
It's good to know
after all these years

728
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,762
that you can still
learn something.

729
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,632
Nah, I still have
a ways to go.

730
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,601
That's true.

731
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,772
So what now?

732
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,276
I have an idea.

733
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,315
Thank you for coming.

734
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:43,252
I asked you here

735
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:47,422
because we lost another
Quadrant member last night.

736
00:38:47,424 --> 00:38:52,427
See, I don't
mind partners...

737
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:55,297
When they're loyal.

738
00:38:55,299 --> 00:39:00,269
Turns out
Ms. Cassamento wasn't.

739
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:04,273
So what I have to decide
right now is

740
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:08,744
whether you two fall
into that same category.

741
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,345
You wanted
into Quadrant.

742
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:12,114
You are in.

743
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,316
This doesn't have to
be adversarial.

744
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:19,655
See, that's the thing--
me wanting in.

745
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,892
I always thought that
I wanted that,

746
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,895
and I realized...

747
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,498
It's just not enough.

748
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,134
You don't want
a partnership.

749
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,637
You want
a controlling stake.

750
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,376
Guilty.

751
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,983
Let's try this again. May I?

752
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:53,288
We have the Quadrant's
resources.

753
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,259
We got its muscle,
its connections.

754
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,899
All I need...

755
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,603
Is loyalty.

756
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,573
The Quadrant's running
out of members.

757
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,943
Do I have it?

758
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:33,528
So far Ricardo Diaz
has been unstoppable.

759
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,264
He has aligned himself
with the most powerful

760
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,000
criminal organization
in the country.

761
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,935
He controls Star City's
government,

762
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,105
its infrastructure,
and its police force.

763
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,743
I can't stop him
on my own.

764
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,714
And when you say you
can't stop him,

765
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,617
are you speaking as
the former mayor

766
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,719
or as someone else?

767
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:05,260
You want my help? I'm gonna
need two things from you.

768
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:10,265
The first is I'm gonna
need you to say the words.

769
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,969
I am the Green Arrow.

770
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,172
And the truth
shall set you free.

771
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:20,342
What's the second thing?

772
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:30,154
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==
<font color="#00FFFF">@elder_man</font>
