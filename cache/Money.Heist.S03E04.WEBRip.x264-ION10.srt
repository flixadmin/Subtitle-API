1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,080
No, no.
I am not getting inside there.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,830
Take the bottle.

3
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,326
That's a mousetrap.
We won't get out of there.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,793
That's our entrance.
We'll do it through hard work.

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,543
What the fuck is that smell?

6
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,416
They must have thrown
pesticide in there.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,750
Bleach and toxic substances for humans.
I'm not going in.

8
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,003
- It's just water.
- Yes, toxic water.

9
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,328
Sit down, come on.

10
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,376
I'll sit down, but I won't go in.

11
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,288
Let's go.

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,670
It's easier to train in a swimming pool,
but our job isn't in a fucking pool.

13
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,036
It will be a lot harder than this.

14
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,578
And way scarier
than getting in there.

15
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,418
I'm not afraid.

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,921
You're shitting your pants.

17
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,041
And it's because
you're a father now.

18
00:00:59,125 --> 00:00:59,995
Look.

19
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,745
I agree with you there, Bogotá.

20
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,078
You were so reckless before,
and you can't do that anymore.

21
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,378
In the past, when shit happened,
I was the only one fucked up by it.

22
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,328
You know that.

23
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,748
Now, I don't want to do
certain things.

24
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,633
For example,
getting inside a cistern.

25
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,538
I don't want to.

26
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,706
Do you know what it means
to be a good father?

27
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,460
I don't know anymore.

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,880
Behaving in the exact same way
when you weren't a father.

29
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:29,711
Of course, and leave the after-party
still high in the morning.

30
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:33,381
If you like to get high on Wednesdays,
you have to keep doing it.

31
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,076
Come on!

32
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,463
You have to,
or you will end up hating your son.

33
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,666
And that would really make you
a bad father. Believe me.

34
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,288
Oh, my God. Do you know
what you can do, Bogotá?

35
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,075
You can write a novel.

36
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:48,961
Yes.

37
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,171
How to be a father
without getting clean.

38
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,831
You don't have kids, do you?

39
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,381
I have seven.

40
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,921
The next one will come
with a prize.

41
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,916
This is Emilio, the oldest.
He lives in Venezuela. Julián, he's in DF.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,330
He is growing a mustache.
He calls me dude.

43
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,746
This bastard's a riot.
Erik, in Iceland.

44
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,956
Hanna, in Finland. Violinist.

45
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,173
She's a beauty.

46
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,328
Drazen in Montenegro.
He's fucking dull.

47
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,171
Yaris, in Thessaloniki,
a real character.

48
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,081
Ivanna.
Bad-tempered as hell,

49
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,206
but she's an artist.
She lives in Odessa.

50
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,080
Seven.

51
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,416
And the next one with a prize.

52
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,923
Sometimes I'm embarrassed for you.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,670
Hey!
I take care of all of them.

54
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,496
But I don't stop being me.

55
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,750
Do I go to their school plays

56
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,423
or the games of whatever sport
they play in Iceland?

57
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,080
No, I don't.

58
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,076
But I do randomly show up
after six months

59
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,956
and I don't ask them for anything.
Not even a hug or their love.

60
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,325
But they jump on me
and cover me with kisses.

61
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,246
Why?

62
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,075
I don't know why.

63
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,876
Because I'm their fucking father.

64
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,963
Their father.

65
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,128
You can't deny your own DNA.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,830
Never.

67
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,538
If you were a robber,
you're still one.

68
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,285
And if you used to risk your life,

69
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,575
keep risking it.

70
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,748
My babies, my babies...

71
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,211
Look what I brought.

72
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,670
A sweet set of earring for myself.

73
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,083
See?

74
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,168
Golden, golden! Sweet gold!

75
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,165
You want them for yourself,
don't you?

76
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,210
- Give them to me.
- Here, here.

77
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,831
You've never seen anything like it.

78
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,206
Let's go to work.

79
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:50,995
We're not done yet.

80
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,456
Open the door for Bogotá.

81
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,325
Come on.
The worst is in the past.

82
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,166
Now the fun begins.

83
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,630
You look hot in that neoprene.

84
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:08,881
What?

85
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,825
Your butt looks smoking hot
in that tight suit.

86
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,793
What's going to be real tight
is the skin from your balls.

87
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:15,881
Rude fuck.

88
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,325
I am not laughing.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,460
Why do you talk to me like that?

90
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,746
Why?

91
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,083
Here on this job,
I am your boss.

92
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,496
Yes, boss. I'm sorry.

93
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,253
Let's not disrespect each other.

94
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,956
Change the bottle!

95
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,633
And you...

96
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,288
Hurry up, come on!

97
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,461
I want those ovens working ASAP.

98
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,705
And the smoke extractors connected.

99
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,418
We're going to melt all the gold
from the fucking national reserve.

100
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,830
And you!
The lance and the bathyscaphe.

101
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:46,876
Absolute priority.

102
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,705
And don't ruffle my feathers again.

103
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:54,166
Hurry up, gentlemen!
Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

104
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,706
Enjoy yourselves!

105
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,128
Let's earn our sandwiches!
Come on!

106
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,245
The first time I heard
one could make fire underwater

107
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,923
was in the Monastery
of San Giovanni.

108
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,078
I thought it was as improbable
as the fact that I was there,

109
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,916
listening to Gregorian chants.

110
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,958
But when I was told it was possible thanks
to the oxygen bubbles covering the fire,

111
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,081
I thought it was a beautiful way
of blowing up what we went there for.

112
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,543
A safe in which no one could have gotten
into with all those gold bars.

113
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,003
They entered by impersonating the First
Squad of BRIPAC's Sixth Company.

114
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,083
The real one arrived a few
minutes later.

115
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,878
Well, fuck me...

116
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,541
They got us good.

117
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,791
They have everyone tapped.

118
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,915
We have to take out everything
that can be bugged.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Anything that can connect to
a network and our phones!

120
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,423
Colonel, let's think about it.
The procedure is to do a sweep.

121
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,830
They can't have everything bugged.

122
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,246
They can hijack whatever they want.
They have a billion euros!

123
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,170
Do you know the budget of UIT?

124
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,040
Sixteen million.
And the whole CNI?

125
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,875
282 million!
282 million against a billion.

126
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,578
They could tap into
the intern's phone!

127
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,286
We only have proof that
they've intercepted communications...

128
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,455
These guys even have pictures
of your dick, Ángel!

129
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,961
They even have pictures of that mole
you have on your balls.

130
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,041
Do you want to say hi?
I'm sure they have your mic activated.

131
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,625
Colonel Tamayo,
the usual procedure is to do a sweep.

132
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,540
Everyone, pay attention!

133
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,875
Don't turn on any device
that hasn't been

134
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,828
in a box for at least six months.
Not even an Olivetti.

135
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,746
There are no secure networks,
not even the army's or the ministry's.

136
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,883
Total blackout.

137
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,536
And I want all your phones
in this bin.

138
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,131
Now!

139
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,998
If you want to call your mommy,
go to a pay phone.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,330
In less than a minute,
we'll be blind and deaf.

141
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,416
Come on, your turn!

142
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,456
He has just fucked us up good.

143
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,251
He's skipping all the protocols.

144
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,628
It's illegal to confiscate phones
without a court order.

145
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,673
Damn!

146
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,750
This changes everything.

147
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,043
Our techs will analyze them
and return them to you

148
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,535
- as soon as possible.
- Let me think.

149
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,038
Antoñanzas,
didn't you hear me?

150
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,035
I'm deleting some private things.

151
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,455
It will only be 30 seconds, sir.

152
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,881
For God's sake!
We all know you're seeing Marisol.

153
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,420
Twenty seconds.

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,420
Alert level 5.
The CNI's security system is down.

155
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,710
The defense staff's been bugged
and the computers infected

156
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:40,831
with an unknown virus!

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,420
The last thing UIT is going to do
is read the chat you use to jerk off.

158
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,376
Give me your fucking phone!

159
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,418
For God's sake!

160
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,040
I want a screen with the time that's left
before the bank's security gates open.

161
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,125
Come on!

162
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,380
You!

163
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,785
Done.

164
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,538
The gauze.

165
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,495
Yes.

166
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,325
We're almost done.

167
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,380
Done.

168
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,461
Palermo.

169
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,246
Palermo, it's urgent.

170
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,753
Professor. It's Tokyo.

171
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,246
How is Palermo?

172
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,788
Operational, sir.

173
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,581
Listen. They've found out
we have them tapped.

174
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,576
We have to accelerate everything
and remain calm.

175
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,876
Calm?

176
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,208
You can be calm
because you're in the van.

177
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,251
We're surrounded by Spain's army here.
We don't know when they will enter.

178
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,630
We don't know
through which entrance.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,290
Has Bogotá started?

180
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,625
Yes.
He's been down there for a while.

181
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,825
Drilling that door will take longer
than an hour. Maybe more than two.

182
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,326
Professor,
how much time is left?

183
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,583
- Fourteen minutes.
- What?

184
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,583
He fucked us and he knows it.

185
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,173
I would try another move.

186
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,423
I even have doubts about Prieto.

187
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,830
But Tamayo is going to skip
all the protocols.

188
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,463
What does that mean?

189
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,540
It means they're going in as soon
as the doors are unlocked.

190
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,131
Good.

191
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,381
Then we have no option
but to use the dolphin. Right?

192
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,246
Exactly. Do you have it?

193
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,995
Yes.

194
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,961
Flipper is here with us.

195
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,630
Colonel, radiofrequency waves
are coming in and out of the bank.

196
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,246
Shortwave signals.

197
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,246
I want to hear them.

198
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,538
What the fuck is that?

199
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,043
It sounds like
an encrypted radio system.

200
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,580
Once inside,
the big question is...

201
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,458
How will we communicate
with each other?

202
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,580
Palermo.

203
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,631
Boom!

204
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,748
A bomb's just exploded.

205
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,418
We're all dead.

206
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,793
Laser sensors.
Technology is wonderful, isn't it?

207
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,923
Internet and hidden
or replicated IP addresses.

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,920
With the money we have, we could buy
a satellite in Kazakhstan.

209
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,711
But that would only take us
to one place.

210
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,581
The shittiest place.

211
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,128
You fight technology
with technology.

212
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,825
In this,
the government can win, but...

213
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,883
there's something
in which they can't compete with.

214
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,710
Time travel.

215
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,995
1941.

216
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,536
Made in England.

217
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,166
With these devices, the BBC broadcast
from Great Britain to the whole world.

218
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,788
Shortwave,
ladies and gentlemen.

219
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,206
No technology can inhibit such
a frequency. We'll talk through here.

220
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,423
Everyone could listen in
on us with that.

221
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,250
Yes, Nairobi. Every moron with
a walkie-talkie will be able to hear us.

222
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,713
But...

223
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,213
will they be able to
understand us?

224
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,830
Absolutely not.

225
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,668
Computer encodings.

226
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,753
In the broadcast
and in the reception as well.

227
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,423
These encodings won't be easy.

228
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,920
We will put in 2300 layers.

229
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,746
They can bring
200 million Chinese ballbusters,

230
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,253
and they'd still never
decode it.

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,880
Synchronization.

232
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,248
Monks.
Come Creator Spirit...

233
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,376
and in our hearts
take up Thy rest...

234
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,666
come with Thy grace
and heavenly aid.

235
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,376
We'll have them there...

236
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,460
erasing layer after layer.

237
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,503
Cursing our mothers.

238
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,498
A hundred brainiacs

239
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,173
who are desperate.

240
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,825
A waste of public funds
for nothing.

241
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,746
Because with every call we make,

242
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,078
we add 2300 more layers.

243
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,496
A call...

244
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,421
and a code.

245
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
A call...

246
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,325
and a code.

247
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,286
If it's a coded system,
then decode it!

248
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:30,495
Bring the whole tech research unit.
They have to start working now!

249
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,131
Very well.

250
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:39,248
In two minutes, I want everyone
with the vests and masks on.

251
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,536
We will give you guns too.

252
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,670
Fake guns.

253
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,915
Don't get too excited.

254
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,631
Amanda, right?

255
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,958
- I'm...
- Miguel.

256
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,171
You know my name?

257
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,245
Well, you told the robber before.

258
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,628
One day, I saved your Tupperware.
I don't know if you remember...

259
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,538
No.

260
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,455
I really don't.

261
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,958
Put the vests on now!

262
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,883
Come on,
things are going to get tough.

263
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,705
Don't put it on!

264
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,578
What?

265
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,626
Don't put it on.

266
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,501
You all,
don't put the vests on!

267
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,383
They want to use us
as human shields.

268
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,168
It's true.
Don't put it on.

269
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,878
We found him.

270
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,041
The smartest kid in class.

271
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,040
The overachiever.

272
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,495
- No, I am not.
- You aren't?

273
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,998
What's your name?

274
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,633
- Miguel, Miguel.
- Miguel, Miguel.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,250
Miguel, I'm Mr. Denver.

276
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, Mr. Denver.
I'm Miguel.

277
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,713
Miguel, do you like movies?

278
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,246
No, sir. I watch TV shows.

279
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,415
Get with the program,

280
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,210
because we're playing
Guess the Movie.

281
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,501
Put the vest on!

282
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:45,923
Give me that.

283
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,825
It's backwards, Miguel.

284
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,171
Good.

285
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,075
You're going to put
this on too.

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,330
If you don't,
I will hurt you.

287
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,536
Hurry up!

288
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,423
Good.

289
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,325
I am going to take seven steps.

290
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,333
Then I will shoot.

291
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,495
If you guess the movie
before I turn around,

292
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,713
maybe I won't shoot you.

293
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:10,996
Mr. Denver...

294
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,673
Miguel is a robot.

295
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,423
One.

296
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,538
Two.

297
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,923
Three. Okay, Miguel,
I will give you another clue.

298
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,880
I am also a robot.

299
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,166
Four.

300
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,575
WALL-E. It's WALL-E.

301
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,576
I come naked from the future,
Miguel.

302
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,706
- WALL-E.
- No, no, no.

303
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,706
- No.
- WALL-E?

304
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,625
Are you calling me WALL-E,
Miguel?

305
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,995
No, Mr. Denver.

306
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,213
Terminator.

307
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,833
I'm the Terminator.

308
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,043
Hasta la vista, baby.

309
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,540
The show is over!

310
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,955
Come on. Form two lines.

311
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,706
Quickly!

312
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,288
Come on.

313
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,038
Come on, the masks.

314
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,831
Put the vests and the masks on!

315
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,165
Who the fuck forgot
to turn off their phone?

316
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,380
I'm sorry, it's mine.

317
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,826
HIDDEN NUMBER

318
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,495
Yes?

319
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,171
Good morning, Colonel Prieto.
I'm the Professor.

320
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,673
I hope you're feeling better.

321
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,880
Hello, Professor.

322
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,125
I'm sorry for taking you away
from the dentist in such a way.

323
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,878
I hope I'm not bothering
you too much.

324
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,581
You are never a bother, Professor.

325
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,080
Colonel, help me,
because I'm a little bit confused.

326
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,495
Are you in charge of the operation?

327
00:16:58,916 --> 00:16:59,956
Or is it Tamayo?

328
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,378
Colonel Tamayo speaking.

329
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,500
From now on, I'm in charge.

330
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,631
It's a pleasure to meet you.

331
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,538
NEGOTIATION

332
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,920
On this occasion, we'll be the ones
making the calls. Never them.

333
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,920
And we'll do it with phones,
but they won't be able to track our calls.

334
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,463
Why?

335
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,535
Because we're going
to travel to the past.

336
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,415
I had that one for five years
and I only had to charge it once.

337
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,380
Second-generation phones.

338
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,498
No Internet and
especially no GPS.

339
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,793
With these phones, we will
only make one call. Only one,

340
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,631
no more,
to an external collaborator.

341
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,291
- Marseille.
- What? The mute guy isn't coming?

342
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,375
- I'm not mute.
- Like your rat that makes these sounds.

343
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,495
It isn't a rat.

344
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,793
Her name is Sofía.

345
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,748
Marseille will have two terminals.

346
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,830
On the first one,
he will receive my call.

347
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,456
On the second one,

348
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,881
he will call the only number
in the telephone's contacts.

349
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,958
Colonel Prieto's.

350
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,920
These two phones will be
our firewalls.

351
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,711
Archaic.

352
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,786
Rudimentary.

353
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,038
But efficient.

354
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:31,381
The police can pinpoint the phone
that's emitting the signal

355
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,498
when the call is being made,
and only then.

356
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,921
There's no technology
capable of tracking

357
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,880
two mobile phones stuck
together in a box

358
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,078
that are constantly on the move.

359
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,628
Besides, without GPS

360
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,918
or Internet,
the only thing

361
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,670
they will have is the antenna

362
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,750
that connects to that phone
when the call is placed.

363
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,170
An antenna that's located

364
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,996
in the center of Madrid.

365
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,958
Right under their noses.

366
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,496
That's the only thing
they will have.

367
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,293
That means...

368
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,956
they have nothing.

369
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,711
I'm sorry,
but we don't know each other,

370
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,421
so I would like to ask
you a question.

371
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,128
Are you in love?

372
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:17,581
I've been married for more than 17 years,
something uncommon nowadays.

373
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,166
That's the irrefutable
proof of my love,

374
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,078
- Professor.
- Yes. I see.

375
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,498
However, and excuse me again,
I don't think you are.

376
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,418
Because when someone is in love,
life becomes rose-tinted.

377
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,080
Everything looks beautiful
and one turns into a kind of teddy bear

378
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,536
that smiles constantly.

379
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,290
Someone in love doesn't shout

380
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,455
or insult his coworkers so rudely.
That's why I asked.

381
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,955
I know you've been listening to us,
you piece of shit.

382
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,246
Colonel,

383
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,916
think about the last time
you made love.

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,040
Look, Professor, you can go to hell
with these bullshit conversations.

385
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,791
Colonel, you've just joined us,
so allow me to remind you what

386
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,665
the first lines of CNI's handbook
say about hostage negotiations.

387
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:05,960
They literally say, listen attentively
to understand the kidnapper's psychology.

388
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,381
Show empathy towards them
and let them know

389
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,628
that you understand
their feelings.

390
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,171
Do you know what?

391
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,665
I think you're blind
and deaf now.

392
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,210
That's why Prieto's phone rang a second
before he was going to leave.

393
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,915
I'm starting to think
you're really screwed, Professor.

394
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,628
This isn't the paradisal island
where you probably spent your days

395
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,538
after the Royal Mint robbery,
am I right?

396
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,875
How did the escape go?

397
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,825
How is Murillo?

398
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,293
Hello, Colonel Tamayo.

399
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,631
Colonel Prieto.

400
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,920
Ángel.

401
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,458
I imagine you're also
there listening.

402
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,421
Okay, do you have them there?
Don't lose them.

403
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,750
Hello, Raquel. How are you?

404
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,041
We miss you here in the tent.

405
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,631
Thank you.

406
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,538
And I'm sorry for leaving like that,
without a goodbye.

407
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:09,788
How are you?

408
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,711
Well, you know me.

409
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,575
I always keep fighting.

410
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,001
And how is Mari Carmen?

411
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,455
Mari Carmen...

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,830
She left me.

413
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,826
It took her too long,
don't you think?

414
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,786
I'm very sorry, Ángel.

415
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,626
Colonel, the antenna is
on Princesa Street.

416
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,290
Fuck me! They're so close.

417
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,376
Raquel,
what the fuck are you doing?

418
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,288
You're throwing your life away.

419
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:39,996
Look...

420
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,248
This is my new life.

421
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,918
And do you know what?

422
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,580
It's a thousand times better
than the previous one.

423
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,083
Do you think
you're living in a movie?

424
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,918
Listen, Raquel.

425
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,460
Movies end, and not always
with a happy ending.

426
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,788
You know I'm going to go after you,
don't you?

427
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,665
That's nothing new.

428
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,883
You've always chased me.

429
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,753
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Colonel, are you still there?

430
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,540
Listen, I am going to call you
in one hour.

431
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,955
By then, I will have released
five hostages.

432
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,711
This time, we'll do things right.

433
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:22,711
In an hour, I will be smoking a cigar
in your name in the governor's office.

434
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,211
Colonel, I'm recording
this conversation.

435
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,541
It sounds like you don't care
about the hostages.

436
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:32,575
If it's recorded, I am going to give you
some advice, so you won't forget it.

437
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,036
Take your mask,
your machine gun,

438
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,125
and get ready.

439
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,878
Because all hell's going to break
loose on your heads.

440
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,463
What do we know
about that phone?

441
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,501
They must have made
the call from an old phone.

442
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,713
It was impossible to access
its geolocation,

443
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,831
but the conversation connected
with two antennas.

444
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,916
On Princesa and Callao.

445
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,208
What does that mean?

446
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,961
It could be because there's a high
concentration of people in the area

447
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,461
or they've been on the move.

448
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:07,998
Are you telling me that they were
on a walk while they were talking to us?

449
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:12,455
I want all available units deployed
and checking everyone's IDs.

450
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,211
Colonel, we're talking about more
than 400,000 people.

451
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,076
People must be spending
the bills they threw.

452
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:23,075
And the absence of background noise may
mean they weren't calling from the street.

453
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,960
Maybe it's a basement
or the metro tunnels.

454
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,541
It's impossible
to know for sure.

455
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:08,538
Four hours.

456
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,826
Look at you,
you look so innocent like this.

457
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,626
I want a son like this one.

458
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,080
And these guys?

459
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,416
- What the hell are they doing?
- I don't know.

460
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,535
I think they're breaking records.

461
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,206
Let me tell you,
I think he has to be really weird

462
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,171
as a boyfriend.

463
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,625
What's wrong?

464
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,246
Nothing.

465
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,673
You're having
second thoughts, don't you?

466
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,290
Do you want to turn back?

467
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,416
We need to perfect...

468
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,080
the plan.

469
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,706
At least, for...

470
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,173
four months.

471
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,331
- Four months?
- Four months.

472
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,745
What are you going to say
to Tokyo?

473
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,923
That the next time she sees Rio,
he'll be a vegetable?

474
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,920
We can't help Rio

475
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,378
with a plan that doesn't work.

476
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,535
It doesn't work?

477
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,625
We've studied it together.
It's a perfect plan.

478
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,168
No, it isn't. It isn't.

479
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,916
Do you know
what's wrong with you?

480
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,915
You've become an egomaniac.

481
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,210
You don't trust the plan
because it isn't yours.

482
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,541
It's your brother's plan,
but he did trust you.

483
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,325
Why did you want to join

484
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:38,961
the robbery so badly?

485
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,921
Why are you so anxious
about it?

486
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,330
You're like those people
who quit smoking

487
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:49,206
and then start hating tobacco
and the smoke and people who smoke,

488
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:51,541
and they become the biggest
Taliban against tobacco.

489
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,415
That's happening to you
with the police.

490
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,791
You hate the police
because they destroyed your life,

491
00:25:56,875 --> 00:26:00,125
because they tried
to take your daughter away,

492
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,378
because there's an arrest warrant
issued against you

493
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,418
and you want revenge,
revenge.

494
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:08,416
And you aren't thinking
about Tokyo, Rio or Berlin.

495
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,630
You're thinking about yourself.
And if that's the case,

496
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:13,578
then I don't think
you should be part of the plan.

497
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,876
I need more time.

498
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,921
Get better,
I will take care of this.

499
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,670
- Hello.
- This way, please.

500
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,670
Of course.

501
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,628
At your service, inspector.

502
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,131
You know them.

503
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:21,463
In the absence of Fonollosa, alias Berlin,
who do think could've taken charge?

504
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:25,786
Why?

505
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:27,995
What do you mean?

506
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,043
Why do you care?

507
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
If we kill
whoever is in charge first,

508
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,828
we may not have to kill
all of them.

509
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,293
Did I answer you?

510
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,790
Denver.

511
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,923
No doubt. He's the most seasoned.
Moscow's son.

512
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,080
- Denver. Believe me.
- Are you sure?

513
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,456
Absolutely.
I know them well.

514
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,001
Look,
Helsinki is a war criminal.

515
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,040
He only knows how to obey orders.

516
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,000
Nairobi.

517
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:06,253
Nairobi staged a coup inside the Mint
and took power from Fonollosa.

518
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,043
The Professor would never
put her in charge.

519
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,670
And Tokyo?

520
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,830
Tokyo...

521
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,630
She's too unstable.

522
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,208
Hot-blooded. It was her fault
that Moscow died. No.

523
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,833
Tokyo couldn't be
in charge of anything.

524
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,668
Listen to me. It's Denver.

525
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:23,705
Denver.

526
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,381
What was that?

527
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,960
To see if you would come
talk to me.

528
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:47,881
Look. It worked.

529
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,500
You're not fine, Denver.

530
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:53,631
I know.

531
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,245
I know I'm not fine,
but not because...

532
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:59,213
all that shit you told me
about being sexist and all that.

533
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:00,831
It's something else.

534
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:11,381
Hey.

535
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,538
What's wrong?

536
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:19,995
Come on, tell me.

537
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,666
- I know how this ends.
- No.

538
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,793
- No, this doesn't end in any way.
- They killed my father.

539
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:29,628
And you know it.

540
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,211
And it happened because she

541
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,671
wanted a grand entrance
with a motorcycle. Right, Tokyo?

542
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:39,881
He was a good man.

543
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:44,423
And he acted like a father in front
of 200 policemen with an M16 and no vest.

544
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,331
And they killed him.

545
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,210
Do you know what I'm saying?

546
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:52,826
If you're here,

547
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,671
the same will happen to me,
because I am not cold-blooded.

548
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,580
If I have to stand in the line of fire
to protect you, I will.

549
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,673
I don't care.

550
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,376
Because you're my family, Mónica.

551
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:06,958
You're my family.

552
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,711
And that's why
I didn't want you here.

553
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:13,576
Do you understand?

554
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,415
Step.

555
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,081
Step, step. Sorry.

556
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,495
Well, I will take
care of the Browning.

557
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,790
Very well, Helsinki.
Good luck.

558
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,208
Let's go inside.

559
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,830
You too.

560
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,751
You don't know
what you're doing.

561
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,998
As soon as I touch
the door of that chamber,

562
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,173
the security system
will flood it in a few minutes.

563
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:07,041
It will be flooded?
No.

564
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,535
More than 100,000 liters of water
will crush you.

565
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,825
More than 100,000 liters of water,
Nairobi.

566
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:12,876
Did you hear?

567
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,536
I hope you took a course
on snorkeling.

568
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,793
You're wrong if you think
you're dealing with an idiot.

569
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,830
I know where you're taking me.

570
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:22,538
And why.

571
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,625
And let me tell you,

572
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,206
I won't do it.

573
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:33,881
Let's go.

574
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,958
Put this on right now.

575
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:41,881
Please.

576
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,246
Ma'am.

577
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,378
Get out of line.

578
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,708
No, I can, I can.
My hands are strong.

579
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,130
Ma'am.

580
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,038
Get out of line, please.

581
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,416
And the rest of you,
keep working!

582
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,503
Thank you.

583
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:44,166
Tokyo.

584
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,788
I watched the other robbery,
glued to the TV.

585
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,626
I know you all.

586
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:54,673
Sit down.

587
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,500
Helicopters, take off.

588
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:08,788
Now.

589
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,380
Come on, come on, come on.

590
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,458
Hurry up with those sacks.
Don't stop.

591
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,418
If something goes wrong,

592
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,828
then we will find ourselves
in the worst-case scenario.

593
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:32,876
In which they will start the assault
before we can open

594
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,328
that little door.

595
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:37,996
And opening that door would take
a lot longer than the first one.

596
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,253
And only he could do this.

597
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,213
A minimum of two hours.

598
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,211
Two hours.

599
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:50,421
If we haven't opened it
before they enter, then...

600
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:52,833
We're dead.

601
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,416
But we have a solution.

602
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,830
There's always a solution.

603
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,458
We have this small baby.

604
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,423
A dolphin.

605
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,665
Well, we didn't have more divers.

606
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,211
We're calling him Flipper.

607
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:06,826
Do you remember Flipper?

608
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,790
The trained dolphin that clapped.

609
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,578
He saved lives too.

610
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,746
If necessary,
he will have to save ours.

611
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,713
The governor of the Bank of Spain
is the only one who can open that door

612
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:18,921
in three seconds.

613
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,131
With this button,
we balance the jacket's buoyancy.

614
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:29,828
I will do it. Don't press it
or you will end up stuck on the ceiling.

615
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:30,786
Hey!

616
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,325
Are you here with us?

617
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,956
We have an emergency respirator.

618
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,461
Hopefully,
we won't need to use it.

619
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,673
Hey, look at me.

620
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,713
Look at me!

621
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,793
Once inside,
you'll notice the change of pressure.

622
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,210
Don't get scared and above all,
don't stop breathing.

623
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,291
Yes, but we have a problem.

624
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,628
He won't do it.

625
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,205
His entire biography
says he has principles.

626
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,671
Everyone has principles.

627
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,380
The governor has to ask himself,
what's more important,

628
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,293
my principles

629
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:07,455
or my life?

630
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,710
We're running out of time.

631
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:12,881
Let's go, let's go.

632
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,580
Governor, any questions?

633
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,083
I'm not going in.

634
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,830
I think you are.

635
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:22,536
- Get into the bathyscaphe. Now.
- Now.

636
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,205
Assault teams in position.

637
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,541
Armored units waiting.

638
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:26,996
Gentlemen,

639
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,713
two minutes and thirty seconds.

640
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,705
Okay. Hasta-la-vista-Baby's line
follows Stockholm.

641
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:36,961
The rest come with me.

642
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,081
You heard her.
Come on, fast.

643
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,036
Fast!

644
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,125
Fast!

645
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,918
Come on, come on, come on.

646
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,210
To the end of the room.

647
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,745
- Fast.
- Come on, come on.

648
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,253
If I put your mask on myself,

649
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,923
you won't be able to take if off
for the rest of your fucking life.

650
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:58,076
Put it on, Governor, put it on.

651
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,205
No?

652
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,251
- Free diving then. Go.
- Release me!

653
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,036
I'm not going in.

654
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,538
He is 60 years old...

655
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,875
- And has coronary heart disease.
- Well, man...

656
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,168
better for us.

657
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,460
Exactly, the coronary heart disease,

658
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,461
the bathyscaphe,
the 20 atmospheres...

659
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:21,131
Just thinking about all that will
give him an astonishing lucidity.

660
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,748
This whole plan depends
on the decision of a man.

661
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,713
And I'm pretty sure
he will decide not to do it.

662
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:30,631
Do you know when he will have
his ultimate moment of lucidity?

663
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,423
Once he gets into
that flooded chamber

664
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,083
and realizes he can't escape.

665
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:41,503
Once he decides his life depends
on us opening that door...

666
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:44,961
or closing off his oxygen.

667
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:48,381
Sergio, if you had to choose between
your decency and your oxygen,

668
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,498
what would you pick?

669
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,710
He won't go inside.

670
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,208
He will.

671
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,753
We'll have to push him
a little bit...

672
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,288
but he will.

673
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:01,785
You fucked it up, peanut.

674
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,075
Matías, the bolt cutters.

675
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,415
They cut so fucking well.

676
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,460
Tell me the code
or you will count bills

677
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,541
with your fucking stumps.

678
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,418
Fuck, Governor.

679
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,670
What a brave idiot.

680
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,923
- Oh, my God!
- Denver!

681
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:26,753
Denver,
what the fuck did you do?

682
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,293
For God's sake!
Someone tell me what's happening!

683
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:30,923
Grab this.

684
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,746
Governor.

685
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,168
Governor, Mario.

686
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,080
Mario.

687
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,036
Fuck me! Fuck's sake!

688
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:38,753
What's up, Nairobi?

689
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,920
He lost consciousness.

690
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,920
For God's sake!

691
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,331
One hundred thirty beats.
He's going to suffer a heart attack.

692
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,666
- How much time do we have left?
- One minute and 20 seconds.

693
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:48,788
That much?

694
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,833
Matías, the first-aid kit and the staples.
We have to close the wound.

695
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:53,876
- Quickly!
- Denver!

696
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:55,378
Cover his wound, fuck!

697
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:56,538
OK, OK.

698
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,206
Hurry up, Denver!

699
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,496
What if, for any reason,

700
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:06,131
he decides not to open
that door?

701
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,705
There are always risks.

702
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,631
Brother, please.

703
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,288
What would life be
without risks?

704
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,170
Brother,
that's what makes life exciting.

705
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,460
If something goes wrong,

706
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,633
we will always have the C-4.

707
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:23,881
Bogotá.

708
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:26,875
Be careful, brother.

709
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,423
Go, go, go.

710
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,626
Come on, without fear.
Fuck! Without fear.

711
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,958
Fast, fast, fast!

712
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:43,001
Pulse at 150.
This guy is going to explode.

713
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,043
C-4 inside there?

714
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,535
Also called RDX,

715
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:47,995
or popularly known as
plastic explosive.

716
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,083
You're crazy!

717
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,666
Well, it's unpredictable.

718
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,210
Uncouth, even, but exciting.

719
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,331
Even the river is going
to tremble.

720
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,628
Gentlemen, we're going in.

721
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,083
We know the priority target,

722
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,666
but we have the green light to fire on
any member of the gang.

723
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:12,745
The presence of at least
a hundred hostages is confirmed.

724
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,833
Blocked-off streets and the whole
country looking at the Bank of Spain.

725
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:19,576
A special operations unit
has been deployed

726
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:23,626
and armored cars and assault vehicles
have been seen driving around.

727
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:27,288
And for a few minutes ago, helicopters
have been heard overhead as well.

728
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,671
Ten milligrams of diazepam.

729
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,080
For fuck's sake!

730
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,246
Come on!

731
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,043
Come on. Okay.

732
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:47,785
A blast wave at 50 meters
underwater,

733
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:52,075
liberating a pressure of 40 atmospheres,
not even God knows what can happen there.

734
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:57,126
Denver, remind me to beat you up
as soon as this ends.

735
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,748
Fucking idiot!

736
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,581
A small big bang,
but that's how life starts.

737
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,575
No, it isn't going down.
Give me another.

738
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,496
Please! Please!

739
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,786
Okay, okay.

740
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:42,246
It's true that it could damage
part of what's inside the safe,

741
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,793
but it will open it for sure.

742
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,080
God!
