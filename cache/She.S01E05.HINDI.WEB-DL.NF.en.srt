1
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,280
Sir, do you remember
when three years ago in Mumbai,

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,920
there was a gang war

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,720
between all the drug dealers.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,520
All of them were shooting down each other.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,280
The police killed the ones who survived.

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,120
Some of the policemen were awarded
with medals, some lost their jobs.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,640
Why did all that happen?

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,240
Not because the police
wanted to eradicate the drug business.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,280
But because, Nayak wanted this.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,200
He foresaw that Mumbai
could be the drug capital of Asia.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,200
The supply chain would begin from here

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,720
and reach every corner of Asia.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,520
Ten times more than before.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,520
Millions of new users would get a chance
to get addicted to cocaine and heroin.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,800
So, the old drug business and the new
drug market would have only one king.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,320
Nayak!

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,360
This was Nayak's five-year plan, sir.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,200
The entire operation...
rests on a network of 365 people.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,320
That's 365, like the days in a year.

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,320
Everyone is delegated a particular duty.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,960
And in the chain,

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,000
each person knows only the person
ahead of him and behind him.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,160
So, if anyone is caught
or becomes a witness,

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,640
police could never reach Nayak.

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,160
That is why, everyone thinks
Nayak does not exist.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,720
That's how it is.

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,160
But he is the only ace in the game.

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,560
Rest all are his slaves.
Supplier, shooter,

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,440
investor, transporter, politician,
police, everyone.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,480
How many policemen are involved?

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Only 52.

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,640
Like, that's the number of weeks
in a year.

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
They have only one job.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,400
To keep the warehouses
and supplier routes clear.

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,520
So that the consignments
can pass through easily.

36
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,560
And how many warehouses are there?

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,880
-I told you, sir, 12.
-Like, months in a year.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,680
This is how he has designed
the plan like a year.

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,320
<i>Sir, we got a random check done at the
warehouse locations mentioned by Sasya.</i>

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,000
None of the information
has been proved wrong till now.

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,040
<i>We have to raid all these locations
at the same time.</i>

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,560
Nayak should not get any warning.

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,840
Yes, sir. For now,
only the core team has this information.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,160
Mathur, we can't repeat the Karwar case.

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,480
If we let Nayak escape this time too,

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,760
he will come back years later
with another dangerous plan.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
-We have to look about it.
-Yes, sir. I understand.

48
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,480
This is where Bhumi comes in, sir.

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,640
Because Nayak does not share
his entire plan with everyone.

50
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,520
He keeps certain things only in his mind.

51
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,640
Nayak's mind is...

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,120
like a horse that keeps galloping.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,760
If I stay with him
for a while longer, I feel tired.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,400
That's how he is. He gets very tired too.

55
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,560
So, for some relaxation...

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,680
he picks up girls.

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,360
I mean, sluts.

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,120
His time-table is so bad,
who else will he find?

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,640
When he spends a night with a girl,

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,000
he feels as if he's normal like us.

61
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,760
He turns his brain off...

62
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,040
and just relaxes.

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,520
There is only one way to reach him.

64
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,240
Girl!

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,520
You want me to trust you?

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Sir, we've met just now.
So, you don't trust me.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,360
You wait and see,
slowly you will learn to trust me.

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,280
Write down the name!

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,839
I know his taste.

70
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,120
The kind of girls he likes.

71
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
He'll definitely like my girlfriend.

72
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,840
Mark my words.

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,680
Should we become pimps, you bastard?

74
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,040
Sir...

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,280
You did not nab me at a temple either.

76
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,400
I am just taking your plan forward.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,840
We've interrogated three policemen
from Nayak's network.

78
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
Their records
match with Sasya's information.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,360
But don't arrest them now.
Or Nayak will know.

80
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,040
We'll take action
only after this operation is over.

81
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,960
Yes, sir.

82
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,200
I've asked the three of them
to report on duty regularly.

83
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
But we're watching them.

84
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,840
Only Nayak knows the landing
and delivery date of drugs.

85
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,760
He will tell others
only after fixing everything.

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,200
Now, it's time for Nayak to enter Mumbai.

87
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Okay?

88
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,920
She's as hot as her photo, right?

89
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,240
She's hotter, buddy.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,160
And my little fellow...
is craving her warmth today.

91
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,800
It's a wonderful night.

92
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
Come.

93
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Here.

94
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,200
Come on.

95
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,080
What are you doing?

96
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,800
This is just a short interval
in our story, sweetheart.

97
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,040
Don't think this is the climax.

98
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,600
Do you like this?

99
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm sure you can feel my happiness, right?

100
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,960
I told Fernandez sir,
not to tell you anything.

101
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,800
If those guys downstairs get the slightest
doubt, they'll bury the two of us here.

102
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,640
Patience always pays, honey. Come.

103
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,080
We have to go down now
and tell a different story. Come.

104
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,320
Everything is in control.

105
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,280
Sasya is doing exactly what he said.

106
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
No surprises.

107
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,680
Yet... the next part is tricky.

108
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Let's hope Sasya manages
to convince his men.

109
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Drop her back.

110
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,640
What happened, sir?

111
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,280
-You were craving her just now.
-Yes, I still am.

112
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
But I would have committed a sin.

113
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,640
Do you know what kind of a girl she is?

114
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
She is the kind our boss likes.

115
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
He would love to have her.

116
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,880
He wanders on the streets
to find a girl like her.

117
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,240
Sir...

118
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,360
Drop her back on the road. If he finds
her one day, he'd pick her up.

119
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Who knows when boss will come.

120
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,480
And when he does, who knows
whether he will pick her up or no.

121
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,440
What if he does?

122
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,800
I don't want a war
between two brothers because of a girl.

123
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,320
If he picks her up, good,
otherwise let it be.

124
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,160
-Draupadi, you please go.
-Okay.

125
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,360
As soon as boss comes,
we'll take him to her.

126
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,240
Now we know where to pick her up from.

127
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,680
Do what you want.
You want to please the boss, whatever...

128
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
But don't tell me. Go.

129
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,400
Come, madam. We'll drop you back
at the same place.

130
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Okay, sister.

131
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,720
Good night.

132
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,680
<i>I'm bad, I'm bad I'm really really bad</i>

133
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,680
<i>Come, baby and dance</i>

134
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,640
Why didn't you tell me
that Sasya would meet me today?

135
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,800
Sasya told you why, right?

136
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
He knew everything, but I did not.

137
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,200
Bhumi, you come to the base.
Then we'll talk about it.

138
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,000
Sasya harasses you. I know.

139
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,240
Sir, I don't know
what he told you about me.

140
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,760
He told me the truth.

141
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,280
Bhumi, if Sasya respects any woman,
it's you.

142
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Why would he respect me? What for?

143
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,120
You are uncomfortable with him. I know.

144
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,960
But he wants
to make you feel uncomfortable.

145
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,520
He wants to overpower me.

146
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,720
When I saw you at traffic duty
for the first time,

147
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,520
you were standing in one corner,
very quiet.

148
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,360
Even then, I could clearly see
that you were a powerful girl.

149
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,800
That there was something special in you.

150
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,280
That is why, you've been chosen
for this special operation, Bhumi.

151
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,800
This Sasya is not the problem.

152
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,640
We are done with him.

153
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,800
But now, Nayak's about to come.

154
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
And we don't know what he is capable of.

155
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,840
You need to start
mentally preparing for Nayak now.

156
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,520
That's your job.

157
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,920
-I am going.
-Hey, wait. Where are you going?

158
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,320
-Give me a kiss before you go.
-Move!

159
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,680
No one is seeing us. Kiss me.

160
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,040
-Get lost. Got it?
-Now you get lost.

161
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,880
-Give the phone.
-No, I won't.

162
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,160
-Give me.
-Kiss me.

163
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,760
-Give me the phone.
-Kiss me, I say.

164
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,120
Why are you doing this?
Okay, keep the phone with you.

165
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,280
What is it?

166
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,080
The lipstick is spreading
outside your lips.

167
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,920
I'm doing that purposely.

168
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,160
Men like it that way.

169
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
It looks cheap.

170
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,680
Will you teach me what looks cheap?

171
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,680
If you know so much,
go and try on your husband.

172
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,440
He is dying to have sex with me.

173
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,480
That rascal says that if I agree
to sleep with him, he'll divorce you.

174
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,880
Mom is very smart.

175
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,720
She started coughing at the right time.
Mom, drink some water.

176
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,480
What time is your shift tomorrow?

177
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,920
Mom, I am on night shift these days.

178
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,960
Mom, how did your coughing stop?

179
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,840
You didn't drink a drop of water.

180
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,680
Is there still some stress at work?

181
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
There's always some stress, Mom.

182
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
But good things are also happening.

183
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,680
Excuse me,
do you have change for Rs. 2000?

184
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,400
Are you one of Mr. Anand's girls?

185
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
I don't do business in this area.

186
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,760
I just came here for some tea. Thank you.

187
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,520
Hey, hello. Come here.

188
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,800
-No.
-Why not?

189
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I am on break.

190
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,040
What? On break?

191
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Stop this drama, tell me your rate.

192
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,920
Tell me.

193
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,760
A tea.

194
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,040
One more day went by!

195
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,119
Where did the time go? It ran away again!

196
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,800
Catch it. Catch it, I say!

197
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,160
I will punish it
for not following my orders.

198
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,400
Bring it to my court.

199
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,200
Mhatre...

200
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,720
Is this all
we're supposed to do every night?

201
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,760
I feel less like a policeman
and more a watchman.

202
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,359
Why don't you tell Fernandez sir then?

203
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,440
I am here because
he requested me personally.

204
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
And you... your parade every day.

205
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,880
What's the point?

206
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,200
You enjoyed all this, didn't you?

207
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,600
Are you enjoying it now?

208
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,960
What?

209
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,880
I get a salary, so, I'm happy with it.

210
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,840
Pull over the car.

211
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,120
Where do you want to go now?

212
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,600
I'll see you at the base. Stop the car.

213
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,760
Come on, hurry up.

214
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Stop!

215
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Yes, ma'am?

216
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,400
Hello... Excuse me...

217
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,280
She is with me.

218
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,120
Close the door as you leave.

219
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,320
What are you doing here?

220
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,960
Go back.

221
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,600
Go.

222
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,960
A little more.

223
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,000
I was clicking your photograph.

224
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,560
To show Rupa.

225
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,120
You can only see...

226
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,160
not show.

227
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,200
Okay.

228
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,680
Then you show me.

229
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,040
You won't be able to take
more than this, in the first time.

230
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,840
I'll try, to take more.

231
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,240
You keep trying.

232
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,160
I'll pray that your lucky day comes soon.

233
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
-Where did you get this from?
-Keep it.

234
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,720
Did you meet Hemant?

235
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,040
How did you get this?

236
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,360
Not the way he asked you to give it.

237
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,320
Why did you meet Hemant?

238
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,760
I told you to stay away from him.

239
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,680
I am not interested in meeting him.

240
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,280
I did that for you.

241
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,480
To get a phone,
you need not give him anything more.

242
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,080
It's not that cheap!

243
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,920
Look, that's our personal matter.

244
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,840
Don't come between my boyfriend...

245
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,040
He isn't anybody's boyfriend.

246
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,920
Hey... first, you get a divorce
from your husband.

247
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,080
If you have enough guts,
don't send me to sleep with him.

248
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,160
To get your work done.

249
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,480
You're trying to teach me!

250
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,600
-I told you, you need not go there.
-Well, fine.

251
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,240
I'll handle it.

252
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,080
Exactly as we planned, sir.

253
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,840
Sasya has gone back into his gang.

254
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,320
And we're tracking every move of his.

255
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,840
You remember all the instructions,
don't you?

256
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,800
There won't be a single moment
when we're not tracking you.

257
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,040
Sir, don't you trust me yet?

258
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,120
I thought, we've come close now.

259
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,400
Don't worry, we'll keep you close.

260
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,760
If you go away even for a second...

261
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,400
we'll shoot you.

262
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,480
I know you will definitely
double-cross us.

263
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,920
You may only shoot me sir.

264
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,440
But do you know what Nayak will do to me,
if he learns about this?

265
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,760
He'll slit my throat.

266
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,440
He'll cut me like a goat,
and let my blood flow in the gutter.

267
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,000
So, no matter what you say,
now I'm scared of only him.

268
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,360
And Nayak?

269
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,680
Any day now, sir.

270
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,320
He can land in Mumbai any day.

271
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,320
And we're ready for him.

272
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,720
And Bhumi?

273
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
We'll shift her to some hotel very soon.

274
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,880
Nobody will be able to trace
her there. It will be safer.

275
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,280
What are the orders for her,
once she is picked up?

276
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,760
You know what I mean.

277
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,480
I know, sir.
We've planned everything, sir.

278
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,880
Planned?

279
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,760
Will Nayak work according to your plan?

280
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,720
He is Nayak.

281
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,080
In Karwar, the arms-dealing
went on for four years

282
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,600
and the police had no clue of it.

283
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,920
When the police cracked it down,
do you know who they arrested?

284
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,720
Local laborers and drivers.

285
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,480
The police did not even know,
if there was a man named Nayak or not.

286
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,240
Four senior police officers...
I mean, IPS officers got suspended.

287
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,200
And this girl will be with him,
at his place, that too, alone.

288
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,680
Don't you understand?

289
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,360
What will she do?
How will she protect herself?

290
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,840
You don't have to catch Nayak, Bhumi.

291
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,640
You only have to pass on the information.

292
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,520
Everything that you see, you hear...

293
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,800
remember that.

294
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,240
And record it
with us once you are back here.

295
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,160
-That's it. This will be your job.
-Yes sir.

296
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,040
Don't rush with Nayak ever.

297
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,400
He'll sense it.

298
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,760
You have to win his confidence.

299
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,240
Slowly, you have to make
a place for yourself with him.

300
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,480
We will always be with you.
Atul will always be close to you.

301
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,240
If there is any emergency,

302
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,600
if you feel there is any danger,
instantly inform the team.

303
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,280
And we'll get you out of there.

304
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,040
{\an8}<i>Sir, I have some news.</i>

305
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,120
{\an8}<i>It's bad, but if you want
a promotion, it's very good.</i>

306
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,760
{\an8}<i>A very huge consignment has landed.</i>

307
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,600
{\an8}<i>It landed yesterday, it has landed today
and it will come tomorrow as well.</i>

308
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,760
{\an8}<i>I didn't see anything myself,
but my boys saw and informed me.</i>

309
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,200
{\an8}<i>All the fishermen in the village
wake up every morning, wear a sarong</i>

310
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,720
{\an8}<i>and go to spread fishing nets.</i>

311
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,200
{\an8}<i>But they return with everything but fish.</i>

312
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,240
{\an8}<i>Drugs, guns... everything!
You got it, right?</i>

313
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,200
{\an8}<i>Something big is about to happen.</i>

314
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,920
{\an8}<i>I suggest, you be ready.</i>

315
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,240
Hello, sir.

316
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,600
It's time.

317
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,840
He is coming.

318
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,360
Hello, Bhumi...

319
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,520
Yes, sir?

320
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,240
