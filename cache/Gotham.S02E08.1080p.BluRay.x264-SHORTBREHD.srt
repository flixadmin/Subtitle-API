1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,880
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:06,925
<i>Cops aren't gonna let you
within 100 feet of Galavan.</i>

3
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:08,093
Let us whack him for you.

4
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:09,344
No.

5
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:10,929
He's mine.

6
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:12,222
Shoot him, Detective.

7
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:13,598
He killed my mother, Jim.

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,563
Do you have the Wayne boy?

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,317
Not yet. There are some practical matters
that have to be resolved first.

10
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,361
See this finger?

11
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:28,947
I've got little Bruce
wrapped tight around it.

12
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:31,116
I had to kill him. Because he hit you.

13
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:32,617
I love you.

14
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:37,622
Kristen.
Kristen? No!

15
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:41,251
Within a year,
Jim and I will be back together.

16
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:42,877
Wanna know why?

17
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,671
Because we're both the same.

18
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,298
We both have a dark side.

19
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,285
Ready for the practice run?

20
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:17,495
I'm ready to skip this and get married.

21
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:18,830
Me, too.

22
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,082
Let us rehearse the vows.

23
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,337
- Barbara Kean...
- Mmm.

24
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,256
Do you take James Gordon

25
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:31,509
to be your unlawfully wedded husband,
to have and to hold--

26
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:35,263
I'm sorry.
Father, you said "unlawfully" wedded.

27
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:40,185
Barbara,
just answer him, for God's sake!

28
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,107
I'm waiting.

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,744
Barbara, what's wrong?

30
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,462
How did you do that?

31
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:44,999
Bad dream.

32
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,083
Doesn't being mayor mean you can sleep in?

33
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,797
Jim Gordon has forced us
to accelerate our plans.

34
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,424
About time.

35
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:36,718
I meet with Bruce Wayne this morning.

36
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:39,888
If all goes well, I'll have his company
by the end of the day.

37
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:43,808
I still don't see how you can get Bruce
Wayne to turn over his family's legacy.

38
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,560
You're not that charming.

39
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:51,816
I'm going to offer him the thing
he wants most in the world.

40
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,152
Still...

41
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,738
It will be delicate.

42
00:03:57,447 --> 00:04:00,116
<i>Jim Gordon
must not be allowed to interfere.</i>

43
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:04,078
But his sudden death would upset Bruce.

44
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,081
So we need him distracted, occupied.

45
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,044
- And then...
- Have you told her?

46
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,921
Told me what?

47
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:21,137
I love my present.

48
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,184
Does it mean what I think it does?

49
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,102
Yes, my dear.

50
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:33,691
Today is the day
you get to kill Jim Gordon.

51
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,488
<i>The breakout at Arkham.</i>

52
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,198
<i>The massacre at the G.C.P.D.</i>

53
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,867
The gala. The arsons.

54
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:45,745
It was Galavan. He's behind everything.

55
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,705
And you have proof of this?

56
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,624
I have Penguin and I have Gilzean.

57
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,501
Both criminals. Both in the wind.

58
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,505
Given the circumstances
under which I obtained the information,

59
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:57,674
I think it's safe to say
they were telling the truth.

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,133
Maybe they are.

61
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,346
But you have no legal evidence, no proof,
not a single, hard lead to go on.

62
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:06,015
You bring in Galavan with what you
have now, and he'll just laugh at you.

63
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,934
He won't laugh long.

64
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,061
What, are you gonna rough him up a little?

65
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,438
A little lawless thuggery?
Is that your plan?

66
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,024
You want to arrest Galavan?

67
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:18,069
You do the police work
and you bring me back some real proof.

68
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,198
Can you blame him?

69
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,951
You're going after a man
who was elected mayor yesterday.

70
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,494
The most popular figure in Gotham.

71
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,538
Galavan is dirty. I'd bet my life on it.

72
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:30,081
- Well, don't.
- Don't what?

73
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,874
- Don't bet your life on it.
- Oh.

74
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,254
I know that look in your eye, Jim.
Be cool. Do not make this personal.

75
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,214
Well, it is personal, isn't it?

76
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,424
Only if you make it that way.

77
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,719
<i>Suspect! Put your hands
where I can see 'em! Right there!</i>

78
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,642
Hi, Jim.

79
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,982
Long time no see.

80
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,464
You said you'd only talk to me.

81
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,467
<i>I'm listening.</i>

82
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:24,677
<i>Yes.</i>

83
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,513
Here it is...

84
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,935
Is there any chance I could get
a latte or something?

85
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:35,730
- This is not a game, Barbara.
- Oh...

86
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,107
Of course it is.

87
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,486
It's a game you've been losing.

88
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,113
Big time.

89
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,827
It is not a game.

90
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,581
It must be killing you.

91
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:58,419
All that righteous indignation
with no place to go.

92
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,178
Why are you here?

93
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,431
Don't act all calm and businesslike.

94
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,518
Rough me up a little.

95
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:15,978
If you want.

96
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,566
I don't wanna do that.

97
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,614
<i>I don't want to hurt you.</i>

98
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,033
<i>I want to help you.</i>

99
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:33,996
I know you want to hurt me.

100
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,958
Just a little.

101
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,005
- I've been a very bad girl.
- No.

102
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,136
You're a good woman.

103
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,807
You're just sick, is all.

104
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,720
I knew it.

105
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,640
I knew you still had feelings for me.

106
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,021
Of course I have feelings.

107
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,192
Talk to me.

108
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,986
I will.

109
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,948
But first, I want to show you something.

110
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:53,951
It's not far away, it won't take long.

111
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,829
What is it? What do you want to show me?

112
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,957
It's a surprise.

113
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,127
Don't worry, it's a good one.

114
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,299
And then, after that,
I will tell you everything.

115
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,052
Everything about what?

116
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,512
Is it about the breakout at Arkham?

117
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,764
Was it Galavan?

118
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,434
Wouldn't you like to know?

119
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,313
<i>Detective Gordon!</i>

120
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:27,693
Okay, that's someone telling you
that my lawyer is here.

121
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,488
Why don't you take five minutes
and think about it?

122
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,533
<i>Detective Gordon! Time is up!</i>

123
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,528
What is she playing at?

124
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:11,946
<i>Not sure, sir.</i>

125
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,948
I suggest we play along and find out.

126
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,950
I'll go see this thing
she wants to show me.

127
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,576
Jim, she's mentally ill.

128
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,871
Like hell! She's sharp as a nail.
This is a trap.

129
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,581
Yeah. Either way, it's too risky.

130
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:26,043
What choice do we have, huh?
She won't talk.

131
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,712
And kissing her didn't work out, did it?

132
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,672
That was a judgment call, sir.

133
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,342
- Judgment? Really?
- Let's focus on the issue at hand.

134
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,263
It's my official opinion
as Chief Medical Examiner

135
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,349
that Miss Kean is seriously mentally ill

136
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,310
and should be in a hospital
getting treatment.

137
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,145
Yes. Tomorrow.

138
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:47,815
Look.

139
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:51,819
I suggest we play along,
let her think she's in control.

140
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,489
<i>I can still work on her inside the car.
Maybe I can find out something useful.</i>

141
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,409
She's our only link to Galavan.

142
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,661
<i>It's worth the risk.</i>

143
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:02,747
All right. Do it.

144
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,906
Whoa, sorry, Miss Kringle.

145
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,835
You have a visitor, Miss St. Cloud.

146
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,713
- Hi.
<i>- Hello.</i>

147
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,224
My uncle will be just a moment.

148
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,852
He wanted me to apologize
for keeping you waiting.

149
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,728
It's fine.

150
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,357
Do you have any idea
why he wanted to see me?

151
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,026
He told me he had something for you.

152
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:59,238
- He seemed excited.
- It was totally goofy.

153
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:00,573
I can't picture him goofy.

154
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,033
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

155
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,202
I'll see you later.

156
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:06,454
Bye.

157
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,208
Please.

158
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,353
Meet the new crop
of Strike Force members.

159
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,772
We're throwing them in the deep end,
but they're ready.

160
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,233
They'll be shadowing you in a TAC SUV.

161
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,110
I'll be monitoring from here.

162
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:41,405
Now, the second I don't like something,
I'm pulling the plug. Agreed?

163
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,865
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

164
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,409
<i>Gordon?</i>

165
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:47,995
Agreed.

166
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,751
He's too wrapped up
in this thing emotionally.

167
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,379
I need to know that one of you isn't gonna
get sucked into all these mind games

168
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,089
that Miss Kean is gonna
be pulling out there.

169
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:02,927
Not to worry. No one's ever accused me
of getting sucked into mind games.

170
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,137
Just follow my orders. Understood?

171
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,265
Understood, Captain.
I'm glad we had this chance to talk.

172
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:13,103
Lee, look, I don't like this
any more than you do.

173
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,396
But it is the only way.

174
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,650
No. This is you, Jim. This is all you.

175
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,360
She sucked you right back in, didn't she?

176
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,612
Because she still has a hold on you.

177
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,573
Her sickness and yours
feed off each other.

178
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,991
What do you mean, "my sickness"?
I'm not sick.

179
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,369
You see an abyss, and you run toward it.

180
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,912
That's not healthy.

181
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,665
I'm just doing my job.

182
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,041
<i>We're moving out!</i>

183
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:42,341
Hey, Lee. You don't mind if I borrow him
for a little while, do ya?

184
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,141
I want to ask you a question.

185
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:56,647
If you could have one dream come true,
what would that be?

186
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,234
I would find the man
who killed my parents.

187
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,820
What would you do if you found him?

188
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,323
I would kill him.

189
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,951
What a young tiger you are.

190
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:14,957
My dream?

191
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,793
I would save this city.

192
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:24,383
I would rid Gotham of corruption,
crime and poverty.

193
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,343
Sounds good.

194
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,388
How would you do that?

195
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:33,517
Oh, I have plans, schemes, ideas aplenty.

196
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,895
But I need help.

197
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,357
I need your help.

198
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:41,900
Of course.

199
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:46,697
And perhaps, in return,
I could help you with your dream.

200
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,077
How so?

201
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,249
<i>Get those vehicles out of the way!</i>

202
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,634
You good?

203
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,596
Anything that makes Captain Barnes'
tight ass nervous, I'm all for.

204
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,766
Watch your head!

205
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,940
So, you want to tell us where we're going?

206
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,234
Head downtown.

207
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,167
Bruce, your family helped build this city.

208
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:44,963
The Wayne name is synonymous with growth,
strength and prosperity.

209
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,466
It's also a lie.

210
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,928
Please explain what you mean.

211
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,182
I've been investigating Wayne Enterprises
for quite some time.

212
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,434
You know what I found?

213
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,937
Toxic waste dumps,

214
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:04,733
illegal weapons contracts,
use of banned chemicals,

215
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,944
nightmarish experiments.

216
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,741
It can't continue. Please understand,
this isn't about corruption.

217
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:15,369
It's about saving innocent lives.

218
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:21,166
You have my word,
I will look into all of it.

219
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,043
And I will stop whoever's responsible.

220
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,336
No, Bruce. You won't.

221
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:26,964
You can't.

222
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,967
People often underestimate me.

223
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:34,513
Wayne Enterprises
is a multibillion-dollar conglomerate

224
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,850
with a board that will kill
to protect its secrets.

225
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,519
Who's underestimating who?

226
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:45,983
Why are you telling me this?

227
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,819
You obviously have a solution
you want to propose.

228
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:55,617
You control 51%
of the voting shares of Wayne Enterprises.

229
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:59,913
If you sell me your shares,
I could take control.

230
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,623
Do what needs to be done.

231
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,835
You would be a cash billionaire
with freedom.

232
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,588
You want my company?

233
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,382
I want to clean up Gotham.

234
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,217
Protect its citizens.

235
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:17,556
Return this city to what it was.
But I can't do it without your help.

236
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,520
Wayne Enterprises is my responsibility.

237
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,400
It's all I have left of them.

238
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,197
I'm not just offering you money, Bruce.

239
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,368
The night your parents were killed,

240
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,038
you weren't supposed to be there,
were you?

241
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,123
No.

242
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,334
Your parents were headed for the theater.

243
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,253
Your father changed his mind,
suggested a movie.

244
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,547
Invited you along.

245
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,132
You got there late.

246
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,844
I've never told anybody that.

247
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,555
He was following your father that night.

248
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,558
Before the alleyway.

249
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,938
I'm a man of considerable resources and,
even then, it took some doing.

250
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,899
That's why I didn't want
to say anything last night.

251
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,443
I couldn't confirm it until today.

252
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,363
If you sell me your company,

253
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,785
I will give you this as a signing gift.

254
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,082
This is the name of the man
who killed your parents.

255
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,251
<i>With documentary proof.</i>

256
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:31,922
<i>Accomplices, motives, why, how, and who.</i>

257
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:40,430
I will fix your company,
protect your legacy, and give you closure.

258
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,142
It's what your father would have wanted.

259
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,521
<i>And what Gotham desperately needs.</i>

260
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,447
I need your answer by the end of the day.

261
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,333
<i>Hey, Jim. Cheer up!</i>

262
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,627
Where's your spirit of adventure?

263
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,713
Next right.

264
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,097
I know it's a trap.

265
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,184
And Galavan's using you like a puppet.

266
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,647
It is Galavan
who's behind all this, right?

267
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,900
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

268
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,943
He's a psychopath, Barbara.

269
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,820
He's using you.

270
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,198
He's laughing at you.

271
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:45,495
And when he's done with you,
you're just a loose end. He'll kill you.

272
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,917
You really don't like
this Galavan guy, do you?

273
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:55,213
She's not talking, Jim.
We need to turn this car around. Now.

274
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,257
Just give me a little more time.

275
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,438
Hmm.

276
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,119
Well, I'm afraid this is
as proper a burial as circumstances allow.

277
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,414
But I thought we could have
one last meal together.

278
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,378
I was a broken man, Miss Kringle.

279
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,130
Two halves at war with each other.

280
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,717
But thanks to you, I am whole.

281
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,388
I will not forget you.

282
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,725
I take you by night, by day take you back.

283
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,728
None suffer to have me,
but do from my lack.

284
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,563
What am I?

285
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,232
That some sort of riddle?

286
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,986
You know, you really shouldn't sneak up
on people. That's not polite.

287
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,405
Not usually any people out here.

288
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,156
Can I interest you in a tea sandwich?

289
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,533
A what?

290
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,578
What the heck is in there?

291
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,757
Great.

292
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,218
Now I've got to improvise.

293
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,555
Don't go anywhere.

294
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,278
Barbara, listen to me.

295
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,114
Are you listening?

296
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,534
You have a lifetime ahead of you.
Don't throw it away on madness.

297
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:53,415
<i>Gordon. Bullock. Come in.</i>

298
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,625
Go ahead, Captain.

299
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,211
<i>I don't like this. You're boxed in.
There's lots of cover.</i>

300
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,047
<i>High vantage points all around.</i>

301
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,798
Perfect spot for an ambush.

302
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,176
<i>Yeah, I gotta pull you out.</i>

303
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,636
You turn around, you get nothing.

304
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,556
<i>Not yet.</i>

305
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,767
<i>You hear me?
I'm pulling you out.</i>

306
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,602
What was that, Captain?
You're breaking up.

307
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,605
<i>Bullock! I swear to God, if you disobey--</i>

308
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,317
Barbara, think hard.
Don't throw away your life.

309
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,152
What life?

310
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:28,408
You and me, we had a life.

311
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,788
We had real love.

312
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,084
You asked me to marry you.

313
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,796
I booked a church.
I bought a damn wedding dress.

314
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:44,049
Jim, fool that I am,

315
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,302
I still love you, even now.

316
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:52,140
And I know you still have feelings for me,
'cause you said so.

317
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:55,143
We can talk about our feelings later.
There's more at stake here.

318
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,354
I love you, Jim.

319
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,735
And I think, deep down, you still love me.

320
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:06,363
Oh, for God's sakes, Barbara,
I don't give a--

321
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,329
Move! Move!

322
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,597
You gonna shoot me, Jim?

323
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,108
I want a 20-block perimeter

324
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,111
with hard-target searches
of every building, business, and bodega.

325
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:31,114
We kick down everything
with four walls and a roof.

326
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,908
Nobody sleeps until our boy gets home.

327
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:36,453
Hey! I told you to get out of here.

328
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,873
You did? There's still a lot of ringing
in my head. I must have missed it.

329
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,416
This is a direct order.

330
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,544
You don't belong here anymore. Go home.

331
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,312
Yeah.

332
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,106
Oh, okay.

333
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,860
Well, let's see.

334
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,530
If I can't make the hole bigger,

335
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:15,450
then I'll make you smaller.

336
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,422
Who has eaten my sandwich?

337
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,349
For a secluded forest,
this place sure has a lot of foot traffic.

338
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,397
Looks like it's gonna get
a tad crowded in there.

339
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,443
I'll be back.

340
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:05,041
Oh, there you are, Master Bruce.
Been looking all over the gaff for you.

341
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,669
Bit dreary down here, isn't it?

342
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,338
Fancy something to eat?

343
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:13,717
What's up?

344
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,469
I need to ask you a question.

345
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,223
And I need your word
that you're gonna be honest with me.

346
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,891
I always am.

347
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,688
All right, you have my word.

348
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,231
My training.

349
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,862
The skills that I need to take down
the corruption at Wayne Enterprises.

350
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:35,822
How long will it take?

351
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:39,743
Well, there's no set timeline.
Doesn't really work like that, does it?

352
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,413
Alfred, a year? Two years? Five?

353
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:47,250
Well, a lot longer than that,
for you to be the man that you need to be.

354
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,086
<i>But you will get there.
I promise you that.</i>

355
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,256
Yeah, well, how many will suffer
in the meantime?

356
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,635
How many will die because of the crimes
committed by my family's company?

357
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,934
Where is all this coming from,
Master Bruce? Eh?

358
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,568
I spoke to

359
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,905
Mayor Galavan this morning.

360
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,114
And?

361
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:26,289
He wants me to sell him my shares
of Wayne Enterprises so he can

362
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,794
fix the company, clean up Gotham.

363
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,422
I see.

364
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,344
And what aren't you telling me?

365
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,182
He says...

366
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,729
That he knows the identity of the man
who killed my parents.

367
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,484
Which he's offering in return
for the company, right?

368
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,488
Yes.

369
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,324
Yeah, well, that's not an offer, is it?

370
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,118
That's bloody extortion.

371
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,578
Yeah, well, I can't help
but consider it, Alfred.

372
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:06,746
Well, you shouldn't.

373
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:10,750
There's a fine line
between extortion and negotiation.

374
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,586
Yes, there is, Master Bruce.
But there's still a line.

375
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,380
My parents were killed

376
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,967
because of the corruption
that my father was trying to stop.

377
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,387
As of now, their deaths have been in vain.

378
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,806
But if Mayor Galavan can truly...

379
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,809
If he can truly fix Wayne Enterprises,

380
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:33,440
isn't it my moral duty
to allow him to do so?

381
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,735
For my father's legacy?

382
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:43,867
Wayne Enterprises isn't
Thomas and Martha Wayne's legacy.

383
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,706
That legacy is standing right here.

384
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,667
With me.

385
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:04,929
Alfred, am I wrong
if I just want it all to be over?

386
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,807
I just want... I just want it to be over.

387
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,894
No, no. No, you're not wrong.

388
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:13,396
Come here.

389
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:16,733
You're not wrong.

390
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:58,816
I know.

391
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,903
Can you believe it still fits?

392
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:11,538
Do you remember
when we first visited this place?

393
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:16,793
How excited I was to get married here?

394
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:22,715
How long do you think you have
before the G.C.P.D. finds us?

395
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,175
So typical.

396
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:30,473
I'm talking about us,
and your head is in work.

397
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,766
There is no "us."

398
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,311
What is all this?

399
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,400
Well, this is my wedding dress.
The tailor still had it in storage.

400
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:44,737
I mean, can you believe the luck? Or fate.

401
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,949
That's Father Callahan.

402
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,617
You remember him, of course.

403
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,953
And these bozos...

404
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:57,625
Who knows? But you can't have
a wedding without witnesses.

405
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,335
That's the law.

406
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,547
Barbara...

407
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,299
Jim,

408
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:08,469
please don't act all surprised
and aggrieved.

409
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:14,517
You knew from the start
that this was a trap.

410
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:20,481
But you thought, "Hey, let the bad guys
take their best shot.

411
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:23,693
<i>"I'm Jim Gordon.</i>

412
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:28,197
"I'll find a way to win."

413
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,367
"Or die."

414
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,457
It's option B, baby.

415
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,544
Your fondest wish come true.

416
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,298
I don't want to die.

417
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:47,258
Oh...

418
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,218
Hey.

419
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,388
Sure you do.

420
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:57,852
Aren't you tired of hiding your true self?

421
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:02,315
Tired of lying to yourself?

422
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,068
To Lee?

423
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,737
I don't lie to Lee.

424
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,573
Really?

425
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:13,534
Let's ask her.

426
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,291
Lee!

427
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,430
Savor every moment.

428
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,146
Hey, girlfriend.

429
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,068
We really need to talk about this bad boy.

430
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,741
<i>We had real love.</i>

431
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,161
<i>You asked me to marry you.</i>

432
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:00,832
<i>I booked a church.
I bought a damn wedding dress.</i>

433
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:03,710
<i>Jim, fool that I am,</i>

434
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,879
<i>I still love you, even now.</i>

435
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:14,804
<i>I booked a church.
I bought a damn wedding dress.</i>

436
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,395
I want updates every 15 minutes.

437
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:24,772
Hang on. Turn around
and get the hell out of here!

438
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,149
She's taking him to church.

439
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,483
Church? What church?

440
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,193
She talked about the wedding
they never had.

441
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,486
She wants a do-over.

442
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:34,323
Gotham Cathedral is nearest
to the snatch site. That's where they are.

443
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,326
- That's thin.
- I know I am right.

444
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,247
I'll call you back.

445
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:42,915
Let's go.

446
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:51,799
So, Lee, how do you think
your relationship with Jim is going?

447
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:54,886
This doesn't concern Lee. Let her go.
This is between you and me.

448
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,053
Oh...

449
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,308
This is about all of us.

450
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:04,687
She deserves to know exactly who you are.

451
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:08,733
I know who he is.

452
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,903
Oh, how could you,
when he doesn't even know?

453
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:17,200
He is incapable
of being honest with himself.

454
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,660
Let alone anyone else.

455
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,287
What about you?

456
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,164
This entire day has been a lie.

457
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:25,833
You were never gonna
give up proof on Galavan.

458
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,210
Who?

459
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:28,586
Oh!

460
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,588
You want some honesty?

461
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,548
Fine.

462
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,344
Mayor James

463
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,054
is alive and well

464
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:41,307
at a stash house on China Docks.

465
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,227
Hmm. See?

466
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,645
Honesty.

467
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,356
- Now, you.
- Who put him there?

468
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:50,608
Who put him there?

469
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,860
Boring, Jim!

470
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:57,281
The Jim Gordon you know is an act.

471
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:02,537
He's like an addict who thinks
he can dabble in darkness

472
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,248
as long as nobody sees the needle marks.

473
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,333
Everyone has an act.

474
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,630
Did he tell you
how he got reinstated at the G.C.P.D.?

475
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:14,423
He killed a man for Penguin.

476
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:19,595
Wow! Very good, Jim.

477
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,264
You did tell her.

478
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:23,474
- We don't have secrets between us.
- Mmm-hmm.

479
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:27,103
He's done a lot of things
that he's not proud of. Everyone has.

480
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:30,690
But you love him anyway? Is that right?

481
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,943
Despite all his faults.

482
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,486
Yes, I do.

483
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:41,450
Cute little do-gooder Dr. Lee. Hmm?

484
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:45,788
In love with a cruel, cold,
death-obsessed sadist.

485
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,498
That's not Jim.

486
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:54,130
Do you think you know him
better than I do? Hmm?

487
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:56,924
<i>I love him, too, you know.</i>

488
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:01,178
I know him better than you do.

489
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,306
Okay, Barbara, I hear you.

490
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,474
You love him, we both love him.
That's okay--

491
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,227
But I love him more!

492
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,730
Okay, listen, Barbara.
I know that now. Please...

493
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:14,066
I'm gonna prove that I love him more.

494
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:19,697
I am going to carve
your pretty face off your skull.

495
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:24,911
And then you will both understand
what true love is.

496
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,662
Okay, there's just one more thing!

497
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,664
- What?
- Your dress!

498
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,082
I love your dress.

499
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:31,792
I just want to know where you got it.

500
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,295
Hmm. Oh, um...

501
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,215
Drop the knife!

502
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:43,095
There he is. My little monster.

503
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,513
Don't make me kill you.

504
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,057
Make you?

505
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:50,728
Jim, you long to kill me.

506
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:53,856
Do it, Jim.

507
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,443
Do me.

508
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:59,654
Don't take another step!

509
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:08,079
<i>Kill him!</i>

510
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,592
Go get her!

511
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,389
<i>Don't move!</i>

512
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,310
Jim!

513
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,451
It's over.

514
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,330
Not yet.

515
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:03,092
Hold on. Hold on.

516
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:05,803
Sorry, baby.

517
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,305
I've been kind of a bad date, huh?

518
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,186
I love you, baby.

519
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:20,026
No!

520
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:30,619
Some hedges and bushes broke her fall.

521
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,456
She's got half a dozen broken bones
and a concussion.

522
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,207
She's critical.

523
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:40,087
Are you okay?

524
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,006
Yeah.

525
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,928
Not now, but when this is over,
we need to talk.

526
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:49,805
I know.

527
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,810
Tell me you got something from her.

528
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:58,481
She didn't give up Galavan,
but she did say Mayor James is alive,

529
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,900
stashed in a safe house on China Docks.

530
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:04,195
All mobile units, China Docks, right now!

531
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,863
<i>10-4, Captain.</i>

532
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,129
G.C.P.D.!

533
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,440
<i>Help.</i>

534
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,151
What is wrong with these people?

535
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,028
Help me!

536
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:48,697
Mayor James?

537
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,324
Help me, please!

538
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:53,494
Oh, thank God!

539
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,705
- Who did this to you?
- Who do you think?

540
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,210
All the papers seem to be in order.

541
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,339
You're making the right decision.

542
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:08,134
Sign, and the file is yours.

543
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,323
I changed my mind.

544
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,660
I can't sell you my company.

545
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,122
<i>Not for any price.</i>

546
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:41,292
Alfred, get Bruce away from him, now!

547
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,419
- Detective Gordon?
<i>- You're under arrest!</i>

548
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:48,299
Surprised to see me?

549
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,468
May I ask what the charge is?

550
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,096
The kidnapping
and torture of Aubrey James.

551
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:55,306
Cuff him.

552
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,271
<i>Get him out of here.</i>

553
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:06,317
Where...

554
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,571
No! No!

555
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:13,782
Tell me who killed them!

556
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,953
<i>Please! I'll do anything.</i>

557
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,177
<i>Finally.</i>

558
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:55,658
Oh!

559
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:13,759
Oh, my.

560
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:16,345
Mr. Penguin?

561
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,349
Help me. Please.

562
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:06,395
English - SDH
