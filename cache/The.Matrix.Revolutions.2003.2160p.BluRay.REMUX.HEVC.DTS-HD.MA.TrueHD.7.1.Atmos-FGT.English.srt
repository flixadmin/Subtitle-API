1
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,708
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,418
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,253
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,380
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,633
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,260
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,096
ROLAND: Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,724
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,603
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- Then the sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,777
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,654
Thank you.

12
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,365
Any change?

13
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,243
No.

14
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,123
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

15
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,917
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:10,255
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,591
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,927
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:20,182
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,644
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,983
MORPHEUS: Roland, I'd like to run
another search through the Matrix.

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,402
- For what?
- For Neo.

23
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,781
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,282
Please, for me.

25
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,504
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,673
What?

27
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,551
MAGGIE: His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,638
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,141
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,156
The big <i>bupkes. Nada.</i>
He's not in there.

31
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,534
COLT: Sir, I got the projections.
ROLAND: How long?

32
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:25,247
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,041
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,838
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,174
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

36
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,468
Make sure we're running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,512
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

38
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,807
-Hey! You got a call.
ROLAND: What?

39
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,352
Operator.

40
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,105
It's Seraph.

41
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,526
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

42
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,999
Good morning.

43
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,754
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,008
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

45
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,178
Are you lost, Neo?

46
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,393
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

47
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,483
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

48
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,944
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

49
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,073
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

50
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,787
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

51
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,290
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

52
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,377
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

53
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:13,605
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

54
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,566
One thing I've learned in all my years...

55
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,820
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

56
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,073
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

57
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:30,080
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

58
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,124
I'm sorry this had to happen.

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,878
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

60
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,965
- ...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

61
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:45,095
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

62
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,638
What choice?

63
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,933
To help you, to guide Neo.

64
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,021
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

65
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,025
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

66
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,778
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

67
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:06,241
...because here I am, at it again.

68
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,287
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

69
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,166
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,671
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

71
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:24,384
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

72
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,721
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

73
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,349
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

74
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,686
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

75
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,688
The Merovingian.

76
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:41,401
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

77
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,156
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

78
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,076
For years he has protected me.

79
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,746
I hope he can do the same for you.

80
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,583
Please, follow me.

81
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,214
Oracle...

82
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,592
I know, Morpheus.

83
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,512
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

84
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,309
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

85
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,227
I don't.

86
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,064
I expect just what I've always expected:

87
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,526
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

88
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:29,115
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

89
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,702
He needs all our help.

90
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,789
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

91
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,290
No.

92
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,378
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

93
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,548
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

94
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,469
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

95
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,137
Yes, Papa.

96
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,646
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

97
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,608
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

98
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:08,488
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

99
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,657
We are most honored to meet you.

100
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,451
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

101
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:18,081
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

102
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,335
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

103
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,005
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

104
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:30,093
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

105
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,846
It's okay.

106
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,681
I don't have an answer.

107
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,393
-I don't even know where "here" is.
RAMA: This place is nowhere.

108
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,354
It is between your world and our world.

109
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,859
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

110
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,236
Why did I know
you were going to say that?

111
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,365
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

112
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,410
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

113
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,539
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

114
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,959
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

115
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,753
Is that what you're doing here?

116
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,882
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

117
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,634
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

118
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,845
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,307
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

120
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,226
The answer is simple.

121
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,193
I love my daughter very much.

122
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,905
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

123
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,783
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

124
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,619
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

125
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,164
If it does not, it is deleted.

126
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,001
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

127
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,923
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

128
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,467
Heard a program speak of love.

129
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,597
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

130
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:02,143
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

131
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,565
I see that you are in love.

132
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,112
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

133
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,613
Anything.

134
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,782
Then perhaps the reason you are here...

135
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,244
...is not so different
than the reason I am here.

136
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,878
That's him.

137
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,882
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

138
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,969
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

139
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,722
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

140
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,906
[GUN SHOOTING]

141
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,192
Oh, no!

142
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,164
Damn it!

143
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,213
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

144
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,590
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

145
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,218
You think it has something
to do with me?

146
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,719
I cannot say.

147
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,722
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

148
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,767
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

149
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,686
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

150
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,397
She promised she'd look after Sati
after we said goodbye.

151
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,566
Goodbye?

152
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,402
-You're not staying with her?
RAMA: It is not possible.

153
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,615
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

154
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,244
- My wife and I must return to our world.

00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,959
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

313
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,877
So do I.

314
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,965
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

315
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,884
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

316
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,139
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

317
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,811
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

318
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,523
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

319
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,942
- Where?
- The source.

320
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,780
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready.

321
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:42,911
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

322
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,666
The Architect told me that
if I didn't return to the source...

323
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,668
...Zion would be destroyed tonight.

324
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:54,173
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

325
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,092
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

326
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:01,346
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

327
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,183
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

328
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,395
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

329
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:12,274
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

330
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,818
What's your purpose?

331
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,029

00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,281
Why? What do you want?

333

I want the same thing you want, Neo.

334
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,455
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

335
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,458
The end of the war.

336
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,501
Is it going to end?

337
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,379
One way or another.

338
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,342
Can Zion be saved?

339
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:43,555
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

340
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:49,269
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

341
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,147
- Where?
- You know where.

342
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,236
And if you can't find the answer...

343
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,906
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

344
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,244
What does that mean?

345
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,876
Everything that has a beginning...

00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,504
...has an end.

00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,590

But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

354

He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>?

467
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,690
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

468
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,859
Perhaps.

469
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,444
But we can hope.

470
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,031
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

471
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,879
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

472
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,715
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

473
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,218
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

474
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,888
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

475
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,978
Kids, you stay here.

476
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,315
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

477
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,484
-I have to.
CAS: Why?

478
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,820
Because I love him.

479
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,864
I love him the same as he loves me.

480
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,368
And if I were out there and he
were here, I know what he'd do.

481
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,831
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

482
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,169
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

483
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,215
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

484
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,509
...what would you do?

485
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,558
Make shells.

486
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,196
What the shit is going on over here?

487
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,908
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

488
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,202
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

489
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,663
A unit volunteer, sir.

490
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,043
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

491
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,213
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

492
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,675
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

493
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,970
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

494
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,555
Okay, I'm 16.

495
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,309
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

496
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:46,314
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

497
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,816
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

498
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,612
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

499
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,697
You do...

500
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,493
...and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

501
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,092
Okay, charge the igniter.

502
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,141
She lives again.

503
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,603
Want us to patch an uplink to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

504
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,107
That'd be swell. Could you clean
the windshield while you're at it?

505
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,531
SPARKS: Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

506
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,450
Looking good, except, uh...

507
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,329
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

508
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,707
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

509
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,378
SPARKS: <i>What's going on in there?</i>
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

510
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,381
ROLAND:
The machines have taken Junction 21.

511
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,426
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

512
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,221
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

513
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:04,976
We'll go first, hammer as deep
as we can, then blow our EMP.

514
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:09,147
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

515
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:15,486
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

516
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,155
No, it's not.

517
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,408
There's another way. A support line.

518
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:24,328
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

519
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,541
If we're lucky, we may be able to
slip down without them ever knowing.

520
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,127
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

521
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,337
- No one can pilot mechanical.
- I can.

522
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,506
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

523
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,926
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

524
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,723
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

525
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,810
Hi.

526
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:54,025
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

527
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,987
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

528
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,281
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

529
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:03,701
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

530
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,537
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

531
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,456
To go where?

532
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,750
To the machine city.

533
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,254
[LAUGHS]

534
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,548
I know it's difficult to understand.

535
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,259
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

536
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,886
I still have to go.

537
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:25,264
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

538
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:28,142
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

539
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,312
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

540
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,815
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

541
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,068
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

542
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,196
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

543
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,574
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

544
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,578
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

545
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:55,253
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

546
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,215
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

547
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,676
...with my ship
after that little speech.

548
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:06,264
- But for christ sake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

549
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:10,434
If we leave inside the hour,
we'll reach Zion as the machines do.

550
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,145
That's as good a plan as any.

551
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:17,066
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

552
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,783
Two ships, two directions.

553
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,120
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

554
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,957
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

555
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,834
Then why are you doing this?

556
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,045
I believe in him.

557
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,882
Thank you.

558
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,807
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

559
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,810
To make it easier for you to remember.

560
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,646
What if I don't want to remember?

561
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,733
Why would you want that?

562
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,986
What if I blew that EMP?

563
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,989
What if I did destroy those ships...

564
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:09,952
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

565
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,999
If I did that...

566
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,919
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

[GROANING]

568
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:33,017
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

569
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,027
I'm ready.

Trinity...

571
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,700
...there's something I have to say.

572
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,623
Something you need to understand.

573
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,668
I know I'm supposed to go.

574
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,129
But beyond that...

575
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,549
...I don't know. I...

576
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,637
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

577
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:16,268
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

578
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,105
Just like you knew the moment
you looked at me...

579
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,649
...that I was coming with you.

580

So am I.

It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

583
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,329
But I'll tell you something.

584
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,416
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

585
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,585
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

586
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,715
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

587
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,426
No.

588
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,302
Nothing.

Every time, I was sure we had you,

as much as killing him.
