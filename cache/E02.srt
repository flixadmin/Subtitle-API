2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,760
So, you're not a fed?

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,970
Do you hear that? That's the old bill.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,300
So unless you want to explain

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,810
why you've got America's favourite
invisible wanker dead on the floor,

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,850
give us a fucking hand, will you?

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,230
Shit.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,830
All right, listen, I have
worked for the feds.

9
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,340
I've worked for loads of people.

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,300
I'm what you might call
an independent contractor.

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,840
You got a problem, you call me,
I solve the problem.

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,110
What is that?

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,530
That's a problem.

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,070
Thank fuck, he's alive.

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,780
Yes, yes, he's
alive! Okay, pull over.

16
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,950
No, no, no, Hughie,
you don't fucking get it.

17
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,580
- Pull the car over.
- This is a fuck-sight worse.

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,410
He's seen our faces.

19
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,960
My God.
No, no, no, no, no. I can't do this.

20
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,760
I can't do this. Let me out.

21
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,720
Let me out. Pull over!

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,770
Hughie, you walk away now,
and you will never get payback for Robin.

23
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,100
You'll spend the rest of your life
sitting on your ass with fucking regret.

24
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,850
Now, is that what you want?

25
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,610
I know a bloke. Top man.

26
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,160
He'll know what to do.

27
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,250
Morning, luv.

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,840
Frenchie about?

29
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,980
You'll love this guy.

30
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,410
Frenchie.

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,830
Oi, Frenchie.

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,000
Monsieur Charcuter.

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,260
This is a surprise.

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,970
Good to see you.

35
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,680
Good to see you, too, mate.

36
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Means you brought that 40,000 you owe me?

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,900
I mean, why else would you
show your face around here?

38
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,280
Because I've got something
even better for you.

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,530
How would you like to double your money?

40
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,420
The double of zero is zero.

41
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,790
Who is he?

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,340
This guy?

43
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,960
This here is Hughie Campbell.

44
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,300
We're, working a little job together.

45
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
And he's still alive?

46
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,390
You and I worked together,
and you're still in one piece.

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,270
Am I?

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,690
Look, do you want to know
what the fucking job is or not?

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,990
Open it.

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,910
Who is in there?

51
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,540
Where's your sense of adventure, Frenchie?

52
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,460
You dumb fucks are fucking dead!

53
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,340
Have you any...?

54
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,850
That's Translucent.

55
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,760
You got Translucent in your trunk?

56
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,810
Nothing gets past you, mate.

57
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,310
- Go away. Get him out of here.
- All right, all right, easy.

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,360
He's chipped. The
Supes can be on their

59
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,610
way. Homelander can
be on his way right now.

60
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,530
Wait, he's chipped?

61
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,820
You bring this to my doorstep?
This is not my problem?

62
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,280
Well, it is now. He
knows what you look like.

63
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,950
Look, Frenchie, I need your help, mate,

64
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,920
and I ain't leaving until I get it,
or until the Seven show up.

65
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,720
Here comes the A-Train!

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,430
My man, how you doing?

67
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,390
Look, I brought you something.

68
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,600
- Thanks?
- Yeah.

69
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,230
I'm sorry, I asked for Translucent.

70
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,690
Right, but Translucent is on a secret,
undercover mission right now.

71
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,820
But you got the A-Train, baby.

72
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,950
But... my wish was to meet Translucent.

73
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,040
That was my only wish. He's my hero.

74
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,210
Yeah. Well, you know,

75
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,760
maybe he can swing by next week or some...

76
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,800
Something...

77
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:53,310
Fuck. You know what?

78
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,100
Maybe I can't turn invisible,
but I am the world's fastest man.

79
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,860
Like, I can outrun anybody or anything.

80
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,400
That's something, right?

81
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,740
Look, I'll tell you what, you get better,
and I'll teach you to run as fast as me.

82
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,830
You'll teach me to outrun cancer?

84
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,460
Yeah.

85
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,670
My God, turn that off.

86
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,510
How many times do I have to tell you
A-Train needs to be scripted?

87
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,910
Right.

88
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,800
When he doesn't have
a script, this happens.

89
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,010
I'm on it. I'm so sorry.

90
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,720
- It will not happen again.
- All right.

91
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,970
And where is Translucent?

92
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,390
We know he's not in the building. He
hasn't triggered any of the motion sensors.

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,810
He's probably out on another one
of his fucking benders.

94
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,570
- Doesn't he have a team-up tomorrow night?
- Yeah, with the Deep.

95
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,730
- Get a backup.
- I'm on it.

96
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,940
Okay, go.

97
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,030
Okay.

98
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,110
Hello?

99
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,290
Black Noir.

100
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,960
We haven't properly met yet. I'm Starlight.

101
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,130
Well...

102
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,140
I look forward to working with you.

103
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,100
There she is.

104
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,510
Hi. How you settling in?

105
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,850
Well, it's an adjustment.

106
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,980
That's for sure.

107
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,940
- This is Trevor from Crime Analytics.
- Hi.

108
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,690
So, we have exciting news for you.

109
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,570
We are sending you on your first patrol.

110
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,410
It's a team-up tomorrow night.

111
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,700
That's great.

112
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,990
That's great news. Thank you.

113
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,620
Hi. Big fan. There you go.

114
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,910
A crime itinerary?

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,040
Yep. Where and when to find the bad guys.

116
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,960
That's what my department does. We vet
leads, crunch satellite data, COMP-STAT.

117
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,290
Better intel than the police.

118
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,460
You know, thanks, but I'm good.

119
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,800
I like to do my own investigating.

120
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,590
And that is why we love you,
but it's not coming from us.

121
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,510
It's corporate. To protect you.

122
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,180
What if you nab the wrong person?
There's liability to consider.

123
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,060
The Deep is coming?

124
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,690
Yeah, it's a water-adjacent crime.

125
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,900
Then he should do it himself.
He doesn't need me.

126
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,940
It was gonna be Deep and Translucent,

127
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,200
but everyone on 82 is so excited
to get you out there.

128
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,740
Yeah, it's just, you know, back in
Des Moines, I always patrolled alone.

129
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,740
And that is why we love you.

130
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,830
But we see at least a 23 percent uptick
in social media mentions and hero hashtags

131
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,290
when there's a team-up.

132
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,500
People love a team-up.

133
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,630
Love a team-up.

134
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,580
That stuff really blocks the chip's signal?

135
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,210
Yeah. It's just R.F. Shielding Foil.
You can get it at Fry's.

136
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,420
You're in tech intelligence?

137
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,300
Sales and installation.

138
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,890
What the fuck?

139
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,970
Where am I?

140
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,600
Oi. Morning, sunshine.

141
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
- You know who I am?
- Not sure.

142
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,310
I know so many invisible assholes.

143
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,150
You fucking amateurs!

144
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,570
Fuck! What the fuck?!

145
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,070
Mind them bars, son.

146
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,660
You'll only bollocks yourself again.

147
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

148
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,790
Okay, what do you guys want? Money?

149
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,500
We don't want your fucking money.

150
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,300
What do you think, Frenchie?

151
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,760
You just dropped the Moby fucking Dick
of problems on my plate.

152
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,050
That's what I think.

153
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,180
Okay?

154
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,600
He can re-order his carbon
on his skin into metamaterial.

155
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,770
It's hard as diamonds.
It's nearly impossible to penetrate.

156
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,350
All right, how about we suffocate him?

157
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,940
Some Dominicans already tried this,
way back, '07.

158
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,570
And what happened?

159
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,160
They're all fucking dead.
That's what happened.

160
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,530
All right, then, fuck it, electrocution.
We'll just increase the amps.

161
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,830
You already hit him with enough
to drop a water buffalo, and look.

162
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,580
Might knock him out.
Doesn't seem to kill him? No.

163
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,370
We need to pierce the skin somehow.

164
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,920
Well, how the hell are we gonna do that?

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,920
I don't know.

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,380
You're gonna kill him?

167
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,430
We didn't bring him here
for a fucking Happy Meal.

168
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,020
I don't... I thought we'd
question him or something.

169
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,430
I don't know,
you get a hold of someone this big...

170
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,730
At Gitmo, we had to water board
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times

171
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,360
over six months to get
him to talk just once.

172
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,900
Now, we ain't got six months.

173
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,360
I doubt we've even got six hours.

174
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,910
There are so many crazy things
about what you just said,

175
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,870
but right now,
you're talking about randomly killing

176
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,500
one of the most famous men on the planet.

177
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,380
A goddamn national treasure.

178
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,760
I mean... people tend to
notice that kind of thing.

179
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,140
And if we let him go...
what do you think the Seven will do to us?

180
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,940
You can't get A-Train
if you're a greasy smear on the pavement.

181
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,110
I'm not a murderer.

182
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,400
That's all right.

183
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,570
I am.

184
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,490
The race is coming up
quickly. How you feeling?

185
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,480
Look, A-Train is a
fierce competitor, but no

186
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,370
one can be the world's
fastest man forever.

187
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,790
Let's just say I like my chan...

188
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,370
I'll always protect you.

189
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,380
Your little hero will never be afraid
with the Junior Homelander Cuddle...

190
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,220
I regret to inform you
that I've located the mayor's Gulfstream.

191
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,260
It's about two miles down
at the bottom of Hudson Canyon.

192
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,390
There are no survivors,
and I've yet to locate the flight recorder.

193
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,640
Though the jet was fragmented,
there was one engine fully intact,

194
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,390
and it appears to be engine failure.

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,860
So I'd like to offer...

196
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,860
- Still going strong?
- Yeah.

197
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,240
Yeah. I've just been pumping for 30
minutes, and I got a quarter of an ounce.

198
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,410
Hey, hey, go easy on yourself.

199
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,290
Come on, now.

200
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:37,380
Personally, I think it's amazing that a
woman your age can have a baby, period.

201
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,710
That is so sweet of you to say.

202
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,840
No problem.
Hey, you found Translucent yet?

203
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,890
You heard about that?

204
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,560
No, not yet.

205
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,390
Well, you know, I could search for him.
Personally.

206
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,650
That's not necessary.

207
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,020
Right.

208
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,030
Hey, did you hear about
the mayor of Baltimore?

209
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,450
Yeah. Yeah.

210
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,990
Heard his plane went down.
Some sort of engine trouble.

211
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,620
Yeah, it's awful.

212
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
I saw him on Tuesday.

213
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,330
I had a meeting with him right here.

214
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,670
Well, hug your kids, right?

215
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,130
Because you never know
what might happen.

216
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,210
So true.

217
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,630
You know what's interesting?

218
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,590
The Deep told me, and only me,

219
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,890
that there were scorch marks
on the mayor's engine.

220
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,690
Almost as if from two small,
high-intensity beams,

221
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,820
roughly the width of human eyes.

222
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,440
Say what you mean to say.

223
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,990
Your brand is hope...

224
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,700
baseball, America, sunshine.

225
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,420
You don't do vengeance.

226
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,630
Madelyn, I heard him
through the wall of this...

227
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,130
He was blackmailing you.

228
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,340
I am the last person you need to save.

229
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,800
Yeah, but I did it for you.

230
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,180
I know, but did the timing occur to you?

231
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,430
I have half the Senate Appropriations
Committee coming tonight.

232
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,950
How did he even know about Compound V?

233
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,000
We are not going to talk about that.

234
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,500
Come on, Madelyn.

235
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,170
You do not need to hide things from me.

236
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,250
I love Vought as much as you do,
and I can do more.

237
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,380
You can do more?

238
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,630
You've already grossed
$12.3 billion for us.

239
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,260
Right. So the pricks on 82
can take all the fucking credit?

240
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,560
Empty fucking suits with Cornell degrees?
Come on.

241
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,770
I'm the one who's out there. Not them.

242
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,360
I'm the one who knows the audience.

243
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,780
Who knows what's good for this company.

244
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,110
I know. I hear you. I do.

245
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,070
But what I need right now,

246
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,080
is I need you to charm the shit
out of those congressmen.

247
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,830
Right.

248
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,040
Because that's all I'm good for?

249
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,040
Smile, look pretty, say my lines.

250
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,550
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

251
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,220
No. No.

252
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,850
You just need to let me protect you.

253
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,020
You're gonna protect me?

254
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,610
Gods are pure...

255
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,190
and they're perfect...

256
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,570
and they're above it all.

257
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,120
And they need to stay that way.

258
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,460
You're leaking.

259
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,220
Thank you.

260
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,960
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

261
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,340
Hughie, where have you been?
I've been calling hospitals.

262
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,260
I'm fine.

263
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,890
But the police are saying
some wacko drove into Gary's store,

264
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,850
right through the
window, and then took off.

265
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,060
I thought maybe you've been hurt,
or kidnapped.

266
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,140
I saw this Dateline on human trafficking...

267
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,390
Dad, I haven't been human trafficked, okay?

268
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,610
I closed up early.
It must have happened after I left.

269
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,110
But where'd you go?

270
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,150
Just been drinking at Anthony's.

271
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,200
- Blowing off steam.
- No. Now, I called Anthony, all right?

272
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,570
I called everybody.
No one's seen you. Don't lie to me.

273
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,200
Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain.

274
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,750
Hey, Dad, listen, I got to, I got to go.

275
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,790
Just, listen, I know you've been taking
Robin's accident real hard.

276
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,000
It wasn't an accident.

277
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,630
All right, all right. My
point is, you're a good boy.

278
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,170
You're a sensitive boy. Come home.

279
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,880
Okay? Before you do something stupid,
come home, Hughie.

280
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,510
- I got to go.
- No, wait, Hugh...

281
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,720
Well, I heard we had a meeting.
So, I'll just leave you to it.

282
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,100
Well, we're having a meeting right now,
aren't we, Deep?

283
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,150
You and me.

284
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,780
- Come on in.
- Yeah. Sure.

285
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,960
So, what...?

286
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,800
Or is there... Is there anything I can...
I can do for you, Homelander?

287
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,510
Well, yeah. I guess...

288
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,350
Well, you can help me understand something,
Deep, because...

289
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,270
I don't know, maybe I'm stupid.
Am I stupid, Deep?

290
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,320
What? No.

291
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,860
No. You're not stupid.

292
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,030
You're smart. Very smart, right?

293
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,660
Yeah. Okay.

294
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,290
So, what possible reason...

295
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,840
what razor-sharp fish instinct...

296
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,800
made you run to Stillwell

297
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,260
and tell her what you thought
you saw down there?

298
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,930
All right, look, I thought...
I thought I... I was...

299
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,180
I don't even know... I don't know what
I saw down there, as a matter of fact.

300
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,310
It was, it was really dark and muddy...

301
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,020
The water was really muddy.

302
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,060
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

303
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,940
I didn't...

304
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,570
I didn't really see anything down there,
as a matter of fact.

305
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,700
That's what I thought.

306
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,870
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

307
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,340
And I trust we never have
to have this conversation again.

308
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,340
No. Of course not. Just this once.

309
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,190
Now go fuck Shamu in the blowhole.

310
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,520
Yeah.

311
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,490
Rounds coated in the same carbon
metamaterial as his skin.

312
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,460
Will it work?

313
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,830
Je ne sais pas.

314
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,050
Guys?

315
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,970
What are you doing?
Wait! No, no, no! Wait, wait!

316
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,980
You stupid, fucking asshole.

317
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,780
I'm invincible.

318
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,530
You stupid motherfuckers.

319
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,740
I'm fucking Translucent.

320
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,410
I'm indestructible.

321
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,000
It's only a matter of time before
they come for me. You're fucking dead!

322
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,380
Well, that was great, guys.

323
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,760
That was awesome.

324
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,430
Frenchie, back later.

325
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,760
Where are you going?

326
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,140
Got an idea. Long shot, might help.

327
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,470
Now?

328
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,650
Yeah, well, it's all under
control here, isn't it?

329
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,440
Try not to bugger each other.

330
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,950
Fuck me.

331
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,870
Fuck.

332
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,590
Sorry, Ms. Stillwell.

333
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,400
Are you Anika?

334
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,310
Ms. Stillwell, I didn't
know that you were...

335
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
You look really nice.

336
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,980
Thank you. Could you please show me?

337
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,540
Yeah. We haven't
been able to ping

338
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,650
Translucent's chip until
about five minutes ago.

339
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,020
Well, where is he?

340
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,360
Jersey City.

341
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,190
What the hell is he doing in Jersey City?

342
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,820
Well, he's somewhere
in this ten-block area.

343
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,990
- That is the best you can do?
- It's possible the chip's glitching,

344
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,490
- or there's some kind of interference...
- Okay.

345
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,830
Tell security to search the area,
door-to-door if necessary.

346
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,670
But tell them to be discreet.

347
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,230
He is invisible, so it
shouldn't be that hard.

348
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,750
Okay.

349
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,260
Wow. What a surprise.

350
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,010
A water crime.

351
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,600
Fuck me running. I swear to God, they only
call me when there's trouble at a dock.

352
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,560
Or a river or a lake, canal...

353
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,690
jetty.

354
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,690
Fucking idiots.
I could be doing so much more.

355
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,200
But no, Vought just wants me
to make my big pretty dives into the water

356
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,660
and flash my fucking biceps for Instagram.

357
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,250
I mean, sure, four million hits a day.
Still, it's fucking demeaning.

358
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,670
What's your problem?

359
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,670
You've had that pissy look
on your face all night.

360
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,090
What...?

361
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,140
Is this about the other night again?

362
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,930
Jesus Christ.

363
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,060
Cry me a fucking river, all right?

364
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,150
I took my share of shit
when I first got here, okay?

365
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,110
Besides, you had a crush on me, remember?

366
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,200
That gives you no right, zero right,
to do what you did, you pathetic asshole.

367
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,870
- Hey. You shut your fucking mouth.
- Or what?

368
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,280
You'll sic a grouper on me?

369
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,500
I'll tell everyone you're a psycho.

370
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,210
- I'll go to Homelander.
- No, you won't.

371
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,630
See, I asked around,
you're not number two around here.

372
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,340
You're just the fish guy.

373
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,260
Everyone thinks you're a joke.

374
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,590
Me, most of all.

375
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,680
I cannot believe I fell for your crap.

376
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,520
- You stuck-up little...
- You ever touch me again...

377
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,980
I will burn your eyes out.

378
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,980
Understand me?

379
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,490
We'll finish this later.

380
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,910
You take them from the front,
I'll come in from behind.

381
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,480
I'll always...

382
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,110
Hey.

383
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,070
Hey, boys.

384
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,710
Hurry up. Move faster. You're amazing.
That was so great. That was really good.

385
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,010
- What? What the hell is this?
- Smile for the cameras.

386
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,860
- Yeah, stand over
him and say "This is lit."

387
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,680
- Hey, Jimmy.

388
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,180
Catch my dive in the water?
It was fucking cherry.

389
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,470
Nice.

390
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,100
Smile at the camera, Starlight.

391
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,910
Congrats on your promotion, Susan.

392
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,700
Jesus Christ. Butcher.

393
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,790
Madam Deputy Director?

394
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,920
Wow. Andrew and the kids
must be chuffed for you.

395
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Keep your voice down,
and don't talk about my family.

396
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,380
It makes my skin crawl.

397
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,010
What are you doing here?

398
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,050
Just need a quick dekko
at some of your files.

399
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,350
- My files? What files?
- A couple of Supes.

400
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,020
Big Game, Shout Out.
Translucent, if you got him.

401
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,040
Why Translucent?

402
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,390
Nothing special, just
ticking a few boxes.

403
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,980
So you just broke into my goddamn house
in the middle of the night?

404
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,440
All right.

405
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,660
I'm trying to find a way
to do the job on the cunt,

406
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,780
and if it's anywhere,
it'll be in Mallory's files.

407
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,990
- Now would you like me to keep talking?
- No.

408
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,200
No. Christ. Just don't
fucking say another word.

409
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,750
The Mallory files are dead and buried.

410
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,580
You're the deputy
director of CIA Operations.

411
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,290
- Dig them up.
- No.

412
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,340
- Why not?
- Because of you.

413
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,090
- Me?
- Yes, you.

414
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,880
The director will shitcan anyone
who even goes near those files.

415
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,680
You made it suicide to go after the Supes.

416
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,770
What are you even doing
back involved in this?

417
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,980
I mean, you have a death wish,
or are you a glutton for punishment?

418
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,070
Yeah. A bit of both, I suppose.

419
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,700
Come on... Susan.

420
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,790
Five minutes alone with a piece of paper.

421
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,330
For old time's sakes. No one will know.

422
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,290
You... You're really
trying to sell this shit?

423
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,460
Why, you buying it?

424
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,670
You think I look back fondly
at the times we fucked in bar bathrooms?

425
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Come on. We had a few laughs.

426
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,850
Like the time you sent
me the Edible Arrangement.

427
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,910
And what we had was
you trying to use me, for a

428
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,850
Get Out of Jail Free
card at a time like this.

429
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,060
Well, if that's all it was, then,

430
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,150
what's got you so hot and bothered

431
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,780
when a simple "fuck you" would suffice?

432
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,150
Fuck you.

433
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,490
Now get out of my house.

434
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,670
Did I mention this is life or death?

435
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,010
I'll send an Edible
Arrangement to your funeral.

436
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,530
Hi.

437
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,990
I... I thought you might be thirsty, so...

438
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,550
Well, if you don't
want it, I can always...

439
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,470
No, I want it.

440
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,220
Cheers.

441
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:23,780
So, listen, I need to ask you
some questions about A-Train.

442
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:30,070
When he burst through that woman
the other day,

443
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,450
Robin Ward...

444
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,000
I... I need to know why.

445
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,160
Where was he going? What was he doing?

446
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,460
Why? Was she your sister?

447
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,000
Girlfriend?

448
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,670
Girlfriend.

449
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,510
That's what all this is about? Christ.

450
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,510
What makes you think I know
anything about it?

451
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,050
I know you and A-Train were tight.

452
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,600
- You guys came up together.
- What are you, a fucking fan?

453
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,140
Listen, those two guys in there,
they want to kill you, okay?

454
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,400
- So you give me something, maybe I can...
- What? Hold them off?

455
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Because they hang on your every word.
You're the big man around here.

456
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,690
Okay, you don't want
to talk, don't talk. I tried.

457
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
Good luck.

458
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,950
Buddy, my superpower ain't invisibility.

459
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,620
You know that, right?

460
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,830
It's reading people. Watching
them when they think they're alone.

461
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,010
I see people for who they really are.

462
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,520
I see you, too, pal.

463
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,730
Right.

464
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,940
Because you know me so well, right?

465
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,440
Yeah. I know you're trying your damnedest
to be tough, it's a little adorable...

466
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,990
but the truth is... you're terrified.

467
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,990
Shitting in your tighty-whities

468
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,240
because you're "in over your head fucked",
and you know it.

469
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,400
Hughie, I even kind of feel for you.

470
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,730
Your girl died, and we do crazy shit
when we got broken hearts,

471
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,030
but now every instinct is screaming at you
to head for the hills,

472
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,660
and you should listen to that instinct.

473
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Unless we kill you first.

474
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,660
How?

475
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,580
I got invulnerable skin.

476
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,580
I'm a fucking superhero, guy.

477
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,920
We fight gangs and terrorists.

478
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,420
We save the world daily.

479
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,930
I've stood in front of
thousands of screaming fans,

480
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,970
all of them creaming their jeans.

481
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,890
Who are you?

482
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,190
A water balloon filled...

483
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,980
with blood and meat.

484
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,370
Homelander's gonna find me, and when
he does, he's gonna burst you wide open.

485
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,370
I'm gonna make it
home in time for cocktails.

486
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,250
Because that's who you are,
and that's who I am.

487
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,710
You're not the hero of this story.

488
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,380
And I'm not the one who's trapped.

489
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,050
Well, good luck.

490
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,060
I tried.

491
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,350
Great chat.

492
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,110
Run for the hills, Hughie.

493
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,410
It looks like we're losing him.
The signal's going in and out.

494
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,710
Keep searching,
about another 50 feet down on the right.

495
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,500
Because, thanks to Samaritan's Embrace,
Asim has a bed,

496
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,370
a ventilated cooking area, and a laptop.

497
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,040
But our work is not done.

498
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,880
There are millions more children
just like Asim, who need your help.

499
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,710
For just $9.99 a month,

500
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,300
- that is only 33 cents a day,
- Hi, John. Thanks for your support.

501
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,050
You can give many...

502
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,350
It's what makes this republic so great.

503
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,890
Bill. How are the kids?

504
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,560
Hey.

505
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,850
Give to Samaritan's Embrace today,
and give a child just like Asim...

506
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,440
Could I get a club soda?

507
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,480
Ms. Stillwell.

508
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,530
Senator, what can I get you?

509
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,780
- Jack, rocks.
- You know, we have Macallan 25.

510
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,530
You'd be wasting it. Whisky's whisky to me.

511
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,160
Boy, they're blowing
so much smoke up Maeve's ass,

512
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,630
it's a miracle she
doesn't die of lung cancer.

513
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,920
But you know it's just that, right? Smoke.

514
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,210
I'm sorry?

515
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,470
Everyone loves to bask in their glow,

516
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:45,430
but tomorrow morning no one's
putting Supes into national defence.

517
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,480
It won't get out of committee,
much less hit the floor.

518
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,520
Because God forbid we could have
an advantage in an armed conflict.

519
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,980
You send a Supe over the 38th parallel,
Pyongyang's gonna answer with a nuke.

520
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,440
Then one of my guys will catch it.

521
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,490
You see Robertson over there?

522
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,740
He's got Lockheed in
his state and in his pocket.

523
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,870
McCrea? He's got Fort Bragg
and its couple thousand voters.

524
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,830
No one wants to outsource to you.

525
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,090
America runs on weapons.

526
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,510
Hell, it's one of the only
damn things we still make.

527
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,670
But you are the chairman.

528
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,680
Where do you stand?

529
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,680
Me? I'm just an old leatherneck.

530
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,890
And if I was on the line, scare the
shit out of me to have Homelander there.

531
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,100
My heroes are the most loyal, patriotic...

532
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,350
That's just it.

533
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,440
They're your heroes, aren't they?

534
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,950
Get him a Macallan 25.

535
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,200
Why have average
when you can have extraordinary?

536
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,500
Thank you.

537
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,710
Guys, we should get back to the party.

538
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
- What?
- Elena just ordered more booze.

539
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,430
- Come on, let's go back.
- No, no.

540
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,100
It'll be more fun at the party.
Please... Okay, don't touch me.

541
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,600
No, please, please.

542
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,560
No, no! Stop! No, no, no, no!

543
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,810
Please, no, no, no, no!

544
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,650
- The girl said no.
- Help.

545
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,770
We're all friends here.

546
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,530
Yeah, it's all good. It's fine.

547
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,740
Miss, do me a favour and shut your eyes.

548
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,290
Fucking bitch.

549
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,020
Fucking diamond skin.

550
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,940
- Fuck.
- Merde!

551
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,320
Here.

552
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,570
Here, take it.

553
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,080
What is that?

554
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,330
It will help with your anxiety.

555
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,710
It's LSD and MDMA. This is a candy flip.
It'll smooth you right out. Take it.

556
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:22,800
Thank you, but I don't think
now is the time for a major hallucinogen.

557
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,380
Fais-toi plaisir.

558
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,690
What are you exactly?

559
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,360
Chemist? Engineer? What?

560
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,650
No. I know a little about a lot of things.

561
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,070
I'm a gunrunner by trade, but, as you
can see, I've developed a certain niche.

562
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,660
Killing superheroes?

563
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,740
No.

564
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,290
You can count on one hand
the number of dead superheroes.

565
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,170
Sometimes you can incapacitate them.

566
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,760
Truly, they are magnificent creatures.

567
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Each one with a unique power
that requires a unique solution.

568
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,430
It's... it's never the same twice.

569
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,140
Who pays you to do that?

570
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,060
Whoever can pay.

571
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,110
And when you do kill a Supe,

572
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,450
or, you know, anyone,

573
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,530
what's it like?

574
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,080
You know...

575
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:47,210
I saw this woman once,
in a midtown elevator, 2008.

576
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,880
No more for ten seconds, I see her?

577
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,930
Stunning.

578
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,510
Five-nine.

579
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,270
Hair so black it absorbed
the light, you know?

580
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,850
Tom Ford pencil skirt, Louboutin stilettos.

581
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,440
C'est magnifique.

582
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,440
But she had... she had...

583
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,450
I never forget this, you see.

584
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:16,540
She had dirt under her fingernails
and callouses on her hands,

585
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,830
and I see this and I say, "Strange
for such a refined woman like this."

586
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,130
What, you... You a gardener?

587
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,130
You know, are you a sculptor?
What is this?

588
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,760
And I think about this...

589
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,800
Yeah. I...

590
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,220
I think about her all the time.

591
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,680
She was the first person I ever killed.

592
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,150
I carry...

593
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,650
I carry them all with me.

594
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:53,360
It's like scars in a way, you know?

595
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,210
Okay, senator, you ready?

596
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,960
Yeah.

597
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,840
Darling.

598
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,130
You know I like to watch.

599
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,760
No. Can't always be in control.

600
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,550
Sir.

601
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,510
Then I guess I'll just have
to feel my way through it.

602
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,230
You'll feel good indeed, baby.

603
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,730
- You ready?
- I was born ready.

604
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,070
Feels like butter, baby.

605
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,610
Get ready, sir.

606
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,200
You're going in.

607
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,790
Giddyup, gal. Come on.

608
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,910
God.

609
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,540
That... That feels different.

610
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,970
Hey...

611
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,850
Homelander.

612
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,600
Starlight.

613
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,270
How are you?

614
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,070
I'm good.

615
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,650
Good.

616
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,490
Hey, is that your secret identity?

617
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,450
Charming.

618
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,540
Thanks.

619
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,080
Yeah, I gave up on mine...

620
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,670
a long time ago now.

621
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,800
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

622
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,220
Good night.

623
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,150
No. No, I did not go
through eight rounds of IVF

624
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,900
and bleeding nipples to quit now.

625
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,030
I am doing this. Yes.

626
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:01,450
That little kid is gonna drink my
goddamn milk if it's the last thing I do.

627
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,560
While scientists
now believe the shell evolved

628
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,980
to help turtles burrow underground...

629
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,750
What are you doing?

630
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,920
Shocking our invisible friend.

631
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,420
I need him unconscious.

632
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,880
Why?

633
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,090
Because I got it.

634
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,680
Now what the fuck do you want?

635
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,770
What the fuck, Starlight?!

636
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,430
What?

637
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,900
- Shit.
- Yeah.

638
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,030
Shit.

639
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:21,240
And so glad you did it in plain clothes,
so you could blow your secret identity.

640
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,620
Here. "OMG. I recognise Starlight,
that's Annie January!

641
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,160
I went to Hoover High with her.
Hashtag 'SheWasBulimic."'

642
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,340
One, this was stupid.

643
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,630
Two, it was really
stupid to do it on camera.

644
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,340
Always look for cameras.

645
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,760
- They were about to rape a girl.
- What girl?

646
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,020
There's no girl in that
video. You get a name?

647
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:46,850
No, she ran off.

648
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,600
Great. She ran off. Great.

649
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,180
Always get a fucking
name, Starlight. Always!

650
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,400
Well... They said...

651
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,860
They said she was a friend.

652
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,400
It was date rape, I think.

653
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,070
Great. Well, she hasn't come forward
and, statistically, she's not likely to.

654
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,570
So all we really have is two Delta Betas

655
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,990
who insist they were just
getting drunk in an alley

656
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,580
until you beat them unconscious.

657
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,370
They're lying! I...

658
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,160
Aren't I innocent until proven guilty?

659
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,040
When you're in the
big leagues, you flip it.

660
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:23,430
I don't know what you were planning
on doing today, with your little, cute day,

661
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,260
but you have to cancel everything, okay?

662
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,350
You're gonna have meetings with
Risk Assessment, with Crisis Management,

663
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,140
with Legal.

664
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,140
Jerry is gonna lose his shit!

665
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,690
Fuck.

666
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,690
Am...

667
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,900
Are they gonna fire me?

668
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,240
Just be in Stillwell's office at 10:00.

669
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,950
But...

670
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,070
Am I fired?

671
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,330
Senator, I very much appreciate
you coming bright and early.

672
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,910
I realise how busy you were last night.

673
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,720
These... are fake.

674
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,430
I think we both know they're not.

675
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,850
Look. I was with a young woman, all right?

676
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,180
Of legal age.

677
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,560
Her name was Rhonda.

678
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,100
So this isn't possible.

679
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,560
They've obviously
been doctored or something.

680
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,320
I'm sorry, they are authentic.

681
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,650
I should know. I was there.

682
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,440
You what?

683
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,750
You shiver when you orgasm, sir.

684
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,410
Jesus.

685
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,500
That will be all, Doppelganger.

686
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,630
Who the fuck is he?

687
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:46,050
Anyway, I would love to continue
our conversation from last night.

688
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,050
This is some dirty fucking pool, Madelyn.

689
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,680
You're really gonna
clutch your pearls, senator?

690
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,390
I don't think either
one of us is that naive.

691
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,810
Yeah. It's not...

692
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,900
it's not fatal to be homosexual these days.

693
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,030
It is in Oklahoma, sir.

694
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,070
Where your voters live.

695
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:13,080
Even if I get the bill out of committee,
nobody's gonna vote for it on the floor.

696
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,750
No one wants your
fucking Supes in the Army.

697
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,370
We'll see.

698
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,960
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

699
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,470
Homelander.

700
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,850
Welcome to Crime Analytics.

701
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,680
- Can... Would you like a Red Bull?
- Have you found Translucent yet?

702
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,600
No. But Security's on it.

703
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,270
He's been missing over 24 hours.

704
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,740
Is he in danger?

705
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,780
Do... you even know?

706
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,490
Forget it. I'll find him myself.

707
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,160
- What's his last known position, please?
- Why don't I just call Ms. Stillwell?

708
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,500
- And I...
- No.

709
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,120
No, no, no, no, no. You're talking to me.

710
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:04,090
Well, I'm not sure I'm
supposed to be talking to...

711
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,380
What's your name?

712
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,760
- Anika.
- Anika.

713
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,800
- Sir.
- It's a beautiful name.

714
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,800
Listen, Anika.

715
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,010
I'm the Homelander.

716
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,730
And I can do whatever the fuck I want.

717
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,140
Okay?

718
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,020
Now...

719
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,860
Translucent's last known position.

720
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,740
Please.

721
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,040
What the...?

722
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,370
- Something doesn't feel right.
- I'll bet.

723
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,170
I'm not ashamed to admit
I have outdone myself.

724
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,050
Now, the problem is the skin, no?
It's hard like diamonds.

725
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,890
But then I realised,
it is just your shell that is hard?

726
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,850
Like a turtle.

727
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,890
But your insides...

728
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,310
they're like the rest of ours...

729
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,520
soft.

730
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,900
So, how do you get to
the... squishy insides?

731
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,030
Through the mouth? Non.

732
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,240
The stomach acid, the gag reflex.

733
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,950
If I stick something down your throat,
you may vomit it up.

734
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,580
There's truly only one way...

735
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,960
The fuck did you do to me?

736
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,750
He stuck a lump of
plastique up your bum, son.

737
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,800
Ass bomb.

738
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,590
My God.

739
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,720
Now...

740
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,520
you stick a little finger up there
and try and fish it out...

741
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,140
bang.

742
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:48,690
I trigger this, also bang. Savvy?

743
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,650
Please don't kill me.

744
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,320
I'll do anything.

745
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,370
I'll tell you about A-Train.

746
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,740
That's what the kid wants, right?

747
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,200
I don't know where A-Train was going
that night he killed the girl, okay?

748
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,670
- But I know where he was coming from.
- What? Where?

749
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,330
Popclaw's.

750
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,300
He fucking... loves her. He doesn't
think anyone else knows, but I know.

751
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,760
I know a lot of things.

752
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,340
He's there every night.

753
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,680
Maybe... now, even.

754
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,970
Popclaw? That's the hero with the
sharp things coming out of her arms.

755
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,470
Yeah. Real D-lister.

756
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,930
Anyone knows what A-Train was doing,
it's Popclaw.

757
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,230
But that's all I know about
that, I swear to Christ.

758
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,730
But I'll tell you anything else you want.

759
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,400
Just ask.

760
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just... ask anything.

761
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:44,000
Now, normally,
that would be just what the doctor ordered.

762
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,830
But unfortunately, for you...

763
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,170
we're out of time.

764
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,920
No.

765
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,130
No!

766
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,340
Please! Listen, I know shit.

767
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,420
Dark shit! All the way to the top!

768
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,590
Wait, wait! No, no, no!
Please, wait, wait, wait.

769
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,390
Listen, I can help you. I'm
fucking invisible! We can be a team.

770
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:03,470
- Butcher!
- No, please, please, please!

771
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,850
- Please, I can...
- A moment, s'il vous plait.

772
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,190
Here.

773
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,110
What is that?

774
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,280
Homelander.

775
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,570
That's Homelander?

776
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,620
Homelander's here? Shit.

777
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,370
Shit!

778
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:28,080
He can see us. He's got X-ray vision.
He can see through the fucking roof.

779
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,120
And super fucking hearing.

780
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,920
You pull that detonator, he will hear.

781
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,840
Homelander.

782
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,140
We got to throw him off the scent.

783
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,220
But how?

784
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,560
Pittsburgh.

785
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,440
You cannot be serious?

786
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,690
Deadly.

787
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,270
You know how much this will cost me?

788
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,570
Put it on the tab.

789
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,120
Guys?!

790
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,130
Where is it?

791
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,050
Back door panel.

792
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,720
Look, the mall shooting's a tragedy.

793
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,650
I'm just saying, if more
people were armed,

794
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,730
maybe I wouldn't have
to save the day every time.

795
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,440
- So, in a situation...
- Hello?

796
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,060
Cherie. It's a burn.

797
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,730
You're joking.

798
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,860
Now?

799
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,150
No joke, I'm afraid.

800
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,240
Fine.

801
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,910
I'll be ready in three.

802
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,710
Come on.

803
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,980
Frenchie, I'm getting
shit reception here.

804
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,540
Well, figure it the fuck out?

805
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,090
Come on.

806
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,290
Evening.

807
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,630
Holy shit. You're the Homelander.

808
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,040
I am talking to the Homelander.

809
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,800
Sir, I need to see some ID.

810
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,760
Get the fuck back in that cage.

811
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,140
Just take it easy. Okay?

812
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,760
What you doing out here?

813
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,720
This is my place.

814
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:54,060
We... I'm... I'm opening a Fogo de Chão.

815
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,150
You know what a churrascaria is?

816
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,060
Yeah. It's a Brazilian steakhouse.

817
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,650
Sir, I need to see in the back of the van.

818
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,490
No offence, you got a...
warrant or something?

819
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,830
Well, if you got nothing back there,
then you got nothing to worry about, right?

820
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,870
Please get back in the cage.

821
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:21,630
I'm not getting back in that cage, man.
I do, I am dead.

822
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,920
Yeah, well, if you don't... you're dead.

823
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:56,660
Just think. You kill me, they'll
never stop looking for you.

824
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:00,290
You'll be glancing over your shoulder
your whole life

825
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,380
until they find you, which they will.

826
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:18,100
Everything all right, sir?

827
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,250
Look, you let me go...

828
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,380
you'll be the hero that saved Translucent.

829
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,180
It's not too late.

830
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,590
You can still go home.

831
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,760
Back to your life.

832
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,810
Attaboy.

833
