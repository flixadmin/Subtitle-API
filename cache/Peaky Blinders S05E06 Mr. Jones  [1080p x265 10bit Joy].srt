1
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,840
You prefer Irish to Scotch.

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,680
Yes, Mr Churchill.

3
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,200
Irish over Scotch.

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,680
Cigarettes over Havana cigars.

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,920
And your mother
was probably born in a tent.

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,360
Grandmother in a tent,

7
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,160
me mother on a narrowboat.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,760
And always happy to give smart answers
to men born better than you.

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,240
A man needs to prove he is better than me

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,720
rather than show me his birth certificate.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
See, I don't have one,
so they mean very little to me.

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,720
You speak beautifully in the House.

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Thank you.

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,600
And believe not a word
of what you are saying.

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,240
Conviction introduces emotion,
which is the enemy of oratory.

16
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,280
You read Greek literature.

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,360
I have trouble sleeping.

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,600
Is there a reason for your visit,
Mr Churchill?

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,280
You are forming an alliance
with a fascist.

20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,160
So, I made some inquiries
amongst the worst people in Whitehall.

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,840
And I found out that you are not
forming an alliance with him at all.

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,120
You are spying on him.

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,800
Yes.

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Why?

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,480
The honest answer is...

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm no longer sure.

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you dig your own garden, Mr Shelby?

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,240
I have a gardener.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
In fact, I have three gardeners.

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,080
Three generations of men with no ambition
who are happier than I will ever be.

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,080
Well, if you ask them,

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,080
they will tell you that there are
certain species of weed,

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,800
no matter how much you tug at them,
poison them, they continue to grow back.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,560
In the end, the only solution

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,240
is to plough up the top soil,
create a field of mud

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,400
and blow up and burn the exposed taproots.

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,240
That's what you and I did in France.

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,000
But when I hear that man Mosley speak,

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,440
I see the green shoots of another war
growing up around his feet.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,320
And you see exactly the same thing I do.

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,920
That's why you oppose him.

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,200
Yeah. Your mystery solved.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,320
What is your strategy?

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,880
I won't burden you with it.

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,600
You're going to break the law.

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,360
I need to sleep.

47
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,880
You said you don't sleep.

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,520
I said I have trouble sleeping.

49
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
As do I.

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,760
As do I.

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,920
Mr Shelby,

52
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,120
I have no doubt
that there was once a time in Flanders

53
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,000
when you were under the ground
and I was above it,

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,000
both working to the same end.

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,440
We are in the same exact situation,
here in Westminster.

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,640
Do what you have to do, Mr Shelby.

57
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,080
And if you need anything, call me.

58
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,959
There are some times, some nights,

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,960
when I don't see the point
of carrying on with any of it.

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
Hmm.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,840
That old dance routine.

62
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,360
I put out a cigar,
and an hour later, I want another.

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,920
Sometimes, the bridge between hours
is as fragile as that.

64
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,720
But use it anyway.

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,000
A tent, then a boat,
then a house, now a mansion.

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,920
That's something, isn't it?

67
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
Yeah, that is something.

68
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,800
By the way,

69
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,200
was it you who killed that
Ulsterman intelligence officer?

70
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,400
I forget his name.

71
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
-Major Campbell.
-Yes.

72
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,880
-Campbell.
-No.

73
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,200
It was me aunt.

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,760
I really must come up
to Birmingham someday

75
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,920
and spend an evening with your family.

76
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,800
They sound interesting.

77
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,360
Yes. We'd like that.

78
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,840
I got to Harold French refereeing
Liverpool. He just wants cash.

79
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,600
Tom the tatter, reffing
Sheffield Wednesday,

80
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,880
wants cash and a beating
for a bloke who's screwing his wife.

81
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,200
Clap doctor said
go easy on the whiskey, yeah?

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,040
Finn.

83
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,880
You don't knock?

84
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,800
No, Finn.

85
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,600
I don't knock.

86
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,400
All right.

87
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,440
Hello, Billy.

88
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,880
-How are you, mate?
-Good, Mr Shelby.

89
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,320
Yeah, you look good.

90
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,400
-That's a nice suit.
- Thank you, Mr Shelby.

91
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,560
He earned that suit.

92
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,760
We made more on the matches
than we did on the races last Saturday.

93
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,480
-He's a good man.
-Yeah, I know that. Mmm.

94
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,840
You're coming up in the world. I like it.

95
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,080
How's the missus? Hmm?

96
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,120
The old trouble and strife,
as the Cockneys like to call it.

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,560
She moved out.

98
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,760
Oh. That's a shame.

99
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,960
Why don't I join you, eh?

100
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,720
Why don't I join the party?
Look at this. Having some fun. Hmm?

101
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
You were a good man, Billy.

102
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,360
You're a good man. Hmm?

103
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,400
You could sing like a bird in a cage.

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,640
What did we do, eh?

105
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,360
We opened that cage
and the real man flies out.

106
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Reveals himself.

107
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,720
The truth is young, Billy boy.

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,880
Yeah. Yeah, look.

109
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,320
What've we got here? Look.

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,560
Look at that, Billy boy, eh?
We got some snow here, look.

111
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,920
Oh, there's some more.
Look, snowflakes, Billy.

112
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,680
Now, I know you like that. Hmm?

113
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,520
Well, I do, too. So I'll tell you what.

114
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,800
Why don't we have
a little line together, eh?

115
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,640
Why don't we do
a little bit of snow together?

116
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,560
-Ooh.

117
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,560
Oh. I spilled it all down you an' all.
Messy, ain't I? Sorry, mate.

118
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,560
What can I do? I'm messy, ain't I?
Billy, I do apologise.

119
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
And you.

120
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,640
Hmm?

121
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
Look at you.

122
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,600
Sitting here with your mate,
eh, your best mate.

123
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,080
Well, while you're sitting here
talking about our business,

124
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,360
drinking whisky,
smoking and sniffing, hmm?

125
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,480
I'm working.

126
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,680
You remember, you tell this man
about our family business...

127
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,640
and it's his life you're risking.

128
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,560
'Cause people talk, Finn. Hmm?

129
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,720
We... we only ever talk about
football and women, Mr Shelby.

130
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,960
Football and women. We only
ever talk about football and women.

131
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,880
- Oh, do you?
-Yeah.

132
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,640
Hmm.

133
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,760
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

134
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,640
Come.

135
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,680
Family meeting. Let's go.

136
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,440
You're not eating right.

137
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,800
Getting the natural things in you, boy.
That's what it is.

138
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
Always.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
You bearing up, Arthur?

140
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Bearing up for what?

141
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,000
Bearing up to be free, Pol.

142
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,560
Another glass, eh?

143
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,600
Another glass of "so what".

144
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,880
Are you all right, Charlie?

145
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Mad bastard Barney kicked me in the shin
when I woke him up.

146
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Where is the mad bastard?

147
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,800
He's tied to a lamppost outside
with three Lee boys,

148
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,840
-shitting themselves.

149
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Right.

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,080
First of all,

151
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,200
an apology from Lizzie. She can't be here.

152
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,000
Charles has a violin concert.

153
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,920
Also, welcome to Mr Aberama Gold.

154
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,560
He and Polly are to be married
in three weeks with my blessing.

155
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,720
From now on,
Aberama will be welcome at our meetings.

156
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,440
First item of business: a bereavement.

157
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,120
Colonel Ben Younger,

158
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,560
who may perhaps have
become a member of this family,

159
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,520
was taken from us,
four days ago, by dark forces.

160
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,040
We've made some investigations.
We think we know who planted the bomb.

161
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,800
In the meantime,
our thoughts are with Ada,

162
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,040
and the baby inside of her,

163
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,440
who may one day
sit at these meetings, but...

164
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,240
hopefully under happier circumstances.

165
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,840
-Let's drink to happier circumstances.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,440
Right.

167
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,280
-To Ada.
- Ada!

168
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,920
-To Ada.
- Ada.

169
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,320
Item number two:
an announcement regarding Michael.

170
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,560
Before you go on, Tommy,

171
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,160
there's something I'd like to say
to the whole family directly

172
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,040
regarding finances
and the future of this company.

173
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,240
According to your own estimations,

174
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,040
this new venture
of the delivery and shipment of opium

175
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,080
will bring into the company
around £2 million per year.

176
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,360
Therefore, due to the amounts involved,

177
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,160
I think this company
should be restructured.

178
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,080
Michael.

179
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,960
I think this can wait
till outside the family meeting.

180
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,400
Restructured in what way?

181
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,360
Because of the amounts
of money involved,

182
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,040
shipment and dispatch

183
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,920
will become the primary source
of income to the company.

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,600
It's simple mathematics.

185
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,680
With the help of my wife,
I will organise an expansion into America,

186
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,400
where the narcotics business
is just beginning to grow.

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,360
I have very good contacts in Detroit,

188
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,400
New York, Boston,
who I've already spoken to about this.

189
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,800
And Gina has family who are
very experienced in this kind of business.

190
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,760
According to the conversations
I've had with them,

191
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,040
with a regular supply
of pure opium from China,

192
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,920
within a short space of time,

193
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,320
the American narcotics business
will bring in $20 million per annum.

194
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,760
Enough money for you to all enjoy
an easing of the burden you all now feel.

195
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,520
See, I know that the scars and the wounds,

196
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,040
they're on the inside, not on the outside.

197
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,560
And as a member of the new generation,

198
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,000
I am able to take that great burden
off your weary shoulders.

199
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,080
A new decade is coming.

200
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,680
There will be new opportunities
and new territories,

201
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,680
more money than we've ever had before.

202
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,480
Tommy,

203
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,560
you can still do the good work
that deep down you want to do.

204
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,000
Mum, you can get married
and live in that big house.

205
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,800
Arthur, you can be the man
that Linda wants you to be.

206
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,920
Fuck Linda.

207
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Finn.

208
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,760
You've proved yourself.

209
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,520
You're part of the new generation.

210
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,520
You could come to New York with me.

211
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Here is my proposal.

212
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,280
A full restructuring of the company.

213
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,880
I will be managing director...

214
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,760
and you can be non-executive chairman.

215
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,040
But under an assumed name
to protect your reputation.

216
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,080
I found the name of a dead man.
You will be registered as Mr Jones.

217
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,480
You will each receive a percentage
of the profits as an annuity.

218
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,000
And you will no longer have to engage
in any of the associated activities.

219
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,920
Take a look at the future, Tommy.

220
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,120
At least read it with an open mind.

221
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,320
It's cold in here, Michael.

222
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,160
Tommy, the Americans want to deal with me.

223
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,760
-Item number three--
- Tell him the truth.

224
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,160
Go on.

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,040
He can take it.

226
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,960
Tell me the truth, Michael.

227
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,280
The Americans don't want to deal

228
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,680
with an old-fashioned
backstreet razor gang.

229
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,680
Those days are done.

230
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,560
Tommy, he's bitten
through the fucking rope.

231
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,360
They've got him cornered,
but they need help.

232
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,800
Go and get him!

233
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,800
Fuck the Americans.

234
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

235
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,000
It's time...

236
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,760
and you know it.

237
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,760
Tommy, Mum's leaving.
John's dead. Arthur needs help.

238
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,800
Ada's man was killed in your own backyard
because you fucked up.

239
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,040
Go on, Tom.

240
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,000
Go on, cut me.

241
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,600
Like the good old days.

242
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Or...

243
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,080
see this for what it is.

244
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,120
A natural succession
that someday must happen.

245
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,840
I gave you an opportunity, Michael.
You betrayed me.

246
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
Don't be here when I get back.

247
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
You.

248
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,080
-You can tell your family--
-Let me guess.

249
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,960
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

250
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,360
Right?

251
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well...

252
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,600
...guess we're gonna be forced
to take the second option.

253
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,240
They're not fucking voices!

254
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,360
Whoa! Whoa.

255
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,480
Calm down.

256
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,480
Put the gun down.

257
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,240
- They're not fucking voices!
-Barney!

258
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,839
Barney!

259
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,960
Put down the gun. At ease.

260
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,119
Finn.

261
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,000
At ease, soldier. At ease.

262
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,319
-Look at me. They're on our side.

263
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,319
You're at home. You're at home.

264
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,760
-Yeah? Yeah.

265
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:36,000
-Here. Take this, Barney. Jeremiah.

266
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,720
Yeah.

267
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,560
Take him to Charlie's yard
before he falls over.

268
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,880
The devil will now be an angel.

269
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,240
Isiah, Curly, you go with him.

270
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,000
Come, brother.
Let me give you the good news.

271
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,400
Jesus loves you.

272
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,880
So, where the fuck is he?

273
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,000
All right, boys.

274
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,160
Subsidiary meeting of the generation
that actually do the work.

275
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Right.

276
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,840
Let's have the good stuff.
None of that shit the punters drink.

277
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,840
Here we go.

278
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,720
All right, item number three:
an introduction.

279
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,720
Except, now, you've already met the man
I was gonna introduce.

280
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,440
In France, he was a comrade.

281
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,440
- What the fuck is he now, Tom?
-He's a man we can use, Johnny.

282
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,680
For what? Put him in a ring
with a bear and take bets on the outcome?

283
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,200
I tell you, I wouldn't put much money
on the fucking bear.

284
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,400
Aberama... that man
is a trained Royal Marines sniper.

285
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,240
Furthermore, he has a criminal profile

286
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,600
which will make his actions
explicable to the police.

287
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,520
What actions?

288
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
A killing.

289
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,280
And since when
did you worry about the police?

290
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,520
Barney Thomason

291
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,160
is gonna kill an MP.

292
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,640
Possibly the future prime minister
of Great Britain.

293
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,480
What the fuck, Tom?

294
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,160
After the killing,

295
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,120
there will be an investigation
by Special Branch and intelligence forces.

296
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,880
There'll be a lot of powerful people
as angry as fucking hornets.

297
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,760
We need there to be no connection to us.

298
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,880
Barney Thomason is registered
as criminally insane.

299
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,920
He broke out. He's an old soldier.

300
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,320
He has known grievances.

301
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,440
No one will question
that the assassination was carried out

302
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,560
by a single gunman acting alone.

303
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,240
And you'd sacrifice an old comrade?

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,240
If they catch him, they won't hang him,
on grounds of insanity.

305
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,840
Just send him back to where I found him.

306
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,480
He'll have had a very eventful holiday

307
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,400
that he'll probably believe
never really happened.

308
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,040
And where will this killing take place?

309
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There you go.

310
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,680
He'll be onstage.

311
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,840
With lots...

312
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,320
of witnesses.

313
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,320
During the rally, there will be
an anti-fascist demonstration.

314
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,360
Amidst the confusion,
a shot will be fired.

315
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,400
-And we're organising this demonstration?
- Yeah.

316
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,160
Where will you be, Tom?

317
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,960
I'll be down on one knee,
cradling his head

318
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,560
while the life drains from him.

319
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,680
And I'll make a speech,

320
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,360
saying how the cause he died for
must continue.

321
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,400
Continue safe in my hands.

322
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,800
Holy fuck.

323
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,760
Tommy, does your ambition have no limits?

324
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,120
Jimmy McCavern will be
running security at this event.

325
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,640
He'll probably be in the wings.

326
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,480
You can take his life,
whichever manner you choose.

327
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,640
What do you want us to do, Tom?

328
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,160
You and Arthur
and a couple of the Lee boys

329
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,960
will be in charge
of getting Barney into position.

330
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,600
He'll be up in the lighting gantry.

331
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,160
-We'll need chains and a twitch, Tom.
-No, I will medicate him.

332
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,760
So he's gonna be cross-eyed
when he takes his shot.

333
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,240
In France, he never missed.

334
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,800
No matter what they gave him.

335
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He'll have had plenty of target practice.

336
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,320
Before he takes the shot,
Arthur here will give him some cocaine.

337
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,640
-Sharpen him up.
- So, just...

338
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
You're gonna be up on the stage

339
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,240
while this criminally-insane gunman
filled with cocaine

340
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,680
takes aim at a man
just a yard away from you?

341
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,320
Welcome to the family, Aberama.

342
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,600
What about me, Thomas?
The man with the broken fucking leg.

343
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,320
After the killing,

344
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,240
every copper in Birmingham
will be sent to Bingley Hall.

345
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,040
Use that opportunity

346
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,600
to get that boat full of opium
up to Stourbridge Locks.

347
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,080
There, you'll be met
by some Chinese gentlemen.

348
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
They will have two suitcases full of cash.

349
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,480
£250,000.

350
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,640
Every man in this room will receive
£30,000 in cash

351
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,680
in recognition of extra services.

352
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,800
Holy Mary, mother of God, Tom.
Good man.

353
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,400
Anyone who wants
to leave, leave now.

354
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:59,480
Anyone who is tired of this old-fashioned,
backstreet fucking razor gang can leave.

355
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,360
Anyone who is tired can fucking stop.

356
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Good.

357
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Charlie, go to the yard and light a fire.

358
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,160
Johnny, bring the van around.

359
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,120
What's the fire for, Tom?

360
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,120
There is an item number four.

361
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,760
It's time.

362
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,000
Jeez, Mr Shelby.

363
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Well, if I'd known, I'd have come in early
and served you drinks, huh?

364
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,720
Here, Micky.

365
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,000
Sit down there.

366
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,880
Sure, I'll have a drink, will I?

367
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,440
Here you go, have a drink.

368
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,000
A few days ago, I went to London, Micky...

369
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,040
...to collect some cargo.

370
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,440
I was met by the Titanic boys.

371
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,840
Hmm.

372
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,360
They knew I was coming. Hmm.

373
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
Yeah.

374
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,960
When, where... what time.

375
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,480
They even knew the cargo I was picking up.

376
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,400
Jesus.

377
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,720
Four days ago, Micky,

378
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,840
a soldier was killed outside my office
by a bomb.

379
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Yeah, erm... the papers said
that was the IRA.

380
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,120
-That wasn't the IRA, Micky.
-No. It weren't the IRA, Micky.

381
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,720
I spoke to the girls who work
at the Digbeth telephone exchange.

382
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,920
They're friends of mine.

383
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
I asked 'em...

384
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,160
what calls were made
around the time of the explosion.

385
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,640
They told me that...

386
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,000
30 minutes before the explosion,
a call was made to a man in Sparkhill

387
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,880
who has connections
to the Ulster Volunteer Force.

388
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
He now offers his services for cash.

389
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,880
Paddy Rose.

390
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,280
Yeah, me and me brother,
we spoke to Paddy at length.

391
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,600
He told us it was him
that planted the bomb.

392
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,760
Yeah, we spoke to him.

393
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,520
We killed him, Micky.

394
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,760
Paddy Rose is dead.

395
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,160
We weighed him down...

396
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,440
we sunk him...
to the bottom of the Grand Union Canal.

397
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,160
The girls at the exchange
gave me the number

398
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,760
of the man that called, Micky,
before the explosion.

399
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,000
That was your number.

400
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Micky...

401
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,560
it was you who called him,
who tipped him off.

402
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,880
You were told to call him

403
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,920
if a black man of a certain description
ever came to Small Heath.

404
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,320
We know you've been giving
the Titanic boys information as well.

405
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,480
Hmm?

406
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,600
We know that.

407
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,720
Yeah.

408
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,840
You've been working behind the bar, hmm?

409
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,160
Seeing what goes on,
listening, taking notes,

410
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,880
and selling your stories
to the highest bidder. Hmm?

411
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,640
Come on.

412
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,360
Come on, man.

413
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,840
I am sorry, Mr Shelby.

414
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,320
Don't look at Tommy.

415
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,520
The ceiling'd be cheaper, brother.

416
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,760
Micky!

417
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,280
Fucking hell, Arthur.

418
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,920
Eh?

419
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,640
Shaking like the hand of a normal man.

420
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,720
What about item five, Tom? Hmm?

421
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,640
There is an item five,
right? Tommy?

422
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,160
I'm fucking sinking here, man.

423
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,760
I'm fucking sinking, Tom.

424
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,400
You said there's an item five.
Say it, Tommy.

425
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,400
Maybe item five can start now, Tommy.

426
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,720
It could start this year, a new decade,

427
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,520
but Michael... Michael could be right.
We could go, Tommy. We could go.

428
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,560
We could fucking leave this place.
Leave it to the kids.

429
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,920
Michael is... He might be right.

430
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,920
-He might be fucking right--
-Arthur, there is no item number five!

431
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
Go and check
that Polly is still on our side.

432
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,400
I have to go to Margate.

433
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,920
All right, Tom.

434
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,200
All right, brother.

435
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,160
<i>♪ I got one more wish before I die ♪</i>

00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,760

441
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
Yeah. I'm here.

442
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,920
I was just having some oil rubbed
into the bits that really hurt, mate.

443
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,280
What do you think of that view, eh?

444
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,840
It's Margate. What can you do?

-I'll tell you something, Tommy, right,

447
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,960
I sit all day, every day,
in that chair on that balcony,

448
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,240
contemplating the fact, right,

449
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,520
that life is so much easier to deal with
when you are dead.

450
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,120
Hello, Alfie.

451
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,440
Yeah. Did you...
Did you look through the binoculars?

452
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,360
Yeah.

453
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,480
I watch ships. No two are the same. Yeah.

454
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,640
That is how God sees us both in his eyes.

455
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,560
"God", eh?

456
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,240
Yeah, sort of. I mean, you know...

457
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,280
Someone's responsible
for all this fucking mess.

458
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,520
Now, how soon did you know
that I was not dead?

459
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,480
-You wrote me a letter, Alfie.
-Did I?

460
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,520
Yeah, you asked about your dog.

461
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,800
Oh. They gave me a lot of drugs
at first, yeah...

462
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,840
I was lying out there,
and the tide come in and woke me up.

463
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I remember looking around
and thinking, you know,

464
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,880
"Fuck.

465
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,400
If this is hell...

466
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,040
then it looks a lot like Margate."

467
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,880
Maybe that's just what
hell looks like, eh?

468
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,840
No. No. Not according
to this holy book right here, yeah.

469
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,080
It gives a very, very vivid description.

470
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,560
You and I are both fucked, mate.

471
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,680
-You read the papers, Alfie?
-No. Don't be silly.

472
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
-But you've heard.
-What? Fascism, yeah?

473
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Three, two, one...

474
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,240
bang.

475
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,880
No?

476
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,560
Fine.

477
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,240
Good Lord, your fucking condition
has got worse, mate.

478
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Mine, on the other hand, I...
I've been living the dream.

479
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,480
Sometimes, I will shoot
at the side of a ship,

480
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,200
and sometimes, I'll sit here,
I may shoot at the old seagull.

481
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Alfie...

482
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,920
I'm gonna shoot Oswald Mosley.

483
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,680
Right. Well...

484
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,960
I hope you do a better job on him
than the one you done on me, yeah?

485
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,680
I mean, what were you thinking?
Was your mind somewhere else, Tommy?

486
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,560
Yes, it was, actually.

487
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,840
-Yeah. All right.

488
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,160
Oh, look.

489
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,520
A ship.

490
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,800
Why do you want to shoot him?

491
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,520
I need to organise a riot, Alfie.

492
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,520
All right.

493
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,440
And I hear you still have some...
standing in the Jewish community.

494
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,680
Let me be clear, all right?

495
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:19,800
Since my resurrection,
I am considered to be a god, all right?

496
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,600
In the Holy Land,
someone has made an image of me

497
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,639
out of rock embedded in the sand,
so I am told,

498
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,679
and I am planning to make a pilgrimage
to stand in my own shadow.

499
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,239
Are you gonna shoot him
because this man is evil?

500
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,480
I need men who can fight.

501
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,600
Mosley uses men from Glasgow.

502
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,639
So, if the men causing the trouble
are Jewish, it will be... explicable.

503
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,120
Since when do you
need explanations, Tommy?

504
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,120
Since I entered politics.

505
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:00,920
Oh, that's right, yeah. Oh, yeah.
And how has that been for you, Tom?

506
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,240
Gangs, wars, truces...
Nothing I didn't already know.

507
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:16,960
So, you think if you kill him,
you will kill the message, yeah?

508
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,360
I will kill the man,
then I will kill the message.

509
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,960
How much you paying?

510
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,880
Thought you might do it
for the cause, Alfie.

511
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,360
Go on, fuck off.

512
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,400
Each man will get £20. You'll get £5,000.

513
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,520
You know, as a god, Tommy, right,

514
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,360
I am now able to just rise
above those kinds of insults, mate.

515
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,440
-Ten?
-Hmm.

516
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,840
How is my dog?

517
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,040
-Your dog is fine.
-Hmm.

518
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,880
In that case, ten should be enough.
Where do you want the men?

519
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,880
Birmingham.

520
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,120
No. No.

521
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,520
That 20 will not be enough for my lads
to step inside that fucking shithole.

522
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,360
It'll have to be 25, at least.

523
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,200
Twenty-five it is.
You can take your dog back then, eh?

524
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,080
No, it is better for him
to think that I am still dead.

525
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,360
As it is also with the police.

526
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,440
All right.

527
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,760
So, you're still at it, eh, Tommy? Hmm.

528
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,880
Ain't got no Margate to go to.

529
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,960
No.

530
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,480
I have no interest in shooting seagulls.

531
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,440
Oh, but you have in shooting
cabinet ministers.

532
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,400
Yeah.

533
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,480
And their paid informants.

534
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,400
Mmm.

535
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,200
I was on a lot of drugs at first, right,

536
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,880
due to the pain, you know,
on account of it...

537
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,720
well, you know,
being shot in the face by some cunt.

538
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,960
I won't bore you with the details.
It'd chill ya.

539
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,360
Nonetheless, I had a recurring dream.

540
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,600
I saw you in a field, right,
with a big black horse,

541
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,560
and you said, "Goodbye", and then, bang.

542
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,640
All right, then, well...

543
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,520
what now?

544
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,240
I will continue...

545
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,000
till I find a man...

546
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,320
that I can't defeat.

547
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,080
Hmm.

548
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,240
Arthur asked whose side I was on.

549
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,600
There will be a war
and one of you will die.

550
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,240
But which one, I cannot tell.

551
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,920
Hmm.

552
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,280
He's gonna do it anyway.

553
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,440
Yeah.

554
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,520
You should know,

555
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,720
if Aberama takes his side,
I will kill him.

556
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,840
What about me?

557
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,960
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

558
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,920
Kill and kill...

559
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,960
The only way to make people listen.

560
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,080
Soon, you will have a stage to stand on,

561
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,200
millions of people will listen to you,

562
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,160
and you will run the country
like you run this family.

563
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,520
It appears to be what people want.

564
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,720
But not me.

565
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,120
Not anymore.

566
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,800
My resignation.

If it's Barney
you're worried about, he's sleeping.

580
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,080
But I can't sleep,
'cause my fucking leg is cracked.

581
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,040
Tell me how me mother went, Charlie.

582
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,120
You know. She drowned.

583
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,080
I know it wasn't by accident.

584
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,680
-Tell me the truth, Charlie.
-The truth, Tommy, yeah?

585
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,920
The fucking truth.

586
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,880
Fuck's sake.

587
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,080
She just stepped into the canal.

588
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,040
Your dad was no use.

589
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,240
It was me trying to stop her
for three days.

590
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,200
In the end, she did it anyway.

591
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,720
-Did she say why?
-Nothing that made sense.

592
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,160
Tell me the things that didn't make sense.

593
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,440
She said it were the gypsies
made the nails for Jesus' cross,

594
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,400
and that's why we're cursed and restless.

595
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,600
Yeah, go on.

596
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,480
You have to move around
or the guilt catches up with you.

597
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,600
I said, "Well, why not go
on the road for a bit?"

598
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,560
She went to Worcester.

599
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,840
She came back with a white pony.

600
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,520
The one she gave to you.

601
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,080
You used to ride it around, remember?

602
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,240
Well, she seemed happy for a bit,
watching you ride it.

603
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,040
And then she was gone.

604
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,160
None of it made any sense.

605
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,960
Afterwards, whenever I looked
at that white pony, I saw her.

606
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,440
You see, I was in love with her, Tom.

607
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,800
No one knew but me.

608
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,760
Broke my fucking heart
to pull her from the cut.

609
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,240
You know, your grandfather,
he went the same way. Suicide.

610
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,520
Sometimes, these things run in the family.

611
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,440
Fuck family, Tom.

612
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,280
You just have to get on with it.

613
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,040

00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,320
Jew and the Gypsy united.

640
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,160
-Look, I have to go, yeah? I have to go.
-Go where?

641
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,360
-They're shooting a fascist tonight.
-They're gonna do what?

642
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,600
-Mosley's in town.
-Really?

643
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,120
Look, go into town,
get some drink and some girl

644
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,840
and listen to the radio.

645
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,920
We will not stand by and let this scum
have free rein in our city!

646
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,880
Fascism must not be allowed
to voice its creed of hatred!

647
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,200
Get out the fucking way.

648
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,200
We have a right to protest!

649
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,760
Anybody heckles,
you beat the fuck out of them.

650
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,240
We have a right to protest!

651
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,840
Calm yourself down.

652
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,240
It's not against the law to protest.

653
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,400
Out of the way.
Out of the way.

654
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,320
Let her go.

655
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,280
I don't need the help of a fascist.

656
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,200
Yes, you do.

657
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,520
At Steelhouse Lane,
they'll do whatever they want to you.

658
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,440
Let her go.

659
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,280
I'm Tommy Shelby, and I'm ordering you
to let her fucking go.

660
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,360
Go on.

661
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,920
Fuck you.

662
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,840
Jessie.

663
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,440
We can do more damage from the inside.

664
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,360
Understand?

665
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,520
We can do more damage from the inside.

666
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,120
Come on.

667
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,960
-Come on.

668
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,880
Out of the way.

669
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,280
Out of the way.

670
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,360
Here, look. A little.

671
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,160
I'll join ya.

672
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,840
-Oh.

673
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,880
-Gallipoli, eh?
-Yeah.

674
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,200
You know what you're doing, don't ya?

675
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,520
Yeah, Tommy checks his pocket watch,
I count to ten,

676
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,120
then I blow the other bloke's head off.

677
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,640
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

678
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,560
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

679
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,160
-That's for after.
-Thank you.

680
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,760
-All right.
-Thank you.

681
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,840
-See you later, Arthur.
-Oh, soldier...

682
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,000
Soldier, you're meant to...

683
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,240
-You run like fuck. Don't stop.
-Run like fuck.

684
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,680
-Yeah.
-Run like fuck.

685
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,880
In here.

686
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,480
-Here, for your face.
-At least I have only one face.

687
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,840
What did you mean,
"damage from the inside"?

688
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,720
-I have a strategy.
-You always have a strategy.

689
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,960
But it's dangerous,

690
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,840
and it can't be shared
without sharing the danger.

691
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,360
-You think I'm afraid?
-No.

692
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,080
That's only gonna put you in more danger.

693
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,440
Jessie, before the speeches start,
just go home.

694
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,680
There's gonna be lots of arrests.
You have a mark against your name.

695
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,560
Why? What's going to happen?

696
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,320
I'm gonna do a good thing.

697
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,440
Whenever I do a good thing,
innocent people get hurt.

698
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,040
So go home.

699
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,960
After this evening, we can meet,
discuss strategy.

700
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,440
That beast...

701
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,720
out there, he's just a beast.

702
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,360
He's like a horse.

703
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,800
It's the rider that decides
what direction it takes.

704
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,200
And who will be the rider?

705
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,280
Just go home.

706
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,600
- Full?
- To the fucking brim.

707
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,880
-Trouble?
-So far, a few communists.

708
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,280
Bowlers helped our boys clear them away.

709
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,200
A few hecklers are a good thing.

710
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,800
We can illustrate
how we deal with opposition.

711
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,840
There's a rumour a gang of Jews
are coming up from Digbeth.

712
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,080
No sign of them yet.

713
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,040
Well, let them come.
Welcome them appropriately.

714
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,400
There are a few Peaky boys around.

715
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,440
They are your allies.
There'll be no rifts between us.

716
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,640
Keep your powder dry.

717
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,120
Mr McCavern.

718
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:20,960
Perish Judah.

719
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,520
No joke, Mr McCavern.

720
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,320
Perish Judah.

721
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,960
Will you turn the radio on,
and turn the volume up?

722
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,960
I wanna listen to the news.

723
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,240
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Oswald Mosley.

Welcome, men and women of Birmingham.

740
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,600
Thank you for coming here
on this cold, dark night

741
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,760
in spite of the obstruction
and provocation of our enemies.

742
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,760
Our enemies deal in bricks
and stones and bottles.

743
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,120
We deal in reasoned principle,
argument and fact.

744
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,600
Among those enemies,
we can number Mr Winston Churchill...

745
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,720
who, last night, condemned me in the House
as a threat to democracy.

746
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,560
Thems who've gone are the lucky ones.
Thems who've gone are the lucky ones.

747
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,360
But then, Mr Churchill has never been
a friend of the common people.

748
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,800
Faced with the alternative
of saying goodbye to the gold standard

749
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,440
<i>and, therefore, to his own employment,</i>
<i>he characteristically selected the latter.</i>

750
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,280
<i>But, of course,</i>

751
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:03,120
<i>not all attending tonight</i>
<i>will be convinced of our cause.</i>

752
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,000
<i>Some will have come here tonight</i>

753
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,640
<i>to find out for themselves</i>
<i>what we stand for.</i>

754
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,280
Whenever you're ready, Tom.

755
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,040
So, here are our guiding principles:

756
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,080
Every citizen shall serve the state.

757
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,680
-Not the banks, not factions.

758
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,000
Not the Jews!

759
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:30,120
Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

760
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,840
The barriers of class will be abolished,
and a greater Britain will be born

761
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,400
of the National Socialist
and fascist creed.

762
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,160
It is useless to hide from ourselves

763
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:01,320
the fact that ever since 1918,
when our heroes returned from France,

764
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,240
our empire has shown
all the signs of disintegration.

765
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,680
And our people are threatened
by gathering disaster.

766
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,800
Go. Go.

767
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,640
Ten... nine...

768
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,120
eight...

769
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,480
seven...

770
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,040
six...

771
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,760
five...

772
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,640
four...

773
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,960
three...

774
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,320
Two apple crumble...

775
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,680
I think it's about time
we got off the stage, old man.

776
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,120
Until this thing is sorted.

777
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,760
The coppers are here, Arthur.
You gotta get away from the body.

778
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,520
What the fuck are you doing here?

779
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,760
What happened?

780
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,720
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what fucking happened.

781
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,280
Doesn't make any fucking sense.

782
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,040
- Wait, fuck!
-It's us.

783
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,200
Aberama's dead.

784
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,000
He's gone. He's gone,
and they came for me, too.

785
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,840
What the fuck is she doing here? Huh?

786
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,120
They got to Barney.
They knew everything.

787
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,880
They knew fucking everything.

788
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,800
Who?

789
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,840
-Who knew, Tommy?
-Johnny, get this woman out of here.

790
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,280
-No, I want to know.
-Yeah, get her out of here.

791
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,040
-Come on.
-Get her out.

792
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,920
Doesn't make sense.

793
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,480
Doesn't make fucking sense.

794
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,320
Who? Who? Who, the Chinese?

795
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,080
The Italians?

796
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,720
Branch.

797
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,880
Intelligence.

798
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,960
McCavern. Mosley.

799
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,640
Mosley knew nothing!

800
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,440
He knew nothing!

801
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,320
Who?

802
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,440
Jesus fucking Christ.

803
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,320
You're fucking frightening me, Tom.

804
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,040
Doesn't make sense.

805
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,800
Who?

806
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,680
Who?

807
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,440
Who?

808
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,240
-Who?
-Who?

809
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,080
You know, Tom, you must know.

810
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,000
You're fucking scaring me.
What're you doing?

811
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,280
Talk to me.

812
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,720
Maybe I found him.

813
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,040
Arthur, the man I can't defeat.

814
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,400
-Mosley?
-I don't know.

815
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,800
I don't fucking know.

816
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,800
It doesn't make sense.

817
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,120
Let's... let's go inside.

818
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,120
We'll work it out.

819
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,360
-Have a drink.
-I need to walk.

820
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,560
The work's all done, Tommy.
It's all done.

821
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,320
We can walk away from all of this.

822
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,160
It's so easy. It's so soft.

823
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,080
Such a small change.
