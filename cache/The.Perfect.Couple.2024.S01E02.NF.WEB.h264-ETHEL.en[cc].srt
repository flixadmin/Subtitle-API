for it in the walk-in cooler, Go Go?

-Of course, Mr. Tag.
-Thank you.

Are you out of your fucking mind?

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,375
It's awful.
I can't believe it. It's so awful.

-Hey. We're sorry.

just let me know, okay?

I'm sorry. I don't think
we've been introduced. I'm Tag Winbury.

Is this absolutely necessary?

You've already taped off my driveway.

There are cops
tromping through my wife's flower beds.

I know you don't get to take
the, uh, toy chest out very often,

218
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,958
but I think we can all agree it all feels

219
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,791
a little bit dramatic
for an accidental drowning.

220
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,791
Should I... Should I call Carl in here
to take this down?

221

Are you prepared
to make an official statement?

Mr. Winbury...

223

Um...

224
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,541
We just have to cover every possibility.

225
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,333
I understand completely.

226
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,333
It just seems like the most obvious
possibility is that there was a party.

227
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,041
It was hot, she went for a swim,

228
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,958
and she didn't realize
how strong the blackberry mojitos were.

229
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:20,958
No.

230
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,583
Or how strong
the currents are around here.

231
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,708
A lot of off-islanders don't know that.

232
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,875
-That's actually right.
-Yeah. Right.

233
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,583
Blackberry mojitos.

234
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,416
Yeah.

Greer's go-to move.

236
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,833
There's... There's another possibility
other than accidental drowning.

237
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,583
I think she hit it off
with one of your guests.

238
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,166
Groomsmen,
maybe one of your son's finance bros.

239
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,958
Two of them sneak away to the beach,
he makes his move,

240
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,833
but she has a change of heart,

241
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,125
and, uh, he strangles her,

242
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,625
but drags her by to the water
to make it look like she drowned,

243
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,833
you know, in the... In the strong current.

244
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,833
Was she strangled?

-No.
-No.

as long as we were writing fiction...

00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,958
[Benji] I don't know. I'm texting him.

274
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:32,250
-It's fine. I'll fill him in. All right?
-Make sure you fill him in on all of it.

275
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,083
[softly] Hi.

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,166
Hi.

277
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,333
Should I not be here?

278
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:42,916
[Tag] No.

279
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,000
Everything okay?

280
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,333
-Your mom?
-She's okay.

281
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,333
Good.

282
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,583
So we've been talking to my team,
and they feel we have to issue a statement

283
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,916
just to mitigate any of the press.

284
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,375
-Press?
-Yeah.

285
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,375
So they're suggesting...

286
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,333
I mean, it's awful, terribly sad, um...

287
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,625
and tragic when someone feels overwhelmed

288
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,833
to the point that they feel
there's no way out.

289
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,291
She would never do that.

290
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,083
There were things
she was looking forward to.

291
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,791
Well, we never know what's going on
in someone's mind, really,

292
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,458
no matter how close you are.

293
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,125
I'll... I'll call Marty about the statement.

294
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,583
Right.

295
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,916
Should we really be issuing statements
that aren't true?

296
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,875
[Greer] Unfortunately,
given the state of what I do,

297
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,625
we do have to get ahead of things.

298
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,666
We're just filling in the blanks, Amelia,
taking control of the narrative.

299
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,833
Yeah. It's an important part of this...

300
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,916
[Tag] All they're suggesting is that

301
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,833
we don't make any
unnecessary statements to the press.

302
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,500
Or the police. Okay?

303
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,083
For her sake.

304

[indistinct police radio chatter]

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,750
Listen, I know you'd prefer I wasn't here.

306
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,791
I'd rather spend the weekend with my kids,
which is saying a lot

307
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,416
because we have passes to Water Wizz,

308
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,958
which, as it turns out,
is a very accurate name.

309
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,416
But I have a job to do,

310
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,416
and the sooner you decide
to help me do that job,

311
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,166
the better it's gonna be for both of us.

312
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,041
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have the techs
comb the beach again

313
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,708
in case anything washes in.

314
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,291
You're too easy on the locals.

315
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,875
Or do you just have a thing
for the insanely rich ones?

316
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,708
Oh, I have a thing for access.
Trust me on this.

317
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,375
Access to a new car every three years?

318
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,708
'Cause the ones in Fall River
still have cassette decks.

319
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,000
-Okay, yeah. We're pretty well-funded.
-Yeah.

they will bring in their New York lawyers
so fast your head will spin.

324
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,791
You got to let them think
you work for them,

325
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,875
because the minute they feel
they're losing control,

She has people sign them all the time.

This isn't "all the time," Benji.
