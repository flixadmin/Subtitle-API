1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:07,054
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,095
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,143
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,275
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,727
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,319
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,363
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,786
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,664
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,823
Let me get this straight.

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,118
You're the doppelganger
of our Dr. Wells.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,128
Yeah, but that Dr. Wells' body
had been taken over by the Reverse-Flash

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,668
who was really Eobard Thawne.

14
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,166
Eddie! Stay with me, okay? Stay.

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,459
Eddie's his ancestor.

16
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,299
If Eddie dies,
then Thawne will never be born.

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,838
He'll be erased from existence.

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,139
Hartley Rathaway. I couldn't have built
the particle accelerator without him.

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,557
Cisco? What did you see?

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,312
I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

21
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,820
I let it happen again.

22
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,569
I trusted someone I shouldn't have.

23
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,325
Jay Garrick.

24
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,906
Zoom.

25
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,405
Just like I trusted Harrison Wells.

26
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,950
Or Eobard Thawne.

27
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,914
You see what I mean?

28
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,329
I made the same mistake twice.

29
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,998
I thought they wanted to teach me
how to use my powers,

30
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,381
train me to get faster,

31
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,010
but they didn't come here to help me.

32
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:29,298
They came to use me,
and take everything I love away from me.

33
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,716
But no more.

34
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,350
I'm gonna crack the code.

35
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,886
Figure out how to improve my speed.

36
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,429
I'm going to train harder,

37
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:39,100
get stronger, and run faster
than anyone's ever run before.

38
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,894
And then I'm gonna stop Zoom.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,487
Come on.

40
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,282
Oh.

41
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,209
Can we please get rid of Jay's helmet?

42
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,586
No. Sorry, it keeps me motivated.

43
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:00,837
Well, it's giving me day-mares.

44
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,960
This is everything I could find
even remotely related to increasing speed.

45
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,218
How are these supposed to help
apply the speed equation to you?

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,973
The answer's got to be here somewhere.

47
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,429
I think I found something interesting.

48
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,220
Good interesting or bad interesting?
'Cause that word could go either way.

49
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,856
After running some comparative data,
it appears that you, Reverse-Flash,

50
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,065
and Zoom are moving your legs at,
essentially, the same speed.

51
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,195
Then why are they so much faster than him?

52
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,780
Best I can tell, with each stride,
their feet spend less time on the ground,

53
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,364
thus propelling them forward much faster.

54
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,029
By almost 30%.

55
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,246
Great. All right, well,
I gotta make up that difference somehow.

56
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,416
Barry?

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,459
Look, after what that monster did,

58
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,798
I want to stop Jay
just as badly as you do.

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,961
Right.

60
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:54,759
But what if the reason you haven't been
able to run as fast as him yet

61
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,222
is because you just can't?

62
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,106
Barry, you know what happened to Jay
is not your fault, right?

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,813
Well, I should've known better.

64
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,026
You?

65
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,941
With Wells last year,
I should've learned my lesson

66
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,451
and dug deeper into Jay.

67
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,371
- But I didn't.
- Come on, Joe.

68
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,999
Point being is,
nobody saw this coming.

69
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,413
Nobody.

70
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,801
So,

71
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,961
I

72
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,468
Kind of went on a date.

73
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,516
- With who?
- The new editor at CCPN.

74
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,305
Scott Evans.

75
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,643
Your boss?

76
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,308
Okay I'm... It wasn't like that.

77
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,978
He's a really nice guy,

78
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,858
he's sweet, and smart, and...

79
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,318
What?

80
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,743
I just...
It all makes me think about Eddie.

81
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,960
I think about him every day, Barry.

82
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,465
Itjust feels wrong.

83
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,673
I know for a fact that
Eddie would want you to find love again.

84
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,337
Yeah, I know, but...

85
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,504
Look, Iris.

86
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,305
You're the only person who's gonna know
when you're ready to move on.

87
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:28,694
But, until then, don't keep yourself
completely closed off, you know?

88
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,442
You're gonna miss out on something great.

89
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,031
Yeah.

90
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,536
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry, I'm late.

91
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,368
No. No, you're just in time.

92
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,541
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Dad, mittens!

93
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,419
So,

94
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,205
my advisor loved my engine designs,

95
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,215
and even asked me to help her out
with one of her engineering projects.

96
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,422
Okay, big man on campus.

97
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,757
It's not that big a deal.

98
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,217
It's a great opportunity
and you should take it,

99
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,926
because life doesn't give those out
all the time.

100
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,558
Isn't that right, Barry?

101
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,888
Yeah.

102
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,644
Yeah, what is the project about?

103
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,522
It's trying to push the speed limits
with smaller propulsion systems.

104
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,641
- Yeah. That's cool.
- Where do you even start?

105
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,943
Well, I really like to read thejournals
of the classic engineers.

106
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,197
So, their engine designs,
how they increased horsepower,

107
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,190
and learn from the best, I guess.

108
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,609
- You read theirjournals?
- Mmm.

109
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,619
I mean, it's not like
I can just go and talk

110
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,405
to Enzo Ferrari or Ferdinand Porsche,

111
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,948
'cause they dead,

112
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,741
but you know,

113
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,910
doesn't mean they can't still teach me.

114
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,252
- I got to go.
- You haven't even touched your food.

115
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,258
Yeah, no, I'm sorry, I just...

116
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,044
I just realized the key
to a case I've been working on,

117
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,758
so I'm gonna just...

118
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,514
Thank you, Wally.

119
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,185
Whew! Um, sorry, guys, I'll be...
I'll be back later.

120
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,680
That dude gets weirder
every time I see him.

121
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,727
Yeah.

122
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,109
You mean the old Harrison Wells.

123
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,686
As in Eobard Thawne.

124
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,651
You want him to teach you
how to run faster?

125
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,864
- Oh, that's rich.
- How are you gonna do that?

126
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,071
By running back to a time last year.

127
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,324
And what about the other you?
The one from that other timeline?

128
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,284
I'll knock him out with something.

129
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,914
I mean, it's not like he'll see me coming.

130
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,121
And then I'll have Wells teach me.

131
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,456
Barry, that's crazy.

132
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,837
Nothing I've read
is pointing me towards a solution,

133
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:15,797
and if there's anybody that's figured out
the key to getting faster, without V-Nine,

134
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,006
it's him.

135
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,093
What do you guys think?

136
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,888
Your plan is asinine.

137
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,518
Did you find Jesse?

138
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,858
Does it look like I found Jesse?

139
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,732
How many times
have you traveled through time?

140
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,896
A few.

141
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,655
Do you have any idea
how many things you could screw up?

142
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,533
All I need is one conversation
with Dr. Wells.

143
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,820
- He's not Wells! I'm Wells!
- Thawne.

144
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,531
This man has been studying you
for 15 years.

145
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,449
For 15 years.

146
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,409
And you don't think
he's gonna know who you are?

147
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,793
Barry's pretty good
at impersonating himself.

148
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,329
You should've seen him
over there on Earth-2.

149
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,998
I was like,
"Somebody, get this man an Oscar."

150
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,838
He will know, Allen. He will know.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,297
All right,
then what am I supposed to do?

152
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,507
I mean, how am I supposed to stop Zoom?

153
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,171
Do you know the answer to this equation?

154
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,215
If Thawne figures out that it's you,

155
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,513
the timeline will be altered,

156
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,018
people can die.

157
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,771
Others could live, and no one will know
who or what will be affected,

158
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,651
but I promise you, when you come back
things will be different.

159
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,856
And only you will know
what those differences are.

160
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,940
Well, if that's what I have to do
to stop Zoom, then so be it.

161
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,701
Because if I don't, and Zoom gets my speed
before I learn how to stop him,

162
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,701
everybody I care about,
everybody in this whole city,

163
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,286
their world will never
be the same, anyway.

164
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,872
I...

165
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,585
Do you really think you can do this?

166
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,378
Yeah, I do.

167
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,013
When I went back last year,

168
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,300
and I saw my mom die,

169
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,059
it didn't affect the timeline.

170
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,223
Yeah, but you haven't really
time-traveled on purpose like this before.

171
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,936
I have to do this, you guys.

172
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,768
Okay. Let's go for it.

173
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,229
Okay,
you're gonna go back to the time

174
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,196
when Wells was distracted by the return
of the major jackass, Hartley Rathaway.

175
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:07,113
This is the first time we found out
Wells knew the accelerator might explode,

176
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,871
And we were all angry with him.

177
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,579
So, anything that might seem odd
about your behavior,

178
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,368
Wells should attribute to that.

179
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,289
Also, remember,
do not underestimate Hartley.

180
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,581
He almost killed you.

181
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,922
This is a tranq dart that should knock
old-you out for about six hours.

182
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,837
Which lines up perfectly
for when you're going back,

183
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,347
because not much was happening,

184
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,054
until Hartley attacks
the Cleveland Dam that night.

185
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,345
So, that should give you time
to learn what you need and return.

186
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,607
One more thing, you cannot tell us
the truth about Wells. No matter what.

187
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,272
You must keep the timeline intact.

188
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,904
It's gonna be hard to course-correct
if anything gets altered.

189
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,112
So, get what you need, and come back,
preferably to this moment,

190
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,323
this exact time you're leaving,
or else you might set off

191
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,905
some kind of Twelve Monkeys time loop
you'll never get out of.

192
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,072
Mmm-hmm.

193
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,499
- No pressure.
- Yeah, cool.

194
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,958
So, we'll see you in, like, two seconds.

195
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,543
Time travel's so weird.

196
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,802
- Godspeed, Barry.
- I'll be fine.

197
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,220
What could go wrong?

198
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,228
Eddie!

199
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,999
Oh, no, I'm too early.

200
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,752
You know my name.
I know some names, too.

201
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,996
This is not a good start.

202
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,341
Caitlin Snow. Cisco Ramon. Harrison Wells.

203
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,187
Something's interfering with his comms.

204
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,347
Barry!

205
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,732
Come on.

206
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,355
Damn it.

207
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,899
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

208
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,033
Whatever Hartley's using
must be shorting out his comms.

209
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,944
I can hear the radio waves...

210
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,328
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember this.

211
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,746
Emanating from your suit.

212
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,077
This could still work.

213
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,368
About 1900 megahertz.

214
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,036
Are they on the other end? Listening?

215
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,125
Will they hear you die?

216
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,124
No. They're gonna hear you

217
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,883
- get your ass kicked.
- "Get your ass kicked."

218
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,261
Okay.

219
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,729
Is that all it takes to scare you off?

220
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,982
And he chose you over me?

221
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,064
My comms? Who are you?

222
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,978
I don't have time
to explain this to you right now.

223
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,426
I don't understand, you're me!

224
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,095
I'm sorry, I have to do this.

225
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,597
This will all make sense eventually.

226
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,936
Where are you, Oh, chosen one?

227
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,619
Got you, again.

228
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,199
Looks like you're not as smart
as everyone says. Huh?

229
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,165
Smart enough to have figured out
who Harrison Wells really is.

230
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,251
You see, I know his secret.

231
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,336
Barry? Are you there?

232
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,499
Yeah.

233
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,758
Yeah, I'm back.

234
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,670
I'm bringing Hartley in.

235
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,436
Scanner's picking up
foreign metallic objects in your ears.

236
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,350
- Take them out.
- I can't.

237
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,314
I suffered head trauma
when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

238
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,567
My hearing was severely damaged.

239
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,857
Without these, I am in pain
you can only imagine.

240
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,996
Cisco, see if the devices in his ears

241
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,500
are generating any
low level electromagnetic pulses.

242
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,332
You want me to scan for E-bombs?

243
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,038
I just...

244
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,548
I mean, don't you think
that could have been

245
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,208
what was interfering with the comms?

246
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,425
Well, well.

247
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,183
Trying to go all Mission Impossible on us?
Use those things to bust out of here?

248
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:46,062
Pump in some sound stimuli
to counteract his tinnitus.

249
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,524
Then we'll make some
non-explosive replacements for him.

250
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,563
Deal with you later.

251
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,572
Take them out, Hartley.

252
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,736
Now.

253
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,413
Dr. Wells.

254
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:06,294
So, that was quite an observation you had
about Hartley in there, Mr. Allen.

255
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,548
Yeah, just seemed too easy,
taking him down, you know?

256
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,708
Mmm-hmm.

257
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,053
Well, likely reason for that
is you're getting faster.

258
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,719
Actually, lwanted to
talk to you about that.

259
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,224
It occurred to me that

260
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,638
Maybe we've been going about
improving my speed the wrong way.

261
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,389
How so?

262
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:31,402
Well, I've been learning
different techniques involved in running,

263
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,815
and I was thinking that there's
just as much science involved in speed

264
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,233
as anything physical or technical.

265
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,245
I just can't figure out
how to apply it to me when I run.

266
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,907
Thought if anyone could help me,
it'd be you.

267
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,250
This is quite the

268
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,415
speed equation you've concocted here,
isn't it, Mr. Allen?

269
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,922
Yeah. I've been doing
a lot of reading in my down time.

270
00:13:55,251 --> 00:14:00,348
What on Earth inspired you
to adopt such a, what shall we call this,

271
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,476
unorthodox approach?

272
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,721
I just know that
I'm not the fastest man alive.

273
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,642
I need to be faster, a lot faster,

274
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,106
if I'm ever gonna be able to
take down the Man in Yellow.

275
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,654
So, what do you think? Can you help me?

276
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,965
Let me see what I can do.

277
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,303
Hey, Joe.

278
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,634
Hey, Eddie.

279
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,389
Must've been a good lunch.

280
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,342
Iris is the first girlfriend
I've ever lived with,

281
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,807
so it's all very new and exciting.

282
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,143
"New"? Yes. "Exciting"? No.

283
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,143
Sorry. Somehow, I keep forgetting
you're her dad.

284
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,150
Right, try to remember.
For both our sakes. Come here.

285
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,820
I was thinking about
what you said about Wells.

286
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,610
How there's something off about him?

287
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,996
I need you to do something for me,
off the books.

288
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,326
Joe, come on.

289
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,491
Just trust me, Eddie.

290
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,706
Okay. What?

291
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,131
Go back to his house. Search everything.

292
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,342
Someone there?

293
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,969
What the hell?

294
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,057
C.C.P.D.

295
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,435
I'm sure they have it handled, right?

296
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,017
No.

297
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,860
You need to go.

298
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,073
Run, Barry.

299
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,973
Is everyone okay?

300
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,118
- Barr.
- Yeah?

301
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,281
You should cover that up.

302
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,870
Oh, right, yeah.

303
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,540
- Thanks.
- Joe.

304
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,458
No sign of it outside.
It just disappeared.

305
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,796
Hey, Barr.

306
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,131
Hey, Eddie.

307
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,510
Any idea what that thing could be?

308
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,842
What the...

309
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,508
No, I don't... No, not yet.

310
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,302
Um, if I figure it out, I'll let you know.

311
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,139
Things just keep getting
more and more strange in this city.

312
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,640
Yeah, they do.

313
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,231
I'm gonna check in with Iris,
let her know I'm okay.

314
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,271
- Great.
- All right, see you, Barr.

315
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,942
What the hell's going on with you?

316
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,236
What are you talking about?

317
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,989
Look, I know you told Iris
that you love her,

318
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:58,002
but you said you'd moved past
this whole Eddie and Iris thing.

319
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,413
I have, Joe. I have.

320
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,007
Then why were you being so weird to Eddie?

321
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,842
Okay, look. I'm sorry.

322
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,130
Let me, uh,
just take care of all this, okay?

323
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,131
I'll talk to you later, I promise.

324
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,632
Fine.

325
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,351
But soon.

326
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,730
Soon, yeah.

327
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,860
What's going on?

328
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,742
Oh, you know, just trying to
figure out how to find this Dementor

329
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,029
that's apparently roaming
through Central City, right now.

330
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,822
I assume that was the cause
of the C.C.P.D. alarm?

331
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,330
Yeah. Actually, it attacked my lab.

332
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,618
You saw it?

333
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,503
No, I didn't see it. No, I did...

334
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:46,042
Um, well, I didn't get there in time,
but I have seen it before.

335
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,048
Where?

336
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,135
It was earlier today, actually,
when I was running to take Hartley down.

337
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,434
Uh-huh. You'rejust mentioning this now?

338
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,890
I didn't...
I mean, I didn't know what it was.

339
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,977
I thought it was some sort of illusion?
I don't know.

340
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,937
Okay, well we need to find it
before it hurts somebody.

341
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,188
Yeah, can you track it?

342
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,398
What is it with you guys?

343
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,857
It's like you think
I have ESP or something.

344
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,318
I can'tjust magically sense
where things are.

345
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,653
What can you do, Cisco?

346
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,819
I'm thinking I can reconfigure the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to look for it.

347
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,612
It might take some time, though.

348
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,780
Do it.

349
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,995
In the meantime, Mr. Allen,
come with me.

350
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,375
Have a seat.

351
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,044
Is this about the speed equation?

352
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,580
Matter of fact, it is.

353
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,423
Great, okay, good.

354
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,926
- So, you've figured it out?
- Mmm-hmm.

355
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,095
Yes.

356
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,055
I figured it out.

357
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,321
Now, who are you?

358
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,286
I mean, who are you, really?

359
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,209
Dr. Wells, what are you doing?

360
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,752
None of it adds up.

361
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,542
The interference with the comms.

362
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,462
The speed equation. The Time Wraith.

363
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,765
That's what we call them.

364
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,970
Time Wraiths.

365
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,807
Scary, aren't they?

366
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,472
I thought,
"Oh, no, a Time Wraith has found me."

367
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,811
But then I thought, "No, no, no."

368
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,772
"You know what you're doing."

369
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,188
"No, the Time Wraith is after someone
who's traveled through time,"

370
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,616
"and doesn't know what they're doing."

371
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,159
Dr. Wells, come on, it's me, it's Barry.
I don't...

372
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,326
Really?

373
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,545
You are good.

374
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,796
You are good,
and I would believe you, except that...

375
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,671
Nothing?

376
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,012
I move like this, you barely flinch.

377
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,305
You know who I am.

378
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,850
Don't you?

379
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,821
On...

380
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,778
And you're from the future.
Do you know how I know that?

381
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,571
Because I haven't taught my Barry Allen
how to phase through objects. Yet.

382
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,205
Let me out of here, Thawne.

383
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,878
I know.

384
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,423
You're upset.

385
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,554
But it does me good
to hear that name again.

386
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,890
Now, onto the bigger question.

387
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,679
Why are you here?

388
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,388
Because I want to go faster,
and you're the only one who can teach me.

389
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,725
You're the only one
who's figured out the equation.

390
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,064
The Speed Force.

391
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,896
You've manipulated it.

392
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:55,898
How did you do that?

393
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,578
No.

394
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,328
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

395
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,621
No.

396
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,551
You'd only come here
if something went wrong.

397
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,595
If you're still alive,

398
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,594
then that means...

399
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,936
I haven't beaten you.

400
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,774
If you're still alive,

401
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,115
that means my plan fails.

402
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,036
And if my plan fails,

403
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,824
I don't get to go home,
and if that's the case, well then...

404
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,288
No, no, no! Hey, hey!

405
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,202
It's the opposite, it's the opposite!

406
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,292
You trick me, you harness my speed.

407
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,674
We turn on the accelerator
to create a path for you to go home.

408
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,961
I go back in time.

409
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,129
You go back to yours.

410
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,135
You won.

411
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,806
Yeah.

412
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,230
Then why are you here?

413
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,810
Why are you here, now?

414
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,101
Because when I got back,
a Singularity had formed.

415
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,986
And now, the only way for me to learn
how to get faster

416
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:20,275
and stop the Singularity from happening
was to come here, now.

417
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,156
Well, that's good to know.

418
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,502
There's just...

419
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,796
Just one thing that occurs to me.

420
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,429
I don't need you.

421
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,676
Do I?

422
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,182
Not this you, certainly.

423
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,514
Oops.

424
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,564
You probably should have thought of that,

425
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,479
before you came back here.

426
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,193
Shame.

427
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:04,152
You ran all the way back here

428
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,867
just to die.

429
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,035
You kill me?

430
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,541
Barry?

431
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,452
This Barry? Your Barry?

432
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,166
He learns it all.

433
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,377
There's a hidden letter,

434
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,088
telling him how it ends, how to beat you.

435
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,420
Everything.

436
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,389
Anything happens to me,

437
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,345
you never make it back home.

438
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,764
Go on.

439
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,357
Kill me, Thawne.

440
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,939
See how this all ends.

441
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,326
Now,

442
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,205
you're gonna help me get faster.

443
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,302
# #

444
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,254
Please.

445
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,301
I want to know how these work.

446
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,725
I'll tell you, just kill the music?

447
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,327
- Thanks.
- The gauntlets, Hartley.

448
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,207
What kind of frequency is this?

449
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:36,231
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

450
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,330
Cisco, it's here!

451
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,412
It's coming!

452
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:19,287
- Inside the cell. Now!
- Uh, sorry, what's coming?

453
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,293
Holy Harry Potter.

454
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,387
Okay! Well, isn't this fantastic?

455
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,594
Look. We're gonna be safe in here,
these cells are...

456
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,809
Impenetrable?

457
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,226
Barry! Doctor Wells!

458
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,435
Uh, we have to help them.

459
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,599
You let it track you here!

460
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,310
Get me out of here, come on!

461
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,362
If that thing comes after me
and messes with my plans,

462
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,568
you're all dead!

463
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,358
Where are they?

464
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,868
Okay. Step back.

465
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,694
You'll shatter the glass!

466
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,953
You got a better plan?

467
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,205
As a matter of fact. Give me those.

468
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,616
No!

469
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,250
Now, Cisco!

470
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,123
What're you gonna do?

471
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,546
These cells have speakers
linked throughout S.T.A.R. Labs.

472
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,705
Yes, and?

473
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,216
I rigged these gauntlets
to emit a destructive signal

474
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,501
if they were ever disarmed.

475
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,136
If I can just find the right frequency
of whatever the hell that thing is,

476
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,551
well, let's just say you'll be glad
you're in here with me.

477
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,198
I'm sorry that we didn't come sooner.

478
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,580
It's alright, lnky's gone.
I don't see anything.

479
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,171
You know, we'd be toast if it wasn't
for Hartley and those gauntlets.

480
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,797
Well, self-preservation
is a very strong motivator,

481
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,004
but he stays in the cell
until I say otherwise.

482
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,544
Okay, I'm just saying-

483
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,634
So, the two places the thing
has attacked are here and C.C.P.D.

484
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,423
- The common denominator being...
- Me.

485
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,513
Yeah, I know. I Just... I don't know why.

486
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,222
Well, you must've done something
to piss him off.

487
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,228
Satellite hasn't found anything.

488
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,355
We need to find a more permanent solution
to this problem.

489
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,562
Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.

490
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,689
That's as good a first step as any.

491
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,775
- I got some parts for it.
- Let's go for it.

492
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,274
- You don't know how to stop a Time Wraith?
- None of us do,

493
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,284
that's why we always
try and avoid them in our travels.

494
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,490
- We?
- Speedsters.

495
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,744
We're not the only two
out there, you know.

496
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,030
This isn't the first time
I've time-traveled.

497
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,870
How come I've never seen
one of these until now?

498
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,705
Because you ran out of luck.

499
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,629
And Time Wraiths hate it
when speedsters manipulate the timeline,

500
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,961
and now that thing's gonna do
everything it can to end you.

501
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,085
Here's what we're gonna do.

502
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,304
You're gonna go to C.C.P.D.,
you're gonna see what you can find

503
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,298
to help us stop this thing,
I'll do the same here.

504
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,012
What am I supposed to be looking for?

505
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,427
You're in forensics, figure something out.

506
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,971
Hey, but what about the equation?
Me getting faster.

507
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,184
If we don't stop this thing,

508
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,816
there's gonna be no point
in me teaching you anything.

509
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,736
No trace elements, no prints,

510
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:57,529
no sign that it was ever here,
except the whole mess.

511
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,241
Any idea what it was looking for?

512
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,323
- Me.
- What? Why?

513
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,458
It doesn't like something that I did.

514
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,494
And what exactly would that be?

515
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,501
Joe, Singh needs you in his office.

516
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,920
Hey, Eddie. Do you have a second?

517
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,679
I kinda gotta go,
check out a lead for Joe.

518
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,714
Okay, actually,
this is for Iris' birthday.

519
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,888
That's two months from now.

520
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,018
Yeah, no, I know, you're right. I just...

521
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,271
Um, I wanna make a video montage for her.

522
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,855
Just everybody in her life, and how her
being in your life has made it better.

523
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,065
That sounds great, yeah.
I'll think of something to say.

524
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,980
Can we do it now?

525
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,739
Barry, I really gotta go do this thing.

526
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,823
- I know, I kind of have to get it today.
- Sure.

527
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:42,081
All right, great.
Just, um, speak from the heart.

528
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:46,710
Talk as if it was the last thing
you could ever say to her.

529
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,872
Okay.

530
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,463
Go ahead.

531
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,845
What does Iris mean to me? Wow.

532
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,681
So, can these gauntlets be salvaged?

533
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,513
Their electron guns are fried.

534
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,224
So, it shorted the wave tubes,
destroyed the amplifiers.

535
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,888
Yeah, but, to be honest with you,

536
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,432
I don't know how to manipulate
the frequency variance.

537
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,272
Hartley would know.
He's the one who did it.

538
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,774
See if he can help,
but he stays in the cell.

539
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,487
But then what?
That thing's gonna come back.

540
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,027
I don't know.

541
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,533
Where is he?

542
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,164
Where's the other Flash?

543
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,914
I'm right here.

544
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,557
Okay, not how I expected
today to turn out.

545
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:43,884
Yeah.

546
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,054
- Who are you?
- Who is he? Who are you?

547
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:51,768
- I'm Barry. I'm Barry. Your Barry. He's...
- Your doppelganger.

548
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,230
No, not yet.

549
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:58,316
I am you, Barry. Just different.

550
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,860
Wait a second, how do we know
which one's the real Barry?

551
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,200
Dude, okay, I've watched Wrath of Khan
with you, like, five times.

552
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,455
Imposter.

553
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,616
Yeah, and every time at the end,
you turn to me and you say,

554
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,956
"I have been, and always shall be,
your friend."

555
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,212
Ah-ha! You imposter.

556
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,461
What is going on here?

557
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,298
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.
This was not supposed to happen.

558
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,838
The tranq dart that Caitlin made
was supposed to last a lot longer.

559
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,132
I did not give him a tranq dart.

560
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,223
Okay, no, yes. Not you.
The you from the time that I'm from.

561
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,472
The time that you're from?

562
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,017
I think what he's trying to say is,
he's from the future.

563
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,230
- The future?
- Yeah.

564
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,487
- The future? With the...
- Yes. Yes.

565
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,947
Are we saying I can time travel?

566
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,322
One day.

567
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,702
Oh, that explains the white on the symbol.

568
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,206
But wait a second,
suppose we now change your emblem?

569
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:52,120
Will it be because we got the idea from
this, or, I mean, that would mean that...

570
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,708
Stop talking. You stop talking, too.
All right?

571
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,873
The more you say,
the more the timeline is disrupted.

572
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,667
Now, I'm going to assume
that your presence here

573
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,462
- is the reason that thing is attacking us?
- What? What thing?

574
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,175
Have you ever seen The Frighteners?

575
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,808
It's sort of like that, but scarier,
and faster, and it's after you. After him.

576
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,686
Yeah, it's been chasing rne
ever since I got here.

577
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,893
- Okay, so how do we stop it?
- We don't know.

578
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,309
- Then what are we gonna do?
- The one thing we can.

579
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,148
What? What are we doing here?

580
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,115
We're here for the answer
to your speed equation.

581
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,748
The reason that you
traveled back to this time.

582
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,910
And the key to running faster.

583
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,631
Tachyon enhancement.

584
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,541
This was not the deal.

585
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,887
If you think that I'm gonna
hold your hand this entire way,

586
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,092
you're sadly mistaken.

587
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,428
Everything you need is on this drive.

588
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,888
If you follow its instructions,

589
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,350
you will enhance the Speed Force
in your system and run faster

590
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,311
than you ever thought possible.

591
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,483
If this doesn't work,

592
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,443
I'm coming back.

593
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,741
Doctor Wells, we need you.

594
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,406
Time to go home, Flash.

595
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,713
Okay, our satellite has finally found
our floating friend, and it's coming back.

596
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,839
- You need to go.
- I need to know how to stop it.

597
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,750
- Barry.
- Not now.

598
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,919
When I get back,
you guys have a year to figure it out.

599
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,926
Okay, we'll figure something out.

600
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,425
Cisco, come here.

601
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,395
Hartley knows where Ronnie is.

602
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,600
Okay. What?

603
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,559
- It's coming.
- You need to leave, now.

604
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,620
Thank you.

605
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,803
Barry, here it comes.

606
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,576
It's not working, it's slowing him down.

607
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,488
Not for long.

608
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,160
No. Barry!

609
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,060
Cool.

610
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,572
- It's coming.
- Did you even go?

611
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,581
- The Time Wraith.
- That's a good name.

612
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,959
- Looks like that's a "Yes."
- Did you figure out how to stop it?

613
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,379
Damn. We thought so.

614
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,724
Barry.

615
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,076
I suddenly realized.

616
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,532
Low frequency, high intensity.

617
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,241
- I knew that.
- Oh, hey, Barry. How was yourtrip?

618
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,009
So, aside from the fact that a Time Wraith

619
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,921
came over here and nearly killed us,
how did it go?

620
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,422
It was interesting.

621
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,887
Good interesting or bad interesting?
'Cause that could go either way.

622
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,020
So far, so good.

623
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,019
How many times
do we have to tell you, Hartley,

624
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,059
ever since evil Wells
got erased from existence,

625
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,445
no one speaks Latin around here, anymore.

626
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,949
Well, as always, been a pleasure working
with you all on this little project.

627
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,156
If you need anything in the future,
call me.

628
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,329
- I'm off to a late dinner.
- Dinner? Anyone special?

629
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,411
Very.

630
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,790
My parents.

631
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,421
So? You got me on
pins and needles over here.

632
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,002
What about the speed equation?
Did Wells tell you what you need to do?

633
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,505
Well, let's see.

634
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:02,062
Mmm. Maybe it's password protected?

635
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,606
Are you kidding me?

636
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:10,779
After everything I Just went through,
this doesn't even work.

637
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,791
We got it.

638
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,253
Hey.

639
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,506
- Hey.
- You okay?

640
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,665
Yeah, I'm okay.

641
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,340
Although, it turns out it's easier to find
a two-ton gorilla on this Earth

642
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,004
than a teenage daughter.

643
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,013
I don't know what I've done.

644
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,391
You did what you thought you had to do.

645
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,020
You risked your life to save her.

646
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,228
You brought her here
to protect her from Zoom.

647
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,354
You acted like a father.

648
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,983
Like a father.

649
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,692
You know, my wife had to...

650
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,986
She had to talk me into having kids.

651
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:03,911
Kids, you know, they're small,
they're loud, run around.

652
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,586
All I needed was my science,
myjob, for myjoy and happiness.

653
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,039
And then,

654
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,128
the moment we had her,

655
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,842
all that I wanted was her love.

656
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,218
Now,

657
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:29,104
I don't know if I'll ever see that again.
It seems every decision I've made lately

658
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,733
has backfired on me.

659
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,611
You just have to trust that
in the long run,

660
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,113
you've made the right ones.

661
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,120
- Hey.
- Hey.

662
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,626
I put your plate from dinner
in the fridge.

663
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,124
Thanks.

664
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,391
It's been almost a year already.
Can you believe that?

665
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,111
That's the thing, Iris.
Everything keeps moving forward.

666
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,740
The question is, when will you?

667
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,200
I don't know, Barry.

668
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:34,624
Well, um, lfound something
that I think might help.

669
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:41,630
I was putting together this little video
montage for your birthday last year

670
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,423
with everybody and...

671
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,185
Everything happened. Um...

672
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:52,474
But, uh, take a look.
I think it might help.

673
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,109
Okay.

674
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,363
What does Iris mean to me? Wow.

675
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,820
You know, a lot of times

676
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,207
I have a hard time
figuring out what to say to people.

677
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,286
But, when it comes to you, Iris, Idon't.

678
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,669
Because with you,
everything that used to feel tough

679
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,667
just doesn't anymore.

680
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,511
It's one of the things I love about you.

681
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,714
You don't need me.

682
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:28,473
You can handle anything on your own,
because you're fearless.

683
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,725
And independent.

684
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,559
Loving.

685
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,433
Kind.

686
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:41,858
You are, without question,
the best decision I ever made, Iris West.

687
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:46,115
And I've never thanked you
for choosing to be with me,

688
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:50,623
because each day with you is a gift.

689
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,910
So, thank you.

690
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,578
You deserve the world, Iris.

691
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,792
You deserve to be happy
the rest of your life.

692
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,208
And no one wants that more for you
than me.

693
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,552
Happy birthday, baby.

694
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,922
I love you.

695
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,184
I love you, too.

696
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,399
Sometimes,
the only way to move forward

697
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,653
is to revisit the things in your past
that were holding you back.

698
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:26,114
You have to deal with them, head on,
no matter how scary they may be.

699
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:31,247
Because once you do, you'll see that
you can go further than you ever imagined.

700
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,421
I'm coming for you.

701
00:41:39,445 --> 00:41:47,445
