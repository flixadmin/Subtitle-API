19
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,684
This is one of the largest and
most mysterious plane crashes

20
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,245
in Colombian history.

21
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,570
It may have been a bomb that blew
up a plane in Colombia today.

22
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,802
The Boeing 727 of Avianca Airlines...

23
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,090
In his unsuccessful attempt

24
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,323
to assassinate presidential
candidate César Gaviria,

25
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,530
Pablo Escobar murdered
107 innocent people.

26
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,248
The "Paisa Robin Hood"...
had become a terrorist.

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,761
But American intelligence authorities

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,526
say the drug bosses in Colombia
have to be considered prime suspects.

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,722
You know where Jaime is?

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,883
No, sir.
I don't know where he is.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,604
He left home and hasn't returned.

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,049
- Have Pablo and his men come by here?
- No.

33
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,407
- Your name is Natalie?
- Yes, sir.

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,530
Natalie, your boyfriend, Jaime,
was he with Pablo's sicarios?

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,250
- No.
- Are you sure?

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,081
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,562
Well, then, why do you have
this picture of Pablo in your house?

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,440
Nothing wrong with that.
Everyone in the comuna has one.

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,722
You think those thugs
are going to protect you?

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,369
You don't understand...
that you represent a big problem for them.

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,086
We can help you.

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,410
We can protect you.
But you have to tell us the truth.

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,290
She's lying.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,250
He's got this poor sucker to carry a bomb
without him even knowing it.

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,405
- Well, maybe he knew.
- I don't care if he knew or not.

46
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,482
It's time we put a bullet in Escobar.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,607
I don't want
to leave, my love. I don't want to leave.

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,531
But I must, for all our safety.

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,489
Did you do something wrong?

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,408
Your dad did nothing wrong.

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,282
These are people who are jealous of us,
who are trying to take what we have.

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,884
You have to be strong.

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,126
I want you to be strong.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,807
You have to be strong
and never show weakness.

55
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,769
I promise I'll never be weak.

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,366
And watch out for your sister.

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,085
I love you very much.

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,444
I love you all very much.

59
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,404
- Mama.
- Pablo?

60
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,201
- Do not spoil this boy.
- But... what do you mean?

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,411
- Watch her.
- Just a few sweets and some pork rinds.

62
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,325
Be careful, son. Be careful.

63
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,531
- I love you.
- Me, too.

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,610
Take care.

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,211
And what about you?

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,324
Come on.
I'm going to take you with me.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,041
I'm going to take you with me...
I'm going to take you with me.

68
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,489
Take care.

69
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,011
You think he did it?

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,162
Surely not.

71
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,562
Blow up that plane?

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,571
Of course he did it, Hermilda.

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,608
But he had his reasons.

74
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,768
We've got everyone looking
for Jaime's wife throughout the comunas.

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,085
I want you to find her and kill her.

76
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,801
And kill any motherfucker that
can connect me with that fucking plane.

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,450
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,529
...the functions
of President of Colombia?

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,045
I swear.

80
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,402
The Avianca bombing created
a tidal wave of support for César Gaviria.

81
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,966
He became the 28th President of Colombia
by a landslide.

82
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,007
Well, César, congratulations.

83
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,889
Not César... l mean, Mr. President.

84
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,485
Salud.

85
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
- Salud.
- Salud.

86
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,041
Excuse us.

87
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,730
- As a former president to a new one...
- Mm-hm?

88
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,007
...what advice would you give?

89
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,723
Well... you'll be asked
to make many difficult decisions.

90
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,049
I would say one thing...
do what your wife says.

91
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,521
I always do.

92
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:40,044
Trust your instincts,
and be confident in your decisions.

93
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,531
Yes...

94
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,370
but that's easier said than done.

95
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,681
You'll never be able to please everyone,

96
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,286
so find the solution
that rings true in your heart.

97
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,521
Thank you.

98
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,285
Another thing I did want to tell you,
about the Americans...

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,328
What about the Americans?

100
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,291
This will have to be off the record,
my dear.

101
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,251
I can't have my opinions
broadcast on your television show.

102
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,322
No, no, no.
You have my word.

103
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,880
- The Americans...
- Yes?

104
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,291
Be careful.

105
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,483
We killed José Rodriguez
Gacha with a minimal loss of life.

106
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,169
Bringing Escobar to justice
is my number one priority.

107
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,529
But we will do so
on our own terms and own resources.

108
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,250
We wanna help you catch Escobar.

109
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,365
I have enormous gratitude to you,
especially with Agent Murphy,

110
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,204
whose warnings kept me off that plane.

111
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,370
You, sir, yes. Unfortunately,
not the rest of the passengers.

112
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,690
The people in Colombia are horrified
about the bombing of Avianca's plane.

113
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,163
But they're also against
American soldiers on our soil

114
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,846
and spy planes intercepting calls, so...

115
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,010
America doesn't intercept
civilian phone calls. That's absurd.

116
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,562
Presidente, you need
additional resources to get this man.

117
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,121
Well...

118
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,851
your government's research says...

119
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,371
660 tons of cocaine were consumed
in the United States last year.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,686
Perhaps if your resources
were focused at home,

121
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,091
we'd all be better off.

122
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,849
Gaviria made good
on his promise to go after Escobar.

123
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,491
Colonel Carrillo's Search Bloc
was set loose with a vengeance.

124
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,246
Carrillo mounted dozens of raids.

125
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,529
But with an army of informants,
Escobar somehow always got away.

126
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,721
We sat on the sidelines,
hands tied by bureaucracy.

127
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,051
In response, Pablo took
his narco-terrorism to a whole new level

128
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,091
with a bombing campaign that would
shake the country to its foundations.

129
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,924
In doing his best to avoid war,
that's exactly what Gaviria got.

130
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,482
And the toll on both sides
was devastating.

131
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,367
The thing about war is...
it's just bad for business.

132
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,924
And when you got a bull's-eye
on your back... your rivals get bold.

133
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,806
- Pablo.
- What's up, Pacho?

134
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,325
That's right.

135
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,370
Pablo and the Medellín cartel
weren't the only game in town.

136
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,169
Thank you.

137
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,170
This is Helmer "Pacho" Herrera, one
of the four leaders of the Cali cartel.

138
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,404
While Pablo left a trail of bodies
and chaos in his wake,

139
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,530
Cali made problems disappear with an army
of lawyers and a mountain of legal briefs.

140
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,922
The Medellín cartel was Miami:

141
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,131
swimming pools, bikini girls...
tacky as a two-tone Cadillac.

142
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,130
The Cali cartel was New York:

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,090
elegant, smooth, subtle.

144
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,209
Where they could fuel
the 24-hour nightlife with cocaine,

145
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,763
and still make sure everybody showed up
for work on Wall Street the next morning.

146
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,169
At first, Medellín and Cali
worked side by side.

147
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,291
But in Colombia, when money's involved,
blood inevitably flows.

148
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,489
There had been violence
between Medellín and Cali before.

149
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,246
But right now, a war on two fronts
was not something Pablo could afford.

150
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,605
We have Miami...
and have left you alone in New York.

151
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,287
- Yes, for a price.
- Certainly.

152
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,764
Look, Pacho, we agreed that we would
share the Los Angeles territory...

153
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,444
and that hasn't been happening.

154
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,247
It seems you are not
holding up our agreement.

155
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,967
- How's that?
- Exactly what I'm saying, Pacho.

156
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,005
Look, Pablo...

157
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,085
you know that our partners
sometimes operate independently.

158
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,369
If Mr. Galeano
and Mr. Moncada are correct,

159
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,523
then you have my assurance
that it will be rectified.

160
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,005
Thanks a lot, Pacho.

161
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,245
Disputes between us
cause needless bloodshed.

162
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,043
Then fix it. A war between our groups
is the last thing we need right now.

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,241
It would seem you already have a war.

164
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,886
Maybe bombing that plane
was a step too far.

165
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,485
Careful, Pacho.

166
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,369
Careful.
The only difference between us

167
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,966
is our little misunderstanding
with the government.

168
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,849
And that will be resolved soon.

169
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,008
Besides, that's the business,
for all of us.

170
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,969
- Yes, it's true for all of us.
- Mm-hm.

171
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,243
The only war we are really fighting
is the war against extradition.

172
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,801
And the outcome of that
is something we're all interested in.

173
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,248
It's true, Gustavo.
Gustavo is right.

174
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,722
We have a common goal,
and that is to get rid of extradition.

175
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,331
The United States is big enough
for all of us to operate in.

176
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,406
Let's figure out Los Angeles
once you take care of your business here.

177
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,406
You know what bothers me?

178
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,290
Your arrogance.

179
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,607
Your attitude, your air of superiority.

180
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,322
Careful, Pacho... that you don't
get yourself killed for that.

181
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,809
Thank you for coming.

182
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,408
- I'm gonna kill that homo bastard.
- Pablo, let me kill him.

183
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,766
Stop talking shit, Moncada.

184
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,885
We'll kill that fag later.
Right now, we can't be out in the open.

185
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,681
If that son of a bitch
starts selling shit in Los Angeles,

186
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,881
I'm personally gonna put a gun up his ass
and pull the trigger. I swear.

187
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,526
That will make him fall in love with you.

188
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,121
We got Escobar's most trusted soldiers:

189
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,124
Poison, La Quica, Sure Shot, Blackie.

190
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,044
Cocky, careless motherfuckers.

191
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,202
Now we're hearing about two new guys:

192
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,890
Fernando Galeano and Kiko Moncada,

193
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,167
basically picking up
where Carlos Lehder left off.

194
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,288
Kill the body, the head will die.

195
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,091
Without Colombian permission
to put assets in the air, we can't help.

196
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,001
In terms of intercepts, yeah,
but what do you guys got on ground intel?

197
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,328
- You mean spies?
- Yes.

198
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,200
We don't have any narco assets.

199
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,284
Our human intelligence
is limited to communists.

200
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,928
Besides, Gaviria doesn't want you
chasing Escobar with CIA spies.

201
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,724
But you got satellites
in the sky, right?

202
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,606
Yes, but to use them in pursuit of narcos
would be a direct violation

203
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,411
- of the order of our host country.
- Man, you're CIA.

204
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,925
You break rules all the time.

205
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,442
These are aerial photographs of comunas
controlled by Escobar and his associates.

206
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,563
- We'll use them to track his men.
- These are aerials.

207
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,611
- We can't track individuals with these.
- Take a look.

208
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,008
The Los Priscos gang controls El Poblado.

209
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,323
Here in Santa Cruz, we got the comuna
where they recruited the Avianca bomber.

210
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,643
And both places more densely packed
than a Marrakesh bazaar.

211
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,722
So let's take a tip from the Colombians.

212
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,687
You notice anything special about these?

213
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,969
Search Bloc follows vehicle traffic
in the comunas. You've got...

214
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,610
Japanese imports... four-by-fours.
Cars over 40 grand.

215
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,723
Narcos are the only ones
who can afford these cars.

216
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,526
Whenever aerials see these cars,
we know sicarios are inside.

217
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,485
- That's right.
- We start tracking these rice rockets,

218
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,728
we might be able to get to Escobar.

219
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,808
I think it's up this way.

220
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,170
I don't want to shoot her.

221
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,765
Kill that cute girl?
And the baby, too?

222
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,561
I don't know why the boss
wants us to kill that girl.

223
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,246
- What does she know about Avianca anyway?
- Just shut up and follow orders!

224
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,288
Does he think
putting a bomb on every corner

225
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,930
is gonna get the police
to quit chasing him?

226
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,930
Gustavo, we need to get away,
out of this country.

227
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,122
And go where?

228
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,363
We'll be treated like criminals
wherever we go.

229
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,642
They'll kill him, and you know it.

230
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,769
I just hope he doesn't
take you down with him.

231
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,003
This isn't our war.

232
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,442
This isn't war. it's negotiation.

233
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,641
Don't you understand
what an opportunity this is?

234
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,849
He's willing to consider
terms of surrender...

235
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,486
Under what conditions?

236
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,722
My God, he just blew up a plane!

237
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,161
Eduardo, calm down.
Let the man speak.

238
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,724
We can end this violence
with dignity. it's good for both sides...

239
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,929
Do you realize
how stupid you sound right now?

240
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,206
César, this is absurd.

241
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,123
- Eduardo, please...
- This is a farce.

242
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,565
Please.

243
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,286
Let me deal with this. Please.

244
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,601
Fine. Whatever you want.

245
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,211
We can at least begin a discussion, right?

246
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,129
Even though you never stated it,

247
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,364
surely you'd like
to see the bombings stop.

248
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,763
- Yes. Yes, I would.
- Exactly.

249
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,162
So if we begin a dialogue,
they will cease.

250
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,280
That affords us all some time,
including the Search Bloc.

251
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,761
Fernando...

252
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,444
you saw his money,
and it blinded you to his soul.

253
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,682
That son of a bitch has no soul.

254
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,245
If telling him we're negotiating

255
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,324
allows the bombs to stop
while we find him...

256
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,285
then be my guest.

257
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,245
Thank you.
Really, thank you.

258
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,721
Look, man,
Pablo's turned into a saint.

259
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,131
Of course.

260
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,330
He sends people straight to heaven.

261
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,642
She's not here.
She might have just left.

262
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,728
Let's search the comuna.

263
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,406
Look, Poison, I'm telling you
Pablo is being paranoid.

264
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,562
Careful what you say, son.

265
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,211
One day,
he is going to ask me to kill you.

266
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,163
Would you do it?

267
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,971
If he asks me... of course.

268
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,529
There is no way around it.

269
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,883
Wouldn't you?

270
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,366
All right, all right,
let's just go find this girl.

271
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,681
We'll look around
and see where she's hiding.

272
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,647
What's wrong?

273
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,171
Here you go.

274
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,727
It's OK, Natalie.
Don't worry.

275
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,647
Before you know it, we'll get you
some food. Right? Isn't that right?

276
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,881
Thank you.

277
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,048
What then, Fernando?

278
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,970
Has the Colombian government
offered a truce?

279
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,525
The government
hasn't been willing to offer anything

280
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,284
I would consider acceptable.

281
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,084
What did they offer?

282
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,970
They want you to admit...

283
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,330
That you're responsible for Avianca.

284
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,529
And of course, I told them that...
That we can't even...

285
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,364
Is it that you're not negotiating a thing?

286
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,681
No, no, of course I'm negotiating...

287
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,890
Then why is Carrillo
stopping every car in the comunas

288
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,645
and killing my boys
with the help of the gringos?!

289
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,648
Why are the Americans helping them if we
are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?

290
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,726
Gaviria doesn't want the gringos to know
he's willing to negotiate with you.

291
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,521
That's it.

292
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,362
Be very careful, Fernando.

293
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,962
Yes, Pablo.

294
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,328
Yes.

295
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,249
You've got to stop the bombing, Pablo.

296
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,807
I don't know what you're thinking anymore.

297
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,682
I think we should...

298
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,322
reorganize a bit...

299
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:01,966
and start sending our boys out to burn
some houses down and do some damage

300
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,964
to politicians and senators
all over the country.

301
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,643
And to the soldiers and cops in our way,
the judges who annoy us

302
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,210
and the reporters that watch us,

303
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,285
basically, we have to create a presence so
disruptive they'll want nothing but peace.

304
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,643
That's the only way
we're going to get there.

305
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,328
Is that it? Is that what you want?
A civil war?

306
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,649
- You've gone crazy, asshole.
- We have to fight, brother.

307
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,161
Let's put our hearts into this.

308
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,884
And if we all must die, so be it.

309
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,171
Well, yes...

310
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,131
The thing is,
I don't want to die yet, Pablo.

311
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,290
Nor do I.

312
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,641
But the bombs make the public want peace.

313
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,411
And that will influence the politicians.

314
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,808
You're the one who says the politicians
don't give a shit about the public.

315
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,362
If you want to influence politicians,
you'll have to narrow your focus.

316
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,447
You know what I mean?

317
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,842
Gustavo was right.

318
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,805
They needed a new strategy,

319
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,407
one that brought terror directly
to the people that mattered the most.

320
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,084
What about her?

321
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,401
No, she is way too much of a princess.

322
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,005
Surely we would have problems with her.

323
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,089
My God, look at that face.

324
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,080
The media is going to love that fox,
right?

325
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,130
Sure they will,
but so will our boys.

326
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,850
Just think what
they're gonna do to her.

327
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,842
Well...

328
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,566
I say let's start with her...

329
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,881
...and this fag.

330
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,720
Let's go!

331
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,247
And this cute couple.

332
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,440
When you kill someone, you lose
all your leverage the moment they're dead.

333
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,131
Now, you take someone's children
away from them,

334
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,282
you'd be amazed
what they'd do to get them back.

335
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,160
Family members of
the most influential people in the country

336
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,040
have been kidnapped
on the very streets they call home.

337
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,968
What does Pablo Escobar want?

338
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,810
I'll see you tomorrow on the same channel
for a special report.

339
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,884
Is everything all right?

340
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,961
All the victims are my friends.

341
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,806
Excuse me.

342
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,684
The kidnapping of Francisco Santos,

343
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,240
the editor in chief of the most important
newspaper in the nation,

344
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,330
is the latest and most shocking
in a string of kidnappings

345
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,641
orchestrated by the Medellín cartel.

346
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,449
Reporting to you, I'm Valeria Velez.

347
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,928
- All right.
- First on the scene, right? As always.

348
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,245
Maybe if you actually
had to work for a living,

349
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,926
you'd be hungry enough to get here first.

350
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,967
I found out from Santos' wife...

351
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,964
a half hour after
he didn't show up for dinner.

352
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,881
You?

353
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,961
Who tipped you off?

354
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,290
It's a pleasure to see you,
as always.

355
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,809
These are Pablo's conditions
for the release of the hostages.

356
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,804
You've read them,
you can see they're very reasonable.

357
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,331
"Very reasonable," he says.

358
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,370
You are definitely an imbecile, Fernando.

359
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,449
And I'm going to tell you something.

360
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,764
You will get what you deserve very soon,
I assure you.

361
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,808
I'm also one of those hostages.

362
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,251
I myself could be walking around calmly...
but like them, I am not free.

363
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,765
Escobar is asking us to surrender,
but that will never happen.

364
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,964
If he releases the hostages
and turns himself in,

365
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,486
we will take this into account.

366
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,368
Gaviria isn't going to bend.

367
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,562
Then I'm going to break him.

368
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
You, get up from there.

369
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,164
The body of Ofelia Hernandez was found
dumped next to the Presidential Palace.

370
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,328
One must admire President Gaviria.
I'm sure it can't be easy for him

371
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,529
to stand by his decision
to not negotiate with Escobar.

372
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,046
What's the plan?

373
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,326
A few more hostages and they will give in.

374
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,361
Their time is running out.

375
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,244
I'm talking about us.

376
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,487
What about us, Valeria?

377
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,808
I don't have time
for that pussy shit right now.

378
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,803
Colombia's sweetheart.

379
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,242
You know the only reason
this hag has any fame

380
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,448
is because her father was president.

381
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,921
I despise her.

382
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,522
And why do you care so much?

383
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,004
Your ratings are through the roof, right?

384
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,242
Hers are higher.

385
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,890
Open the door, quick!

386
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,046
Move!

387
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,320
Let's go!

388
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,561
Hurry up!

389
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,971
Where am I?

390
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,046
Hello!

391
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,325
Tell me where I am.

392
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,242
Does my family know I'm alive?

393
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,810
How would I know?

394
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,920
Who are you?

395
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,002
You work for Escobar?

396
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,170
You can call me Gorilla.

397
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,722
Gorilla.

398
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,326
Very well... Gorilla.

399
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,125
Where's my crew?

400
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,525
Did you bring them here as well?

401
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,485
I'm here to guard you. That's it.

402
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,282
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.

403
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,326
We understand the frustration and pain
you must be feeling for your children,

404
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,200
but believe me,
we are doing everything we can

405
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,521
to make sure your children get home soon.

406
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,410
Our daughter was kidnapped
on her way to an interview.

407
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,768
They killed the bodyguard.
No one is safe.

408
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,051
As a former president, I understand
the terrible position you're in.

409
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,926
But we're here to find a solution.

410
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,925
I understand your frustration,
Dr. Turbay.

411
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,802
But if we give in now, any criminal
can hold our government hostage.

412
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,090
This isn't "any criminal."
This is the worst criminal in the world.

413
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,527
- And he is laughing at all of us.
- Mr. President,

414
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,010
you're proceeding as you must, but we must
act as the parents of our children.

415
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,970
Let's pray you find a solution.

416
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,123
A good president
can stand up to external pressure.

417
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,044
It's the internal pressure
that can wear you down.

418
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,731
We knew the clock was ticking before
Gaviria had to cave in to Escobar...

419
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,049
but hopefully not before
our unauthorized operation struck gold.

420
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,970
Catching a top sicario could be the break
we needed in leading us to Pablo.

421
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,927
Here.

422
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,886
We'd continue to join
in an "observational capacity."

423
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,610
Hands up!

424
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,881
Up!

425
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,883
Why are you driving this car?

426
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,601
I don't know. Someone paid me 50,000 pesos
to drive it around the city.

427
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,365
The sicarios had figured out
we were tracking their rides.

428
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,927
So they traded down to junkers
to avoid our eye in the sky.

429
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,049
But we weren't the only ones
that had Pablo in the gun sights.

430
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,929
Pablo came to see me.

431
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,081
Why?

432
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,640
He wants to settle
the dispute we have in the US.

433
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,165
The Los Angeles problems.

434
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,130
He has bigger issues
than that right now.

435
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,646
He'll make a deal with the government.

436
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,930
He's managed to secure
some very effective bargaining chips.

437
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,890
Of course,
he'll look after you guys, right?

438
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,407
We haven't talked to Pablo in weeks.
He's in hiding.

439
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,491
Look at that.
What a beautiful animal, Jorge.

440
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,641
You like it?

441
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,771
Yes, of course.

442
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,640
I'm sure he'll look after you.
After all, you're partners.

443
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,569
Yes, of course. Partners.

444
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,848
You could always have your sister
put in a good word with Gustavo.

445
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,809
What do you mean?

446
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,041
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

447
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,046
It could be gossip.
You know how people like to talk.

448
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,606
You should eat,
because you're going to be here a while.

449
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,569
You're going to get very hungry.

450
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,802
I don't feel well.

451
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,566
What's wrong? Are you sick?

452
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,642
I can get you some medicine.

453
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,731
It's not that kind of illness.

454
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,121
I want to congratulate you.
I know you're a very good reporter.

455
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,766
Thank you.

456
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,720
Gorilla, how long have you been
working for Escobar?

457
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,527
Oh, it's been a while.

458
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,002
So you know what's going on out there,
don't you?

459
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,768
The truth is, I don't go out,
so I have no idea what's happening.

460
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,448
What the fuck are you doing, Gorilla?
Why isn't she wearing the blindfold?

461
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,885
I didn't know you were coming.

462
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,169
Put it on, man!
We have to take her.

463
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,407
Put that on.

464
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,650
- Says who?
- Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?

465
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,484
Just put it on.

466
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,164
Pleasure to finally meet you,
Ms. Turbay.

467
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,290
Sit down, please.

468
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,847
I suppose you want me to interview you?

469
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,401
No, even better.

470
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,131
I'm going to interview you.

471
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,689
So you can tell the world about
the humane treatment you've received here.

472
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,370
Don't you want your parents
to know you're well?

473
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,404
That you're alive?

474
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,962
I don't want to become
a piece of propaganda for you.

475
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,330
Who do you think you are?

476
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,490
So what's necessary, miss,
to have your cooperation?

477
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,528
Let one of the hostages go.

478
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,649
You and I know that
I'm the one you really want.

479
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,045
You see?

480
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,406
Two reasonable people
coming to an agreement.

481
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,324
Maybe we can convince President Gaviria
to do the same. Right?

482
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,642
Mr. Escobar has shown
a willingness to negotiate.

483
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,203
This afternoon,
he let one of the hostages go.

484
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,362
President Gaviria...

485
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:59,084
I ask you to at least
consider discussions with Mr. Escobar.

486
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,811
I don't understand.

487
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,850
I thought you said he wouldn't bend,
but now he's let one go.

488
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,202
Because he has your daughter.

489
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,124
And she's worth more to him
than the rest of them combined.

490
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,010
If you knew all I know, you'd understand
it's nothing more than a stunt.

491
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,690
Give him what he wants.

492
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,240
What he wants is an insult to us
and to this country.

493
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,169
I don't care. I want my child!

494
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,761
What I believe
my wife is trying to say is,

495
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,681
we'd like you to make a deal with Escobar.

496
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,047
If you refuse,
we'll have to take certain measures.

497
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,600
Financially, by robbing you of donors...
and politically,

498
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,084
by robbing you of whatever support
your legislative agenda needs.

499
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,681
Are you threatening me?

500
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,961
We all use the tools at our disposal.

501
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,290
You as a politician, me as a father.
I'm sorry.

502
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,051
Doctor...

503
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,124
you told me to follow my instincts...

504
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,609
and they tell me
not to give in to this criminal.

505
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,161
That was before they took my daughter.

506
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,241
I came over as quickly as I could.
I was told you needed me urgently.

507
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,731
What's up?

508
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,962
You OK?

509
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,802
Tell Fernando...
I'm willing to open negotiations.

510
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,649
We'll make a counter to Escobar's demands.

511
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,402
I thought you weren't going to negotiate.

512
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,247
I have to stop this madness, Eduardo.

513
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,811
But God willing,
we can catch him first.

514
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,769
Tell the Americans
they can put their planes in the air.

515
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,809
And there it was.

516
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,601
Negotiate with a terrorist while
trying to catch him at the same time.

517
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,206
Hammer, we have calls
originating in Comuna 3,

518
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,643
Manrique, from known
sicario satellite phones.

519
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,484
Do you have a location?

520
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,766
What?

521
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,325
Yes, we're here in Campo Valdés.

522
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,204
Campo Valdés.

523
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,409
That's in the central eastern area,
bordered by the Comuna Popular.

524
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,970
Roger that.

525
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,405
Campo Valdés.

526
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,404
Going into the comunas
without Colombian backup,

527
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,807
that's about the most dangerous
thing you can do.

528
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,770
We're gonna
score a quick goal and then come back out.

529
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,968
All right, all right. All right.

530
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,766
That's how bad
we wanted to catch these guys.

531
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,964
Don't kill me, please!

532
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,931
I swear I didn't hear anything!
I'm not going to say anything!

533
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,321
Please, don't kill me.

534
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,164
- I'm not...
- Hey! Hey!

535
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,728
- Please, don't kill me!
- What?

536
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,849
I'm begging you, please...

537
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,126
You could have at least waited till
I got her off me. Look at me now! Huh?

538
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,328
You got blood all over my new shoes.

539
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,643
I don't give a shit about your shoes.
Stop bitching.

540
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,126
I'm not.

541
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,447
What about her?

542
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,411
Put a bullet in her.

543
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,567
What? The baby's not a witness, man.

544
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,808
I don't give a shit.

545
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,651
- Pablo told us to kill everyone.
- Yeah, but it's a baby.

546
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,007
She won't say shit in court.

547
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,525
If she grows up and talks?

548
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,002
Really? Do you remember
what your mom told you when you were two?

549
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,048
Why is it so fucking difficult
for you to follow Pablo's orders? Huh?

550
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,367
Drop the gun.

551
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,810
Now!

552
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,050
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

553
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,327
Let him go!

554
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,601
Let him go!

555
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,087
- Put the gun down.
- You put yours down.

556
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,243
I don't want to have to kill you.

557
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,402
I will.

558
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,888
Fuck.

559
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,166
Fuck!

560
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,331
Hey.

561
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,364
Hey...

562
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,407
So those fags want to sit and negotiate.

563
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,406
Well...

564
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,481
we have to spend some time in jail, right?

565
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,369
So what the fuck.

566
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,371
You won, Pablo. They gave in.

567
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,765
But that faggot president has yet
to accept our most important demand

568
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,490
before we turn ourselves in.

569
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,930
Which demand is that?

570
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,248
It's been a while
since we've been up here, right?

571
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,367
Yeah.

572
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,087
We used to come up here
with our girlfriends and smoke a joint.

573
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,567
What does that have to do with anything?

574
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,001
I know every centimeter
of these mountains.

575
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,321
From here,
we can see anything coming.

576
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,041
And we have enough space
to build whatever we want.

577
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,567
We're going to design it...

578
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,723
we're going to build it...

579
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,966
and we will be protected
from all our enemies.

580
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,761
- You want to build a jail?
- Not a jail, cousin.

581
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,490
A castle.

582
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,514
