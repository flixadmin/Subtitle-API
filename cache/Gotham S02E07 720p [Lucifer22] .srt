1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,601
<i>Previously, on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:05,470
That's for Reggie.
Now, I don't know

3
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,939
what you want with
Master Bruce, but I'm certain

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,709
that his life's gonna be a damn
sight better without you in it.

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,778
I would be honored
if you would consider

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,380
endorsing me for mayor.
If you can give me
your word that

7
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,283
we won't have to face it alone,
you'll have my endorsement.

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,519
It's been some time
since I've had a meal like this.

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,720
You should come over more often.

10
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,022
We can, like, hang out
or whatever.

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,090
I'd like that.

12
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:26,792
Let go of me, you freak!

13
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:27,993
Listen to me.

14
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,328
I did it<i> for</i> you.

15
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,964
Kristen?

16
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,034
I've been following the
goings-on at Wayne Enterprises.

17
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,704
What have you learned?
That your father
was a good man.

18
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,773
But in spite of that, bad things
happened at his company.

19
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,944
(screams)
Looking for Penguin's mother,
weren't you?

20
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,547
I have to obey him
in all things.

21
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,351
Penguin has brainwashed
this poor soul. Can we help?

22
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,986
(grunting)

23
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,490
I'll leave you two
to it.

24
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,363
Father Creel.

25
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,332
You have the Wayne boy?

26
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,434
Not yet, but soon.

27
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,303
I found your mother.
Where?

28
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,771
In a warehouse
down by the port.

29
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,717
You sure this is it?

30
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,452
GILZEAN:
I'm sure, boss.

31
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,588
Once my mother is safe,

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,724
we go after Galavan
and his sister.

33
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,926
They're gonna pay
for what they've done.

34
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,635
Mother!

35
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,004
Mother.
(laughs)

36
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,173
(gasps)

37
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,975
You're okay.

38
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,209
Thank God.

39
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,678
Oswald?

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,047
Is that really you?

41
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,116
Your sweet face.

42
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,218
Like a vision.

43
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,854
I'm taking you home, okay?

44
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,556
Oh!

45
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,962
THEO:
And there I was,

46
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,433
thinking you understood the
meaning of consequences.

47
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,334
Consequences, yes.

48
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,936
I assure you

49
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,805
that my understanding
of consequences

50
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,240
will be made quite clear
once my mother

51
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,542
is outside.

52
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,778
But we've had
so much fun together.

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,914
My sister gets attached
to her playthings,

54
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,849
so I must insist
she stay.

55
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,285
And those bolt
cutters are useless.

56
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,886
The only way
out of there

57
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,889
is with this.

58
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,859
Very well.

59
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,993
Butch?

60
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,262
Shoot them both in the
head and grab the key.

61
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,197
Oswald?

62
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,698
Mother, I'm sorry,

63
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,701
but what they've
done to you will not stand!

64
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,173
I gave you an order!

65
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,675
Shoot them both in the head.

66
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,082
No.

67
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,851
No, no, no,
that's not possible.

68
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,421
You have to obey me.

69
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,156
You have to!

70
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,125
That time has passed.

71
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,327
They fixed me.

72
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,962
Tabby is well-versed

73
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:19,431
in the protocols
of conditioning.

74
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,200
There's always a trigger word
implanted during the process.

75
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,768
All I had to do

76
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,904
was get Butch remember
what it is.

77
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,707
I'll admit,
it took a few tries.

78
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,912
And now here we are.

79
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,183
(gasps)

80
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,353
Please.

81
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,088
I can still be valuable.

82
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,922
You'll see.

83
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,658
I so wish
that were true.

84
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,927
Then kill me if you must,
but let her go.

85
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,297
I'm begging you.

86
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,733
Doesn't look like begging to me.

87
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,536
Indeed, half-hearted
at best.

88
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,875
Please.

89
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,077
I'll do anything.

90
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,847
(sighs)

91
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,482
Perhaps she has
served her purpose.

92
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,617
Don't pout.

93
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,219
You still have the
former mayor.

94
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,620
He's so dull.

95
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,222
He just moans all the time.

96
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,999
(whimpering)

97
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,168
(laughing)

98
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,273
I told you everything
would be okay.

99
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,341
Didn't I?
(laughs)

100
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,209
And it will be.

101
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,979
(knife slashes)

102
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,154
No!

103
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,221
No!

104
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,259
(sobbing)

105
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,064
Oswald?

106
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,333
What is wrong?

107
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,903
You look so sad.

108
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:05,737
(sniffles)

109
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,505
Nothing's wrong, Mother.

110
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,841
Nothing at all.

111
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,277
We're together now.

112
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,679
That's all that matters.

113
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,381
That's all
that ever mattered, right?

114
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,784
Ever since...

115
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,687
you were a little baby.

116
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,991
My little Cobblepot.

117
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,061
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,464
This is my fault.

119
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,698
Please forgive me.

120
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,035
I'm so sorry.

121
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,303
For what?

122
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:42,107
You were always such a good boy.

123
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,748
No, no.

124
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,191
THEO:
Kill him.

125
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,393
Dump the bodies...

126
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,330
...anywhere.

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,834
You don't have the stomach
to kill me yourself?

128
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,905
No wonder your family was
run out of town.

129
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,775
You come from a long line

130
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,743
of cowards!

131
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,213
(sighs)

132
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,948
Fine, fine.

133
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,359
Any last words?

134
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,460
Yes.

135
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,763
I'm going to kill you.

136
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,031
(screams)

137
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,445
(breath trembling)

138
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,979
KRINGLE:
<i>You are a psychopath!</i>

139
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,950
I am not the man
you think I am!

140
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,819
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

141
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,855
(gasps)

142
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:08,927
(sighs)

143
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,996
DARK NYGMA:
Rise and shine.

144
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,932
(laughs)

145
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,867
What are you doing here?

146
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,235
I banished you for good.

147
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,804
Almost. Love of a good woman
and all of that.

148
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,406
Though, we both know

149
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,008
how that turned out. Yikes.

150
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,545
That was an accident.

151
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,748
I'm not that man.

152
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,450
I'm gonna make this right.

153
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,352
See, I knew you'd wake up
all boo-hooey.

154
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,688
You probably have half a mind
to turn yourself in.

155
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,423
Luckily, I have the other half.

156
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,159
Do you like magic tricks?

157
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:41,826
What?

158
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,294
Of course you like magic tricks.

159
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,462
After all, I do.

160
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,064
Well, guess what?

161
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,899
I can make a body disappear.

162
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,001
(gasps)

163
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,312
Where is she?

164
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,449
Where is Ms. Kringle's body?

165
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,451
Open the envelope.

166
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,724
"I hid her body while
you were catching some Zs,

167
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,859
"you'll need a helping hand,

168
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,196
so look for her initials
down at the GCPD."

169
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,601
You went to my work last night?

170
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,969
Well, technically, you did.

171
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,771
I was just in the driver's seat,

172
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,406
so to speak.
How?

173
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,876
You're a figment
of my imagination.

174
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,478
A projection of impulse.

175
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,746
Nothing more.

176
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,714
That is uncalled for.

177
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,751
Uncalled for?

178
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,320
You hijacked my body
while I was asleep

179
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,989
and you stole
my dead girlfriend.

180
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,758
(laughs):
Okay.

181
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,126
Yeah, that's true.

182
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,195
But I'm doing this
for your own good.

183
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,331
If I was you-- which, again,

184
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,033
I sort of am--
I'd get cracking.

185
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,836
You do want to find
the body first, right?

186
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,905
REPORTER:<i> Reporting live from</i>
<i>city hall, as we celebrate</i>

187
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,240
the latest mayoral election.

188
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,509
Early exit polling confirmed
that Gotham City's new mayor

189
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,044
will be Theo Galavan,

190
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,046
who is projected to win
in a landslide,

191
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,882
helped by the endorsement
of many prominent citizens,

192
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,051
including police union president
James Gordon,

193
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,652
city controller Edwin...

194
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,588
(TV clicks off)
I can't believe

195
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,389
you're gonna be mayor
of this sinkhole.

196
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,392
Can I go
to the victory party tonight?

197
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,727
You promised me fun.

198
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,663
When are we gonna
unleash a little hell?

199
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,632
There'll be plenty of time

200
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,134
for unleashing hell and parties

201
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,571
once Bruce Wayne
has signed over his company

202
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,808
and met his unfortunate destiny.

203
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,376
Until then,

204
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,012
I need focus.

205
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,617
Young Bruce
has become fond of you.

206
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,685
His trust will be crucial
when the time comes.

207
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,220
I need you

208
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:52,090
to ensure that no one else
is whispering in his ear

209
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,459
until I make my offer.

210
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,995
See this finger?

211
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:00,098
I've got little Bruce
wrapped tight around it.

212
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,667
What a vixen you've become.

213
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,971
You make me very proud.

214
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,107
And we have Penguin
to deal with.

215
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,844
I'm on it.
No.

216
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,245
I'm about to become mayor.

217
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,582
I'm gonna have
an army at my disposal.

218
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,652
Time to use it.

219
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,488
BULLOCK:<i> Looks like you backed</i>
<i>the right horse.</i>

220
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,989
You trust him?

221
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,157
A Gotham politician?

222
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,126
About as far as
I can throw him.

223
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,561
But if he gives the
GCPD what it needs,

224
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,064
he's all right by me.

225
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,067
You know, Selina said
Penguin was behind

226
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,769
the Wayne Enterprise fires.

227
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,170
So?

228
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,805
First he's going
after mayoral candidates,

229
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,874
next thing you know,
he's burning down buildings.

230
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,008
Doesn't make any sense.

231
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,343
Guy is an abacus
of crazy.

232
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,545
Nothing he does
surprises me.

233
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,353
What the hell happened?

234
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,287
Penguin.

235
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,489
He tried to kill our next mayor.

236
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,697
Mr. Cobblepot knew
that I was poised

237
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,399
to win the election today,
and he came to me

238
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,234
seeking an alliance.
And you refused.

239
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,638
(scoffs)
I politely declined, yes.

240
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,806
So he stabbed you
in the neck?

241
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,040
GORDON:
That seems like

242
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,408
a pretty extreme reaction,

243
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,576
even for Penguin.

244
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,411
We've been trying
to build a case

245
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,080
against Penguin
since I got here.

246
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,615
We assume that he's
behind the earlier attacks

247
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,950
on the other candidates as well.

248
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,519
And this is the second time
he's tried to kill me.

249
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,954
The man is a menace.

250
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,323
And one that I fully intend
to put behind bars.

251
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,491
I assume you have

252
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,592
something for me?

253
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:37,729
Arrest warrant
for Oswald Cobblepot

254
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,597
as well as search
and seizures

255
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,899
on all his properties
and known associates.

256
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,468
Quite a list.

257
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,902
We'll get right on it.

258
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,104
Anything else?

259
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,106
Yes. In lieu
of recent events,

260
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,441
Judge Turnball has declared
a state of emergency

261
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,609
and granted the
mayor's office

262
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,077
additional powers.

263
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,196
Meaning what, exactly?

264
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:57,314
The moment I'm sworn in,
I'm implementing a curfew

265
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,683
and I'm ordering
your Strike Force

266
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,918
to begin door-to-door searches

267
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,553
until Mr. Cobblepot

268
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,888
is apprehended.

269
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,891
You're talking
about martial law?

270
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,792
We're talking

271
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,794
about bringing
a dangerous fugitive

272
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,195
to justice.

273
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,498
We'll be acting within
our legal rights.

274
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,532
Am I right, Mr. Dent?

275
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,567
Absolutely.

276
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,569
You'll have our
full support, sir.

277
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,772
Thank you, Captain.

278
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,476
Detective Gordon?

279
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,544
You seem...

280
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,946
hesitant.

281
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,982
Cautious.

282
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,918
(sighs)
You told me we needed to use

283
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,888
every method at our disposal
to go after men like Penguin.

284
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,557
Men who don't play
by the rules.

285
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,492
Desperate times call
for a strong measure.

286
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,361
I have no problem going
after Penguin

287
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,429
with everything we've got,

288
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,464
but if we start kicking down
the doors of average citizens

289
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,734
and policing through fear,
we're no better than he is.

290
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,136
People still need to trust us.

291
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,671
And they will.

292
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,339
Because at the end of the day,

293
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,109
all people want is to feel safe.

294
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,580
Just remember, Detective.

295
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,916
You came to me.

296
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,499
REPORTER:
...Theo Galavan will be
the mayor of Gotham.

297
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,368
A crowd has gathered outside,
and the excitement is brimming,

298
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,436
and in just a moment,

299
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,039
we'll also be talking
to many of the supporters

300
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,441
that gave up their time
and effort to support...

301
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,811
(TV clicks off)

302
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,279
What do you have
against the front door?

303
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,414
Nothing.

304
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,216
It's the ape who opens it

305
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,385
who I could live without.

306
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,688
I haven't seen you in a month.

307
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,690
Selina, what are you doing here?

308
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,392
You wouldn't believe
the week I've had.

309
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,827
This friend of mine, Bridgit,

310
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,496
decided to build this fire suit.

311
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,530
Selina...

312
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,898
Some people just don't...

313
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,502
Whose is that?

314
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,704
Sorry. I got lost
on the way back from...

315
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,940
Hello.

316
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,810
Hi.

317
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,815
Silver St. Cloud,
this is my friend Selina.

318
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,417
Selina, this is Silver.

319
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,086
Nice to meet you.

320
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,755
You, too.

321
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,757
Are you staying for lunch?

322
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,225
No.
Please say you are.

323
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,895
I just moved here
and don't know many people.

324
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:27,465
Bruce, go tell Alfred to set
another place for lunch.

325
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,599
Come on, it'll be fun!

326
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,868
Go. Shoo.

327
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,245
While it's just us girls,

328
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,814
let me give you a little advice.

329
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,185
You come around here again...

330
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,855
Well, that would be bad.

331
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,191
For you.

332
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,525
(chuckles)

333
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,527
Who the hell are you?

334
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,696
I'm Bruce's friend.

335
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,666
His only friend.

336
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,635
(sniffs)

337
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,003
(chuckles)

338
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,240
And you're a piece
of gutter trash.

339
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,442
Now, tell me something,

340
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:15,613
would anyone miss you
if one day you were just...

341
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,215
gone?

342
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,584
(chuckles)

343
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,819
I didn't think so.

344
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,754
BRUCE:
I told Alfred.

345
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,593
What are you guys talking about?

346
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,228
Nothing.

347
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,230
Just girl stuff.

348
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,334

No.

373
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,171
Come on.

374
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,009
OFFICER: Hey, Mike, can you
give me a hand with this?

375
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,790
Putting Penguin
in the crosshairs of the GCPD

376
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,458
will drive him underground.

377
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,161
We can't kill him
if we can't find him.

378
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,896
We won't have to find him.

379
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,765
He's going to deliver
himself to us.

380
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,001
And why would he do that?

381
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,237
Penguin's rage will consume
his better judgment,

382
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:24,241
leaving him with an insatiable
craving for revenge.

383
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,645
All we need to do
is keep him hungry

384
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,081
and invite him to dinner.

385
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,884
And then I get to kill him?

386
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,521
Yes, kitten.

387
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,724
Then you get to kill him.

388
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,793
<i>First, I would like</i>
<i>to thank this city</i>

389
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,730
for the immense trust
it has placed in me.

390
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,298
I'm eager to get to work.

391
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,401
I'd also like to address
the recent attempt on my life

392
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,669
by the man known as Penguin.

393
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,838
It is true that he attacked me,

394
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,207
and as of now,
he is still at large.

395
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,276
Men such as Penguin
will no longer be tolerated.

396
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,346
These are men who scurry
from the light of decency

397
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,115
like cockroaches.

398
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,850
Men who...

399
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,785
not even a mother could love.

400
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,987
(reporters shouting)

401
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,293
(clattering)

402
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,164
He dies.

403
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,166
Tonight.

404
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,141
BULLOCK:
Yeah. Got it.

405
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,877
Gilzean's holed up in
a booze joint downtown.

406
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,278
Penguin?
Hmm-mm.

407
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,013
And get this. Word on the street

408
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,915
is Gilzean's started
his own crew.

409
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,850
Sounds like they had
a falling out.

410
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,252
Maybe he's ready to talk.

411
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:41,886
Yeah.

412
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:42,987
Hey.

413
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,622
I heard about what happened
to our new mayor.

414
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,623
Never a dull moment, huh?

415
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,991
No kidding.

416
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,325
You left your keys again
this morning.

417
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,293
Oh.

418
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,761
(softly):
Thank you.

419
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,797
What's this one?

420
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,899
A key to my apartment.

421
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,300
Oh?

422
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,068
I'll be in the car.

423
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,404
What? It's just a key.

424
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,673
Yeah, no, uh...

425
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,809
Do you want a key to my place?

426
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,010
Not even a little bit.

427
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,378
Wait. Do you have a place?

428
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,312
I think so.

429
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,380
Sorry. Caught me off guard.

430
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,781
I guess I do spend
most nights there.

431
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:11,849
Which I love.

432
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:15,186
What I don't love is hauling ass
out of bed at 2:00 a.m.

433
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,787
when you come home
from a stakeout

434
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,789
smelling of chili dogs.

435
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,525
I love to watch you squirm.

436
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,060
I was not squirming.

437
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,895
Little squirm.

438
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,431
(sighs)

439
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,234
I had no idea

440
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,470
we were entertaining today,
Master Bruce.

441
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,706
Anyone else popping by?

442
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,174
BRUCE:
No. Thank you, Alfred.

443
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,943
SILVER:
This is marvelous, Alfred.

444
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:41,679
I fell in love
with Lapsang souchong

445
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,580
when I lived in Fujian.

446
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,814
Driving through
the Wuyi region,

447
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,182
all you could smell

448
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,617
is the burning cedar
they use to smoke leaves.

449
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,121
Right, well, technically
it's, uh, pinewood, miss,

450
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,957
but I appreciate
the enthusiasm.

451
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,658
(sniffs)

452
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,527
That smell

453
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,697
really does slap you
in the face, doesn't it, Alfred?

454
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,932
(chuckles)

455
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,101
So, Selina?

456
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,970
Tell me about yourself.

457
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,105
Any family?

458
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,875
You really buying her act?

459
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,010
I beg your pardon?

460
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,212
Let me ask you

461
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,648
a question.

462
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,783
How long have you been
a two-faced slut?

463
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,253
Selina!
No, seriously,
what're you after?

464
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,387
It's the money, right?

465
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,123
I mean it's not
his wacky sense of humor.

466
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,458
I think I should go.

467
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,492
No, wait.

468
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:29,727
Is that a tear?

469
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,730
You're good.

470
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,998
I'm sorry.

471
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,533
Good-bye, Bruce.

472
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,269
Silver.

473
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,971
What did you just do?!

474
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,407
I know you're not the best judge

475
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,776
of, like, you know, people,

476
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,078
but that girl is bad news.

477
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,980
I just did you a favor.

478
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,616
I want you to leave.

479
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,852
(scoffs)

480
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,487
Fine.

481
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,421
Whatever.

482
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,223
Maybe you're right.

483
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,360
Maybe I'm not
the best judge of people.

484
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,567
Because all this time,
I thought you were my friend.

485
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,468
But clearly,

486
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,671
you have no idea
what that means.

487
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,429
"I'm tired of hiding
and want to be free.

488
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,631
"To locate her body,

489
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,200
find the two things missing
from me."

490
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,936
DARK NYGMA: The back of our head
kind of looks funny.

491
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,038
It's like the top of a pencil.

492
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,341
Why are you doing this?

493
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:53,210
Because... it's fun!

494
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,212
And it's good for you.

495
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,948
How is it good for
me to be tortured?

496
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,050
To be driven insane!

497
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,252
I'm trying to show you
who you are.

498
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,321
How have you not
realized that yet?

499
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,457
Though, to be honest,

500
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,126
I'm surprised you haven't
figured out this riddle yet.

501
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,228
Should I have
made it easier?

502
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,896
You could start by
using proper grammar.

503
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,633
A period at the end
of a sentence is...

504
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,267
"Find the two things
missing from ME..."

505
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,169
M, period, E, period.

506
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,337
Oh, God.

507
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,839
M.E.-- medical examiner.

508
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,074
You didn't!

509
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,876
I did.

510
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:38,822
I say we wait and see if
someone can walk us inside.

511
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,458
Try and keep things civil.

512
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,264
Did I tell you I was
thinking about getting a cat?

513
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,767
What?

514
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,335
Hey! How are you?

515
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,270
Why don't you get your
head in the game here?

516
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,039
I'm sorry.

517
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,140
It's just...

518
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:59,276
Do you believe
Galavan's story?

519
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,644
Questions like that
are above my pay grade

520
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,446
and below my
sense of wonder.

521
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,281
Penguin's a pragmatist.

522
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,417
Hitting Galavan
for refusing an alliance?

523
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,585
That doesn't get him
anything but heat.

524
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,988
So, what really
happened do you think?

525
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,158
A few months ago, nobody knew
who Galavan was, right?

526
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Now, all of a sudden,
he's mayor?

527
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,394
Doesn't happen by accident.

528
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,429
It takes planning.

529
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,964
And it takes help.

530
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,866
Guys like Galavan
are born on third base.

531
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,935
Stealing home's
practically a birthright.

532
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,437
Think about the timing.

533
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:30,007
He shows up just after
Mayor James disappears.

534
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,042
The massacre
at the gala

535
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,078
turns him into a hero.

536
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,314
Penguin's assassination attempts
on mayoral candidates

537
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:38,982
launched his campaign.

538
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,720
Everything that's
gone down up to this point,

539
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:45,255
you could argue
was orchestrated.

540
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,624
Look, what you're talking about
is Machiavellian-level crazy,

541
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,060
even by Gotham standards.

542
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,262
Yeah.

543
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,902
There's our door pass.

544
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,906
MAN:
<i>Yeah, so your mother tells you.</i>

545
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,042
Yeah, his mama stopped
talking to me ages ago.

546
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,478
(laughter)
Oh, finally.

547
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,247
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey!

548
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,750
BULLOCK:
I wouldn't!

549
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,351
Aw, come on.

550
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,320
(laughs):
I really wouldn't.

551
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,391
That's a lot of firepower
there, Butch.

552
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,128
You expecting company?

553
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,363
Neighborhood ain't what
it used to be, Jim.

554
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,498
Where's Penguin?

555
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,466
How should I know?

556
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,369
You're the boss' lapdog and you
don't know where your owner is?

557
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,304
I ain't nobody's lapdog.

558
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,106
Not anymore.

559
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,007
Prove it.

560
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,743
Tell us why the hell
Penguin went after Galavan.

561
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,378
I ain't telling you anything.

562
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,647
And unless you have a warrant,

563
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,415
I'm gonna have to ask
you boys to leave.

564
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,750
Yeah, see the thing is

565
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,352
our newly elected mayor
kind of

566
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,020
wants results on this.

567
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:53,223
So we drag you in, chances are
that's where you're gonna stay.

568
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,460
ZSASZ:
I'm here for Gilzean!

569
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:03,000
Anyone who leaves now
leaves alive.

570
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,770
Anyone who stays

571
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,539
dies!

572
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:12,276
You have 60 seconds
to do the math.

573
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,444
Sorry, Butch.

574
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,514
Seriously?

575
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,517
No honor among scumbags, huh?

576
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,686
Hey, don't shoot!
I'm out of here!

577
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,826
(grunting)

578
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,964
What are you doing?

579
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,666
You tell us what the hell's
going on with Penguin

580
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,201
or we leave you with Zsasz.

581
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,435
You can't do that.

582
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,637
Bullock?
We can totally do that.

583
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,208
Galavan was telling
Penguin what to do.

584
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,476
Knocking off the candidates,
torching the buildings--

585
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,911
it all came down
from Galavan.

586
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,847
The hell was Penguin
taking orders?

587
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,115
Kidnapped Penguin's mother.

588
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,484
He was keeping her
for leverage.
"Kidnapped"?

589
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,154
Jim?

590
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,056
I think we need to go.

591
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,957
I didn't think Galavan
actually go through with it.

592
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,426
Go through with what?

593
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,127
Go through
with what?!

594
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,668
GCPD!
Put down your weapons!

595
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,641
(gunfire)

596
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,087
We're outmanned here
big time, partner.

597
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,588
Yeah.

598
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,190
But not out-gunned.

599
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,092
Oh, hell yeah.

600
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,545
(siren wailing in distance)

601
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,515
ZSASZ:
I'll take that as a no!

602
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,517
See you later, Butch!

603
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,553
(door slams)

604
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,188
(tires squealing)

605
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,694
That's a new one.

606
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,596
You think he was
telling the truth?

607
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:15,232
Nobody's
telling the truth.

608
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,234
This is Gotham.

609
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,577
Bruce.

610
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,447
What a lovely surprise.

611
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,581
Hello, sir.

612
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,750
I was looking for Silver.

613
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,752
She's here.

614
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,455
Seemed a bit upset
when she came in.

615
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,290
Yes, a friend of mine

616
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,859
stopped by the house
when Silver was there.

617
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,294
They--
Say no more.

618
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,630
I was your age once.
(chuckles)

619
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,265
Your feelings
do you credit.

620
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,000
I never met your father,
but it's clear

621
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,303
that he instilled in you
a sound moral compass.

622
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,405
He did.

623
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,343
You know, we're both...

624
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,111
very alike.

625
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:04,147
Born into wealth
and privilege,

626
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:07,651
yet forced to walk
our lives alone.

627
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:10,620
Haunted by loss.

628
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,122
Driven to prove
ourselves worthy

629
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,491
to those who came before.

630
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,528
Be careful, Bruce.

631
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,564
That way of thinking--

632
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,933
the need to fill a void--

633
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,601
it can consume you.

634
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,503
Does it every go away?

635
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:27,771
No.

636
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:30,774
But you can find closure;

637
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:33,543
a way to move on
without letting go.

638
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,178
How?

639
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,014
Well...
(chuckles)

640
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,548
I don't want to make
any promises,

641
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,916
but when the time is right,

642
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,152
we'll talk again.

643
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,354
(footsteps approaching)

644
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,526
I, uh, need to get
ready for the party.

645
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:52,229
Excuse me.

646
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,466
I knew you'd come.

647
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,675
No one's to kill Galavan but me.

648
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,677
Understand?

649
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,413
Boss, I get what you're feeling.

650
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,815
Mother's love--
it's the most beautiful,

651
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,884
most simple--
Gabe!

652
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:16,453
Cops aren't gonna let you within
a hundred feet of Galavan.

653
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:20,323
Let us whack him for you,
please?

654
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,125
No.

655
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,428
He's mine.

656
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,829
(sniffles)

657
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,732
Now, let's get dressed.

658
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:32,102
We've got a party to attend.

659
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,604
Listen up, people!

660
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,440
(indistinct chatter)

661
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,442
Our newly elected mayor
is going ahead

662
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,710
with his victory
celebration tonight.

663
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,680
He will be exposed.

664
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,682
He will be vulnerable.

665
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:48,585
And he will be protected.

666
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:49,986
By you.

667
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,722
The brave men and women
of this police force.

668
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,559
You all have your assignments.

669
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:58,462
Detective Gordon here
will be running point.

670
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,864
Detective?

671
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,266
Penguin has already

672
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,836
made one attempt
on Galavan's life today.

673
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:09,139
We should be ready for anything.

674
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,576
Let's show this city
what it means to carry a badge.

675
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:15,245
As you were.

676
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,423
GORDON:
<i>I want check-ins from perimeter</i>
<i>teams every five minutes.</i>

677
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:29,626
Martinez,
how's the avenue looking?

678
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,695
All clear.

679
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,764
Sniper Teams Alpha and Bravo
report all clear as well.

680
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,700
Copy that.

681
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,168
What you find out?

682
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,437
Spoke to the super at
Gertrude Cobblepot's building.

683
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,839
Turns out, no one's
seen her for two weeks.

684
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,875
Timeline matches
Gilzean's story.

685
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:49,045
Maybe or maybe the old broad's
on a sunset cruise, hmm?

686
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,447
You know, there's something

687
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:53,316
that Gilzean said
that I can't shake.

688
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,552
He said he never thought Galavan
would go through with it.

689
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,786
Go through with what?

690
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,054
I don't think

691
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,624
Gertrude Cobblepot
is on a cruise.

692
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:03,026
Ladies and gentlemen,

693
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:06,463
let me be the first
to officially

694
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,199
introduce you to the honorable

695
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,535
Theo Galavan,

696
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,537
the new mayor of Gotham!

697
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,540
(crowd cheering)

698
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:52,576
♪ ♪

699
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,759
Ed?

700
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,161
(gasps)
Oh...

701
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:12,629
What are you doing?

702
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,599
Dr. Thompkins, hello.

703
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,767
Uh, I'm just...

704
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,137
double-checking notes
for a Jane Doe case I'm working.

705
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,305
Do you need help?

706
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,707
No! No, no, no.
She's all gone.

707
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:24,841
Or she's--

708
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:25,775
I'm sorry, I'm--

709
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,112
I'm all done
with checking my notes.

710
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,147
Uh, what notes?

711
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,585
It's all up here.
(quiet laugh)

712
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:36,686
Do you realize that

713
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,089
by assigning simple
mnemonic devices to case files,

714
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,390
you can produce recall capacity

715
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,058
equal to that
of photographic

716
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,427
or even eidetic memory?

717
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,963
Ed, what's going on?
Okay.

718
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,998
(chuckles nervously)

719
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,634
Um, truth be told,

720
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,135
uh...

721
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,070
I was hoping
to run into you here.

722
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,038
Alone.

723
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,173
It's Miss Kringle.

724
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,242
Uh...

725
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,444
We had a fight.

726
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,548
I'm sorry.

727
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,185
(chuckles) Every relationship
hits a rough patch now and then.

728
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,388
And you've been so supportive.

729
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,158
And I was hoping that maybe
we-we could go grab a coffee

730
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,960
and you could give me
some advice.

731
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,462
Uh, do you want to finish up
what you were doing first?
No, no, no, no.

732
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,464
I... I can come back
another time.

733
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,033
It's not like they're
gonna go anywhere, right?

734
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,034
(laughs)

735
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:25,468
You'd think so.

736
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,270
(chuckling):
Yeah, okay.

737
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
THEO:
Detective Gordon.

738
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,916
WOMAN:
Hey. That's it, sir.

739
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,685
Perfect.
Thank you so much.

740
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,554
I, uh, heard about
your shoot-out today.

741
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,757
Something about one
of Penguin's former Lieutenants,

742
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,992
a Butch Gilzean?

743
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:52,062
Some men ambushed us
as we were questioning him.

744
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:53,430
He escaped.

745
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,832
Did you get anything out of him?

746
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,701
Before the attack?

747
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,370
No.

748
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,739
That's a pity.

749
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:05,942
Well...

750
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,251
MARTINEZ: Detective,
I have a large group of men

751
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,654
approaching from off
the main road.

752
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:28,198
I have eyes on the target.

753
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,799
Appears to be Cobblepot, sir.

754
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,601
Hold your fire.

755
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,403
Perimeter units,
prepare to engage.

756
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,406
(gun fires)

757
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,408
The target is down.

758
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,976
Martinez, I said hold your fire.

759
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:40,810
It wasn't us.

760
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,079
We have an unknown
shooter on the roof.

761
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,249
I repeat: we have an unknown
shooter on the roof.

762
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,094
GORDON:
<i>Martinez.</i>

763
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,963
Is Penguin dead?

764
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,201
No, it wasn't him.
GORDON: Find the other shooter

765
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,203
and find Penguin--
we need him alive.

766
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,275
MARTINEZ: Detective, all the
targets are dressed as Penguin,

767
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,376
and all are heavily armed.

768
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,644
Positive I.D. is impossible.

769
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,150
Martinez,
you're clear to engage.

770
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,852
All perimeter units,
crash our location now.

771
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,649
Drop it.

772
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,384
Turn around.

773
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,119
Hands above
your head, now.

774
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,190
So forceful.

775
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,125
I like a strong
confident man.

776
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,763
(coughs)

777
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,847
(gun fire continues)

778
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,386
GORDON: We got
to get you out of here.

779
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,522
Radio his driver,
have him pull the car around

780
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,523
to the back service entrance.

781
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,858
Got it?
Yes.

782
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,326
Cover us?
No problem.

783
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,168
(speaks indistinctly)

784
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,438
MAN: Remaining officers stay
inside and clear the lobby.

785
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,907
MAN 2: Confirmed.
Primary is on the move.

786
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,443
Initiating exit plan
using the south entrance.

787
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,912
MAN 3: Roger that,
Detective Gordon is en route

788
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,914
to the rear entrance
with the mayor.

789
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:01,651
Need that limo at the back
service entrance, stat.

790
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,119
MAN 4:
Copy that.

791
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,157
Get him out of here!

792
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,662
(gun fires)

793
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,097
Go!

794
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,501
Hello, Jim.

795
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,005
Please step aside.

796
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:23,806
You know I can't do that.

797
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,910
You would if you knew what kind
of man you were protecting.

798
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,645
Shoot him,
Detective.

799
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,914
Oswald, listen to me.

800
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,249
You have to put
the gun down.

801
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,487
He killed my mother, Jim.

802
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,089
I know.

803
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,826
Detective Gordon,
I am ordering you

804
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,696
to put that man
down now.

805
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,165
He had her murdered
in front of me.

806
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,302
I held her.

807
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:53,836
Watched her die.

808
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,472
Do you know what
that's like?

809
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,175
It changes a person.
(footsteps approach)

810
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,843
BULLOCK: Sorry about
your mother, Penguin,
(gun cocks)

811
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,413
but I'm gonna need you to put
the shotgun down on the ground,

812
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,248
slowly, now.

813
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,254
One of us is gonna die tonight.

814
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,456
I have made my
peace with that.

815
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,826
I suggest the new mayor
does as well.

816
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,795
Don't make us shoot you.

817
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,731
Shoot me and you have no idea
what his endgame is, Jim.

818
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,400
And you should.

819
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,736
Because it concerns
someone you know,

820
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,871
someone you care about.

821
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,840
(whispering):
Shoot him.

822
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,242
(gun fires)
GORDON: Down!

823
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,222
BULLOCK:
Jim, Oswald!

824
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,473
Penguin smashed the mayor's ride
through the main checkpoint.

825
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:04,741
The good news is--

826
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,476
with the gunshot wound
to the shoulder and the APB,

827
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:07,877
I doubt he'll make it
out of the city.

828
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:11,080
He won't be trying
to make it out.

829
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,349
We lost more
people tonight.

830
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,952
Good people,
including Martinez.

831
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,688
Sometimes the good guys
have a bad night.

832
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,289
This ain't your fault.

833
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,291
I know.

834
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,427
It's his.

835
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,129
(reporters clamor)

836
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:29,198
My ancestors were swordsmiths.

837
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,137
They knew that to good steel,
it had first to be forged.

838
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:38,107
I look at tonight...

839
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:42,712
I look at tonight
as a baptism of fire.

840
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:46,449
A fire from which
we will emerge stronger.

841
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,585
Our resolve forged

842
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,588
to bring about
a new day in Gotham.

843
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,257
(listeners applaud, clamor)

844
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:56,726
(TV clicks off)

845
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:01,464
I've felt pretty alone
since moving here.

846
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,067
Until I met you.

847
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:08,071
But I-I don't want to come
between you and a friend.

848
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,939
You won't.

849
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:13,476
Selina is never going
to like me.

850
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:16,846
I don't care.

851
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,848
I like you.

852
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,832
THEO:
Detective Gordon.

853
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,633
Mr. Mayor.

854
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,901
You catch my speech?

855
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,104
I think I've heard
enough speeches.

856
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,440
I had high hopes for you.

857
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,177
I thought you were prepared
to make the hard choices,

858
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,781
to do whatever it takes
to rid Gotham of its monsters.

859
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,118
I am.

860
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,554
I've just decided...

861
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,023
I'm gonna start with you.

862
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,929
Dangerous words...

863
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:11,801
when addressing the man
who now controls this city.

864
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,273
Desperate times.

865
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,475
They are, indeed.

I want to know why you did this.

868
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:58,548
When Dr. Thompkins walked
in the room, how did it feel?

869
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,082
I was terrified.

870
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,051
She could have
discovered the body.

871
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,853
But she didn't.

872
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,822
You got away with it.

873
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,557
That's not the point.

874
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,726
(echoing):
That is absolutely the point!

875
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:15,832
You can still feel
the rush, can't you?

876
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,835
Coming so close
to getting caught.

877
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:21,571
Knowing what you would
have been forced to do

878
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:24,307
if she had discovered
the body,

879
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:28,311
discovered what
you had done.

880
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:32,582
Standing... standing at
the edge of uncertainty

881
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,851
and peering
into the void.

882
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:38,788
Now tell me,
how did it feel?

883
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,800
Beautiful.
