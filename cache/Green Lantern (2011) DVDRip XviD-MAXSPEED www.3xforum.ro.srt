1
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,197
<i>TOMAR-RE:
Billions of years ago...</i>

2
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:40,032
<i>... a race of immortals harnessed
the most powerful force in existence:</i>

3
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,673
<i>The emerald energy of willpower.</i>

4
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:46,243
<i>These immortals,
the Guardians of the Universe...</i>

5
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,780
<i>... built a world from where they could
watch over all of existence:</i>

6
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,349
<i>The planet Oa.</i>

7
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:57,418
<i>They divided the universe
into 3600 sectors.</i>

8
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,085
<i>A ring powered by the energy of will
was sent to every sector to select a recruit.</i>

9
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:08,632
<i>In order to be chosen by the ring,
it was said one must be without fear.</i>

10
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,763
<i>Together, these 3600 recruits...</i>

11
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,899
<i>... formed the intergalactic peacekeepers
known as the Green Lantern Corps.</i>

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,613
<i>Of all the threats the Corps ever faced...</i>

13
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,953
<i>... the gravest was an entity of fear
known as Parallax.</i>

14
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,692
<i>Only the legendary Green Lantern
Abin Sur...</i>

15
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,196
<i>... was capable of capturing
and imprisoning this beast...</i>

16
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:44,132
<i>... which he did on the lost planet of Ryut.</i>

17
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:08,024
COMMANDER :

18
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,622
You are afraid.

19
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,728
Good.

20
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,854
Sinestro, I'm traveling at maximum velocity.
Tell Fentara I should...

21
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,499
<i>Fentara is dead.</i>

22
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,065
The planet's inhabitants?

23
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,672
<i>Your mission to evacuate them
is no longer necessary.</i>

24
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,299
<i>It's just as it was on Talok.</i>

25
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,712
<i>Every life form destroyed
and their essence absorbed.</i>

26
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,047
<i>Traces of yellow power everywhere.</i>

27
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,546
And the Guardians?

28
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,185
<i>The Guardians are silent.</i>

29
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,386
<i>I've demanded an audience with them.</i>

30
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,530
PARALLAX:
Abin Sur.

31
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,745
ABIN SUR:
I'm badly wounded.

32
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,822
Heading to the nearest inhabited planet
for the selection process.

33
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,757
Tell the Guardians it's Parallax.

34
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,801
No. No.

35
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,482
Sorry, I gotta run.
Make yourself at home, okay?

36
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,417
There's, uh, water in the tap.

37
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,776
HAL:
No!

38
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,608
Yup.

39
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,151
Asshole.

40
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:44,827
MAN: The Ferris Sabre III is state-of-the-art
of artificial-intelligence fighter planes.

41
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,831
It has all of the flying and combat
capability of a human pilot...

42
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,135
...but with none of the human error
that comes with it.

43
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,302
Carl isn't just blowing smoke
to get a contract, general.

44
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,500
Your staff, these contractors, my office...

45
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,077
...we've all been part of this
from the ground up.

46
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,040
Well, I appreciate that, senator.

47
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,308
HAMMOND:
But today the rubber meets the road.

48
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:09,478
We have a simulated combat situation.
Two Sabres against Carl's two best pilots.

49
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,105
Carol. Was gonna do a little flying today.
What do you think?

50
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,503
I think you're late.

51
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,735
Yes, but that's only because I slept in.

52
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,903
I used to sleep in. Then I turned 11.

53
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,975
Let me give you a little heads-up.

54
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,550
I've gone up against these Sabres all week
and they smoked me every time.

55
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,121
There isn't anything you can do that
they can't do better, faster...

56
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,554
...and without disappointing women
everywhere.

57
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,126
I, uh, think we both know that's not true.

58
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,696
This is exactly why I didn't want you
for this. My father did.

59
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,298
I would've gone with Jensen.

60
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,130
I'd have too, but unfortunately
he's busy not being good enough.

61
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,828
At least he shows up.

62
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,496
Hal...

63
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,642
...this test today, it's important.

64
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,642
I'm gonna make you look good up there.
Don't worry, okay?

65
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:10,407
Now let's get these pants off
and fly some planes.

66
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,315
Highball, weapon check now.

67
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,785
Roger that.

68
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,919
TOM: Good morning, Mr. Ferris.
CARL: Morning, everybody.

69
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,653
Gentlemen.

70
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,159
- We about ready, Tom?
- Yes, Mr. Ferris. We are go for test.

71
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,330
Sapphire, cleared weapons hot
at the merge.

72
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,099
Ferris Test, Sapphire. Weapons are hot.

73
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,071
Fly safe, Highball.

74
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,336
HAL:
Um, no.

75
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,989
Goddamn it!
Tom, what the hell you feed those things?

76
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,859
F-35s, what else?

77
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,964
<i>HAL :
Wakey, wakey, Sapphire.</i>

78
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,127
You got a shot,
now would be a great time.

79
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,240
Easy, Highball. Just lining it up.

80
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,352
There's no way
we're taking these out solo.

81
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,788
<i>Get over here.
Let's figure something out.</i>

82
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,294
<i>CAROL :
On my way, Highball.</i>

83
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,969
HAL:
Now stay right there and look real pretty.

84
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,660
Highball, did you just use your wingman
as a decoy?

85
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,787
Highball, those Sabres headed up your 6
can fly anywhere you can.

86
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,855
Then let's go somewhere I can't fly.

87
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,853
What the hell is he up to?

88
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,388
Coffin corner.

89
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,299
Highball, rules of engagement
set ceiling at 50,000 feet.

90
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,735
HAL: Yeah, because the Sabres will stall
if they go any higher, right, Tom?

91
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,101
And so will you.

92
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,447
<i>COMPUTER:
Compressor stall. Compressor stall.</i>

93
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,516
Yes!

94
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,329
Um, I mean, damn it, Hal.

95
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,130
Your boy certainly
takes his job seriously.

96
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,769
<i>TOM :
Ailerons, Hal. Side to side.</i>

97
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,960
I got it.

98
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,432
<i>MARTIN:
Hal.</i>

99
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,382
Keep it warm for me.

100
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,143
TECHNICIAN:
Going through 25,000.

101
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,552
Hey, you okay, Highball?

102
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,353
Yeah, just taking my victory lap.

103
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,699
TECHNICIAN: Going through 20,000.
- Okay, Highball, give me some roll.

104
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,505
Yeah, Dad!

105
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,179
<i>TOM:
Hal, do you read me?</i>

106
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,884
<i>TOM: Highball, you're approaching
minimum ejection altitude.</i>

107
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,733
<i>Highball, you're below 10,000 AGL.
Spin is unrecoverable.</i>

108
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,329
<i>Eject, eject, eject!</i>

109
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,498
You're not scared, are you, Dad?

110
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,507
Let's just say it's my job not to be.

111
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,607
HAL:
Dad!

112
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,518
Dad!

113
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,103
You stupid son of a bitch. You...

114
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,336
CARL:
Stand down, Bob. It doesn't matter now.

115
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,672
It does matter.

116
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,748
Never mind that you crashed
a brand-new F-35.

117
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,818
You broke the rules of engagement.
You sacrificed your wingman.

118
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,581
And you blew the contract
this company was depending on.

119
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,724
I'm sorry. I thought this was a dogfight.

120
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,383
I was under the impression
the objective was to win.

121
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,621
No, the objective was to show
what the Sabres could do in combat.

122
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,766
And in combat,
no pilot is gonna crater his own plane.

123
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,592
I did.

124
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:08,165
Now you know you gotta boost the ceiling.
I showed you what they can't do.

125
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,002
You didn't have to make that point
in front of Air Force Acquisitions.

126
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,404
That's enough, Carol.

127
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:18,114
Since I'm gonna have to lay off most of
my company anyway, you're fired, Hal.

128
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,410
It's too late. I quit.

129
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,212
CAROL:
He's not fired and you don't quit.

130
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,015
You're grounded,
pending the results of an investigation.

131
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,197
Watch your back.

132
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,798
That's impossible, Bob.

133
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,166
- Tell me what happened.
- Controls locked up.

134
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,779
Don't give me that, Hal. You had a
window when you could've recovered.

135
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,471
Did you choke?

136
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,775
You wouldn't be the first,
but I need to know.

137
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,647
My controls locked up.
What the hell is all this, anyway?

138
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,310
What's with the ridiculous suit?

139
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:00,254
- I know your dad's been bucking for you...
- The merits of my career choices...

140
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:04,624
You're a pilot, and a good one.
Giving that up to fly a desk is bullshit.

141
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,128
I like it and I'm good at it.

142
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,995
Doesn't mean I'll never get in a cockpit
again. It isn't one way or the other.

143
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,605
That's the way a child looks at things,
and we aren't children anymore.

144
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,636
At least...

145
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,806
I just don't wanna see
someone I care about getting hurt.

146
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,540
Least of all you.

147
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,886
Choose well.

148
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,250
<i>A test pilot's daring maneuvers
almost ended in tragedy.</i>

149
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,880
<i>Witnesses say pilot Hal Jordan
ejected at the last possible second...</i>

150
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,117
<i>... before his jet crashed
in the open desert.</i>

151
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,227
<i>He's the son of the late Martin Jordan...</i>

152
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,421
<i>... who was killed in his own
ill-fated test flight back in 1993.</i>

153

<i>We are told that Hal Jordan
is doing fine right now...</i>

154
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,168
<i>... though we have yet to hear
an official statement.</i>

155
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,361
Hey, guys.

156
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,100
<i>HEBERT: The incident has been a blow
to a new high-tech aircraft program...</i>

157
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,709
JACK:
Hey. How was work?

158
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,437
Oh. It was amazing, Jack.
Thank you for asking. Hey, Janice.

159
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,741
Just help me out here, because
I'm really trying to understand this.

160
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,782
- Mm-hm.
- Do you wanna be like him so bad?

161
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,216
- You just assume it's my fault.
- I talked to Carl.

162
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,481
- Oh. Heh, heh.
- You pushed the plane past its limits...

163
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,455
That's my job. It was an accident.
Everybody walked away.

164
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:18,027
Like your motorcycle accident
that put you in the hospital for a month?

165
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,993
I miss all this quality family time.
Good talk, Jack.

166
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,533
JACK: God.
JANICE: Jack, come on.

167
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,364
JIM:
You okay?

168
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,597
Where's Jason?

169
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,073
In his room.

170
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,767
Why?

171
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,111
HAL:
Hey, it's Uncle Hal.

172
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,375
What's up there, ace?

173
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,282
This is the worst 11th birthday party
I've ever been to.

174
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,889
No dancing girls?
What's going on...? Hey.

175
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,384
Hey.

176
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,823
I'm fine.

177
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,396
I guess I got a little freaked out
or something.

178
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,430
It happens.

179
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,658
Not to you.

180
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,592
Look...

181
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,463
...you don't have anything
to worry about.

182
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,664
You wanna know why?

183
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,669
Yeah, I may be a total screw-up
in every other part of my life...

184
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:10,872
...but the one thing I do know
how to do is fly.

185
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:17,455
Hey, got you something, birthday boy.
Wrapped it myself.

186
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,826
Cool. It's an X-1, right?

187
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,057
It's a Starfighter. My dad gave me that.

188
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,894
Let's put it up.

189
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,764
What happened today?

190
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,566
I mean, when you crashed.

191
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,675
HAL:
Not really sure, exactly.

192
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,073
Were you scared?

193
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,943
It's my job not to be.

194
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,453
You know, you're totally missing
your super-lame birthday party.

195
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,183
Beat it. Go, go, go!

196
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,622
I'm glad you're okay.

197
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,858
Me too, ace.

198
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,377
Get off! No!

199
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,947
Aah! No!

200
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,550
HAL: Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.
I'm gonna get you some help.

201
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,212
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay. Okay, hold on.

202
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,655
Your name. Your name.

203
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,488
It's Hal. Hal Jordan.

204
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:42,600
Hal Jordan, I am Abin Sur,
protector of Sector 2814.

205
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:43,996
HAL:
Okay, hey, listen.

206
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:49,630
We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
Okay? One that carries purple blood.

207
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,200
ABIN SUR:
The ring...

208
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,901
...it chose you.

209
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,570
Take it!

210
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,983
Place the ring in the lantern.

211
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,712
Place the ring, speak the oath...

212
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,350
- What?
- Great honor, responsibility...

213
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,118
I don't understand.
Breathe. You gotta breathe, okay?

214
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,761
All you gotta do is breathe.
Just breathe, okay?

215
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,397
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
Hey, hey.

216
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,400
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
No, no, no, don't do that.

217
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,361
Hey, now, don't do that.

218
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,242
Oh, come on.

219
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,954
<i>COMPUTER:
X- 97 systems check complete.</i>

220
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,597
Yo.

221
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,191
Come again?

222
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,312
Hmm.

223
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,414
Is that a spaceship?

224
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,154
Yeah.

225
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,790
Is it real?

226
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,157
It's real.

227
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,154
Did you see what kind of power source
this thing uses?

228
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,096
- Do you understand...?
- We can't stay.

229
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,530
- We can't stay here.
- What?

230
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,568
- Gotta go.
- What?

231
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,296
HAL:
Pilot.

232
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,574
He wore a uniform.
I think he was a soldier.

233
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,574
He gave me this.

234
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,270
He proposed?

235
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,084
We're gone. We're gone, now!

236
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,095
They're gonna know someone was there.
Alien pilots don't bury themselves.

237
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,866
I couldn't just leave him there.

238
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,639
I hope this thing isn't radioactive.

239
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,839
- Yeah, well, you're the genius. You... Aah!
- Aah!

240
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,676
HAL: Jesus!
- Aah! Whoa!

241
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,284
Got it!

242
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,986
He said that the ring chose me.

243
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,526
He said it was a great honor.
Responsibility.

244
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,020
Responsibility?

245
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,222
- Yeah.
- You?

246
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,562
Well, maybe on their planet
"responsibility" just means "asshole."

247
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,997
Let's hope so.

248
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,048
A great light has gone out
in the universe.

249
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,648
Abin Sur is dead.

250
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,320
Four of my Lantern brothers killed.

251
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,933
The inhabitants of two worlds
annihilated by an unknown enemy.

252
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,197
An enemy that possesses
the yellow power of fear.

253
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,136
We know it originated from
within the Lost Sector.

254
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:19,715
We know it grows more powerful
with each encounter.

255
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:25,122
According to Abin Sur's last transmission,
he seemed to know what it was.

256
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,188
His only words were, "It's Parallax."

257
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,736
We are aware of the threat.
We are assessing the situation.

258
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:44,567
While you assess,
innocent lives will be lost.

259
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,639
Let me take the fight to this enemy.

260
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,303
There is much of which
you are not aware, Sinestro.

261
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,212
If the danger is as great as we suspect...

262
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,148
What are you saying?

263
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,581
You believe this enemy can defeat us?

264
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:12,000
Guardians, if your faith in our power
has faltered, let me renew it.

265
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,770
Let me take a squadron of my strongest
Lanterns against this enemy...

266
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,900
...and I'll prove to you
our best days are not behind us.

267
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,077
Dr. Hammond?

268
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,687
Dr. Hector Hammond?

269
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,851
We need to ask you to come with us.

270
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,822
Did Adam put you up to this?

271
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,380
Get out of the car, please.

272
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,777
Whoa.

273
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,422
Dr. Hammond?

274
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,023
Dr. Amanda Waller.

275
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,897
I must apologize for the theatrics,
but the government does like its protocols.

276
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,867
Please, follow me.

277
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,022
Is that what I think it is?

278
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,824
An alien life form, doctor.

279
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,431
The first that mankind
has ever encountered...

280
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:00,037
...despite what the conspiracy theorists
would have you believe.

281
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,902
We want you to do the initial assessment
of its physiology.

282
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,940
My God.

283
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,275
Why me?

284
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,906
As a xenobiologist, your skills are
specifically suited to the task.

285
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,143
Beyond that...

286
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,083
...I'm not at liberty to tell you.

287
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,116
Hello.

288
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:57,725
The eyes, nose, ears and mouth
are humanoid.

289
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:02,162
In the left anterior thoracic region
is a 10-centimeter wound...

290
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,962
...with jagged edges containing attached
cyanotic-colored coagulum.

291
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,863
Okay, all right.

292
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,701
Place the ring, then speak the oath.

293
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,902
The oath.

294
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,410
Because everybody knows the oath.

295
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,250
Used to sing it in camp.

296
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,918
I, Hal Jordan...

297
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,688
...do solemnly swear...

298
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,728
...to pledge allegiance...

299
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,663
...to a lantern...

300
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,667
...that I got from a dying purple alien...

301
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,828
...in a swamp.

302
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,905
HECTOR:
The epidermis is magenta.

303
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,975
It appears transparent
and is extremely thin...

304
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:51,377
...allowing visualization of muscles
and individual muscle fibers.

305
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,547
"To infinity and beyond."

306
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,412
"By the power of Grayskull."

307
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,080
What the hell?!

308
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,955
If you can fly me 100 miles in the middle
of nowhere, you'd think that you...

309
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,096
No!

310
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:22,042
In brightest day, in blackest night...

311
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,349
...no evil shall escape my sight.

312
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,985
Let those who worship evil's might...

313
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,951
...beware my power:

314
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,156
Green Lantern's light.

315
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,180
Carol.

316
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,413
- Everything okay in there?
- It's fine.

317
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,245
Well, can I come in?

318
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,514
No.

319
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,250
Yeah, no, because we're...
Uh, do you wanna get a drink?

320
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,455
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

321
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,263
We can talk and drink.

322
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,242
HECTOR: My initial analysis.
- Thank you, doctor.

323
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:31,974
I don't need to tell you that the mere fact
that it's humanoid is extraordinary.

324
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:37,144
It's indicating a convergent evolution,
or perhaps a common ancestry...

325
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,689
...and the implications of that
are staggering.

326
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,452
I mean, where did it come from?

327
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,859
This could completely change the way
that the world views itself.

328
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,125
You imagine the way that the public
will react to this?

329
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,962
Um, but I know that
that won't happen. I do.

330
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,130
Like yourself, doctor,
I'm a seeker of truth.

331
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,833
But the people who pay for facilities
like this...

332
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,740
...have other priorities
and the power to enforce them.

333
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,745
So I keep it a secret.

334
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,578
People like us have to work
within the system, doctor.

335
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,346
We do the best we can.

336
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,752
Right.

337
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,122
WOMAN:
Pick that up.

338
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,425
I, um...

339
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,496
I'm really sorry.

340
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,294
Did you just apologize?

341
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,170
You haven't been replaced by an alien
or something?

342
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,002
No.

343
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,669
I'm good.

344
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,404
Ah. I'm good.

345
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,444
I'm good, totally good. Uh...

346
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,085
Do you think I'm irresponsible?

347
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,386
No need to answer. That's fine.

348
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,821
Hal. Ha, ha.

349
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,233
You look pretty.

350
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,971
And we haven't been in this place
together since...

351
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,072
...that night.

352
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,811
- You forgot it was my birthday.
HAL: Did I?

353
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,282
Mm.

354
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:19,116
That was also the night...
The first time that we ever...

355
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,252
...flew together.

356
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:28,227
You've been flying ever since
with anyone who'd get in the plane.

357
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,831
Oh, yeah.

358
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,674
- Oh, no.
HAL: Come on.

359
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,310
- No, yeah, let's go.
CAROL: Mm-mm.

360
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,003
HAL: Dance with me.
- No.

361
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,712
No.

362
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,585
No.

363
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,657
Hal. No.

364
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,285
No.

365
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,666
I really am sorry.

366
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,739
Oh. It's okay.
The contract isn't quite dead yet.

367
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,306
I told you I was good at this.

368
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,001
I wasn't talking about the contract.

369
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:21,615
I would've screwed this up. You know?

370
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,819
Even if I didn't go to the Air Force...

371
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,155
...I would've found some way to...

372
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,958
- You and me, I would've blown it.
- Yeah, is that what you tell yourself?

373
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,325
Mm. What do you tell yourself?

374
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,665
That you were scared
I was getting too close.

375
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,802
You know what I spent
my afternoon doing?

376
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,445
What?

377
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,770
Worrying about you.

378
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:57,184
I went over every inch of the flight data.
There was nothing wrong with the plane.

379
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,855
- What happened up there?
HAL: Thanks for the dance.

380
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,415
BOB:
I told you to watch your back.

381
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,882
You cost us all our jobs,
you son of a bitch.

382
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,802
Pathetic.

383
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,774
Bastard's been living off his old man's
reputation his whole life.

384
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,323
Hey.

385
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,716
Hey!

386
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,895
My face is just getting warmed up.

387
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,161
Whoa.

388
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,146
Have you concluded admiring yourself?

389
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,805
Uh...

390
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,143
Yeah.

391
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,118
Well, your ring translator
is functioning properly.

392
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,485
Your mask will appear when protection
of your identity is required.

393
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,353
There is no need for it on Oa.

394
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,421
A talking fish.

395
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,257
Actually, my race is Xudarian.

396
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,923
Our DNA does somewhat resemble
your own ichthyological species.

397
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:48,329
I am Tomar-Re, protector of Sector 2813
and home to...

398
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:53,000
80,012 galaxies,
2.34 million sentient species.

399
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:54,970
How do I know that?

400
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,772
The induction process.

401
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:01,384
It activates the ring's higher functions,
including a working knowledge base.

402
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,780
In truth, we were curious.

403
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:07,447
The process had never been attempted on
a species as young as humans before.

404
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,588
As you are the first to be chosen,
I've been sent to welcome you here.

405
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,334
And here is?

406
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,369
TOMAR-RE:
Welcome to Oa.

407
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,273
This planet has been our home
for countless millennia.

408
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,475
It was created for us by the Guardians.

409
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,314
Guardians?

410
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,251
There stands their Citadel.

411
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,053
They are immortals,
among the most ancient of races.

412
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:47,459
They made all you see
and are responsible for all we are and do.

413
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,632
Since time immemorial,
the Green Lantern Corps...

414
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:55,636
...has served as the keepers of peace,
order and justice throughout the universe.

415
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,907
To be chosen to join its ranks
is the highest of honors...

416
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,409
...and the greatest of responsibilities.

417
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,071
Yeah. Yeah, that part I heard about.

418
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,080
We're going to fly now.

419
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,447
- Fly?
- Absolutely.

420
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,251
All right.

421
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,984
I can do that.

422
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,466
Join me.

423
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,000
I can do that.

424
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,777
Yeah!

425
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,851
Whoa!

426
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,087
Whoa!

427
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,619
What is that?

428
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,689
TOMAR-RE: It's the energy
that's generated from the Central Battery.

429
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,350
Its power comes from the will
of every living creature in the universe.

430
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:29,732
It, in turn, charges your lantern,
which, in turn, charges your ring.

431
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,336
Even your suit is comprised
entirely of energy.

432
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,068
What's with all the green?

433
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,706
Green is the color of will.

434
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,432
The Guardians harnessed will...

435
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,874
...because it's the strongest
source of energy in the universe.

436
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,778
HAL:
There's so many.

437
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,546
TOMAR-RE: The stars you can see from
your home planet on the clearest night...

438
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,781
...your sector is a thousand times larger.

439
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:00,062
And 3600 Lanterns,
each with a sector just as vast.

440
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,421
Lanterns, I've called you here
to this unprecedented gathering...

441
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,890
...because we face
an unprecedented danger.

442
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:36,898
Our four Lantern brothers
were killed by an enemy called Parallax.

443
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,504
An enemy we don't yet fully understand.

444
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:46,603
We do know it's powerful enough
to destroy entire civilizations.

445
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:51,937
Powerful enough
to defeat even Abin Sur...

446
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,543
...our finest warrior...

447
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,113
...whose light can never be replaced.

448
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,928
SINESTRO: The Guardians have charged me
to lead a squadron of Lanterns...

449
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,826
...in an assault on Parallax.

450
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:12,730
We will seek out and find this enemy.

451
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,368
And we will destroy it.

452
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,840
Alone, we are now vulnerable.

453
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,603
United, we are still invincible.

454
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,180
We have never been defeated.

455
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,483
Will we be defeated now?

456
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,813
ALL:
No!

457
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:36,317
SINESTRO: It was for this moment
that we were created.

458
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,621
But I don't need to tell you your duty.

459
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,789
I don't need to tell you who we are.

460
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:50,203
<i>LANTERNS :
We are the Corps! We are the Corps!</i>

461
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:55,510
<i>We are the Corps! We are the Corps!</i>

462
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,741
TOMAR-RE:
Your will turns thought into reality.

463
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,915
To master the ring,
you must learn to focus your will...

464
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:09,115
...and create what you see in your mind.

465
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,989
The ring's limits
are only what you can imagine.

466
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,668
Do that again.

467
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,101
Now you try.

468
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,502
Concentrate.

469
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:46,090
The ring will inform you
where there is an imminent threat.

470
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,366
TOMAR-RE:
This particular threat's name is Kilowog.

471
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,027
He'll be your combat training officer.

472
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,933
<i>HAL: Whoa!
- Never let your guard down, poozer.</i>

473
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,971
Welcome to Ring Slinging 101.

474
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,703
Or as I like to call it:

475
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,748
The worst day of your worthless life.

476
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,255
The human. Ain't never seen one before.

477
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,792
- You smell funny.
- Ugh.

478
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:18,351
I smell funny?

479
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:22,294
Yeah, I heard about humans.
Think you're the center of the universe.

480
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:26,093
You want to be a Lantern?
You gotta commit to the Corps.

481
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,240
<i>All right, poozer.
Let's see what you've got.</i>

482
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,979
Your constructs are only gonna be
as strong as your will.

483
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:49,682
And your will is pathetic.

484
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,726
I'm gonna work you
and I'm gonna hit you...

485
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,336
...until your will is strong enough
to be worthy of the Corps.

486
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,715
KILOWOG:
Next lesson.

487
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,848
Ha, ha. Feel that?

488
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,651
It's the gravitational pull
of your average sun.

489
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:26,284
Makes flying through space
very dangerous.

490
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,626
The bigger you are,
the quicker you burn.

491
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,194
Gravity's a bitch.

492
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,169
Here, let me help you.

493
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:46,747
Remember, your enemy,
he's not gonna play fair.

494
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:56,192
Well, that's good advice.
Thanks, gorgeous.

495
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,827
SINESTRO:
So...

496
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,160
...this is the human.

497
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,400
When I learned Abin Sur's ring
had chosen you...

498
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,092
...I said there had to be a mistake.

499
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,207
I see nothing to change my mind.

500
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,537
I'll take it from here, Kilowog.

501
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,907
The Corps is only as strong
as its weakest link.

502
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,176
And I will tolerate no weak links.

503
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,050
You understand me?

504
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,550
Are you afraid, human?

505
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,521
Are you afraid?

506
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,719
Don't.

507
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,560
Don't do that.

508
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,301
Shall we?

509
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,439
Sure.

510
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,206
A sword?

511
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,210
How human.

512
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,851
I do believe I smell fear.

513
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,000
I'm a Green Lantern.

514
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,061
I fear nothing.

515
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,233
Fear is the enemy of will.

516
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,240
Will is what makes you take action.

517
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:28,410
Fear is what stops you
and makes you weak.

518
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,248
Makes your constructs feeble.

519
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,596
You must ignore your fear.
When you're afraid, you can't act.

520
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,300
When you can't act, you can't defend.
If you can't defend, you die.

521
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,372
You reek of fear, Hal Jordan.

522
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,612
Abin Sur was a great warrior.

523
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,849
My mentor.

524
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,747
My friend.

525
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:11,420
You insult his memory
by wearing his ring.

526
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,841
I'm done. He's right. I'm only human.
We're not ready to defend the universe.

527
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:36,076
A few days ago, we thought we were
the only ones in the universe.

528
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:39,916
The ring chose you. It wouldn't have
if it hadn't seen something in you.

529
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,114
Oh, yeah?

530
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,486
Something you yourself don't yet see.

531
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,594
The ring never makes a mistake.

532
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,254
This time it did.

533
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,745
HECTOR:
- That until recently, we didn't realize...

534
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:43,784
...that many of these little critters that we've
been calling bacteria weren't bacteria at all.

535
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:48,823
They were an entirely different type
of primitive prokaryotic cell.

536
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:52,928
These little buggers, called archaeans,
are still poorly understood.

537
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:56,859
Um...

538
00:53:57,033 --> 00:54:00,059
But might turn out to be
different from bacteria...

539
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:07,604
But might turn out to be as different
from bacteria as bacteria is from us.

540
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:08,971
Some call them extremophiles...

541
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,938
...because they live in the most extreme
environments on Earth, such as...

542
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,244
<i>MICHAEL :
God, he's so boring.</i>

543
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,080
...the boiling waters of a geyser.

544
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,688
<i>MICHAEL :
What a loser.</i>

545
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,453
- Michael!
- Huh?

546
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,450
What did you say?

547
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,522
I didn't say anything.

548
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,258
Did you just call me a loser?

549
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,527
<i>MICHAEL :
What kind of freak is this guy?</i>

550
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,295
"Freak"?!

551
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,551
Class dismissed.

552
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,766
So how you been?

553
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,933
Been a while.

554
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,233
So you had a rough night last night.
Did you get her name, huh?

555
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,803
You need to get some sleep, son.

556
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,341
- Have a seat.
- What can I do for you, Dad?

557
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,952
Well, actually, you've already done it.

558
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,284
For me and for your country.

559
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,280
What are you talking about?

560
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:07,624
I'm talking about you impressing
a whole lot of very important people.

561
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,560
Where did you get that?

562
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:15,262
I'm on a subcommittee
overseeing the agencies involved.

563
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:20,432
- Top-secret, of course.
- It was you. That's why they chose me.

564
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:24,713
Because of this, we're gonna be able
to get you a top post on the inside now...

565
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,542
...helping to oversee the operation.

566
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:31,312
There are scientists
that worked their whole lives for this.

567
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,456
- Mm-hm.
- People more qualified.

568
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:34,920
And less connected.

569
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:38,720
Don't be naive, son.
It's the way the world works.

570
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:42,395
You have to seize an opportunity
when it presents itself.

571
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,932
<i>HAMMOND :
He'll never get it.</i>

572
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,161
<i>Just wasting his life away.</i>

573
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,006
<i>What an embarrassment.</i>

574
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,142
Bill! Ha. How are you?

575
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:57,973
I'm terrific.

576
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:02,084
No, no, no. Just finishing up a meeting.
Got plenty of time.

577
00:58:01,407 --> 00:58:05,639
<i>SINESTRO: With my own eyes I saw this
creature induce fear in our finest warriors...</i>

578
00:58:05,811 --> 00:58:07,938
...and then feed on that fear.

579
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:10,147
There's more.

580
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:14,308
We've tracked its trajectory.
Parallax is headed for Oa.

581
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,152
Never before has an enemy
dared attack us here.

582
00:58:17,322 --> 00:58:19,586
You must tell me what you know.

583
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:24,495
FIRST GUARDIAN:
Will has always been our sole weapon...

584
00:58:24,663 --> 00:58:27,359
...against the forces of darkness
in the universe.

585
00:58:27,866 --> 00:58:31,427
But as that power began to seem
insufficient...

586
00:58:31,603 --> 00:58:34,071
...a great debate arose among us.

587
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:36,673
Should we exploit
another source of power...

588
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:41,002
...one we had long since sworn
should never be used?

589
00:58:41,613 --> 00:58:43,103
Fear.

590
00:58:43,282 --> 00:58:46,911
But the power of fear
was too unpredictable.

591
00:58:47,086 --> 00:58:49,748
The chance of corruption too great.

592
00:58:49,922 --> 00:58:52,356
And so we decided against it.

593
00:58:52,524 --> 00:58:56,517
<i>All of us, that is, except one.</i>

594
00:58:57,229 --> 00:59:00,995
<i>Alone, this Guardian
entered the forbidden chamber.</i>

595
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:05,310
<i>He wanted to prove the light of fear
could be mastered.</i>

596
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:08,322
<i>His intentions were pure...</i>

597
00:59:08,492 --> 00:59:11,552
<i>... but his hopes were naive.</i>

598
00:59:12,396 --> 00:59:15,263
<i>Consumed by the yellow power of fear...</i>

599
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:19,995
<i>... the Guardian became the very evil
he had wished to destroy.</i>

600
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:22,230
<i>He became Parallax.</i>

601
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:32,747
For the universe's safety and his own...

602
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:37,149
...Abin Sur was charged with
imprisoning Parallax in the Lost Sector.

603
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,722
But he escaped.

604
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:42,827
Feeding on the fear of others,
he grew larger, more powerful.

605
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:44,189
And is now headed here...

606
00:59:44,363 --> 00:59:47,662
...to take his revenge on you
and destroy the Corps.

607
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,701
Then we have no choice.

608
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:01,109
We must prepare to harness the power
of our enemy and fight fear with fear.

609
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:04,444
To protect our sectors,
we must be able to defend ourselves.

610
01:00:05,651 --> 01:00:08,415
We must forge a yellow ring.

611
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,221
CREWMAN:
Watch your step.

612
01:00:18,398 --> 01:00:20,025
MAN: Senator.
WOMAN: Senator.

613
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,135
<i>Don't have to worry about me no more</i>

614
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:26,500
<i>I'm gone</i>

615
01:00:27,273 --> 01:00:31,300
<i>I'm gone, I'm gone</i>

616
01:00:33,848 --> 01:00:34,906
TOM:
Hello.

617
01:00:35,082 --> 01:00:36,310
Hi.

618
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,849
<i>SINGER :
Everybody get on your feet</i>

619
01:00:45,092 --> 01:00:47,322
<i>You make me nervous
When you're in your seat</i>

620
01:00:48,497 --> 01:00:49,987
Rough night, huh?

621
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,662
Hector.

622
01:00:53,735 --> 01:00:55,600
How you doing?
What have you been up to?

623
01:00:55,771 --> 01:00:58,365
- Same old, same old.
- Yeah. Me too.

624
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:03,408
Hal Jordan. Worst pilot I've ever seen.
Or the best. Not quite sure.

625
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:04,737
I've been called both.

626
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:08,404
- Glad you could make it, son.
- I was a little surprised I got the invite.

627
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:09,744
No, you're family, Hal.

628
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:12,649
There are thinkers in this world
and there are doers.

629
01:01:12,822 --> 01:01:14,585
And you are one of the doers.

630
01:01:16,391 --> 01:01:18,882
Yeah, but the thinkers
make what I do possible.

631
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:21,427
Wouldn't have a plane
unless someone thought it up.

632
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:22,995
Of course.

633
01:01:23,198 --> 01:01:25,132
Excuse me, I need a drink.

634
01:01:26,803 --> 01:01:29,636
- I gotta get back to work. This is work.
- Yes, sir.

635
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:32,469
- Nice to see you, son.
HAL: You too. You too.

636
01:01:39,082 --> 01:01:40,913
Nice.

637
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:45,686
Yeah, my dad used to train in it.

638
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,387
I was talking about your dress.

639
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,592
Nice jacket.

640
01:01:53,764 --> 01:01:55,925
Last time I checked,
you didn't even own one.

641
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,796
Yeah, I've been shaking up
the wardrobe lately.

642
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:02,496
Congratulations on the contract.
How'd you manage to pull that off?

643
01:02:02,673 --> 01:02:06,006
I pointed out you only won because you
broke the rules of engagement.

644
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:09,339
And Tom figured out
how to give the Sabres more altitude.

645
01:02:09,513 --> 01:02:12,778
So I guess in a way,
without even meaning to...

646
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:14,645
...you actually did us a favor.

647
01:02:16,454 --> 01:02:17,853
Look...

648
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:21,049
...I'm uncomfortable
with the word "hero."

649
01:02:21,226 --> 01:02:22,818
<i>SINGER :
Hey</i>

650
01:02:29,734 --> 01:02:32,032
CARL:
Thank you. Thank you all for joining us.

651
01:02:32,203 --> 01:02:33,363
Great evening.

652
01:02:38,477 --> 01:02:40,843
My daughter, Carol Ferris.

653
01:02:41,013 --> 01:02:42,037
Come on!

654
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,587
Congratulations, Carol.

655
01:02:53,759 --> 01:02:55,818
I take one look at you, young lady...

656
01:02:55,995 --> 01:02:58,395
...or at Hal Jordan over there,
spitting image of his dad...

657
01:02:58,564 --> 01:03:00,532
MAN 1: Whoo!
- You give us hope.

658
01:03:00,966 --> 01:03:02,729
A toast to our future.

659
01:03:02,902 --> 01:03:04,699
MAN 2: Hear, hear!
MAN 3: To the future!

660
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:05,963
HAMMOND:
We're in good hands.

661
01:03:22,455 --> 01:03:25,253
Hector! Oh, my God! Hey!

662
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:33,056
- Congratulations. Um...
CAROL: Thank you.

663
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:36,829
Here's to you and Hal, the future.

664
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:40,870
Yeah, heh, I'm sorry.

665
01:03:41,308 --> 01:03:45,005
I know it couldn't have been easy
growing up with your dad.

666
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,172
But, hey, you're doing great, so... Ha, ha.

667
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:50,113
I am. I'm doing great. Ha, ha.

668
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,947
- He's right, though. I'm not a doer.
CAROL: Ha, ha.

669
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,783
Although I did get to examine
an alien body recently.

670
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,481
That was very cool.

671
01:03:57,658 --> 01:04:01,219
I can't tell anyone about it,
but, hey, you can't have everything.

672
01:04:01,395 --> 01:04:03,659
Hector telling you another
of his science-fiction stories?

673
01:04:03,832 --> 01:04:05,823
<i>HAMMOND :
What the hell's wrong with him?</i>

674
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:07,764
<i>Can't keep his mouth shut.</i>

675
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:10,771
You really do have
a creative imagination.

676
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,271
Bye.

677
01:04:12,574 --> 01:04:13,598
ASSISTANT:
Senator.

678
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:16,804
I apologize. We really must go.

679
01:04:17,779 --> 01:04:19,872
- Good night, Carol.
- Good night.

680
01:04:23,586 --> 01:04:24,610
MAN 4:
Senator!

681
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:26,354
Hey.

682
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,282
MAN 5:
Thanks for everything.

683
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:40,598
WOMAN 1:
Bye, senator!

684
01:05:06,463 --> 01:05:09,864
Get the crash crew here.
Our helicopter's going down.

685
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:21,272
Oh, my God.

686
01:06:29,384 --> 01:06:31,852
WOMAN 2:
What is that? What is that?

687
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,332
<i>What happened tonight took place
in just a matter of seconds...</i>

688
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:01,206
<i>... but people will be talking about it
for years to come.</i>

689
01:08:01,379 --> 01:08:05,281
<i>A helicopter careening out of control,
headed toward certain tragedy...</i>

690
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:09,613
<i>... when all of a sudden, a mystery man,
a hero, saves the day...</i>

691
01:08:09,787 --> 01:08:13,382
<i>... incredibly diverting the helicopter
from destroying innocent people...</i>

692
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:17,891
<i>... and miraculously rescuing Carol Ferris.</i>

693
01:08:18,331 --> 01:08:23,530
<i>The real question tonight is who is this
amazing hero and where is he now?</i>

694
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,939
Start talking.

695
01:08:37,116 --> 01:08:38,583
- A racetrack?
- Yeah.

696
01:08:38,751 --> 01:08:40,150
TOM:
Hmm.

697
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,755
That's the best you could come up with
for your first big appearance? Racetrack.

698
01:08:43,923 --> 01:08:46,084
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I disappoint you?

699
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:50,855
I materialized a track out of pure energy,
saving hundreds, and you're disappointed.

700
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,156
I'm sorry about that.

701
01:08:52,331 --> 01:08:54,026
No, I wanna see this stuff. Show me.

702
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:55,759
I don't think that's a good idea.

703
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,459
Come on, I wanna see this stuff.

704
01:08:57,637 --> 01:09:00,265
I wanna see the outfit, the flying...
You gotta show me.

705
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:02,304
Hal, being your best friend's no picnic.

706
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:04,706
- It's for emergencies!
- You owe me!

707
01:09:05,512 --> 01:09:08,174
Hal, I wanna see it.

708
01:09:09,383 --> 01:09:10,407
Fine.

709
01:09:11,752 --> 01:09:13,219
Hold on to your glasses.

710
01:09:15,956 --> 01:09:17,184
HAL:
All right.

711
01:09:17,357 --> 01:09:18,847
Question:

712
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,690
- You ready to have your mind blown?
- Yeah.

713
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:24,825
Ring.

714
01:09:24,999 --> 01:09:26,557
Finger.

715
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:38,238
Here we go.

716
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,017
- Did you break it already?
- I didn't break it, okay? It's just...

717
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,920
It's out of juice. I have to recharge it.

718
01:10:02,204 --> 01:10:04,035
Now pay attention.

719
01:10:07,308 --> 01:10:09,003
Aah! Green!

720
01:10:11,648 --> 01:10:14,139
- Wow.
- I know, right?!

721
01:10:16,987 --> 01:10:18,511
Whoo!

722
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:22,785
Not bad, huh?

723
01:10:22,959 --> 01:10:25,120
You're a superhero.

724
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,337
Don't they always get the girl?

725
01:11:04,335 --> 01:11:05,962
Evening, ma'am.

726
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,265
Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

727
01:11:09,908 --> 01:11:11,603
Are you okay?

728
01:11:11,777 --> 01:11:15,235
Uh, yeah, no,
I'm glad to have a chance to thank you.

729
01:11:15,414 --> 01:11:18,144
Just doing my job.
No thanks necessary, miss.

730
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:20,414
No, it is.

731
01:11:21,153 --> 01:11:23,018
You saved my life.

732
01:11:23,422 --> 01:11:26,550
You saved all of our lives.
That was a very...

733
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:34,993
Hal?

734
01:11:35,435 --> 01:11:36,561
Miss?

735
01:11:36,735 --> 01:11:38,168
Hal?!

736
01:11:38,937 --> 01:11:41,599
Oh, my Go... Oh, my God!

737
01:11:41,808 --> 01:11:44,436
- Oh, my God! Hal!
- How did you know it was me?

738
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:47,340
What? I've known you my whole life!
I've seen you naked!

739
01:11:47,514 --> 01:11:50,449
You don't think I would recognize you
because I can't see your cheekbones?!

740
01:11:50,617 --> 01:11:54,348
What is this?! Why is your skin green?
Why are you glowing?

741
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,215
What the hell is with that mask?!

742
01:11:56,823 --> 01:11:57,949
It came with the outfit.

743
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:01,555
Cool, huh?

744
01:12:02,896 --> 01:12:06,127
CAROL: So it all works
because of this magic ring? Ha, ha.

745
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,962
HAL:
No, there's no such thing as magic.

746
01:12:09,137 --> 01:12:11,731
Intergalactic green peacekeepers,
thousands of them.

747
01:12:11,905 --> 01:12:14,203
CAROL: Ha, ha.
- But, no.

748
01:12:14,475 --> 01:12:15,567
I'm not making it up.

749
01:12:18,112 --> 01:12:20,580
CAROL: I mean, when we were kids,
who'd have thought?

750
01:12:21,215 --> 01:12:24,707
- I did, actually. I called this early on.
- Ha-ha-ha.

751
01:12:24,886 --> 01:12:28,913
I said, "One day I'll be a green space cop."
Here I am.

752
01:12:30,725 --> 01:12:34,161
Okay, so at the party, how did you
make that big green ramp thing?

753
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:38,229
Anything I see in my mind, I can create.
I just have to focus.

754
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:39,958
Anything?

755
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:42,231
Anything.

756
01:12:57,453 --> 01:13:00,581
Happy birthday. Better late than never.

757
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:02,849
Um...

758
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:05,520
Okay, so how does it work?

759
01:13:05,694 --> 01:13:10,961
They just, um, call you on your cell,
"Cat in a tree, downtown Milky Way"?

760
01:13:11,134 --> 01:13:14,194
No. I don't think it works
exactly like that.

761
01:13:14,371 --> 01:13:16,931
Well, technically speaking, um...

762
01:13:17,174 --> 01:13:19,335
...I actually sort of, uh...

763
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:21,638
...quit.

764
01:13:21,812 --> 01:13:23,040
What do you mean? How?

765
01:13:23,212 --> 01:13:26,704
Well, I mean, it's a lot like quitting
anything else, really.

766
01:13:27,317 --> 01:13:28,545
I don't understand.

767
01:13:28,718 --> 01:13:30,982
How do you walk away
from something like that?

768
01:13:31,154 --> 01:13:32,348
Is that even possible?

769
01:13:32,523 --> 01:13:35,981
Oh, I think we both know
I'm pretty good at walking away.

770
01:13:40,931 --> 01:13:44,389
If for once you didn't quit something
you cared about...

771
01:13:44,569 --> 01:13:46,799
...what's the worst that could happen?

772
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,419
Well, thank you.
This has been really something.

773
01:14:06,592 --> 01:14:09,959
- I know I've made a lot of mistakes...
- Look, Hal, I'm not mad at you.

774
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,058
I feel bad for you, really.

775
01:14:13,398 --> 01:14:16,231
You've been given so much so often.

776
01:14:17,101 --> 01:14:18,568
And you just...

777
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:24,536
Good night.

778
01:15:17,031 --> 01:15:18,055
WALLER:
Dr. Hammond?

779
01:15:20,401 --> 01:15:23,268
There is something I'd like to show you.

780
01:15:23,438 --> 01:15:26,874
Something I'm fairly certain
you'll want to see.

781
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:36,447
<i>SON:
See you later, Mom.</i>

782
01:15:36,618 --> 01:15:38,279
<i>DAUGHTER: I love you.
JOSEPH: Bye, baby.</i>

783
01:15:40,055 --> 01:15:41,920
<i>WALLER:
No!</i>

784
01:15:44,993 --> 01:15:49,362
Physical contact
accesses mnemonic data.

785
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:52,763
I can see your memories.

786
01:16:29,172 --> 01:16:30,196
Dad.

787
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:34,207
Son, this is my fault.

788
01:16:35,046 --> 01:16:36,809
But I'm gonna fix it.

789
01:16:37,714 --> 01:16:41,172
We're gonna get you well again.
Whatever it takes.

790
01:16:42,987 --> 01:16:45,751
I don't know what you're talking about.

791
01:16:45,923 --> 01:16:48,323
We detected traces
of a second alien life form...

792
01:16:48,493 --> 01:16:50,586
...buried within the body of the first.

793
01:16:50,762 --> 01:16:53,094
You've been exposed.

794
01:16:53,431 --> 01:16:58,368
I've never felt better in my life.

795
01:16:59,138 --> 01:17:01,504
We know everything, son.

796
01:17:02,241 --> 01:17:04,607
I've never felt better in my life.

It's gonna be all right.

801
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:03,402
They just need to run some tests,
that's all.

802
01:18:08,742 --> 01:18:10,232
Keep him under.

803
01:18:13,514 --> 01:18:15,607
I only want what's best for you.

804
01:18:34,369 --> 01:18:35,597
Run.

805
01:19:10,673 --> 01:19:12,504
- Hector.
HECTOR: Shh, shh.

806
01:19:12,676 --> 01:19:14,200
Don't worry.

807
01:19:16,047 --> 01:19:18,038
I only want what's best for you.

808
01:20:40,233 --> 01:20:42,724
The ring, it chose you.

809
01:20:42,903 --> 01:20:44,427
Take it!

810
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:47,570
HECTOR:
Hal.

811
01:20:48,441 --> 01:20:50,238
Hi.

812
01:20:53,147 --> 01:20:55,980
The alien was one of you.

813
01:20:57,952 --> 01:21:00,512
How did we end up so different?

814
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:02,417
Hmm? Hmm?

815
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,217
Sit down!

816
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:07,756
Now...

817
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:11,193
...how's Carol?

818
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:14,802
- That came out wrong.
- Please.

819
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,835
HAL: I've made mistakes...
- Look, Hal...

820
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:19,473
I feel bad for you, really. Good night.

821
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:29,579
You're just as much of a failure
as I was.

822
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:32,514
And just as afraid.

823
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:36,156
Well...

824
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:39,123
...I used to fight my fear.

825
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:47,028
But now that I've tasted its true power...

826
01:21:50,641 --> 01:21:52,700
...I'll never go back.

827
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:03,185
HAL:
No!

828
01:22:22,873 --> 01:22:26,502
You wear the ring of the Lantern
that imprisoned me.

829
01:22:27,412 --> 01:22:29,880
<i>You will suffer the same fate.</i>

830
01:22:30,048 --> 01:22:33,381
Once I have devoured your world...

831
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,882
<i>... I will have all the strength I need...</i>

832
01:22:36,054 --> 01:22:39,922
...to defeat the Corps
and destroy the Guardians.

833
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:13,622
TOM:
Let me get this straight.

834
01:23:13,793 --> 01:23:17,194
This thing that's out there attacking planets
is connected to Hector?

835
01:23:17,363 --> 01:23:19,923
Somehow it infected him
after it killed Abin Sur.

836
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:24,331
- Well, you're just gonna have to stop it.
- Oh, I'm just gonna have to stop it, huh?

837
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:26,165
Well, I tried that and I failed.

838
01:23:26,339 --> 01:23:29,638
And the senator died.
I told you, the ring made a mistake.

839
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:32,472
Wait, go back.
How did the ring make a mistake?

840
01:23:32,646 --> 01:23:37,606
The one thing that a Green Lantern
is supposed to be is fearless.

841
01:23:38,151 --> 01:23:41,279
Fearless is the job description.

842
01:23:41,922 --> 01:23:42,946
That isn't me.

843
01:23:43,122 --> 01:23:45,488
So you're just gonna walk away again?

844
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:49,596
Explain this to me, Hal.
Please explain to me just once, why.

845
01:23:49,764 --> 01:23:51,527
Because I'm afraid!

846
01:24:08,317 --> 01:24:10,376
You don't think your dad ever felt afraid?

847
01:24:11,653 --> 01:24:13,484
If he did,
he figured out some way to beat it.

848
01:24:13,655 --> 01:24:16,385
Yeah, well, there's a word for that:

849
01:24:16,692 --> 01:24:18,250
Courage.

850
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:28,864
They said that the ring wouldn't have
chosen me if it didn't see something.

851
01:24:29,906 --> 01:24:33,171
Something I don't see. Yet.

852
01:24:36,912 --> 01:24:38,277
I see it.

853
01:24:39,615 --> 01:24:41,583
I always have.

854
01:24:42,484 --> 01:24:44,918
The ring didn't see
that you were fearless.

855
01:24:45,088 --> 01:24:48,387
It saw that you had the ability to
overcome fear.

856
01:24:49,158 --> 01:24:51,558
It saw that you're courageous.

857
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:56,062
Which you are.

858
01:24:56,933 --> 01:24:58,230
Just like your dad.

SINESTRO:
Our new weapon is ready.

862
01:25:49,621 --> 01:25:51,316
Once I've mastered its power...

863
01:25:51,957 --> 01:25:54,619
...I'll begin training the Corps
to do the same.

864
01:25:55,994 --> 01:25:58,121
Though Earth will be lost...

865
01:25:58,563 --> 01:26:02,624
...we'll be ready to make a stand against
Parallax before it reaches Oa.

866
01:26:02,803 --> 01:26:04,395
Then the power of the enemy
will be ours.

867
01:26:04,571 --> 01:26:06,402
HAL:
At what cost?

868
01:26:09,175 --> 01:26:11,837
SINESTRO: You dare enter this chamber?
- I need your help.

869
01:26:13,446 --> 01:26:15,641
You gotta help me save my world.

870
01:26:23,490 --> 01:26:28,689
I know that humans aren't the strongest
species, or the smartest.

871
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:32,190
We're young, we have a lot to learn.

872
01:26:32,899 --> 01:26:34,196
But we're worth saving.

873
01:26:42,909 --> 01:26:45,207
This new weapon of yours,
you can't use it.

874
01:26:45,413 --> 01:26:50,077
Once you cross that line, once you've given
in to fear, you'll never go back. I've seen it.

875
01:26:51,319 --> 01:26:54,152
Look, I know right now you're afraid.

876
01:26:54,322 --> 01:26:56,654
You dare accuse the Guardians
of feeling fear?

877
01:26:56,824 --> 01:26:58,121
Yes, I do.

878
01:26:58,291 --> 01:27:00,452
That's exactly why Parallax
is beating you...

879
01:27:00,628 --> 01:27:03,222
...because you're afraid
to even admit you're afraid.

880
01:27:03,398 --> 01:27:04,956
I know.

881
01:27:05,366 --> 01:27:07,334
I spent my entire life doing it.

882
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:11,130
You know, we have a saying on Earth.

883
01:27:11,306 --> 01:27:13,831
We say, "I'm only human."

884
01:27:15,577 --> 01:27:19,172
We say it because we're vulnerable,
we say it because we know we're afraid.

885
01:27:19,348 --> 01:27:21,475
It doesn't mean we're weak.

886
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:25,186
Help me save my planet.

887
01:27:26,255 --> 01:27:27,654
Don't give in to fear.

888
01:27:27,823 --> 01:27:30,951
Fight it. Fight it with me.

889
01:27:32,195 --> 01:27:34,561
GUARDIAN:
Your words are compelling, young human.

890
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:38,393
But as immortals, we must measure
our actions over billions of years...

891
01:27:38,568 --> 01:27:40,729
...and the fate of the universe.

892
01:27:40,904 --> 01:27:45,432
We simply cannot risk losing everything
on the chance you might be right.

893
01:27:45,608 --> 01:27:48,702
Then don't. Don't risk any more lives.

894
01:27:49,913 --> 01:27:51,039
Just mine.

895
01:27:52,849 --> 01:27:54,612
Let me go fight for my world...

896
01:27:54,784 --> 01:27:58,982
...and I'll show you
that will is stronger than fear.

897
01:27:59,924 --> 01:28:02,119
There is no way you can succeed.

898
01:28:02,293 --> 01:28:04,488
You will die, Hal Jordan.

899
01:28:06,097 --> 01:28:08,361
Then I'll die trying.

900
01:28:10,934 --> 01:28:13,129
Good luck, Green Lantern.

901
01:29:12,465 --> 01:29:13,989
I wouldn't do that.

902
01:29:17,037 --> 01:29:18,334
Look closely.

903
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:25,107
She's beautiful, isn't she?

904
01:29:26,346 --> 01:29:29,213
I loved her from the moment
I first saw her.

905
01:29:29,383 --> 01:29:32,546
But she could never see me,
as you were always standing in the way.

906
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,550
But not anymore.

907
01:29:35,156 --> 01:29:37,647
No! No! Don't! Don't do this, Hector.

908
01:29:37,826 --> 01:29:39,350
Please.

909
01:29:40,027 --> 01:29:41,392
Please.

910
01:29:42,462 --> 01:29:43,486
I know how you feel.

911
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:47,558
Come on, look at yourself!

912
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:52,399
No, I know what it's like...

913
01:29:53,709 --> 01:29:55,540
...to not live up to expectations...

914
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:58,975
...to feel like nothing that you do
will ever be good enough.

915
01:30:03,251 --> 01:30:05,583
I know what it's like to be afraid.

916
01:30:06,688 --> 01:30:08,485
Let me help you.

917
01:30:09,859 --> 01:30:12,726
Hal. You've changed.

918
01:30:13,996 --> 01:30:17,488
How wonderful that all it took for you
to grow up was the end of the world.

919
01:30:19,001 --> 01:30:20,696
Now it's my turn.

920
01:30:22,872 --> 01:30:26,035
And if I can't be like you,
I'm gonna make her like me.

921
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:28,369
And let's face it, once she's like me...

922
01:30:29,178 --> 01:30:31,339
...then you wouldn't be very interested.

923
01:30:31,513 --> 01:30:33,572
Hmm? Now, would you?

924
01:30:35,418 --> 01:30:37,545
- Why can't you?
- Hmm?

925
01:30:38,922 --> 01:30:40,719
Why can't you be like me?

926
01:30:40,891 --> 01:30:42,916
Heh. Huh?

927
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:45,559
Let her go...

928
01:30:48,931 --> 01:30:50,057
...and you can have it.

929
01:30:55,806 --> 01:30:57,603
You can do anything.

930
01:30:58,309 --> 01:30:59,970
Be anything.

931
01:31:02,613 --> 01:31:04,046
Take it.

932
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:09,580
Let her make the choice.

933
01:31:15,092 --> 01:31:16,559
Okay.

934
01:31:44,189 --> 01:31:45,520
Wow.

935
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:57,534
Now bring her down.

936
01:32:01,174 --> 01:32:02,334
Hal.

937
01:32:04,143 --> 01:32:05,201
I lied.

938
01:32:11,285 --> 01:32:12,809
I lied too.

939
01:32:13,554 --> 01:32:15,522
See, the way it works is...

940
01:32:15,689 --> 01:32:16,951
...you have to be chosen.

941
01:32:57,699 --> 01:32:59,667
You have failed me.

942
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,428
Stay here.

943
01:33:32,602 --> 01:33:33,967
No problem.

944
01:34:01,566 --> 01:34:04,558
Your will is strong,
but not strong enough.

945
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:08,468

You must move out of the area now.</i>

947
01:34:37,035 --> 01:34:39,503
<i>Please clear the streets.</i>

948
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:41,468
<i>Clear the streets immediately.</i>

949
01:34:44,944 --> 01:34:47,174
You can never beat this. You'll die.

950
01:34:47,347 --> 01:34:49,178
At least I can get it away from here.

951
01:34:49,349 --> 01:34:52,011
- How do you think you're gonna do that?
- I don't know. I don't know.

952
01:34:53,453 --> 01:34:55,887
Maybe I can outthink it or...

953
01:34:56,055 --> 01:34:57,886
The dogfight, remember?

954
01:34:58,056 --> 01:34:59,546
Those were a couple of jets.

955
01:34:59,725 --> 01:35:01,818
Unbeatable jets.

956
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:06,691
The ring chose me for a reason.

957
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:09,765
This is why.

958
01:35:11,338 --> 01:35:14,205
- Look, I'm probably not...
- Please don't. No.

959
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,774
Hey.

960
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:27,049
<i>POLICEMAN :
This is a mandatory evacuation.</i>

961
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:29,554
<i>Everyone must clear the streets
immediately.</i>

962
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:35,220
<i>Police emergency,
everyone must clear the street now.</i>

963
01:36:10,533 --> 01:36:12,967
DRIVER:
Everybody off now! Now!

964
01:36:13,502 --> 01:36:14,730
Go! Go!

965
01:36:24,081 --> 01:36:25,412
MAN:
Run!

966
01:36:51,975 --> 01:36:53,567
- Run!
- Aah! Aah!

967
01:37:12,297 --> 01:37:15,027
I feel your fear growing.

968
01:37:15,433 --> 01:37:17,230
You will be dead soon.

969
01:37:17,402 --> 01:37:20,200
In brightest day, in blackest night...

970
01:37:20,372 --> 01:37:23,830
And when you're gone,
I'll destroy everything you ever loved.

971
01:37:24,009 --> 01:37:27,001
- No evil shall escape my sight.

972
01:37:27,179 --> 01:37:30,637
Your family, your home,
your planet will be no more.

973
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:34,951
Let those who worship evil's might...

974
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:39,750
The entire human race will be wiped out
because you, Hal Jordan...

975
01:37:39,925 --> 01:37:41,449
...were afraid.

976
01:37:41,628 --> 01:37:44,153
- Beware my power:

977
01:37:44,698 --> 01:37:46,029
Green Lantern's light!

978
01:39:02,044 --> 01:39:05,946
The bigger you are, the faster you burn.

979
01:41:07,575 --> 01:41:10,043
<i>SINESTRO: Though his time
wearing the ring has been brief...</i>

980
01:41:11,144 --> 01:41:16,411
...Hal Jordan's defeat of Parallax will be
remembered as long as the Corps exists.

981
01:41:16,651 --> 01:41:20,280
His actions are a reminder
of why the ring chose each of us.

982
01:41:21,422 --> 01:41:23,253
To overcome fear...

983
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:27,257
...and destroy evil wherever it may hide.

984
01:41:35,837 --> 01:41:38,067
As Lanterns,
we must fight with all our will.

985
01:41:39,841 --> 01:41:42,275
Our wills haven't always been united.

986
01:41:44,112 --> 01:41:45,374
It's time they were.

987
01:41:47,415 --> 01:41:50,043
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Can I train them or can I train them?

988
01:41:51,287 --> 01:41:53,687
SINESTRO:
You're impertinent, Hal Jordan.

989
01:41:53,856 --> 01:41:57,485
You're rash, volatile, opinionated.

990
01:41:58,962 --> 01:42:02,227
It seems Abin Sur found another
just like himself.

991
01:42:44,174 --> 01:42:47,109
Wow, I am never getting used to that.

992
01:42:51,683 --> 01:42:55,175
My new job requires that I travel.

993
01:42:58,023 --> 01:42:59,456
Be away for a while.

994
01:43:03,294 --> 01:43:07,025
Away, never gone.

995
01:43:11,804 --> 01:43:12,998
Hal.

996
01:43:13,172 --> 01:43:14,503
Yeah?

997
01:43:14,873 --> 01:43:17,034
Can you take off the mask?

998
01:43:22,214 --> 01:43:23,545
That's really cool. Ha, ha.

999
01:43:38,264 --> 01:43:40,095
So, what happens now?

1000
01:43:41,333 --> 01:43:43,267
I'm gonna go look for trouble.

1001
01:44:06,795 --> 01:44:09,195
<i>TOMAR-RE: Of all the Lanterns
who have ever worn the ring...</i>

1002
01:44:09,363 --> 01:44:12,355
<i>... there was one
whose light shined brightest.</i>

1003
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,133
<i>At first, his humanity
was thought to be a weakness.</i>

1004
01:44:16,304 --> 01:44:20,206
<i>And yet it proved to be
his greatest strength.</i>
