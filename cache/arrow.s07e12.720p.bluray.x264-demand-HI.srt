you were doing out there?

for asking.

I'm glad you're OK.

I'm glad the FBI made
your immunity permanent,

195
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,796
but being a vigilante
is illegal in Star City.

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,394
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

197
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,234
I mean, you have a cute,
shiny new badge.

198
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,073
Thought about giving
one to anyone else?

199
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,096
First step would probably
be not being so reckless.

- You or me?
- Try to guess.

201

I nearly lost my job
giving Oliver a badge,

and Pollard is still looking
for ways to take it from him.

Are you still working with
the new Green Arrow?

208
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,816
Because I'm pretty sure
we've been over this.

209
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,832
Not for nothing,
but crime stats

210
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,240
have skyrocketed
ever since

211

we've hung up
our masks,

212
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,150
and they've gone down
ever since nga showed up.

213
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,320
Oh, we need
to come up with

214
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
a better name immediately.

OK. Who was it who
attacked you guys?

Another mask,
some sort of exosuit.

Oliver: All right,
we need a full

219

forensics sweep
of the abduction point.

220
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,357
I need to know
where they could've gone.

224
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,496
I don't mean them.
I mean what I've been hearing

225
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,193
about a vigilante being
abducted tonight.

226
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,999
I thought you didn't
care about vigilantes.

227
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,160
Believe me, captain Drake,
I'm anything but Sanguine,

228
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,237
but your little stunt of
deputizing Oliver Queen

229
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,595
has set off
a firestorm.

230
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,040
That's funny. I think that's
actually a different superhero.

I'm holding a town hall
on vigilantism.

234
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,876
In the hope
that firestorm

235
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,394
will burn Oliver,
get him to resign?

236

Your friend Oliver,

237
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,056
he's gonna have to stand in
front of the city he lied to,

238
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,276
a city that's afraid
of him, and justify

239
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,352
his continued existence
as the Green Arrow.

240
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,590
You can't force him to.

241

Oh, I'm the mayor.
I'm pretty sure I can.

so that it would infect anything

on finding it. I mean...

- No.

That wasn't so much
a suggestion

you're grounded. So...

A.R.G.U.S. has satellites
off the books.

have your help on this one.

Well, Oliver, yes, but, look,
I need a little bit more information.

I'm quite sure you're
not this animated

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,336
how long have you
known about this?

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,109
Friends?

477
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Yeah.

478
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,794
Felicity set up
an encryption scheme

479
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,176
so I could text Zoe
while I was away.

480
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,656
I didn't know that.
Why didn't I know that?

481
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,736
How come you didn't
tell me?

482
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,080
It's just texting, dad.

483
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,436
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, sure, yeah.

484
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,632
Um, you guys can have
the living room.

485
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,189
I'll be in
the next room...

486
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,715
Cleaning my gun.

487
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,395
Don't worry about him.
How's it being back home?

488
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,960
Sucks.

489
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,033
Guys with cameras are following
my dad and Felicity everywhere.

490
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,629
And that's
what's bothering you?

491
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,714
We've only got
about 3 minutes

492
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,560
before my dad finds
an excuse to check on us.

493
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,150
What's wrong?

494
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,296
You tell some girl
you have a crush on her

495
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,640
and she didn't
like you back?

496
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,154
Sort of.

497
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,391
Cool. What's her name?

498
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,312
It's not that.

499
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,914
Then what is it?

500
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,554
I don't know.

501
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,794
I think you do know.

502
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,200
You just don't want
to tell me.

503
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,714
Maybe it's not
the worst thing.

504
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,470
My dad and aunt Dinah
fight instead of talk.

505
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,633
Promise me we'll
never be like that.

506
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,235
You got it.

507
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,199
Mind if I hang here
for a few hours?

508
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,118
I really do not
want to go back home.

509
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,516
OK. We should probably
open that geography book.

510
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,954
Yeah.

511
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,794
Get up. Go.

512
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,997
Curtis: What's that mean,
"he's coming for you"?

513
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,309
Well,
this chimera...

514
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,576
I'm really glad that
name's catching on.

515
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,115
Hey, he's
hunting vigilantes.

516
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,557
So he's like
an anti-vigilante vigilante.

517
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,296
John: More like a predator
or a lion trying

518
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,437
to take down the biggest
in the jungle.

519
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,874
Dinah: That's quite a leap.

520
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,656
Tell that to Rene,
who was nearly cut in half,

521
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,275
had it not been for the kevlar,
or Rory or Helena,

522
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,113
neither of which we can
get in contact with.

523
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,669
Oliver and I came across
this collection of masks

524
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,275
in chimera's
underground lair.

525
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,119
He had them all
on display,

526
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,520
almost like
trophies.

527
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,599
Any word?

528
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,195
Oliver: Best guess is that
she has a concussion

529
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,509
and a couple of
broken ribs.

530
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,196
They're having Dr. Schwartz
examine her discreetly.

531
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,112
Dinah: Did she give you
any intel on chimera?

532
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,475
Is that what
we're calling it?

533
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,314
I can only hope. I mean,
it'd be nice. Heh! Ahem.

534
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,278
No, she was
in too much pain to speak.

535
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,874
Oliver: Meanwhile.
John: Meanwhile...

536
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,314
You're next on
chimera's list.

537
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,959
So I can't think of
a worse idea

538
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,396
than going out as Green Arrow
during Pollard's town hall.

539
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,016
Except maybe showing up
in the first place.

540
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,696
Maybe you should tell Pollard
that you're not coming.

541
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,951
I think that's Dinah's job.

542
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,114
Great.

543
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,035
Schwartz: Excuse me.
Uh, where is she?

544
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
What?

545
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,080
Your green-hooded friend.
She's not in her room.

546
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,389
Oliver: Oh, for god's sakes.

547
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,790
Well, did we really expect
her to stick around?

548
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,280
[Whispering] No.

549
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,950
It's just me.

550
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,156
What are you doing here?

551
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,233
Captain Drake told me you
bailed at the hospital.

552
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,755
I just came to
check up on you.

553
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,958
- Let me help you with that.
- I can manage on my own.

554
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,191
You are so stubborn.

555
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,875
You sure you and
Oliver aren't related?

556
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,640
[Sighs]

557
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,313
Actually, we are.

558
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,880
He's my half-brother.

559
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,478
Ha ha! That's funny.

560
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,517
I'm not joking.

561
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,193
Robert Queen was my father.

562
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,114
So when you told me
about your mother,

563
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,956
you kind of left out a
pretty important detail.

564
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,509
Robert was out of
the picture long before.

565
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,192
I didn't want to
tell you

566
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,239
because I didn't want
to risk changing things.

567
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,277
Changing
what things?

568
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,193
You and me working together.

569
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,753
Why would it?

570
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,514
Oliver's got his thing,
and we've got our thing.

571
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,720
Right?

572
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,911
Yeah, we do.

573
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,400
All right. All right.
Thank you, Ms. Mayor...

574
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
For nothing.

575
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,630
[Hangs up]

576
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,200
We have a new problem.

577
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,158
Don't we always?

578
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,114
Dinah, before
we get to that,

579
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,920
there's something that I need
to speak with you about,

580
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,674
something I've been
keeping from you.

581
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,635
Well, that is par for
the course with you, Oliver.

582
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,757
That's a fair point.

583
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,550
In this instance,

584
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,552
I just... I needed
some time

585
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,552
to process
the information

586
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,074
before I shared it
with everyone.

587
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,355
What information?

588
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,318
The new Green Arrow
is my half-sister.

589
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,273
She's the product of an
affair that my father had.

590
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,033
Wow.

591
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,555
Ha ha!
I wasn't expecting that.

592
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,994
I really hope you
can appreciate

593
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,514
why I needed
some time with this.

594
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,875
Sure. Yeah.

595
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,679
I have lots of questions.

596
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,200
I have a lot of
questions, too.

597
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,112
I have been trying
to connect with her,

598
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,830
but she is
not very trusting

599
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
at the moment.

600
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,394
Sounds like
your sister, all right.

601
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,079
OK, what's
our new problem?

602
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,198
Right. Pollard is insisting you
go to the town hall tonight.

603
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,158
What? You explained
to her...

604
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
yeah, of course I did.

605
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,056
But she actually thinks
that we made up chimera

606
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,390
as an excuse to get you
to not face the city.

607
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,518
If I had a problem being scrutinized,
Dinah,

608
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,751
I wouldn't let a camera
crew follow me around.

609
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,399
I know. I explained
that to her.

610
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,790
But if you ask me,
she sees this town hall

611
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,314
as a chance to
publicly crucify you,

612
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,754
and she's not
gonna miss that.

613
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,274
I'm not exposing
hundreds of people

614
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,829
to what could potentially
become a war zone.

615
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,400
Pollard cannot
force me to.

616
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,995
- I will tell her.
- Thank you.

617
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,560
Mm-hmm. This should be fun.

618
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,875
Hey. You got a minute?

619
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,360
Of course.

620
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,696
I know you don't plan on doing this
town hall meeting thing, do you?

621
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,916
I just told Dinah to
tell Pollard that.

622
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,160
I'm thinking maybe
you should.

623
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,896
It might be our only shot
at catching chimera.

624
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,960
Curtis will
find him again.

625
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,096
Yeah, well, the trail's
gone cold.

626
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,318
But, Oliver, I have a plan.

627
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,074
I'm all ears.

628
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,759
So are they.

629
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,271
Sorry, guys.
Private party.

630
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,679
Cameraman: Ugh. Damn it.

631
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,629
I enjoyed that.

632
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,951
You know I know what
you're gonna say, right?

633
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
I do.

634
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,716
Best way to stop chimera
is by drawing him out?

635
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,433
Exactly.

636
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,992
Not with hundreds of
people there, John.

637
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,958
This guy's taken
down 4 vigilantes.

638
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,952
He is out of
the SCPD's league.

639
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,394
Yes, he is...

640
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,235
But not Team Arrow's.

641
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,913
What? No. No.

642
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,117
There's no world
in which Pollard

643
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,351
will allow Dinah to
deputize all of you.

644
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,936
And I'm certainly not going
to risk you going to prison

645
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,553
for violating
the anti-vigilante law.

646
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,475
Come on.
Even if I was willing to take that risk,

647
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,438
there is
no Team Arrow anymore.

648
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,795
But there is.

649
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,234
Oliver, there is.

650
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,039
It's just changed.

651
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,920
We may not have been Team Arrow
when you were in slabside,

652
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,196
but we had
each other's backs.

653
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,078
Just give us a chance,
man, to have yours.

654
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,435
You could
go to prison.

655
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,749
So?

656
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,638
You did it for us,

657
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,556
which never really
sat right with me.

658
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,560
And the reason why is because
it wasn't right, Oliver.

659
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,791
We have fights, disagreements,
recriminations,

660
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,918
but it doesn't matter
because we are a team.

661
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,911
And nothing's going
to change that.

662
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,719
John, I made a lot
of mistakes.

663
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,473
We all did.

664
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,274
That's why they're
called mistakes, Oliver.

665
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,278
You learn from them.
You move forward.

666
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,999
We...

667
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,114
We get better.

Pollard:
Thank you for coming.

672
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,152
You made it pretty clear
I didn't have a choice.

673
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,310
Well, it's my hope

674
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,039
that once the
pittson pavilion opens,

675
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,396
your services will
no longer be required.

676
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,040
The police can keep this
event and the city safe.

677
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,520
The SCPD
has been rebuilt

678
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,592
into a remarkable
police force,

679
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,776
but if they were
enough, the city

680
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,120
wouldn't need me,
now, would they?

681
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,640
It doesn't need you.

682
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,713
That's exactly the message
I intend to convey tonight.

683
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,995
[Applause]

Mayor Pollard.

685
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,056
All right, buckle up, kiddies,
because overwatch is back in the house.

686
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,514
Well, not actually
in the house.

687
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,856
I mean, I'm working at A.R.G.U.S. remotely,
but I'm on the comms, you know.

688
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,176
We know what
you meant, overwatch.

689
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,475
Cool, cool, cool.
So I am tapped

690
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,200

Copy that. Standing by.

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
I swore I'd never
wear this suit again.

695
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,315
Come on. It's got to feel good
to be back in the saddle.

696
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,760
I just wish Dinah
was here with us.

697

She's doing
her thing with SCPD.

698
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,711
That anti-vigilante law's
crap, man.

Over the past 7 years,
Star City has suffered

702
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,551
through a weapon
of mass destruction,

703
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,752
an actual army of soldiers,
and nuclear weapons...

ago, I wonder.

705
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,510
Now, Mayor Pollard, I
fail to see your point.

706
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
7 years ago,

707
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,149
you started zip-lining
through the city.

708
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,960
Your activities as the hood
and then the Green Arrow

709
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,351
prompted the very same dangers that
you claim to have saved us from.

It's electromagnetic
