1
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:19,371
Yo, I am so psyched
for Invisible Force 2.

2
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:22,078
Please.
Invisible Force 1 was lame.

3
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:23,751
I'm all about Rising Tide.

4
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:26,078
Rising Tide? The Deep?

5
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:27,976
- Uh-huh.
- Translucent could kick the Deep's ass.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,630
How? He's invisible.

7
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:31,249
That's, like, all he's got.
That's it.

8
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:33,505
Exactly.
He sneaks up on the Deep,

9
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:35,257
and then boom, motherfucker!

10
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,939
- Sit down.
- Until the Deep makes a shark

11
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:38,838
bite Translucent's dick off.

12
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,846
How's he gonna find his dick?
It's invisible.

13
00:00:50,022 --> 00:00:51,022
Holy shit.

14
00:00:57,863 --> 00:00:59,283
Benjy!

15
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:08,058
Get up. Get up, get up, get up.

16
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:09,922
Come on, Benjy.
Come on, come on.

17
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:41,824
Stay back.

18
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,366
Just stay the fuck back.

19
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:47,036
What are you smiling at?

20
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:08,601
Homelander?

21
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:11,312
You boys okay?

22
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:16,482
Can I... can I get a selfie?

23
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,895
Course you can.

24
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:22,866
The Seven's Queen Maeve
and Homelander

25
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:24,577
made another heroic save today,

26
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:26,078
stopping
a hijacked armored truck

27
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:27,448
on the streets of Brooklyn,

28
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:28,945
then staying behind
for a photo op

29
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:30,432
- with some very lucky fans.
- Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:32,036
- Jean?
- Thanks, Jennifer. And now...

31
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,673
So, this is pretty much

32
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,549
everything in one.
Bluetooth speakers.

33
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:38,167
It's in stereo,
so you can put it

34
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:39,775
all around your living room,
have some fun with it.

35
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,679
You said you have
a standard cable box, right?

36
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:44,427
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, then I need to get you an audio transmitter,

37
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,930
aptX Low Latency.

38
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:47,601
It makes it
so there's less audio lag,

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,350
and it's got
a standard optical in.

40
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:52,102
And let's hook you up
with thousand-meg HDMI.

41
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:53,234
Let's go with this one.

42
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,810
Uh, it costs a little bit more,

43
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:56,565
but the carbon's
way more conductive.

44
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,249
Hey, Gary. Um...

45
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:14,267
- I really need to talk to you about something.
- Later, kid.

46
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,131
Okay. Cool.

47
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:19,298
Later... you want, like...
want, like, 30-30 minutes?

48
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:20,758
Like, a solid 45?

49
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:26,511
Excuse me, sir?

50
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,974
Hi. I'd like
to make an appointment

51
00:03:29,014 --> 00:03:31,024
for you to come over and...

52
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:33,848
lay some cable.

53
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,694
Okay. Uh... oh, Robin.

54
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,360
Oh, dear, dear, Robin.

55
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:41,609
Um, that doesn't mean
what you think it means.

56
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:44,532
Um, "laying cable" means sex.

57
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,452
No, "laying pipe" means sex.

58
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,830
"Laying cable" means

59
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,577
you want me
to come over to your house

60
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:51,263
and just take a big, old shit.

61
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:53,327
- That's disgusting.
- Well, okay.

62
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:54,752
But you...
Who-who said it, though?

63
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,290
Okay. Are you ready?
Despite your best efforts,

64
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:59,384
I'm actually still hungry.

65
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,710
I'm actually more hungry now.

66
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:05,175
- Where are we gonna go after all this hot talk?
- I don't know.

67
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:06,611
- You know?
- More importantly, where are we gonna go

68
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,345
to lay some cable afterwards?

69
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:09,677
Geez.

70
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:11,352
So, did you ask him?

71
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,890
- Who?
- Gary.

72
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:17,104
Did you ask Gary for the raise?

73
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:19,146
Yeah. Yeah. It was... it was a...

74
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,570
Look, it was a crazy day,
and-and he was super busy,

75
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:24,279
but tomorrow for sure. Yes.

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,280
Okay.

77
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,872
What was I supposed to do,
kick his door down?

78
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:30,868
Like Homelander?

79
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,240
I said "okay."

80
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:33,826
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

81
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:35,461
Hey, I see the look.

82
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:37,368
I see it. Come on.

83
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:42,634
This is like when
we started dating.

84
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:45,091
I don't think that's...
I don't think that's true.

85
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,512
Dude, I had to ask you out.

86
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,931
Well, excuse me for waiting.

87
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,810
You ever hear of chivalry?

88
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:54,767
Listen, this is about you
getting what you deserve.

89
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,478
I'm killing myself at school

90
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,689
because I think it's gonna be
worth it for both of us.

91
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,480
You know,
if we move in together.

92
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:04,485
Wait, what? What?
W-W-Wait. Hey, hey, hey.

93
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:05,777
Hey, hey. What was that?

94
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,739
What'd you just say?

95
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,570
Well, I mean, we can't keep,
you know, laying pipe

96
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:12,334
at your dad's place.

97
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:13,988
Trying to be all quiet.

98
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:16,826
Staring up at that dumb
Billy Joel post...

99
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:25,304
- ...poster.
- Hey.

100
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:28,549
Don't you ever besmirch
Billy Jo...

101
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,626
I can't stop. I can't stop.
I can't stop. I can't stop.

102
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,960
Can't stop. Can't stop.

103
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,009
Robin?

104
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:18,515
Robin?

105
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:22,561
Robin!

106
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,517
Robin!

107
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:55,638
Let the energy
go through the wall.

108
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:06,521
I am Starlight.

109
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:09,685
I'm 110 pounds,
and I'm five foot six.

110
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:11,735
Turn around, please.

111
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,412
Okay. Let's see it, dear.

112
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:23,254
- You should look away.
- Sorry?

113
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,920
You should turn away
from the camera,

114
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,088
and you should close your eyes,
or else I'll blind you.

115
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:30,008
All right.

116
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,047
Okay, go ahead.

117
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:42,691
I am so sorry.

118
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:44,976
Are you all right?

119
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:49,321
I was born Super-Abled.

120
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:51,688
Uh, my mom was thrilled.

121
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:55,605
She took me to all
the little miss hero pageants,

122
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,236
but I hated it.

123
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:59,662
Ugh, I mean, I can still...

124
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:02,292
smell the hairspray.

125
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:05,619
Uh, but...

126
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:10,126
...at the Q and A, they always
asked me what my wish was,

127
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,470
and I always said,
"to save the world."

128
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:17,388
And the judges just chuckled

129
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,718
like it was cute.

130
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:23,773
But it wasn't a joke to me.

131
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:29,774
Since when
did "hopeful" and "naive"

132
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:32,105
become the same thing?

133
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:34,901
I mean, why would you
get into this business

134
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:37,865
if not to save the world?

135
00:08:37,906 --> 00:08:41,576
That's all I have ever wanted.

136
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:47,326
And that's why
I've always wanted

137
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:50,504
to be in The Seven.

138
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,889
Thanks, Jennifer.

139
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:06,602
Thought Robin's service
was nice.

140
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:09,693
Did you see
how many people came?

141
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,730
Wow.

142
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:14,781
Lot of respect for that girl.

143
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:17,278
Lot of love in the room.

144
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,951
And the spread. What a spread.

145
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,490
Just really nice.

146
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,413
That does not begin to convey

147
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:25,833
the terrible regret...

148
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,182
Aw, geez.
Maybe there's a movie on.

149
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:28,600
- No, keep it.
- No, we can switch it.

150
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,254
Keep it.

151
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,002
...awful, tragic loss.

152
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:37,416
My deepest condolences
to Robin Ward's family.

153
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:40,216
I was chasing
these bank robbers.

154
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,850
She just stepped
in the middle of the street,

155
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:45,018
and I-I couldn't...

156
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:46,477
Middle of the...

157
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:49,057
She was a half step
off the fucking curb.

158
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:50,402
Oh, now, come on, Hughie.

159
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:52,227
Just, uh, don't get upset, okay?
Just...

160
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:54,022
He knows.

161
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,585
...swift,
thoughtful attention...

162
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:01,108
Now I think that A-Train
would like to get back to work.

163
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:02,866
Everyone at Vought is just...

164
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:06,078
just wrecked about Robin.

165
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:10,119
Now, you two weren't married,
and look,

166
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:12,915
technically,
there's no legal claim.

167
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,210
But...

168
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:16,763
Vought wants to do
the right thing:

169
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:20,127
offer you $45,000
in restitution.

170
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,514
All you have to do is sign

171
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:24,724
right here,

172
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:26,773
and I'll offer you the check.

173
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,769
This is
a confidentiality agreement.

174
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:33,652
It's a boilerplate NDA.

175
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:36,649
I sign this, and...

176
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:39,442
I can't talk about it?

177
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:41,446
Have to pretend
like it didn't happen,

178
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:44,618
like I wasn't holding
Robin's arms in my hands?

179
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:46,578
Look, I know you're upset,

180
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:48,578
but we're just trying to help.

181
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,080
Then say you're sorry.

182
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:52,543
Excuse me?

183
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,213
I mean, you people say
"our condolences"

184
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:57,252
and "my sympathies"
and "our regrets,"

185
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,296
but nobody can look me
in the fucking eye

186
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,129
and say "I'm sorry."

187
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:05,425
I'm not signing anything.
Get out.

188
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,180
I said get the hell out!

189
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:16,146
You okay?

190
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:22,235
As I said,
boilerplate NDA, really.

191
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,239
Pretty standard stuff.

192
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:26,911
Can I think about it?

193
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:32,161
If you have
any questions at all,

194
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,995
just, uh...

195
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,929
Unit 44, code 20.

196
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,967
Address is 1420 63rd Street...

197
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:49,971
Any maniacs out there?

198
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:51,675
Mm-mm. Quiet night.

199
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:53,225
Like every night.

200
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:55,098
That's too bad.

201
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:58,145
We could really use the press
right now.

202
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,395
Oh, Annie.

203
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:03,363
I'm hungry.

204
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:05,363
Don't worry.
I didn't get the job.

205
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,695
You don't know that.

206
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:10,701
They're auditioning girls
nationwide.

207
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:12,414
Besides,
Countess probably got it.

208
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:14,414
She's so good in a room.

209
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:17,496
If you're negative,
negative things happen to you.

210
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:20,303
Hello?

211
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:23,297
Yes, I'm her mother.

212
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,010
Uh, yes. Uh...

213
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:27,641
uh, one moment.

214
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,258
It's them.

215
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:30,514
It's them.

216
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:31,765
Hello?

217
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:34,766
Yes, this is she.

218
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:39,311
I got it?

219
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:40,856
You got it!

220
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:41,899
You got it!

221
00:12:41,942 --> 00:12:43,822
Shh.

222
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,530
Oh, my God.

223
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,161
Uh, I'm so... I'm so sorry.

224
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:50,118
It's a weird connection.

225
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:51,618
I don't know what that was,
actually.

226
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,830
Uh... Mm-hmm.

227
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,620
Oh, shit.

228
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:57,825
Yeah?

229
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:59,504
I think she was an addict.

230
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:00,883
Needle tracks?

231
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,209
12 marks on one arm.

232
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:04,875
More dope coming in.

233
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,012
More pushers at work.

234
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,760
What you doing?

235
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:10,222
Can't file a criminal case

236
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:11,614
against A-Train.
Supes are like cops.

237
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:13,138
They can't be charged

238
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,141
- for damages while they're on the job.
- Okay.

239
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:16,893
But maybe we can file
a wrongful death.

240
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:19,855
I just got to get Robin's
parents to sign off on it.

241
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:22,896
- Hughie, come sit with me.
- Dad, I'm not...

242
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:25,031
I'm right...

243
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:27,068
Okay.

244
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:35,502
Good for you.

245
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:38,537
You want to make this right,
what happened to Robin.

246
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:42,713
But you can't.

247
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,214
So sign this.

248
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,180
What?

249
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:51,137
This is a lot of money, Hughie.

250
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:53,178
We could really use it.

251
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:57,602
I can't... Dad, they killed her.

252
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,312
Be realistic, okay?

253
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:00,852
Even if we could pay
for a lawyer...

254
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:03,186
and that's a big if...
there's no case.

255
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:04,611
She was in the street.

256
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,239
- Be like if a bus hit her.
- Dad, she was one step

257
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:08,447
- off the curb.
- I...

258
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:09,947
- I saw it!
- Hughie, look. Look.

259
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:12,988
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

260
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,635
- Dad, I have...
- You don't have the fight.

261
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,659
You never have.

262
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:22,208
I'm sorry, but it's-it's true.

263
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:26,252
Neither do I.

264
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,340
Now...

265
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:32,182
come and...
come and sit with me, okay?

266
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:35,679
Remington Steele's on.

267
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:38,182
Hughie! Where you going?

268
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:47,783
...the red carpet
outside of Vought headquarters,

269
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,858
here for the annual
shareholders presentation...

270
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:53,655
There she is.

271
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:55,368
Welcome to New York.

272
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,488
I'm Ashley Barrett,
director of talent relations.

273
00:14:57,536 --> 00:15:00,156
So, uh, are all these people
here for me?

274
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:01,575
Oh, honey.

275
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:04,293
Who else
would they be here for?

276
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,504
Come on.

277
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:07,054
We're running late.

278
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:08,337
Oh, my God.

279
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

280
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:20,024
it is without a doubt
a good time

281
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:23,268
to be in the Superhero business.

282
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:26,361
Our net income is up 14%.

283
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:29,478
Our latest film,
G-Men: World War,

284
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:31,606
just grossed shy

285
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:35,203
of $1.7 billion world-wide.

286
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,830
And this fall, we break ground

287
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:39,077
on our newest theme park
outside of Paris.

288
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:42,539
The branding opportunities
are limitless.

289
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:48,173
But, you know,
none of that really matters.

290
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:52,921
Because job one is managing,
supporting,

291
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:56,296
and advising the brave heroes

292
00:15:56,344 --> 00:16:00,814
who put themselves in
harm's way each and every day

293
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:03,389
for us.

294
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:06,055
Let's take a look.

295
00:16:11,776 --> 00:16:13,986
A world without crime,

296
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:16,359
with liberty
and justice for all,

297
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:18,776
that's within our reach,

298
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:22,075
thanks to the 200-plus
Superheroes

299
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,710
in the Vought Family.

300
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,747
We see a bright future ahead,

301
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,500
where there is a Vought Hero
in every town.

302
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:33,094
You're doing really well,
by the way, so far.

303
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:35,221
I-I haven't done anything yet.

304
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:36,798
Yeah, exactly.
You're already up

305
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:38,403
two-and-a-half points
with Midwesterners

306
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:40,468
and conservative Christians
in 18 to 49.

307
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,973
That speech, by the way,
your audition...

308
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:45,846
It was modest;
it was humble.

309
00:16:45,894 --> 00:16:48,484
Really fucking smart choice.

310
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,571
Uh, I-I meant it.

311
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,027
Yeah, that's why we love you.

312
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:55,948
So you ready for your life
to change?

313
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,592
...including the jewel

314
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:00,736
in Vought's crown,

315
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:03,124
the greatest superhero team

316
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:04,411
the world's ever seen:

317
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,214
The Seven.

318
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,878
That is our job,
our honor.

319
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,497
We are Vought.

320
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:12,923
We make heroes super.

321
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,350
I have a very exciting surprise
for you.

322
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:25,179
Both a member of The Seven,

323
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:28,185
and Lord of the Seven Seas,

324
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:30,808
live and in person, the Deep.

325
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:48,576
Thank you.

326
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,496
Thank you, everybody.

327
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:56,344
After a long,

328
00:17:56,381 --> 00:18:00,141
distinguished career
with The Seven,

329
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:04,556
my good friend, the Lamplighter,
has retired.

330
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:06,767
Let's give him
a big "thank you."

331
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:08,268
What do you say?

332
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,704
Thank you, Lamplighter!

333
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,230
But now,

334
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:18,194
as we turn towards the future,

335
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:21,946
I'd like to introduce someone
very special.

336
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,830
And I, for one, can't wait
to work with her.

337
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:27,578
Please welcome Starlight.

338
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,410
Go. Go. That's you.

339
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:42,361
- Ooh, look at that.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

340
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:44,925
Starlight and the Deep.

341
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:52,149
Oh. Hi.

342
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:53,897
I love you, Starlight!

343
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,650
We love you!

344
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,490
Hey, buddy, you okay?

345
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:48,374
Hey, buddy!

346
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,386
Wow.

347
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:08,888
Pretty cool, huh?

348
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,220
Oh, hey, check this out.

349
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:12,305
We have two
World View-4 satellites

350
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,310
in geocentric orbit.

351
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:16,652
We can essentially read
a getaway car's license plate

352
00:20:16,688 --> 00:20:18,568
from 380 miles up.

353
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:20,976
That is just...

354
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:22,605
I mean...

355
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:24,532
G... I was working with
a police scanner

356
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,361
that I bought on eBay.

357
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,906
Yeah, well,
not anymore you're not.

358
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,790
Oh, and wait till you
check out the dining room.

359
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:34,408
We, uh, may or may not
have stolen Miro

360
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:36,456
from Gramercy Tavern.

361
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,419
Yeah, he's
fan-fucking-tastic.

362
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,710
That's his, isn't it?

363
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:45,375
Homelander's? Yeah.

364
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:47,425
But you'll have your own soon.

365
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:48,889
Here. Come on.

366
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:50,218
Give it a test drive.

367
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:53,183
Come on.

368
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:55,314
O-Oh, you-you okay?

369
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:57,731
It's just...

370
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:03,856
I used to stand in the mirror,

371
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:08,032
pretending to be
where I am right now.

372
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:10,532
You know something?

373
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:14,075
On my first day, I, uh...

374
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,710
Well, I-I felt like a fraud.

375
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:22,169
Yeah. But the good news is,
everybody feels that way.

376
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:26,344
Thank you.

377
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:31,854
And, hey, we're a team now.

378
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:34,218
We'll help each other out.

379
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:35,635
I bet growing up you had

380
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:38,233
a poster of Homelander
on your wall, huh?

381
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:42,109
No, actually, I...

382
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:44,938
I don't know, Homelander's so...

383
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:48,994
He's like Jesus or something.

384
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,490
If you want to know the truth,

385
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:54,333
I actually had a poster of you.

386
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:56,449
Really?

387
00:21:56,496 --> 00:21:58,666
- Yeah. Yeah. I kind of...
- Oh.

388
00:21:58,706 --> 00:22:02,286
I kind of had
a schoolgirl crush on you.

389
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:04,705
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

390
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,264
I hope that's not
inappropriate to say.

391
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:09,068
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not inappropriate at all.

392
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:11,892
It's just, it's kind of wild.

393
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,310
What?

394
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:22,790
I mean, you said you had
a crush on me.

395
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:24,274
I figured that, you know...

396
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:26,185
- That is...
- Whoa, whoa, wh-wh-whoa, hey.

397
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:27,784
Look, you're gorgeous.

398
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,609
I'm not... I'm not talking
about sex,

399
00:22:29,654 --> 00:22:31,574
just a little bit
of pole-smoking.

400
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:33,467
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

401
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:36,621
It's just a question of how bad
you want to be in The Seven.

402
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:47,588
Excuse me?

403
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,840
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

404
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,051
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

405
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:53,221
Take it easy.

406
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:55,601
Settle down. We're just,
we're just talking.

407
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,598
And look, I know
that you're powerful.

408
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:01,941
I get it.
Your powers are no joke.

409
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:04,438
The thing is...

410
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,860
I am number two around here.

411
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:08,899
So, like, if I say so,

412
00:23:08,943 --> 00:23:10,573
you know, you'd be out of here.

413
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:13,662
Especially since
you attacked me.

414
00:23:13,698 --> 00:23:15,658
I what?

415
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,120
Yeah. Look.

416
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:22,251
I mean, Iowa's sweetheart,
the Defender of Des Moines,

417
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,880
just went psycho on the Deep.

418
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,587
I mean, that...

419
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:29,339
that could put you
out of the business.

420
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,880
Yeah.

421
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:35,224
I mean, home to Mommy,
tail tucked between your legs.

422
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:37,061
Just think of all those kids.

423
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:39,056
I mean, the kids.

424
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:41,268
Those kids who look up to you,

425
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:44,019
they'd just be shattered.

426
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:49,654
I mean, th-that's not
what you really want, right?

427
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:52,862
Or we come together as a team.

428
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:56,534
You and me, we just roll
with the punches,

429
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:59,544
for, like, three minutes, maybe.

430
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:01,537
It's not a big deal.

431
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:04,829
And then you know what happens?

432
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:07,254
All your dreams come true.

433
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,379
I-I'm sure you guys
have all heard

434
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:16,684
that Translucent stopped
a home invasion

435
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,238
in Yonkers last night,
a young, single mother

436
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:19,823
and her two kids.

437
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:22,307
Just incredible. Just...

438
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,270
So tell us, how are you able
to-to vanish?

439
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:26,771
No, I don't actually vanish.

440
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:31,033
My skin turns into this
carbon meta-material

441
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:32,027
that bends the light.

442
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:33,778
Like an invisibility cloak.

443
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,410
All right,
but just to be clear,

444
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:37,446
you have to be
completely naked, right?

445
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:42,039
I appreciate you coming on
the show, my man. I love you.

446
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:44,158
You guys stay tuned for
a behind-the-scenes look

447
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:46,495
at Invisible Force 2, and
later, Translucent himself...

448
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:50,959
You interested in a nanny cam?

449
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:52,564
'Cause we're actually running
a special on that.

450
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:53,918
Um, it's a pretty popular bear.

451
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:55,505
There's cameras in the eyes.

452
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,010
Tell me,

453
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:59,641
how many nannies shake
their babies?

454
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,059
Uh, I'm sorry?

455
00:25:02,098 --> 00:25:06,268
You know, a good...
hard shake, like...

456
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,520
like tryin' to get ketchup
out of a bottle.

457
00:25:09,564 --> 00:25:11,984
One percent? Less?

458
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:13,994
I-I don't really know.

459
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:15,856
Funny, that.

460
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:19,573
They sell a billion dollars
worth of that shit worldwide.

461
00:25:19,615 --> 00:25:21,825
Goes to show you, doesn't it?

462
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:24,328
The bollocks people
will believe

463
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,330
if you get them scared enough.

464
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:29,212
Cool.

465
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,170
Cool, cool.

466
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,750
Um...

467
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:35,205
Is there anything I can
help you with today, or...?

468
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:38,006
I'm not gonna piss you about,
Hughie.

469
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,430
I heard what happened to Robin.

470
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,572
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
who are you?

471
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:42,926
She wasn't in the street.

472
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:44,812
She was one step off
the fucking curb.

473
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:47,019
And you didn't take the pay-off.

474
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,328
Yeah. I said,
who the hell are you?

475
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:49,402
How do you know that?

476
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:51,147
Name's Butcher.

477
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:52,819
Billy Butcher.

478
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:56,153
Listen, I was thinking that, uh,

479
00:25:56,194 --> 00:26:00,074
you and me should have
a little bit of a chat.

480
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:03,579
Y-You're a Fed?

481
00:26:03,618 --> 00:26:05,408
You don't sound like a Fed.

482
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:07,253
What, I can't immigrate?

483
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:08,766
There's a giant green slapper
with her ass in the harbor

484
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,250
that says different.

485
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,477
You don't really look
like one, either.

486
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:13,341
No? What do I look like?

487
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:16,627
Like you're starring in
a porn version of The Matrix.

488
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:18,722
Well, it's all right there
in black and white.

489
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:21,548
Okay. Uh, what exactly
can I do for you?

490
00:26:21,594 --> 00:26:23,354
No, you got it all wrong,
Hughie.

491
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:25,257
It's what I can do for you.

492
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:27,176
You see, you ain't alone, son.

493
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:29,435
It happens a lot more
than you think.

494
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:32,727
Supes lose hundreds of people
each year to collateral damage.

495
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:34,862
No. Come on, that'd be
all over the news.

496
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:36,529
People would be screaming
bloody murder.

497
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,045
Yeah, look, there might be
the odd mention

498
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:39,569
of it now and again,
like with Robin,

499
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:41,173
but there's a fuck-sight more
that happens

500
00:26:41,197 --> 00:26:43,367
that just gets swept
right under the rug.

501
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:45,827
Why?

502
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:49,713
Ain't it obvious?

503
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:52,417
Movie tickets, merchandising,

504
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,918
theme parks, video games.

505
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:57,671
A multi-billion dollar
global industry supported

506
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:59,673
by corporate lobbyists

507
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:02,465
and politicians on both sides.

508
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,640
But the main reason
that you won't hear about it

509
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,810
is 'cause the public don't
want to know about it.

510
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,560
See, people love that cozy
feeling that Supes give them.

511
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:14,113
Some golden cunt

512
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:16,686
to swoop out of the sky
and save the day

513
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:19,282
so you don't got
to do it yourself.

514
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:22,358
But if you knew half the shit
they get up to...

515
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:25,025
Ooh...

516
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:27,124
Fuckin' diabolical.

517
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,289
But then...
that's where I come in.

518
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,170
Come in to... to do what?

519
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:37,708
Spank the bastards
when they get out of line.

520
00:27:37,753 --> 00:27:40,013
How do you spank a Supe?

521
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:42,047
Come on, son.

522
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:44,141
Uh, where?

523
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:45,546
You'll love it.

524
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:46,755
Uh, not likely.

525
00:27:46,804 --> 00:27:47,934
Uh, listen.

526
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:50,432
I think this is good; I'm good.

527
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:53,444
Uh, thank you for
an extremely weird conversation,

528
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:56,187
but, uh, I don't want to go
to a second location with you.

529
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,520
So, I'm gonna get back
to work.

530
00:27:58,566 --> 00:27:59,976
Thank you.

531
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:04,156
Hughie! Hughie.

532
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:08,487
This is your one and only, mate.

533
00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:11,584
Once I go, I'm gone.

534
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:14,541
I'm offering you the opportunity

535
00:28:14,582 --> 00:28:17,502
to get them that got your girl.

536
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:21,213
What have you got to lose

537
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:24,795
that you ain't already lost?

538
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:46,945
Where are we?

539
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:49,279
Keep your mouth shut.

540
00:28:50,785 --> 00:28:52,195
Harry.

541
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:53,794
Got your message.

542
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:56,289
Thank you for being
an upstanding citizen.

543
00:28:56,332 --> 00:28:58,292
You know this is fucking
police brutality, man.

544
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:01,424
You know what they'll do to me,
they catch me letting you in?

545
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:05,342
Not half of what I'll do
if you don't.

546
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:10,045
Did he just say
you were police?

547
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:13,016
Yeah, you know, cop, Fed,
all the same to twats like that.

548
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:26,855
Holy shit.

549
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:28,744
Pick your jaw up off the floor

550
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:30,411
and try to blend in.

551
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,239
This is the only place

552
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:35,714
where the Supes can scratch
their filthy little itch

553
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:37,996
without the paps taking snaps.

554
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:43,381
Wait, wait, wait.
That's Ezekiel.

555
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,927
The "Capes for Christ" guy...

556
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:51,299
preaches all that...

557
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:54,135
"pray the gay away" shit.

558
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:56,391
And now he's
the meat in the Manwich.

559
00:29:56,434 --> 00:29:59,274
Fucking hypocrite.

560
00:30:05,776 --> 00:30:07,276
Keep going forward.

561
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,950
That's it. Further.

562
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,120
Further.

563
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:13,368
There. There.

564
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:15,329
- Stop.
- Wait, wait, wait.

565
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:17,659
A-Train's...
A-Train's here right now?

566
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:19,995
Was. This is from last night.

567
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,671
Turn it up.

568
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:25,298
I cannot believe
you ran through a bitch.

569
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:27,917
You want to hear
something crazy?

570
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:30,795
I ran so fast
through this bitch

571
00:30:30,843 --> 00:30:33,053
that I swallowed
one of her molars.

572
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:36,345
Like a bug
on the fucking freeway.

573
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,730
Dude, that's nasty.

574
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:44,022
They're laughing.

575
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:47,315
Just... Like she's a joke.

576
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:51,611
They're fucking laughing.

577
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:00,081
So what are you
gonna do about it?

578
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:40,702
Oh, for Chrissakes.

579
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:43,286
Clean yourself up.

580
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:45,922
Never let them see you
like this.

581
00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:49,755
Translucent,

582
00:31:49,797 --> 00:31:51,797
you're a goddamn pervert.

583
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:55,756
Ah...

584
00:31:57,513 --> 00:32:00,103
Oh, uh...

585
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:02,271
I'll just go.

586
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:06,306
They're all like that?

587
00:32:06,355 --> 00:32:08,815
All of them?
Even Homelander?

588
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,244
Homelander's the exception.

589
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:14,278
He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke.

590
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:16,411
Man's a saint.

591
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:18,118
But the rest of 'em, yeah.

592
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,539
Pardon my French,
fuck those fuckers.

593
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:22,118
Here.

594
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:24,543
Have a shufti of that.

595
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:26,542
- What are these?
- That's the police log

596
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:29,044
the day that Robin got murdered.

597
00:32:29,086 --> 00:32:32,336
Couple of bar fights.
A few cars got nicked.

598
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:34,841
But you know
what's not in there?

599
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:37,604
No bank alarms going off.

600
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:39,886
No one charged
at Central Booking.

601
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,220
A-Train stopped
two bank robbers, my arse.

602
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:44,596
Someone's fucking
hiding something.

603
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:46,733
- Hiding what?
- Well, I don't know,

604
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,610
whatever dodgy shit
he was up to that night.

605
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:51,978
Why couldn't he stop?
I mean, what was in that bag?

606
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:54,026
You know?
Who was he running from?

607
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:56,609
- Or where was he running to?
- Bingo.

608
00:32:56,655 --> 00:33:00,405
Work that out, and we'll have
the fucker, I can smell it.

609
00:33:00,451 --> 00:33:02,291
Okay.

610
00:33:03,787 --> 00:33:05,997
Okay, so, um...

611
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,080
what can I do to help?

612
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:10,415
Here's what you do.

613
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:13,421
Ring Vought, tell 'em you'll
take the money, sign the NDA,

614
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:16,514
but only if A-Train's there
in person when you do it.

615
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,890
Why does A-Train need
to be there?

616
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:19,196
Then they'll take you
into The Seven Tower,

617
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,430
through security, mate,

618
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:22,431
- and then you're gonna plant a bug.
- A bug?

619
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:24,643
A bug. And we'll have
a little listen.

620
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:26,893
See what's really going on.

621
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:29,556
Okay, let me just... sorry,
let me just get this straight.

622
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:33,065
You want me to... you want me
to go to Seven Tower by myself,

623
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:35,398
and-and you want me
to plant a bug,

624
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:38,034
like I'm... what,
like I'm fuckin' James Bond?

625
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:40,662
- Yeah, exactly. You got it.
- You're FBI.

626
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:42,369
If you're FBI,
then get a warrant.

627
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:44,679
- Why do you... why do you even need me?
- Hughie, Hughie,

628
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:47,163
look, mate,
I got a warrant, all right?

629
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:49,876
But that place is firewalled,
untappable,

630
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,637
and locked up tighter
than a nun's knickers.

631
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:53,799
I couldn't get myself in there
in a million years.

632
00:33:53,837 --> 00:33:55,457
But you, son, you could do it.

633
00:33:55,506 --> 00:33:57,256
- No, no, I can't, okay?
- Yeah.

634
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,389
I can't. No. You didn't see
A-Train covered in...

635
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:01,596
And-and I'm, what, I'm
just supposed to go in there,

636
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:03,967
and I'm supposed to...
I'm supposed to shake his hand?

637
00:34:04,014 --> 00:34:06,024
- And smile?
- Yeah.

638
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:08,438
I'm not... Do you know
who my favorite musician is?

639
00:34:08,477 --> 00:34:10,227
- Who?
- James Taylor.

640
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:13,191
Number two, Simon & Garfunkel.
Number three, Billy Joel.

641
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:15,862
Any of those guys,
they don't infiltrate.

642
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:18,201
Okay? I'm not an infiltrator.

643
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:19,657
Hughie, Hughie,
fucking grow a pair.

644
00:34:19,697 --> 00:34:21,174
You heard that cunt
laughing at your girl.

645
00:34:21,198 --> 00:34:22,828
No. No. No.

646
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:25,116
No, I can't.
I can't do that.

647
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,290
I'm sorry,
I'm just gonna fuck it up,

648
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:29,289
and you're not
gonna have your bug...

649
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:31,331
...and I'll be dead.

650
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:34,881
I'm not... I'm not like you.

651
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:43,007
This is amazing, Madelyn.

652
00:34:43,053 --> 00:34:45,313
Thank you for this.
My kid is gonna lose his mind.

653
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:47,427
Ah, it is our pleasure.

654
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,394
Just do not sell it online.

655
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:53,146
All right.
What are you thinking?

656
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:54,858
Baltimore is a beautiful town.

657
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:57,608
But you've got a problem.

658
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:01,571
Your homicide rates
are up, what, 62%?

659
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:03,323
The police
are not closing cases.

660
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,218
You're on the verge
of needing a federal lifeline.

661
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:07,042
Cut to the chase, Madelyn.

662
00:35:07,077 --> 00:35:08,867
Who are you proposing?

663
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:11,502
Nubian Prince.

664
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,460
Fits your population's demo,

665
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,290
but not too militant.

666
00:35:15,336 --> 00:35:17,456
Caucasians love him,
too, with a...

667
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:19,594
59% approval rate.

668
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:23,841
I am willing to give you
a three-year exclusive contract

669
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:25,886
with full PR support,

670
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:28,559
and I'm gonna give you
nine and a half points

671
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,679
of the merchandising.

672
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:32,556
I thought he was in Detroit.

673
00:35:32,603 --> 00:35:34,653
Well, we're thinking
about making a move.

674
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:36,478
How much?

675
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:39,033
$300 million a year.

676
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,160
I know, I know,
it's a tough swallow.

677
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,909
But we both know that
your city needs a hero.

678
00:35:49,953 --> 00:35:53,043
$200 million for Nubian Prince.

679
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:55,462
- I can sell that.
- Mm.

680
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,051
I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

681
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:00,587
We've got Atlanta waiting
in the wings.

682
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:03,181
I think maybe you can.

683
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:04,837
And why is that?

684
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:10,311
I happen to know
about Compound V.

685
00:36:13,602 --> 00:36:15,232
What is Compound V?

686
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,150
It's the type of rumor

687
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:19,399
that could really tarnish
those heroes of yours.

688
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:21,031
Nobody wants that.

689
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:22,738
People need heroes.

690
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:25,568
Now, I can make sure
that that stays a rumor,

691
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:27,574
because I'm a friend.

692
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:30,866
But friendship
does cut both ways.

693
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:34,791
I'm sorry, Steve, I don't know
what you're talking about.

694
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:37,712
$300 million is the price,

695
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:40,341
or we go to Atlanta.

696
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:44,087
So, how amazing is it?

697
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,683
What's Homelander like?

698
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:47,587
Uh... he's busy.

699
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:50,056
I haven't really
met him yet, but...

700
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:54,015
Mom, I got to tell you
what happened.

701
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:55,849
Oh, I forgot.

702
00:36:55,894 --> 00:36:57,774
I was playing mah-jongg
with Patty and Trish,

703
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:00,023
and Patty is going on and on
about how her daughter

704
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:02,725
got into med school,
and I'm thinking, so what?

705
00:37:02,776 --> 00:37:04,696
My daughter got into The Seven!

706
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:08,406
Anyway, so-so,
what did you want to tell me?

707
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:12,622
Everything's great.

708
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:14,711
Just how we dreamed.

709
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:16,206
Um...

710
00:37:16,248 --> 00:37:18,828
Mom, actually, you know what?
I have to go.

711
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:20,786
All right. Bye, honey.

712
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,605
Um...

713
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,150
excuse me.

714
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,204
I'm sorry, a-are you okay?

715
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:49,027
Just seemed like a...

716
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:51,202
tough call.

717
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:53,041
Sorry.
I don't mean to bother you.

718
00:37:53,076 --> 00:37:54,446
No, no, it's okay.

719
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:55,655
Uh...

720
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:58,254
I'm fine.
I'm just...

721
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,710
I'm just having a bad day.

722
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:03,631
Yeah, me, too.

723
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,670
Uh... is it, like,
a-a work thing, or...

724
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:09,545
a-a life thing?

725
00:38:09,593 --> 00:38:12,553
It's a work thing.

726
00:38:13,722 --> 00:38:15,352
You?

727
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,480
Uh... life thing.

728
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:24,896
You know how you have this...

729
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:27,362
image of yourself?

730
00:38:28,403 --> 00:38:31,113
Like, I thought I was strong.

731
00:38:31,156 --> 00:38:33,116
You know?
Like, made of steel.

732
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:34,448
A fighter.

733
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:35,913
And...

734
00:38:35,953 --> 00:38:38,623
then I was faced
with this horrible situation

735
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:40,924
with this asshole...

736
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,708
and...

737
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:47,882
I just heard my mom's voice
in my head,

738
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:49,803
"Keep smiling,

739
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,431
the show must go on,"

740
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:55,639
and... I didn't fight.

741
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:58,981
And now I just feel sick.

742
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:02,017
Partly because I did it, but...

743
00:39:02,062 --> 00:39:04,062
mostly because...

744
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:10,744
...turns out I'm
not who I thought I was.

745
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:17,658
- Oh. Oh, I'm, um, sorry.
- Uh...

746
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:20,503
I-I didn't mean
to just dump all of that

747
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:24,329
- onto you.
- No, no, it's totally fine that you dumped. Um...

748
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:29,878
Listen, d-do you like your job?

749
00:39:29,923 --> 00:39:31,433
Oh.

750
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:33,966
It's the only thing
I've ever wanted.

751
00:39:34,011 --> 00:39:35,721
And it's a good job?

752
00:39:35,762 --> 00:39:38,642
Like, you're not
selling kids smack?

753
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:41,062
No, it's a great job.

754
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:43,811
I could help a lot of people.

755
00:39:43,854 --> 00:39:46,654
Thing is, I, um...

756
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,610
used to know this girl,

757
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:52,821
and we used to go skating
at Rockefeller,

758
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:54,743
and I'd be on the side

759
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:56,741
with this death grip
on the rails.

760
00:39:56,783 --> 00:40:00,293
She would just charge headfirst
into the middle of the rink.

761
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:03,669
And she wasn't... good.

762
00:40:03,707 --> 00:40:05,747
Like, she fell...

763
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:08,132
a lot...

764
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,630
but she was never scared.

765
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:16,971
And she always used to say:

766
00:40:17,012 --> 00:40:19,602
"Just 'cause you fall
on your ass doesn't mean

767
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,560
you have to stay there."

768
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,901
So you fell on your ass,
you know?

769
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:27,356
That's not who you are.

770
00:40:29,024 --> 00:40:31,284
So who are you?

771
00:40:37,324 --> 00:40:39,414
I'm a fighter.

772
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:43,122
I'm gonna fight.

773
00:40:44,164 --> 00:40:45,964
Yeah.

774
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:49,289
I'm gonna take
that son of a bitch's head

775
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:52,836
- clean off his body.
- Okay. Wow, that was...

776
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:54,551
Okay.

777
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:56,551
Cool.

778
00:40:56,593 --> 00:40:57,893
Little scary, but...

779
00:40:57,928 --> 00:40:59,928
but-but cool.

780
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:04,055
I'm-I'm Hughie, by the way.

781
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:05,891
Annie.

782
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:23,698
Okay, man. I'm in.

783
00:41:27,082 --> 00:41:29,582
Okay, it's ringing.

784
00:41:31,712 --> 00:41:33,132
Yeah, hello?

785
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:34,461
Hi. Hi.

786
00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:36,506
Yes, hello.
Hello, Mr. Friedman.

787
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,510
It's Hughie Campbell.
I got your message,

788
00:41:38,552 --> 00:41:40,352
and-and $45K, it's just...

789
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:43,517
it's just... it's bingo,
like, life-changing.

790
00:41:43,557 --> 00:41:47,477
Um, but I just need one thing
before I-I sign anything.

791
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,019
I need an apology

792
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:51,362
- from A-Train.
- Uh, he already apologized.

793
00:41:51,398 --> 00:41:53,318
Well, no, no, no.

794
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:54,938
No, he hasn't.
Yes, he sent his...

795
00:41:54,985 --> 00:41:58,025
he sent his regrets
and his sympathies on...

796
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,371
on TV, but I-I...

797
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:04,037
if I could just get
an apology face-to-face,

798
00:42:04,077 --> 00:42:05,697
that would be fantastic.

799
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:07,206
Just to... just for closure,

800
00:42:07,247 --> 00:42:09,497
just to put...
just to put a b-button on it.

801
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:11,461
Okay, yeah. But, uh...

802
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:13,461
Hugh, I'm telling you,
the answer's gonna be no.

803
00:42:13,503 --> 00:42:15,263
All right, in that...
in that case, can you

804
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:16,837
just give me... Uh, hello?

805
00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:18,592
I think... They hung up.

806
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:20,553
I don't think
they're gonna go for it.

807
00:42:20,594 --> 00:42:23,814
Hmm. Oh, yes, they will.

808
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:42,909
Starlight.

809
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:45,949
Don't want to be late
to your first official meeting.

810
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:49,785
I had a whole
welcome speech planned.

811
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:51,291
Sorry, sir.

812
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,083
Please, Homelander's fine.

813
00:42:53,126 --> 00:42:55,416
Beginning to wonder
if you'd even show up.

814
00:42:55,462 --> 00:42:57,092
I mean, all that pressure,

815
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,930
it's a lot
for anyone to swallow.

816
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,296
Yeah. Don't worry, I'll be fine.

817
00:43:02,344 --> 00:43:03,804
I'm here,

818
00:43:03,845 --> 00:43:06,965
and I'm not going anywhere.

819
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:11,746
Can we get back to this, please?

820
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:15,650
This is a serious crime.
These assholes pirated my movie

821
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,980
three weeks before release,

822
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:18,985
and you can't walk down
5th Avenue

823
00:43:19,027 --> 00:43:21,777
without bumping into a table
of unlicensed Homelander shirts.

824
00:43:21,822 --> 00:43:24,162
Copyright infringement
is costing Vought

825
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:25,869
$1.2 billion per year.

826
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:27,619
That's money out of our pockets.

827
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:29,501
We've all got, what,
four points each?

828
00:43:29,538 --> 00:43:31,158
What the fuck?

829
00:43:31,206 --> 00:43:33,706
You got four points?

830
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,840
And clearly better lawyers.

831
00:43:35,877 --> 00:43:38,507
Hey, hey, hey, guys, come on.

832
00:43:38,547 --> 00:43:40,127
Stop.

833
00:43:40,173 --> 00:43:42,013
What's Starlight gonna think?

834
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:45,010
Listening to us haggling
over nickels.

835
00:43:45,053 --> 00:43:48,103
We're The Seven, for God's sake.

836
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:51,179
Whether we're out there
or we're in here.

837
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:53,846
Now, what I do want to hear

838
00:43:53,895 --> 00:43:56,605
is who you saved this week.

839
00:43:56,648 --> 00:43:58,018
Huh?

840
00:43:58,066 --> 00:43:59,276
Who's up for that?

841
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:02,652
Black Noir.

842
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:05,452
Let's start with you, man.

843
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:13,327
Do you have a dog?

844
00:44:13,373 --> 00:44:14,753
No.

845
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,921
All right, give us your phone.

846
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,670
There's fuck-all security
to worry about.

847
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:20,672
In fact,
they're a bunch of muppets.

848
00:44:20,714 --> 00:44:22,724
And the metal detector
won't pick this up.

849
00:44:22,757 --> 00:44:25,177
Right? And what
they'll probably do is take you

850
00:44:25,218 --> 00:44:27,678
through the security
and then up into the boardroom.

851
00:44:27,721 --> 00:44:30,311
Sit down. Be nice, congenial.

852
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:33,638
Then, real polite-like, tell 'em
you're gonna take a fake shit.

853
00:44:33,685 --> 00:44:35,765
Go into the bog,
take the bug out.

854
00:44:35,812 --> 00:44:38,022
Peel back the plastic bit
to reveal the sticky side.

855
00:44:38,064 --> 00:44:41,154
Put the plastic bit in the bog.
Flush it.

856
00:44:41,192 --> 00:44:43,572
Then go back into the boardroom,

857
00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:45,492
sit down... big smiles...

858
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,490
plant the bug
underneath the table.

859
00:44:47,532 --> 00:44:49,332
Easy peasy Japanesey.

860
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:51,577
Bob's your uncle. That's that.

861
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,080
- That's that? That was... that was a lot.
- Yeah.

862
00:44:54,122 --> 00:44:56,434
Th... I've... Hold on, can you
just... can you repeat it again?

863
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:57,685
Just a little bit slower?
Because I...

864
00:44:57,709 --> 00:44:59,539
Shh. Listen.

865
00:44:59,586 --> 00:45:02,166
- Fuck.
- Hughie, calm down, all right?

866
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:04,843
This is like that scene
in The Matrix.

867
00:45:04,883 --> 00:45:08,473
Now, you could take
the fucking red pill, right?

868
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:10,561
Spend the rest of your life
jacking off,

869
00:45:10,597 --> 00:45:13,307
crying into your chai tea

870
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,690
green latte,
what the fuck. Or...

871
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:18,437
you could take the blue pill.

872
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,190
Or is it the red pill?
Anyway, take the other pill

873
00:45:21,232 --> 00:45:23,419
- and quit being a cunt.
- Which pill do you want me to take?

874
00:45:23,443 --> 00:45:25,363
Just quit being a cunt.
That's what I'm saying.

875
00:45:27,364 --> 00:45:29,074
Fuck me. Okay.

876
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:15,624
Sir, could you empty
your pockets, please?

877
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,650
Thank you.

878
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:14,096
Um...

879
00:47:14,137 --> 00:47:16,347
excuse me, can-can I, uh...

880
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:18,599
can I use your bathroom?

881
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,100
Just to be clear,
A-Train's apology

882
00:47:22,145 --> 00:47:24,855
isn't an admission of any sort
of culpability whatsoever.

883
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:25,898
Do you understand?

884
00:47:30,653 --> 00:47:31,714
I'm sorry about what
happened to your girlfriend,

885
00:47:31,738 --> 00:47:32,738
all right?

886
00:47:37,118 --> 00:47:38,698
Hey, dude, are you okay?

887
00:47:51,424 --> 00:47:52,804
Fine.

888
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:56,811
I appreciate the apology.

889
00:47:56,846 --> 00:47:59,136
Accidents happen, right?

890
00:47:59,182 --> 00:48:00,812
After all,

891
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,730
I mean,
you were saving the world.

892
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:05,149
Okay, great.
Thank you so much. As you know,

893
00:48:05,188 --> 00:48:06,916
a crimefighter's work is never
done. Douglas here will handle

894
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,360
the rest of the paperwork
for you, okay? Thank you.

895
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:16,618
Can I use your bathroom?

896
00:49:11,546 --> 00:49:14,836
What the fuck?

897
00:49:31,065 --> 00:49:33,685
And I look him right in the eye,
and I smile.

898
00:49:33,735 --> 00:49:35,855
And that was awesome, man,

899
00:49:35,904 --> 00:49:37,744
just getting to stare
that asshole down.

900
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,620
I get why you dig this job.

901
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:41,867
Yeah, you know, it has
its moments, doesn't it?

902
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:44,870
You were right.
Fuck A-Train.

903
00:49:44,913 --> 00:49:48,463
Fuck A-Train.
Fuck-fuck The Seven.

904
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:52,299
Fuck all... Seven.

905
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:54,207
What are we, uh...

906
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:56,215
what are we doing here?

907
00:49:56,257 --> 00:49:59,217
Well, you got to go
to work, don't you?

908
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,560
Yeah, but, um,
I don't, uh...

909
00:50:02,597 --> 00:50:07,017
Well, I mean, that's all
I need you for right now, yeah?

910
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:09,689
Yeah, I mean, but I-I can...

911
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:11,479
I can help with other stuff,
you know?

912
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:13,167
I could... I could be,
like, your tech guy.

913
00:50:13,191 --> 00:50:15,691
You know? Like, I could be
in the van with the thing

914
00:50:15,735 --> 00:50:17,630
and, like, you know, "He's down
the hall to the left."

915
00:50:17,654 --> 00:50:18,704
Like, I can...

916
00:50:18,738 --> 00:50:20,368
Yeah, look, son, I, uh...

917
00:50:20,406 --> 00:50:22,116
I think it's best
that I take it from here.

918
00:50:22,158 --> 00:50:23,958
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, but I-I can...

919
00:50:23,993 --> 00:50:25,543
I can really help.

920
00:50:25,578 --> 00:50:28,538
I know you can help.
I got it.

921
00:50:40,343 --> 00:50:42,303
Oh, w...
Oh, hey, wait.

922
00:50:44,347 --> 00:50:47,977
You ever see an asshole
tear up $45K?

923
00:50:50,645 --> 00:50:53,055
Hughie.

924
00:50:54,607 --> 00:50:57,687
You're a good lad.

925
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:15,592
Ms. Stillwell,
I wasn't sure you'd call.

926
00:51:15,628 --> 00:51:18,628
This fucking chafes, but, um...

927
00:51:18,673 --> 00:51:22,723
I'm willing to come down to
$230 million for Nubian Prince.

928
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,510
That's very reasonable, Maddie.
Thank you.

929
00:51:24,554 --> 00:51:28,984
And, Steve,
this, um, Compound V,

930
00:51:29,017 --> 00:51:31,477
any rumors you may have heard
about my heroes...

931
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:34,689
libelous and completely untrue.

932
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:36,521
But we all know
how rumors spread,

933
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:39,776
so... I'd appreciate
your discretion.

934
00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:41,109
Of course.

935
00:51:41,154 --> 00:51:42,284
You have my word.

936
00:51:42,322 --> 00:51:44,372
Thank you.

937
00:51:44,407 --> 00:51:47,617
Have a safe flight home.

938
00:51:49,704 --> 00:51:52,334
Policing cities is
a thorny enough issue as it is,

939
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:55,083
but allowing superheroes
into national defense?

940
00:51:55,126 --> 00:51:57,996
We'd basically be
privatizing war.

941
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,340
Good night, Hughie.

942
00:52:01,382 --> 00:52:03,012
You'll lock up?

943
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:04,341
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

944
00:52:04,385 --> 00:52:06,545
Thanks, Gary.

945
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:19,782
Sorry, we're closing up.

946
00:52:27,116 --> 00:52:28,406
Hello?

947
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:32,619
Who are you?

948
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:34,083
The fuck?

949
00:52:34,123 --> 00:52:36,503
Right in front of you, prick.

950
00:52:38,378 --> 00:52:40,588
You think I wouldn't find
this thing?

951
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,720
Hughie.

952
00:52:51,307 --> 00:52:53,887
You pussy, I followed you
from the fucking Tower.

953
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:56,395
No, no, no!

954
00:52:59,357 --> 00:53:01,687
Who's that guy you were with,
in the car?

955
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:03,114
- Who was he?!
- I don't...

956
00:53:03,152 --> 00:53:04,463
- He put you up to this?
- I don't know!

957
00:53:04,487 --> 00:53:05,947
He was just some Uber driver,
okay?

958
00:53:05,988 --> 00:53:08,408
Don't give me some bullshit!
Uber driver!

959
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:11,119
Do you think
I'm a fucking idiot?

960
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,290
- Why'd you plant the bug?
- Please.

961
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,540
Please, please, please.

962
00:53:15,581 --> 00:53:16,871
No, please.

963
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:18,496
We're The Seven,

964
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:20,463
Earth's most mighty,

965
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:23,383
champions of the innocent,

966
00:53:23,423 --> 00:53:25,053
motherfucker!

967
00:53:32,807 --> 00:53:35,387
Sorry about the mess.

968
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:39,515
You should fuck off, Hughie.

969
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:48,276
Hughie, run!

970
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:50,622
Well, well, well,

971
00:53:50,658 --> 00:53:53,448
if it ain't the invisible cunt.

972
00:54:22,064 --> 00:54:23,944
There you are.

973
00:54:52,386 --> 00:54:54,506
So who are you?

974
00:54:54,555 --> 00:54:57,345
Fucking spy?

975
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:59,941
For who? Huh?

976
00:54:59,977 --> 00:55:02,767
You're gonna fucking tell me,

977
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:05,613
or I'm gonna smash
your fucking scalp off!

978
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,440
Who the fuck are you?!

979
00:55:07,485 --> 00:55:09,485
I'll tell you who you are.

980
00:55:09,529 --> 00:55:11,989
A fucking moron.

981
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:15,951
"Translucent"
doesn't even mean "invisible."

982
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:18,753
It means "semi-transparent."

983
00:55:42,895 --> 00:55:45,815
Is he... is he dead?

984
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:47,816
Is he...

985
00:55:49,277 --> 00:55:50,987
Well, he ain't moving.

986
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:53,318
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.

987
00:55:53,364 --> 00:55:55,284
How'd you know the electric
could do the job?

988
00:55:55,324 --> 00:55:57,124
Skin's carbon.

989
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,949
Highly conductive.

990
00:55:58,995 --> 00:56:02,035
Saw it on, uh, Jimmy Fallon.

991
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:06,838
Would've taken me forever
to work that one out.

992
00:56:06,877 --> 00:56:08,207
Good job.

993
00:56:08,254 --> 00:56:09,554
Let's get him in the boot.

994
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:11,799
Wait, wait, what?
Wait, what? What?

995
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:13,841
The trunk.

996
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,153
No, no, I mean, what are we...
what are we...

997
00:56:15,177 --> 00:56:16,717
what are we doing with him?

998
00:56:16,762 --> 00:56:19,182
Well, Hughie, you just offed
one of The Seven, mate.

999
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:20,603
Me? I...

1000
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:23,481
You-you hit him
with a fucking car!

1001
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:25,859
Look, potato, fucking po-tah-to.

1002
00:56:25,896 --> 00:56:27,646
We're both in a shitload
of trouble.

1003
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,280
No, no, no, we're not!
It's... It...

1004
00:56:29,317 --> 00:56:31,777
He-he attacked us, okay?

1005
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:34,239
And you're-you're
a federal officer, you know?

1006
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,910
Just-just call the fucking FBI.

1007
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:38,739
Yeah, o-okay, so, look,

1008
00:56:38,784 --> 00:56:41,584
technically, I'm not a Fed.

1009
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,080
What?!

1010
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:49,165
Then who the fuck are you?!

1011
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:01,059
Don't worry about it, kiddo.
It's just a little turbulence.

1012
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:03,518
It'll be okay.

1013
00:57:18,449 --> 00:57:20,829
Whoa.

1014
00:57:20,868 --> 00:57:24,118
Dad. Dad. Dad!

1015
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:29,917
What's he doing out here?

1016
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,750
Are you guys friends?

1017
00:57:36,342 --> 00:57:37,972
Oh, my God.
