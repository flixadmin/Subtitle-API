Skip to the end!

161
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:29,512
See these? These are my
wilderness explorer badges.

162
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:31,646
You may notice one is missing.

163
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:34,065
It's my "Assisting
the elderly badge".

164
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,314
If I get it, I'll become a
senior wilderness explorer!

165
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:43,109
The wilderness
must be explored!

166
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:46,536
It's gonna be great!

167
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:49,532
There is a big ceremony
and all the dads come and...

168
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,284
we pin on our badges...

169
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:54,245
- So you wanna assist an old person.
- Yeah!

170
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,165
Then I'll be a senior
wilderness explorer!

171
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,711
- Have you ever heard of a "snipe"?
- "Snipe"?

172
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:03,386
A bird. Big eyes.

173
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,757
Every night it
sneaks into my yard

174
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,092
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

175
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,053
I'm elderly and infirm.

176
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,728
I can't catch it.

177
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:14,641
- If only someone could help me...
- Me, me, I'll do it!

178
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:16,976
I don't know, it's
awfully crafty.

179
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:19,229
You'd have to clap
your hands three times

180
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:20,320
to lure it in.

181
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:21,821
I'll find her,
mr. Fredricksen!

182
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:23,942
I think its burrow
is two blocks down...

183
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,485
Two blocks down. Got it!

184
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,413
Snipe! Here, snipie, snipie...

185
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,367
Bring it back here
when you find it!

186
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:33,910
Snipe!

187
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:39,624
And stop. Stop. Stop!

188
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,960
Hey, hey!

189
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:46,214
Hey, you! What do you
think you're doing?

190
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:47,774
I am so sorry, sir.

191
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,265
Don't touch that!

192
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,635
No, no, no, let me take
care of that for you.

193
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,809
Get away from our mailbox!

194
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:53,888
- Sir...
- I don't want you to touch that!

195
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:10,822
It looks bad.

196
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:34,095
<i><b>COURT SUMMONS</b></i>

197
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:43,938
Sorry, mr. Fredricksen.

198
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:47,150
You don't seem like
a public menace to me.

199
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,866
Take this.

200
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:51,821
The guys from "Shady Oaks" will be
by to pick you up in the morning, ok?

201
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,880
What do I do now, Ellie?

202
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:40,311
Good morning, gentlemen.

203
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:42,056
Good morning, mr. Fredricksen.

204
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:43,349
You're ready to go?

205
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:46,859
Ready as I'll ever be.

206
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:48,917
Would you do me the
favour and take this?

207
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:50,905
I'll meet you in the
van in just a minute.

208
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,695
I... wanna say one last
goodbye to the old place.

209
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,322
Sure. Take all the
time you need, sir.

210
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:05,204
That's typical. He's probably going
to the bathroom for the 80th time.

211
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:10,209
You'd think he'd take
better care of his house.

212
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,383
So long, boys!

213
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:57,548
I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

214
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:56,107
<i><b>SOUTH AMERICA</b></i>

215
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,012
We are on our way, Ellie.

216
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:37,395
Hi, mr. Fredricksen.

217
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,959
It's me, Russell.

218
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,451
What are you doing
out here, kid?

219
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:45,115
I found the snipe and I
followed it under your porch.

220
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,666
But this snipe had a long tail

221
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:50,579
and looked more
like a large mouse.

222
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,253
Please, let me in.

223
00:24:58,295 --> 00:25:01,465
No.

224
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:06,344
Aw, all right. You can...

225
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:08,472
come... in.

226
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,567
I've never been in a
floating house before.

227
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:24,488
Goggles...
Look at this stuff!

228
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,371
Are you going on a trip?

229
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:29,875
"Paradise Falls, a
land lost in time".

230
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,037
Are you going to South
America, mr. Fredricksen?

231
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,223
Don't touch that!
You'll soil it.

232
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:36,374
You know, most
people take a plane.

233
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,591
But you're smart,

234
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:39,669
because you have your
TV, clocks and stuff.

235
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:41,963
Ooo, is this how
you steer your house?

236
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:46,426
Does it really work?

237
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:51,223
This makes it turn right
and that way is left.

238
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:54,024
Hey, look! Buildings!

239
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,938
That building's so close,
I can almost touch it!

240
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:02,532
Wow, this is great!

241
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,618
You should try this,
mr. Fredricksen.

242
00:26:04,653 --> 00:26:07,781
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

243
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,700
Hey, I can see your
house from here!

244
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:13,578
Don't jerk around
so much, kid!

245
00:26:13,828 --> 00:26:17,297
Well, that's not gonna work.

246
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:20,710
I know that cloud,
it's a "cumulonimbus".

247
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,964
Did you know that
a cumulonimbus...

248
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,302
Aaa, I stayed up all night
blowing up ballons... for what?

249
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,263
That's nice, kid.

250
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:41,147
What are you doing over there?

251
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,317
Look!

252
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,246
See? Cumulonimbus.

253
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:33,033
My bag!

254
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:39,497
Got you!

255
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:18,495
Uuu, I thought you were dead.

256
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:22,464
What happened?

257
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:25,752
I steered us. I did
it! I steered the house.

258
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:27,218
You steered us?

259
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:29,923
After you tied your stuff
down, you took a nap.

260
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,218
So I went ahead and
steered us down here.

261
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,930
Yeah, sure.

262
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:48,948
I can't tell where we are.

263
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:50,742
O, we're in South
America all right.

264
00:28:50,777 --> 00:28:54,614
It was a singe. I used my
wilderness explorer GPS.

265
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,789
GP... what?

266
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:57,290
My dad gave it to me.

267
00:28:57,325 --> 00:29:01,871
It shows exactly where
we are on the planet.

268
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:06,626
With this baby
we'll never be lost!

269
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:10,505
Ups.

270
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:16,267
We'll get you down,
find a bus stop,

271
00:29:16,302 --> 00:29:19,597
and you'll just tell the man you
want to get back to your mother.

272
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:23,226
Sure, but I don't think they
have buses in Paradise Falls.

273
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:26,361
There, that ought to do it.

274
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:29,774
There, I'll give you some
change for the bus fare.

275
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,443
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

276
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:38,700
It's just gonna be like a billion
passes to get back to my house.

277
00:29:43,454 --> 00:29:44,998
Mr. Fredricksen,
how much longer?

278
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,538
Well, we're up pretty high.

279
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:50,044
It'll take hours to get down.

280
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:54,549
I think that was a
building or something.

281
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,226
What was that,
mr. Fredricksen?

282
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:02,056
We can't be close
to the ground yet.

283
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:11,899
Wait, no, no!

284
00:30:13,484 --> 00:30:14,944
Wait, wait!

285
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:22,076
Hang on!

286
00:30:34,255 --> 00:30:36,382
Pull back!

287
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:52,613
Where... where are we?

288
00:30:52,648 --> 00:30:56,861
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, mr. Fredricksen.

289
00:30:57,612 --> 00:31:02,909
Don't worry,
Ellie. I've got it.

290
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:31,437
There it is!

291
00:31:57,046 --> 00:32:00,383
Ellie, it's so beautiful!

292
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,683
We made it!

293
00:32:02,718 --> 00:32:06,430
We made it! Russell, we
can float right over there.

294
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:08,397
Climb up, climb up!

295
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:09,565
Do you mean... assist you?

296
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,686
- Yeah, whatever.
- Ok, I'll climb up!

297
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:19,151
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

298
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:30,830
When you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up.

299
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:33,749
Got it?

300
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:39,213
Are you on the porch yet?

301
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:47,562
What? That's it?

302
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:53,269
I came all this way here to get stuck
on the wrong end of this rock pile?

303
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:57,607
Ah... great.

304
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:02,862
Hey, if I could assist
you over there...

305
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,906
would you sign
up for my badge?

306
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:07,373
What are you talking about?

307
00:33:07,408 --> 00:33:09,577
We could walk your
house to the fall.

308
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:11,579
- Walk it?
- Yeah.

309
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:15,374
After all we weigh it down, we
could walk it right over there.

310
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:17,585
Like a parade balloon.

311
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:24,925
Now, we'll walk to the
falls quickly and quietly,

312
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,184
with no rap music
or flash dancing.

313
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:31,891
We have three days at best till the
helium leaks out of those balloons.

314
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,061
And if we are not at the
falls when that happens...

315
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,355
we're not getting
to the falls.

316
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,645
There... I found sand!

317
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,866
Don't you worry, Ellie.

318
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:44,153
We'll get our
house over there.

319
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:50,618
It is fun already, isn't it?

320
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,495
By the time we get there,

321
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:56,123
You're gonna feel so
assisted... Oh, mr. Fredricksen,

322
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:58,413
if we happen to get separated,

323
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:00,669
use the wilderness
explorer call.

324
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,926
Wait, why are we going
to Paradise Falls, again?

325
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:08,559
Hey, let's play a game.

326
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:12,264
It's called: "See who
can be quiet the longest".

327
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:14,600
Cool! My mom loves that game!

328
00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:20,916
Darn thing...

329
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:23,127
Come on, Russell, hurry it up.

330
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,084
Ah, I'm tired.

331
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,251
My knee hurts.

332
00:35:27,286 --> 00:35:29,383
Which knee?

333
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:33,721
My elbow hurts and I have
to go to the bathroom.

334
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,307
I asked you about
that five minutes ago.

335
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,953
I didn't have to go then!

336
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:43,564
I don't wanna walk anymore...

337
00:35:43,606 --> 00:35:46,615
Please, stop...

338
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,278
Russell, if you don't hurry
up, the tigers will eat you.

339
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,031
There are no tigers
in South America.

340
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:56,201
Zoology.

341
00:35:56,243 --> 00:35:59,413
Ah, for the love of Pete... Go on
into the bushes and do your business.

342
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:03,083
Ok. Here! Hold my stuff!

343
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,920
I've always
wanted to try this.

344
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:14,637
Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose
to dig the hole before or after?

345
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,932
That's none of my concern.

346
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:21,018
Oh, it's "before"!

347
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,152
Tracks?

348
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,078
Snipe.

349
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:35,956
Here, snipe.

350
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:38,118
Come on out, snipe.

351
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:40,537
Snipe!

352
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:03,394
Got you. Don't be
afraid, little snipe.

353
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,194
I am a wilderness explorer,

354
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:08,190
so I'm a friend
to all of nature.

355
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:12,945
Want some more?

356
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,322
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.

357
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:17,199
Come on out.

358
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,668
Come on. Come on...

359
00:37:21,703 --> 00:37:24,247
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

360
00:37:24,282 --> 00:37:26,792
Nice snipe. Good little snipe.

361
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:31,255
Nice giant... snipe!

362
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:37,594
I found the snipe.

363
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:40,229
Oh, did you?

364
00:37:40,264 --> 00:37:42,057
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes. They're very tall.

365
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:43,642
Do they have a lot of colors?

366
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,150
They do, indeed.

367
00:37:45,185 --> 00:37:47,688
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yeah...

368
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,983
Chocolate?

369
00:37:51,024 --> 00:37:53,235
What is that thing?

370
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,327
It's a snipe.

371
00:37:55,362 --> 00:37:57,948
There no such
thing as a snipe!

372
00:37:57,983 --> 00:38:00,909
But you said...

373
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:03,662
Go on, get out of here! Go!

374
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:15,681
Careful, Russell.

375
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:19,261
Look, mr. Fredricksen,
he likes me.

376
00:38:19,303 --> 00:38:22,806
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles!

377
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:25,517
Get out of here!
Go on! Get!

378
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:36,215
No, no, no. Kevin, it's ok.

379
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,454
Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

380
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:42,034
- Kevin?
- Yes, that's the name I just gave him.

381
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:44,390
Bit it, boo, scram!

382
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:46,580
Hey, that's mine!

383
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:53,545
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

384
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,797
Go on, bit it!

385
00:39:01,553 --> 00:39:03,937
Can we keep him? Please?

386
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:06,600
I'll get the food for him, I'll walk
him, I'll change his newspapers...

387
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,602
No.

388
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:11,361
An explorer is
a friend to all,

389
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:13,440
be it a plant, a
fish or a tiny mole.

390
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:15,859
That doesn't even rhyme.

391
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:17,819
Yeah, it does.

392
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,703
- Hey, look, Kevin.
- What?

393
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:22,699
Hey, get down from there!
You're not allowed up there!

394
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:29,623
You come down here right now!

395
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,961
Can you believe this, Ellie?

396
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,970
Ellie?

397
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:39,424
Hey, Ellie, can
I keep the bird?

398
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:42,010
Aha.

399
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:44,770
She said for you to let me.

400
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:47,182
But I told him
no. I told you no.

401
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:49,559
N
- o!

402
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:02,531
I see you, back there.

403
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:07,869
Go on, get out of here! Shoo! Go
annoy someone else for a while.

404
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:10,706
Hey, are you ok over there?

405
00:40:12,874 --> 00:40:16,253
Hello?

406
00:40:20,932 --> 00:40:24,109
Oh, hello, sir.
Thank Goodness.

407
00:40:24,144 --> 00:40:27,063
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

408
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:28,815
I can smell you.

409
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,074
What?

410
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:33,924
You can... smell us?

411
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,740
I can smell you.

412
00:40:43,872 --> 00:40:47,083
- Hey!
- You were talking to a rock.

413
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:50,295
Hey, that one
looks like a turtle.

414
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:52,672
Look at that one! That
one looks like a dog!

415
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:56,433
- Ah, it is a dog.
- What?

416
00:40:56,468 --> 00:41:00,388
We're not allowed to have
dogs in my appartment.

417
00:41:00,555 --> 00:41:04,079
Hey, I like dogs!

418
00:41:04,114 --> 00:41:07,569
We have your dog!

419
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:09,272
- I wonder whom he belongs to.
- Sit, boy.

420
00:41:09,307 --> 00:41:11,065
Hey, look, he's trained!

421
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,115
Shake.

422
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,006
Aha. Speak.

423
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,862
Hi, there.

424
00:41:16,362 --> 00:41:18,740
Did that dog just
say "Hi, there"?

425
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:20,658
Oh, yes!

426
00:41:20,784 --> 00:41:24,078
My name is Dug. I just
met you and I love you.

427
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:26,963
My master made me this collar.

428
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:30,418
He is a good and smart master
and he made me this collar

429
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:32,980
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

430
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:35,507
My master is good and smart.

431
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:36,806
It's not possible.

432
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:38,822
It is because my
master is smart.

433
00:41:38,857 --> 00:41:40,803
Hey, cool! What
do these do, boy?

434
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:43,563
<i>Would you cut...</i>

435
00:41:43,598 --> 00:41:46,935
<i>I'd use that collar... I
would be happy if you stopped.</i>

436
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,152
Russell, don't touch that.

437
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:51,112
It could be...
radioactive or something.

438
00:41:51,147 --> 00:41:53,483
I am a great tracker. My master
sent me on a special mission.

439
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:55,992
All by myself. Have
you seen a bird?

440
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:58,383
I want to find one and
I've been on a scent.

441
00:41:58,418 --> 00:42:00,740
I'm a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

442
00:42:02,575 --> 00:42:06,454
Hey, that is a bird. I have
never seen one up close,

443
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:07,962
but this is the bird.

444
00:42:07,997 --> 00:42:10,291
May I take your bird up
to camp as my prisoner?

445
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:11,841
Yes, yes, take it.

446
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:14,128
And on the way, learn how
to bark like a real dog.

447
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:15,887
I can bark.

448
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:18,049
And here's howling.

449
00:42:20,134 --> 00:42:23,513
Can we keep him, please?
Please, please, please?

450
00:42:23,548 --> 00:42:26,891
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

451
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:29,018
It's just a weird
trick or something.

452
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:31,187
Let's get to the fall.

453
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:36,317
Please, be my prisoner! Oh,
please oh, please, be my prisoner!

454
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:40,321
Oh, here it is! I picked
up the bird's scent!

455
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:42,407
Wait a minute, wait a
minute. What is this?

456
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,916
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

457
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:47,996
I'm getting prunes
and ginger cream.

458
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:49,295
Who are they?

459
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,965
Oh, man, the master
will not be pleased.

460
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,837
We'd better tell him someone
took the bird, right, Alfa?

461
00:42:56,004 --> 00:42:57,804
No.

462
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,758
Soon enough the bird
will be ours again.

463
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:01,808
Find the scent, my compadres,

464
00:43:01,843 --> 00:43:05,346
and you, too, shall have
much rewarding from the master

465
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:07,271
for the toil that you did.

466
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:11,769
Hey, Alfa, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

467
00:43:11,804 --> 00:43:14,737
You must have broken it.

468
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:18,901
Yeah. Your voice sounds funny.

469
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:20,069
Beta, Delta!

470
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:24,414
Perhaps you
desire... Squirrel!

471
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:26,951
Perhaps you desire to
challenge the right that

472
00:43:26,986 --> 00:43:29,454
I have been assigned by
my strength and cunning.

473
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:31,754
No, no. No.

474
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:34,688
But maybe Dug would.

475
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:37,587
You might wanna ask him.

476
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,506
I wonder if he's found the bird
on his "very special mission".

477
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:42,640
Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.

478
00:43:42,675 --> 00:43:46,137
His fool's errand will
keep him most occupied...

479
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:48,563
Most occupied, indeed.

480
00:43:48,598 --> 00:43:51,190
Do you not agree with that
which I'm saying to you now?

481
00:43:51,225 --> 00:43:56,147
Sure. But the second the master finds
out that you sent Dug out by himself,

482
00:43:56,182 --> 00:43:59,358
none of us will get a treat.

483
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,611
You're unwise, my
trusted lieutenant.

484
00:44:02,646 --> 00:44:05,152
This is Alfa. Calling
Dug. Come in, Dug.

485
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:07,658
<i>Hi, Alfa. Your
voice sounds funny.</i>

486
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:10,001
I know, I know!

487
00:44:10,036 --> 00:44:12,670
Have you seen the bird?

488
00:44:12,705 --> 00:44:14,832
<i>Oh, yes. The bird
is my prisoner now.</i>

489
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:17,084
Yeah, right.

490
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,969
Impossible. Where are you?

491
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:23,132
<i>I am here with the bird
and I will bring it back</i>

492
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,842
<i>and then you like
me. Oh, gotta go.</i>

493
00:44:24,877 --> 00:44:26,684
<i>Dug, who are you talking to?</i>

494
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:28,742
- Wait, wait!
- What is Dug doing?

495
00:44:28,777 --> 00:44:30,765
Why is he with
the small mailman?

496
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,888
Where are they?

497
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:34,993
There he is.

498
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:37,063
Come on!

499
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,403
Please, oh, please,
be my prisoner.

500
00:44:44,438 --> 00:44:46,954
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

501
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:48,866
That man over there
says I can take the bird.

502
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:50,743
And I love that man there
like he is my master.

503
00:44:50,785 --> 00:44:52,919
I am not your master!

504
00:44:52,954 --> 00:44:54,670
I am warning you
once again, bird!

505
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,666
- Hey, quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird!

506
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:58,918
At this rate we will
never get to the falls!

507
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,893
I am nobody's master, got it?

508
00:45:08,928 --> 00:45:11,222
I don't want you here
and I don't want you here!

509
00:45:11,257 --> 00:45:13,856
I'm stuck with you!

510
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:15,935
If you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

511
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:19,105
A ball! Oh, boy,
oh, boy, a ball!

512
00:45:19,146 --> 00:45:22,149
Ball? You want a ball?

513
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,945
Yes, I do! I ever
so want the ball!

514
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,702
Go get it!

515
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,990
Oh, boy, I will get it
and then bring it back!

516
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:31,867
Quick, Russell, give
me some chocolate.

517
00:45:31,902 --> 00:45:33,411
- Why?
- Just give to me!

518
00:45:33,446 --> 00:45:35,288
Bird! Bird!

519
00:45:35,413 --> 00:45:38,541
Come on, Russell.

520
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:42,044
Wait! Wait, mr. Fredricksen!

521
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:48,718
What are you doing?

522
00:45:52,805 --> 00:45:56,058
Hey, we're pretty far now.

523
00:45:56,093 --> 00:45:58,060
Kevin's gonna miss.

524
00:46:02,815 --> 00:46:06,444
I think that did the trick.

525
00:46:06,652 --> 00:46:09,113
Hi, master.

526
00:46:09,155 --> 00:46:11,574
Afternoon.

527
00:46:35,514 --> 00:46:39,810
Well, thanks for keeping
us dry, anyway, Ellie.

528
00:46:39,845 --> 00:46:42,396
Which one is the front?

529
00:46:42,438 --> 00:46:45,072
Well, boy...

530
00:46:45,107 --> 00:46:49,653
Is this step
three or step five?

531
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:51,906
There.

532
00:46:55,076 --> 00:46:59,455
All done. That's for you.

533
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:07,511
Well, tents are hard.

534
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:10,424
Wait, aren't you
super wilderness guy

535
00:47:10,459 --> 00:47:13,010
with the GPS and the badges?

536
00:47:13,045 --> 00:47:14,804
Yeah, but...

537
00:47:15,054 --> 00:47:18,063
Can I tell you a secret?

538
00:47:18,098 --> 00:47:21,108
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

539
00:47:21,143 --> 00:47:24,688
I never actually built a
tent before. There! I said it.

540
00:47:24,855 --> 00:47:27,775
You've been camping
before, haven't you?

541
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:30,868
Well, never outside...

542
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:34,365
Well, why didn't you ask
your dad how to build a tent?

543
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,535
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

544
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,496
Try him sometime, maybe
he'll surprise you.

545
00:47:40,531 --> 00:47:42,957
He's away alot, I
don't see him much.

546
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:44,632
He's gotta be home sometime.

547
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:48,969
I call, but Phyllis told
me I bug him too much.

548
00:47:49,004 --> 00:47:52,132
Phyllis? You call your own
mother by her first name?

549
00:47:52,216 --> 00:47:55,886
- Phyllis isn't my mom.
- Oh!

550
00:48:05,187 --> 00:48:08,983
But he promised he'd come
to my Explorers Ceremony

551
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:11,777
to pin on my "Assisting
the elderly badge".

552
00:48:12,236 --> 00:48:16,240
So he can show me how
about the tent then, right?

553
00:48:22,037 --> 00:48:25,548
Hey, why don't
you get some sleep?

554
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:29,503
We don't want to wake the
travelling flea circus.

555
00:48:31,505 --> 00:48:34,633
Dle Fredricksen, Dug says he
wants to take Kevin prisoner.

556
00:48:34,675 --> 00:48:38,512
We have to protect him.

557
00:48:41,515 --> 00:48:44,163
Can Kevin go with us?

558
00:48:44,198 --> 00:48:46,777
All right, he can come.

559
00:48:46,812 --> 00:48:49,148
Promise you won't leave him?

560
00:48:49,183 --> 00:48:50,322
Yeah.

561
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:54,403
Cross your heart?

562
00:48:58,615 --> 00:49:02,995
Cross my heart.

563
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:11,045
What have I got
myself into, Ellie?

564
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:35,069
Good morning, sweetheart.

565
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:39,281
We'd better get moving.

566
00:49:41,575 --> 00:49:46,372
The bird's gone. Maybe
Russell won't notice.

567
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:47,498
All right, everybody up!

568
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:50,250
Where's Kevin?
He's wondered off!

569
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:52,586
- Dug, find Kevin! Kevin!
- Find the bird, find the bird!

570
00:49:52,753 --> 00:49:55,637
Point!

571
00:49:55,672 --> 00:49:57,633
Oh, look! There he is...

572
00:49:59,009 --> 00:50:01,143
Point!

573
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:04,264
Hey, that's my roof!
Get off my roof!

574
00:50:04,299 --> 00:50:07,017
Yeah, get off of his WROOF!

575
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:13,614
What is he doing?

576
00:50:13,649 --> 00:50:15,859
The bird is calling
to her babies.

577
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:19,286
Her babies!

578
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:22,533
Kevin is a... girl?

579
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:26,370
Her house is over there,
on those twisty rocks.

580
00:50:26,662 --> 00:50:30,833
She's been gathering food for her
babies and must get back to them.

581
00:50:30,868 --> 00:50:33,919
Wait, Kevin is just leaving.

582
00:50:35,629 --> 00:50:39,014
But you promised
to protect her.

583
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:42,219
Her babies need her. We gotta
make sure they're together.

584
00:50:42,254 --> 00:50:45,264
Sorry, Russell. We've
lost enough time already.

585
00:50:46,306 --> 00:50:48,392
Yeah...

586
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:58,367
It was her favorite chocolate.

587
00:50:58,402 --> 00:51:03,407
Because you sent her
away, there's more for you.

588
00:51:05,284 --> 00:51:08,203
Kevin?

589
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:28,724
Where's the bird? You
said you had the bird!

590
00:51:28,759 --> 00:51:30,910
Oh, yes, oh, yes.
If I had said that,

591
00:51:30,945 --> 00:51:33,061
I can see how you
would think that.

592
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:34,187
Where is it?

593
00:51:34,229 --> 00:51:41,445
Oh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and
then I will again have the bird. Yes.

594
00:51:41,778 --> 00:51:45,573
You lost it. why do I not
have a surprised feeling?

595
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:49,428
Well, at least you now
have led us to the small

596
00:51:49,463 --> 00:51:53,248
mailman and to the one
that smells as prunes.

597
00:51:53,332 --> 00:51:56,126
The master will be most
pleased we have found them.

598
00:51:56,161 --> 00:51:57,794
He will ask them
many questions. Come.

599
00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:00,631
Wait! We're not
going with you.

600
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:02,257
We're going to the fall.

601
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:06,511
Get away from me!

602
00:53:05,362 --> 00:53:06,613
Down!

603
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:17,749
You came here... in that?

604
00:53:17,784 --> 00:53:19,167
Yeah.

605
00:53:20,043 --> 00:53:24,005
In a house? A floating house?

606
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:35,350
That is the darnest
thing I've ever seen!

607
00:53:35,385 --> 00:53:38,360
You're not after
my bird, are you?

608
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:42,774
But if you need to borrow a cup
of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige!

609
00:53:46,945 --> 00:53:49,447
Well, this is all
a misunderstanding.

610
00:53:49,482 --> 00:53:51,498
My dogs made a mistake.

611
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:54,536
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

612
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:57,462
Well... yes.

613
00:53:57,497 --> 00:53:59,603
The Charles Muntz?

614
00:53:59,638 --> 00:54:01,710
Adventure's out there!

615
00:54:01,745 --> 00:54:03,468
It's really him!

616
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:05,714
That's Charles Muntz!

617
00:54:05,749 --> 00:54:06,847
It is?

618
00:54:06,882 --> 00:54:08,675
Who's Charles Muntz?

619
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,724
Him!

620
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:13,847
Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
I, we were your biggest fans.

621
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:18,143
Oh, well, you're a
man of good taste.

622
00:54:18,393 --> 00:54:21,396
Now you must be tired. Hungry?

623
00:54:21,646 --> 00:54:25,358
Atention, everyone! These
people are no longer intruders.

624
00:54:25,393 --> 00:54:27,152
They are our guests.

625
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:29,035
Yeah!

626
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:33,533
All right! I like
you temporarily.

627
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:37,627
I will not bite you.

628
00:54:37,662 --> 00:54:40,582
The small mailman
smells like chocolate!

629
00:54:40,617 --> 00:54:42,924
I'm sorry about the dogs,

630
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:45,468
I hope they weren't
too... rough on you.

631
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:50,759
Go ahead and pull your
airship right next to mine.

632
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,642
We are not actually going inside
the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?

633
00:54:58,677 --> 00:55:01,770
Oh, would you like to?

634
00:55:01,805 --> 00:55:04,356
Would I?

635
00:55:04,731 --> 00:55:07,337
Wait up, mr. Muntz!

636
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:09,909
Jiminy Cricket!

637
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:12,078
- Not you!
- What do we do with Dug?

638
00:55:12,113 --> 00:55:15,659
He lost the bird. Put him
in "the cone of shame".

639
00:55:18,995 --> 00:55:23,375
I do not like "the
cone of shame".

640
00:55:24,834 --> 00:55:27,712
Most of the collection is housed
in the world's top museums:

641
00:55:27,747 --> 00:55:30,096
New York, Münich, London.

642
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:32,759
Of course, I kept
the best for myself.

643
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:35,550
Did you ever. Look at that!

644
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:38,271
Oh, yes. The Arseloterium.

645
00:55:38,306 --> 00:55:41,142
The beast charged while
I was brushing my teeth.

646
00:55:41,177 --> 00:55:42,352
I used my shaving
kit to bring it down.

647
00:55:42,477 --> 00:55:45,987
Oh, yeah, now, surprise me.

648
00:55:46,022 --> 00:55:48,358
The only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time was

649
00:55:48,393 --> 00:55:50,652
to have it declared
technical weapon.

650
00:55:52,654 --> 00:55:55,323
Oh, my Gosh! The giant
Somalian Labradodis!

651
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:57,780
Oh, you recognize
it? I'm impressed!

652
00:55:57,815 --> 00:56:00,203
There's an interesting
story there.

653
00:56:00,238 --> 00:56:02,535
Excellent choice.

654
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,833
I found it on safari,

655
00:56:04,868 --> 00:56:06,466
with Roosevelt.

656
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:10,380
He and I fell into a habit of
playing Gin Rummy in the evenings

657
00:56:10,415 --> 00:56:12,649
and did he cheat!

658
00:56:12,684 --> 00:56:14,884
He was horrible.

659
00:56:17,262 --> 00:56:18,763
Master, dinner is ready.

660
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:20,230
Oh, dear, broken translator.

661
00:56:20,265 --> 00:56:24,102
I think it's that
loose wire again.

662
00:56:24,227 --> 00:56:26,271
- There you go, big fellow.
- Thank you, master.

663
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:29,649
I liked his other voice.

664
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:31,818
Well, dinner is served.

665
00:56:31,853 --> 00:56:33,361
Right this way.

666
00:56:33,528 --> 00:56:37,372
So, how are
things States side?

667
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:40,493
Almost tempted to
go back a few times.

668
00:56:41,286 --> 00:56:44,017
But I have
unfinished work here.

669
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:46,714
Please! I hope you're hungry.

670
00:56:46,749 --> 00:56:51,254
Because Epsilon is the
finest chef I've ever had.

671
00:56:56,843 --> 00:56:59,053
Epsilon, you've done it again!

672
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:00,096
Yeah!

673
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,731
Hey! Hey!

674
00:57:03,766 --> 00:57:07,353
My Ellie would have
loved all these.

675
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:09,835
You know, because of
you she had this dream

676
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,469
to come down here
and live by the fall.

677
00:57:12,504 --> 00:57:15,034
I'm honored. And
now you've made it.

678
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:17,822
You sure we're not a
bother? I'd hate to impose.

679
00:57:17,857 --> 00:57:20,158
No, no, it's a
pleasure to have guests.

680
00:57:20,193 --> 00:57:21,826
A real treat.

681
00:57:21,861 --> 00:57:23,084
Treat?

682
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,330
Where's my treat?
I want my treat!

683
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:28,006
Hey!

684
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:29,500
I shouldn't have
used that word.

685
00:57:29,535 --> 00:57:31,843
Having guests is a delight!

686
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:36,674
More often I get thieves trying
to steal what is rightfully mine.

687
00:57:36,709 --> 00:57:37,884
No...

688
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:43,097
They called me
a fraud, those...

689
00:57:44,182 --> 00:57:48,561
But once I bring back this
creature, my name will be cleared.

690
00:57:48,603 --> 00:57:51,981
Beautiful, isn't it?

691
00:57:54,692 --> 00:57:57,028
Oh, I've spent a
lifetime tracking it.

692
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,699
Sometimes, years go by

693
00:58:01,734 --> 00:58:03,583
between seeings.

694
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:08,665
I've tried to smoke it out of
that death land where it lives.

695
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,007
Can't go in after it.

696
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:13,962
Once in, there's no way out.

697
00:58:13,997 --> 00:58:17,263
I lost so many dogs.

698
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:23,179
Here they come tnose bandits who
think the bird is theirs to take!

699
00:58:27,058 --> 00:58:30,978
is a very dangerous place.

700
00:58:31,187 --> 00:58:35,948
Hey, that looks like Kevin!

701
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:38,986
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird!

702
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:40,905
I trained it to follow us.

703
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,247
Follow you?

704
00:58:43,282 --> 00:58:45,305
Impossible. How?

705
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,356
She likes chocolate.

706
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:49,337
- Chocolate?
- Yeah.

707
00:58:49,372 --> 00:58:50,748
I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes wild about it.

708
00:58:50,783 --> 00:58:53,560
But it ran off.

709
00:58:53,595 --> 00:58:56,337
Let's go now.

710
00:58:59,257 --> 00:59:02,809
You know, Carl...

711
00:59:02,844 --> 00:59:06,431
these people who
pass through here

712
00:59:11,269 --> 00:59:13,938
A surveyor making a map...

713
00:59:14,355 --> 00:59:18,317
a botanist
cataloguing plants...

714
00:59:19,902 --> 00:59:26,117
an old man taking his
house to Paradise Falls.

715
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:37,253
That's the best one yet, I
can't wait to hear how it ends.

716
00:59:45,761 --> 00:59:49,807
Well, it's been a wonderful
evening, but we'd better be going.

717
00:59:49,842 --> 00:59:51,816
You're not leaving.

718
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:55,313
We don't want to take
advantage of your hospitality.

719
00:59:55,348 --> 00:59:56,571
Come on, Russell.

720
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:58,608
But we haven't even
had dessert yet.

721
00:59:58,643 --> 01:00:01,277
Oh, the boy is right.

722
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:02,910
You haven't had dessert.

723
01:00:02,945 --> 01:00:06,490
Epsilon here makes a
delicious cherries jubilee.

724
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:10,765
You really must
stay! I insist!

725
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,664
We have so much
more to talk about!

726
01:00:18,044 --> 01:00:19,295
Kevin?

727
01:00:26,177 --> 01:00:28,930
It's near.

728
01:00:29,722 --> 01:00:31,891
Get them!

729
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:35,999
- Hurry!
- Kevin!

730
01:00:36,034 --> 01:00:38,439
Hurry! Dogs! Hurry!

731
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:42,526
Master! Over here!

732
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:46,113
Here!

733
01:00:58,376 --> 01:01:01,295
Go on, master!

734
01:01:21,983 --> 01:01:25,111
Left!

735
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:31,367
Russell!

736
01:01:36,747 --> 01:01:37,790
Get back!

737
01:01:41,127 --> 01:01:44,422
Go on, master! I
will stop the dogs!

738
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:47,341
Stop, you, dogs!

739
01:02:14,952 --> 01:02:18,164
Help!

740
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:27,548
Give me your hand!

741
01:02:38,225 --> 01:02:42,897
Hang on to Kevin!

742
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:15,179
Kevin!

743
01:03:36,742 --> 01:03:39,036
No, no, no. Kevin...

744
01:03:39,161 --> 01:03:40,878
Stay down.

745
01:03:40,913 --> 01:03:43,540
She's hurt real bad.

746
01:03:43,582 --> 01:03:46,043
Can't we help her get home?

747
01:03:56,512 --> 01:04:00,224
All right. But we gotta hurry.

748
01:04:05,729 --> 01:04:08,364
- You lost them?
- No, it was Dug.

749
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:13,988
Yeah, he's with them.
he helped them escape!

750
01:04:14,023 --> 01:04:16,907
Wait. Wait a minute.

751
01:04:16,949 --> 01:04:18,075
Dug.

752
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:27,292
- See anything?
- No, my pack is not following us.

753
01:04:27,327 --> 01:04:29,003
Boy, they are dumb!

754
01:04:29,038 --> 01:04:31,929
This is crazy.

755
01:04:31,964 --> 01:04:34,633
I finally meet my chidlhood
hero and he's trying to kill us.

756
01:04:34,668 --> 01:04:36,093
- What a joke.
- Hey, I know a joke!

757
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:37,977
A squirrel walks up
up to a tree and says:

758
01:04:38,012 --> 01:04:41,640
"I forgot to store acorns
for winter and now I am dead".

759
01:04:42,016 --> 01:04:44,476
It is funny because
the squirrel gets dead.

760
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:48,126
Careful, Russell.

761
01:04:48,161 --> 01:04:50,733
You ok, Kevin?

762
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:57,997
You know what,
mr. Fredricksen?

763
01:04:58,032 --> 01:05:01,201
The wilderness isn't
quite what I expected.

764
01:05:01,236 --> 01:05:03,162
Yeah? How so?

765
01:05:03,328 --> 01:05:05,713
It's kind of... wild.

766
01:05:05,748 --> 01:05:08,959
I mean, it's not how they
made it sound in my book.

767
01:05:08,994 --> 01:05:11,260
Get used to that, kid.

768
01:05:11,295 --> 01:05:13,526
My dad made it sound so easy.

769
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:15,723
He is really good at camping,

770
01:05:15,758 --> 01:05:18,886
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff...

771
01:05:18,921 --> 01:05:22,344
He used to come to all
my squad lodge meetings.

772
01:05:22,379 --> 01:05:25,595
And afterwards, we go
get icecream that fattens.

773
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,812
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.

774
01:05:28,847 --> 01:05:31,822
Then we sit on this
one curve, right outside

775
01:05:31,857 --> 01:05:35,569
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones

776
01:05:35,604 --> 01:05:41,492
and whoever gets
the most wins.

777
01:05:42,576 --> 01:05:46,100
I like that curve.

778
01:05:46,135 --> 01:05:49,590
It might sound boring,

779
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:53,629
but I think the boring stuff is
the stuff I remember the most.

780
01:06:01,345 --> 01:06:04,973
Look, there it is!

781
01:06:05,432 --> 01:06:08,519
Hold on, Russell, stand still.

782
01:06:18,028 --> 01:06:21,698
Look at that bird go! Wait
up, you overgrown chicken!

783
01:06:23,158 --> 01:06:26,119
That's it! Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

784
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:34,086
Run, Kevin, run!

785
01:06:34,753 --> 01:06:37,005
Oh, no!

786
01:06:41,134 --> 01:06:44,888
Russell, dã-mi cuþitul tãu!

787
01:06:45,347 --> 01:06:48,308
Get away from my bird!

788
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:15,669
No!

789
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:24,011
No!

790
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:33,270
Careful, I want it in good
shape for my retirement.

791
01:07:34,563 --> 01:07:36,732
Let it go!

792
01:07:36,773 --> 01:07:38,650
Stop!

793
01:07:41,987 --> 01:07:44,531
Kevin!

794
01:07:57,044 --> 01:08:00,505
You gave away Kevin.

795
01:08:00,547 --> 01:08:04,843
You just... gave her away.

796
01:08:04,885 --> 01:08:08,472
This is none of my concern.

797
01:08:08,507 --> 01:08:12,059
I didn't ask for any of these!

798
01:08:14,686 --> 01:08:17,459
Master, it's all right.

799
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:20,198
I am not your master!

800
01:08:20,233 --> 01:08:23,528
If you hadn't shown up, none
of these would have happened.

801
01:08:23,563 --> 01:08:26,281
Bad dog, bad dog!

802
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:36,965
Whether you assist me or not,

803
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,587
I am going to Paradise
Falls, if it kills me!

804
01:09:53,118 --> 01:09:55,078
Here.

805
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,372
I don't want this anymore.

806
01:13:37,175 --> 01:13:40,386
Russell?

807
01:13:41,429 --> 01:13:45,850
- Russell!
- I'm gonna help Kevin

808
01:13:45,885 --> 01:13:48,745
even if you won't!

809
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,606
No, Russell, no!

810
01:15:03,928 --> 01:15:05,179
Russell?

811
01:15:08,683 --> 01:15:11,644
I was hiding under your
porch because I love you.

812
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,277
Can I stay?

813
01:15:13,312 --> 01:15:15,565
Can you stay? Well,
you're my dog, aren't you?

814
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,167
And I'm your master.

815
01:15:17,202 --> 01:15:18,699
You're my master?

816
01:15:18,734 --> 01:15:21,487
- Oh, boy!
- Good boy, Dug!

817
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:23,489
You're a good boy!

818
01:15:49,181 --> 01:15:50,224
Yes!

819
01:15:52,101 --> 01:15:54,270
Don't worry, Kevin,
I'll save you.

820
01:16:03,112 --> 01:16:05,162
And they wouldn't believe me.

821
01:16:05,197 --> 01:16:08,117
Just wait till they
get a look at you!

822
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:09,000
Master.

823
01:16:09,035 --> 01:16:12,121
The small mailman
has returned.

824
01:16:12,156 --> 01:16:13,998
What?

825
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,750
Let me go!

826
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:18,586
Where is your elderly friend?

827
01:16:18,669 --> 01:16:22,680
He's not my friend anymore.

828
01:16:22,715 --> 01:16:26,469
If you're here, Fredricksen
can't be far behind.

829
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:29,847
Where are you keeping Kevin?

830
01:16:29,972 --> 01:16:32,440
Let me go!

831
01:16:32,475 --> 01:16:34,692
Scream all you
want, small mailman.

832
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:37,028
None of your mailmen
friends can hear you.

833
01:16:37,063 --> 01:16:43,069
I will unleash all my
wilderness explorer training!

834
01:16:43,986 --> 01:16:46,739
Alfa, Fredricksen
is coming back!

835
01:16:46,774 --> 01:16:49,081
Guard that bird.

836
01:16:49,116 --> 01:16:51,327
If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

837
01:16:51,369 --> 01:16:53,537
Where are you going? I'm
not finished with you!

838
01:16:53,572 --> 01:16:55,164
Nice talking with you.

839
01:17:00,795 --> 01:17:03,964
Where are you, Fredricksen?

840
01:17:18,104 --> 01:17:20,502
Help!

841
01:17:20,537 --> 01:17:22,900
Russell!

842
01:17:35,454 --> 01:17:39,166
- Dle Fredricksen!
- Dug, bring her over!

843
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:42,419
You came back for
Kevin! Let's go get her!

844
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:44,637
I'm getting Kevin.
You stay here.

845
01:17:44,672 --> 01:17:48,175
- But I wanna help!
- I don't want your help.

846
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:51,095
I want you safe.

847
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:58,227
How do we get pass these dogs?

848
01:17:58,262 --> 01:18:00,604
Point!

849
01:18:10,823 --> 01:18:11,866
Kevin!

850
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,292
Don't worry, Kevin.
We are on our way.

851
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:18,873
No one should be enterring
through these doors.

852
01:18:18,908 --> 01:18:22,293
Guard well that
bird, my minions.

853
01:18:22,328 --> 01:18:25,713
What do we do now, Dug?

854
01:18:36,223 --> 01:18:39,727
Who wants the ball?

855
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:41,896
Me, me, me!

856
01:18:45,107 --> 01:18:46,859
Go get it!

857
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:53,449
I got it!

858
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:00,080
I'm sorry, Kevin. Let's
get you out of here.

859
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:02,541
- Master, he's gone.
- What's going on?

860
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:05,044
- He's got the bird!
- He ran off!

861
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:07,004
Calm down! One at the time!

862
01:19:10,966 --> 01:19:14,094
I want to... help!

863
01:19:27,566 --> 01:19:34,198
Does anybody know
where they are?

864
01:19:44,124 --> 01:19:49,213
Rais leaders! Bring
down that house!

865
01:19:52,966 --> 01:19:56,393
Raid leader! Checking in!

866
01:19:56,428 --> 01:20:01,141
- Raid two, checking in.
- Raid three, checking in.

867
01:20:01,183 --> 01:20:04,561
Target sighted.

868
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:14,196
Come on, Kevin.

869
01:20:26,834 --> 01:20:30,921
Hi.

870
01:20:55,154 --> 01:20:58,824
Any last words, Fredricksen?

871
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:01,410
Come on, spit it out!

872
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:03,971
Come on!

873
01:21:04,006 --> 01:21:06,463
Enough!

874
01:21:06,498 --> 01:21:10,043
You cannot leave
this place alive!

875
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:13,630
You're dead!

876
01:21:36,862 --> 01:21:40,365
Come on, Kevin.

877
01:21:58,383 --> 01:22:01,678
I'll have plenty of enjoyment
for what I'm about to do to you.

878
01:22:07,893 --> 01:22:11,355
He wears the cone of shame!

879
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:15,567
Not just continue
sitting! Atack!

880
01:22:18,528 --> 01:22:21,573
No! No! Stop your laughing!

881
01:22:21,608 --> 01:22:24,785
Listen, you, dog, sit!

882
01:22:24,826 --> 01:22:27,586
Yes, Alfa.

883
01:22:27,621 --> 01:22:31,833
Alfa? I am not
Alfa, he is... Oh!

884
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:34,795
I can't do it.

885
01:22:36,713 --> 01:22:40,926
Russell...

886
01:22:42,135 --> 01:22:44,554
You leave mr.
Fredricksen alone!

887
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:04,533
- Hey! Squirrel!
- Squrrel? Where?

888
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:15,502
I hate squirrels!

889
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:35,564
- Dug!
- Master!

890
01:23:35,772 --> 01:23:38,942
Russell, over here!

891
01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:42,320
Let's go!

892
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:48,389
Mr. Fredricksen!

893
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:51,788
Come on, Kevin.

894
01:24:03,175 --> 01:24:07,429
No!

895
01:24:19,191 --> 01:24:22,110
Russell, get out of there!

896
01:24:25,155 --> 01:24:27,866
Leave them alone!

897
01:24:41,671 --> 01:24:45,592
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go! Grab on to him!

898
01:24:48,053 --> 01:24:51,223
Kevin! Cihcolate!

899
01:25:11,534 --> 01:25:15,288
That was cool!

900
01:25:15,997 --> 01:25:19,376
Don't jerk around
so much, kid.

901
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,878
Easy, Russell.

902
01:25:22,837 --> 01:25:25,215
Oh, I am ready
to not be up high.

903
01:25:48,571 --> 01:25:51,449
Sorry about your
house, mr. Fredricksen.

904
01:25:53,159 --> 01:25:56,913
You know... It's just a house.

905
01:26:03,962 --> 01:26:07,090
Look at you! You're so soft!

906
01:26:10,343 --> 01:26:13,513
I wish I could keep one.

907
01:26:16,224 --> 01:26:19,269
Where is my cane?
I just had it here.

908
01:26:27,527 --> 01:26:30,739
You know what? Keep them. A
little gift from me to you.

909
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:33,700
Bye, Kevin!

910
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:45,336
- Ready?
- Ready.

911
01:26:56,598 --> 01:27:00,185
By receiving these badges,
the following explorers

912
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:03,271
will graduate to
Senior Explorers.

913

For Extreme
Mountaineering Lore.

914
01:27:05,683 --> 01:27:06,948
Congratulations, Jimmy.

915
01:27:06,983 --> 01:27:10,069

Defensive Arts,

916

Congratulations, Brendan.

917
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:15,158
For Assisting the Elderly...

918
01:27:15,825 --> 01:27:19,078
Russell.
Is there someone...

919
01:27:21,289 --> 01:27:26,127
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

920
01:27:26,169 --> 01:27:29,721
I'm here for him.

921
01:27:29,756 --> 01:27:33,551
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

922
01:27:33,593 --> 01:27:37,312
Russell, for
assisting the elderly

923
01:27:37,347 --> 01:27:42,227
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

924
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:48,024
I would like to award you the
highest honor I can bestow.

925
01:27:48,107 --> 01:27:52,737
<i><b>"The Ellie badge".</b></i>

926
01:28:00,745 --> 01:28:04,958
I think that covers everybody.
so let's give a big exlorer call

927
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:08,336
to our brand new Senior
Wilderness Explorers!

928
01:28:08,371 --> 01:28:11,881
Ready everybody?

929
01:28:18,972 --> 01:28:22,371
- Blue one.
- Red one.

930
01:28:22,406 --> 01:28:25,770
- Blue one.
- Gray one.

931
01:28:26,271 --> 01:28:28,112
- Red one.
- That's a bike.

932
01:28:28,147 --> 01:28:32,443
- It's red, isn't it?
- Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating!

933
01:28:32,485 --> 01:28:36,239
- No, I'm not. Red one.
- That's a fire hydrant.

934
01:28:36,274 --> 01:28:39,655
Maybe I need a few lessons.

935
