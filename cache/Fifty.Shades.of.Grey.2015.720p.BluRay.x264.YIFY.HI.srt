That was in your questions.

Why would you do that to me?

175

Because whenever
he's in the society pages,

176
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,761
he's never been photographed with a woman.
So, naturally...

177

Well, maybe he just wants to keep
his private life private, Kate.

something different.

1323
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,939
Although, I think
that Elliot's trying to poach him.

1324
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:53,192
They've sparked
quite the bromance.

1325
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,860
He's a cool guy.

1326
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,529
Ana, where is your family from?

1327
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:00,908
My stepfather lives in Montesano,
and my mom's in Georgia.

1328
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,701
Georgia? Which part?

1329
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,036
Savannah.

1330
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:05,287
How nice.

1331
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:08,415
Although, I do hear it gets rather
humid in Georgia this time of year.

1332
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,875
Oh, my God, it does.

1333
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:12,044
It's stifling sometimes.

1334
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:14,088
Actually, I'm going
to visit her tomorrow.

1335
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,048

1336
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:17,716
You hear that, Christian?

1337
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:21,303
Some children do visit
their parents now and again.

1338

Hey, Dad, you catch
the Mariners game?

1339
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,164
Uh, I heard it went
to extra innings.

1340

01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,630
Why can't we sleep
in the same bed?

1362

Why won't you let me touch you?

1363
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:44,178
Why does it have
to be like this?

1364
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,311
If you would just
sign the contract,

1365
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,437
you wouldn't have
to think about...

1366
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,601
Why do you care so much
about the contract, Christian?

1367
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,733
Don't you like me the way I am?

1368
01:34:57,984 --> 01:34:59,234
Of course I do.

1369
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:01,320
Then why are you
trying to change me?

1370
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,322
I'm not.

1371
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,574
It's...

1372
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:08,660
I need more. I want more.

1373
01:35:09,829 --> 01:35:11,538

1374

1376
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:22,341
It's you that's changing me.

1377
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:25,969
Let me touch you.

1378

Let me.

1379
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,570
Are they burns?

1380
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:47,032
I had a rough start in life.

1381
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,700
That's all you need to know.

1382
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,371
Okay.

1383
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:17,396
The woman that gave birth to me

1384
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:20,274
was a crack addict

1385
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:23,235
and a prostitute.

1386
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:29,408
She died when I was four.

1387
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:35,247

But sometimes,

1391
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,892
I think I see her in my dreams.

1392
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,119
Mmm.
