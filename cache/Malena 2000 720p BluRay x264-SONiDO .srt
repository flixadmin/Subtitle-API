1
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:05,397
This afternoon at 5:00

2
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,107
II Duce wiII speak
to the nation!

3
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,651
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!

4
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:13,280
AII of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones

5
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,240
are ordered to turn them on.

6
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,200
MussoIini wiII speak
to aII ItaIians!

7
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:21,621
You are authorised by order
of the Fascist government

8
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:23,748
to interrupt your work.

9
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:26,626
This afternoon at 5:00

10
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:29,129
II Duce wiII speak
to the nation.

11
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:35,093
I was tweIve and a haIf
when I saw her for the first time.

12
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,887
Even though I'm oIder now

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,848
and my mind pIays tricks on me,
I remember it weII.

14
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,810
Τhat day, MussoIini decIared war
on France and Great Britain

15
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,563
and I got my first bicycIe.

16
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,940
The frame is British,

17
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:51,901
the gears are French,

18
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,572
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

19
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,534
But the chain is SiciIian...
aIways keep it greasy.

20
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,829
- Are you sure it's safe?
- I have new bikes too.

21
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:07,375
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycIe?

22
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,712
Fighting men...

23
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,426
on Iand, on sea
and in the air,

24
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:20,305
BIackshirts of the revoIution,

25
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:25,143
men and women of ItaIy
and the Kingdom of AIbania

26
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:26,811
hear this...

27
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,940
Except for my father, who wasn't
very fond of "Our Great Leader"

28
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,861
everyone in town was happy
that ItaIy was going to war.

29
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,988
Maybe they couIdn't see,
and I sureIy couIdn't have known

30
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,115
how that day wouId
mark my Iife forever.

31
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,672
The hour...

32
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,472
of decisions from which
there is no return.

33
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,017
Pino, think this ant knows
he's dead meat?

34
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,143
Who knows?

35
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,480
If he's Iike you,
he doesn't know shit.

36
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:13,149
The decIaration of war

37
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,028
has aIready been deIivered
to the ambassadors.

38
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,424
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

39
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:44,180
Hey, guys!

40
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:48,810
Lucky bastard,
he's got a new bicycIe!

41
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,354
Man, she's beautifuI!

42
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,315
It's aImost brand new.

43
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,653
Custom-made,
just Iike the racers.

44
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:02,407
- Now you're a man, Iike us.
- So I can join the gang?

45
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,617
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.

46
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:07,662
- "Don NicoIa"?
- I'd Iet him in.

47
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,831
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.

48
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:11,249
And you, "Don Sasa"?

49
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,003
I don't want some kid
poking into our business.

50
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,964
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?

51
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,222
She's coming!

52
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,019
What's going on?

53
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,815
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

54
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,618
Who is she?

55
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:30,578
The deaf guy's daughter,
our new Latin teacher.

56
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:33,957
- What's her name?
- What a wonderfuI ass!

57
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,909
What I wouIdn't give
for an hour with her!

58
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:13,997
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't...

59
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,540
What's her name?

60
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,669
MaIena, the most beautifuI ass
in CasteIcuto.

61
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:28,469
The sun is bigger
than the moon.

62
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,473
SoI maior est quam Iunam.

63
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,686
Or soI maior est Iuna.

64
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,272
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf oId fart?

65
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,982
Yes, but hurry.

66
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:46,404
I Iove honesty
more than weaIth.

67
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:56,789
Seven thumbs Iong!

68
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:59,042
- Seven and a haIf thumbs!
- Mine's a bazooka!

69
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,753
- I got eight!
- Eight is nothing!

70
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,921
That's just tickIing a woman!

71
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,717
One, two... three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine.

72
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,260
Torpedo!

73
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:12,472
My submarine
wiII rip MaIena in haIf!

74
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,145
Once I skipped schooI
and went by MaIena's house.

75
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:23,274
She was at the window,
and she caIIed out to me.

76
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,401
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

77
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:30,323
I went up for the money,
and her robe feII open.

78
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,699
And there she was,

79
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,493
naked as the day
she was born.

80
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,619
HoIy shit!

81
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,746
She did it on purpose
to excite me.

82
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:38,915
I was an idiot.
I shouId have jumped at the chance.

83
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,835
If it happens again,
I'II bang her brains out.

84
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:46,673
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no baIIs.

85
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,384
You IittIe runt,
you've been here for two hours

86
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,179
and you stiII haven't
measured yourseIf.

87
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:55,556
Measure it!

88
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,393
One, two...

89
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,311
three, four...

90
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,813
five...

91
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,107
OnIy six!

92
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,984
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

93
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,070
Short pants: short dick!

94
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,115
Fuck off. My thumbs are twice
as big as yours!

95
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,574
BuIIshit!

96
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:19,122
Who's got the biggest dick
now, runt?

97
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,331
You do!

98
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:23,418
No, I am II Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!

99
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:31,718
- Ooh. Renato's skipping schooI.
- Shh!

100
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:30,151
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.

101
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,497
What cigarettes do you want?

102
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,625
Macedonia Extra.

103
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,105
I remember this suit very weII.
It's your father's.

104
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:12,151
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it stiII Iooks brand new.

105
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:16,030
He onIy wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeraI.

106
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:20,660
If he's buried in this suit,
he'II go straight to heaven!

107
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:25,456
- My father's stiII young.
- And you're too young for Iong pants.

108
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,917
I didn't ask
for your opinion, sir.

109
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,503
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!

110
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,756
You IittIe scoundreI,
what the heII is this?

111
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,383
Come here, mister.

112
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,553
So you want to skip schooI?

113
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,180
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

114
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,807
Leave him aIone!

115
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,642
I know what I'm doing.

116
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:50,731
And you Iet your friends
beat you up.

117
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,858
Fair enough.

118
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,486
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

119
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:59,615
But steaIing trousers
from your father

120
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:02,368
and getting them aItered
for yourseIf

121
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,161
is just pIain wrong!

122
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,913
But, Papa,
you don't understand!

123
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,083
Understand?
Who said you couId speak?

124
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,419
I'm ashamed
to wear short pants!

125
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,629
What about knickers?
They're aImost Iong pants!

126
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,423
Enough! He's stiII a chiId!

127
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:20,386
I'II teII our party secretary you won't
Iet me go to the Fascist exercises.

128
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,936
Let's make a deaI:

129
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:33,983
The day someone cracks the skuII
of "Our Great Leader"...

130
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,736
then you'II get Iong pants.

131
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,238
Swear it.

132
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:44,410
A beautifuI young woman
aII aIone here. It's a crime.

133
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,872
- Who's he taIking about?
- MaIena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

134
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,000
She must have somebody on the side,
it's inevitabIe!

135
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,793
- Number fifteen!
- Me.

136
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,964
Right. Nino brings her from her viIIage
with her aiIing father.

137
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,093
And then a month Iater, boom...
Nino's caIIed to the war.

138
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,804
Who here wants to bet
she's sIeeping aII aIone?

139
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,431
Not me!

140
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,895
Why don't you Iet me
sit with the others?

141
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,483
You're too young
to sit in the aduIt chair.

142
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,934
- Good night, comrade.
- Hey, who's out after curfew?

143
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,477
Ah, it's you, Roberto.

144
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:44,030
And on the home front,

145
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:48,034
report of fueI and food shortages
are beginning to mount.

146
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,830
In the isIands
and outIying areas

147
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:56,917
rationing of flour and sugar
wiII continue...

148
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:27,925
But, son, if you don't know the titIe,
how can I heIp you?

149
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:30,553
It's that pretty, romantic one...

150
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:38,018
"Ma L'Amore No".
Why didn't you say so?

151
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,398
Ten Iire.
Pay at the cashier's.

152
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,108
- Don't you test it?
- What for?

153
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,527
- It might be defective.
- It's brand new!

154
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,786
Miss MaIena,
this heart of mine, on fire,

155
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,746
has written so many Ietters

156
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:23,374
and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you

157
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,669
it was onIy because I didn't want
to do you harm.

158
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,297
So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.

159
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:33,509
I want you to know
that this town has many gossips,

160
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:38,222
who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret Iover.

161
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,182
I know it's not true.

162
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:41,809
You don't have anyone.

163
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:46,272
After your husband,
the onIy man in your Iife is me.

164
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:03,455
I have to go. I'II see you
at schooI tomorrow.

165
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:05,833
So Iong!

166
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,960
Don't get Iost!

167
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:20,889
MaIena's up
in the empIoyment office.

168
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:25,352
- Looking for a job again?
- But who wiII ever hire her?

169
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:27,354
No one in this town.

170
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,065
I've got a job for her...

171
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:32,109
LittIe boy, Iet me get by.

172
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,499
Hey, baby,
give a soIdier a break!

173
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,174
Mr Lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

174
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,303
Mind your own fucking business!

175
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,648
Good morning, Signora MaIena,
are you weII?

176
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,276
How is your father?
May I?

177
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,432
The show's over!
She's gone now!

178
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,213
I forgot the key!

179
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,149
So it's true what peopIe say!

180
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,526
What's the matter with you?
You Iook so strange.

181
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:39,153
You've poisoned me
with your Iies.

182
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,406
What Iies?
I've never spoken to you.

183
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:47,911
I knew it from the start...
you're a Ioose woman.

184
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,956
But I've never
done anything wrong.

185
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:54,084
Liar! I've been foIIowing you
on my bicycIe!

186
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,045
I know where you went.
I know everything!

187
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,965
- Τhe Iawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I Iove onIy you!

188
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,675
Liar!

189
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,098
- Amoroso.
- Here!

190
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:09,725
- CaIi.
- Here!

191
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,226
- Costanza.
- Here!

192
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:15,105
Professor, can I put my dick
between MaIena's tits?

193
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:17,649
Can I put mine in her mouth?

194
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,776
Can I put mine
between her Iegs?

195
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,196
Okay, but one at a time!

196
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,285
You're aII sons of bitches!

197
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,128
Why didn't she marry someone
from her own viIIage?

198
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,755
I'm sure no one wanted her.

199
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:49,932
- They say she's a seamstress.
- But she's so vuIgar.

200
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:01,026
My son says she Iooks fake.

201
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:03,570
My husband says he wouIdn't touch her
with a ten-foot poIe.

202
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:07,866
The Baron Bonta's mistress
is much nicer.

203
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:10,077
At Ieast Gina does everything
in the open.

204
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:14,206
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to PaIermo.

205
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:18,043
MaIena acts so superior.
Like we don't know what she's up to.

206
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,045
Wait and see.
She'II get hers.

207
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:09,595
The headquarters
of the armed forces communicates:

208
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,473
"Our brave and invincibIe fighting men
have deIivered a powerfuI bIow

209
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,143
"to the faceIess war machine
unIeashed by the AIIies.

210
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:20,272
"In order to ensure
the continued strength and vitaIity,

211
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,399
"of our forces at the front,

212
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:25,527
"aII payment of civic pensions

213
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:30,282
"wiII again be postponed..."

214
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:44,171
It's ready.

215
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,464
Thank you.

216
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,594
It's not much,
but it's aII we can afford.

217
00:24:12,408 --> 00:24:14,826
Me Tarzan, you MaIena.

218
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:28,256
Renato, you've got the biggest gun
in the West!

219
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:35,222
You're going to go bIind!

220
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:48,443
Right rank!

221
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:52,406
Eyes front! Arms out, arms high,
in quick succession!

222
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:58,286
Have you heard?
MaIena's husband was kiIIed.

223
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,623
My father toId me.
He read the teIegram.

224
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:03,834
MaIena is avaiIabIe!

225
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,129
Comrades of CasteIcuto,

226
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,423
we are gathered here today

227
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,885
to share in the tragic
but honourabIe mourning

228
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:15,762
which has struck our town.

229
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,850
To express our deepest condoIences

230
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,894
for the Ioss
of Lt Nino Scordia,

231
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,689
heroicaIIy kiIIed in action

232
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,733
in Northern Africa...

233
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,861
...and to his bride MaddaIena

234
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:35,782
who, stricken with grief,
unfortunateIy isn't here with us.

235
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:40,662
- She's aIready out Iooking!
- She'II need a warm bed now!

236
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,497
But she is with us in spirit

237
00:25:42,623 --> 00:25:44,916
because SiciIian women,

238
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,961
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices,

239
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:51,047
march shouIder to shouIder
with fighting men.

240
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,306
The martyrdom of our feIIow citizen
in defence of his country

241
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,432
was not a useIess sacrifice.

242
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:06,354
- Lt Cadei is so handsome.
- A Iucky girI wiII catch him!

243
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:11,485
...that wiII carry us to the
finaI victory of the Fascist Empire!

244
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,952
Long Iive II Duce!

245
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:49,124
From now on
I'II be at your side.

246
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,084
Forever. I promise.

247
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:54,462
Just give me time to grow up.

248
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,849
Now she'II take a Iover
for sure!

249
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,935
"Once in the sack,
there's no Iooking back!"

250
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:12,022
She knows that.
She's 27 years oId.

251
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,899
She knows her way
around the bIock!

252
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,818
Cusimano, the dentist,
has gone crazy for her.

253
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:19,279
One day he was distracted
as she waIked by

254
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:23,241
and puIIed a heaIthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

255
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,537
Dentist or not,
why haven't we seen her IateIy?

256
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:29,998
Guess she's too busy!

257
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:36,713
They say she's fooIing around
with a shopkeeper in Catania

258
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,340
with subversive tendencies.

259
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,760
Some say Cusimano,
the dentist.

260
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:46,723
- A famiIy man. It's disgracefuI!
- When you're a born whore...

261
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:51,144
I hear the priest
has received anonymous Ietters

262
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,897
saying her Iover
is this man, that man.

263
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,774
The voice of the peopIe
is the voice of God!

264
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:32,143
I can't taIk to anyone
about my personaI probIems.

265
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,770
They're too intimate.

266
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:38,984
But you seem nice.
I'd Iike to confide in you.

267
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:48,368
Every day,
I'II Iight a candIe for you.

268
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:50,787
I'II even come to Mass
on Sunday.

269
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:55,375
But you must protect MaIena Scordia
from the town.

270
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:59,129
Yes, the widow... at Ieast for a few years.
Then I'II take over.

271
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,989
I am aIways at your service.

272
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,117
Renewed condoIences, MaIena.

273
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:40,086
What a piece of ass!

274
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:42,839
Son of a bitch!

275
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,012
You IittIe runt!
Come back here!

276
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,450
- Can't you sing in ItaIian?
- Can't you speak German?

277
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,982
Renato, get up. It's Iate.

278
00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:18,203
Monster!

279
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,455
You're a fetishist,

280
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:24,834
a sadomasochist,
or even worse, a pervert!

281
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,045
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!

282
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,967
Shame on you!

283
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,806
- How pretty. Can I keep them?
- You shameIess girI!

284
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,727
What are you Iooking at?
Get out of here!

285
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,897
Come here, you IittIe pig!

286
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:49,651
- Goddam pervert!
- What did I do?

287
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:54,739
You're not permitted to sit
at the tabIe with us, understand?

288
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:57,158
- Answer me!
- Okay!

289
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:04,290
You no Ionger have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

290
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,253
Lock me up! I'II show you!

291
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,090
You're not to Ieave this room
untiI further notice!

292
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:17,303
Son, at Ieast have some soup.
It wiII do you good.

293
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:20,139
Pietro, he hasn't eaten
for three days.

294
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,851
In the Soviet Union,
they never eat. StiII...

295
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:26,312
What is this shit?

296
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:30,483
The Fascists gave it to us.
At Ieast it Iooks Iike coffee.

297
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:32,443
Sure, and I Iook
Iike Vittorio De Sica.

298
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:34,153
Everything they give us
is terribIe!

299
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,282
Look at these pockets.
They're aIways ripping open!

300
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,244
This cheap thread
doesn't hoId the stitches!

301
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,037
The thread isn't the probIem!

302
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:46,624
WhiIe our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

303
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,128
What does that mean?

304
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,088
Do you get it now?

305
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:55,550
Just as weII! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets cIosed!

306
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,219
But he'II have no pockets?

307
00:34:58,345 --> 00:35:00,930
He'II work it out.
It wiII be good for his heaIth!

308
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:05,727
Lights out!

309
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:11,232
"...that the weary spirit may ne'er
repose in more restfuI harbour..."

310
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,610
- Has he gone crazy?
- I think he's gone bIind.

311
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,452
"WhiIe upon women's work
you sat intent

312
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:27,165
"content with the vague future
you heId in mind

313
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,544
"was the scented May,
and thus you used to spend your days."

314
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,505
- This chiId needs air.
- Air?

315
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:35,840
Air.

316
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:50,646
Good morning, Professor.

317
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,899
This Ietter is for you.

318
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,402
It says "urgent".

319
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,914
You're dishonoured.

320
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,500
Your daughter MaIena is sIeeping
with the whoIe town.

321
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:32,814
It was an anonymous Ietter,
but I read it!

322
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,024
It says MaIena is a whore
with everyone in town!

323
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,485
So there's hope for us too!

324
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:40,696
Take it back!

325
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:44,492
I'II bust your ass,
Mr Short Pants!

326
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:27,827
Tonight was wonderfuI.

327
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,913
For me too.

328
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:33,499
I know it's
been onIy ten months since.

329
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,126
But maybe I can see you again.

330
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:38,754
AII right. You win. Tomorrow.

331
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,965
Okay, as Iong as
I'm not on duty.

332
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:44,177
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're weIcome.

333
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,648
Take care of yourseIf.

334
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:08,409
So see you tomorrow?

335
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:13,247
- UntiI then.
- Good night, Leone.

336
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,876
What time?

337
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:22,340
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, my ass!

338
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:26,636
How dare you
pester my fiancée!

339
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,097
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited.

340
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,974
You're a Iiar and a bastard!

341
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,645
Because I'm in uniform,
I cannot retaIiate, sir.

342
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:39,148
- But you wiII answer to me.
- Anytime. Anywhere.

343
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:42,777
Coward, scoundreI!

344
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,403
Get up.

345
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,449
Come here! I'II tear you apart,
you coward!

346
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:50,493
I'II break you in two!

347
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,872
Let me go! Or I'II have
to get tough with you!

348
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,752
Here's the aduIterer!

349
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:01,254
My wife!

350
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,340
- Officer, Iook! He's cheating on me!
- With a man?

351
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:06,300
With a traitor!

352
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,555
You said you wouIdn't touch her
with a ten-foot poIe!

353
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,681
It's the dentist!

354
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:15,309
I've been spying on you
a Iong time, you bastard!

355
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,270
And as for you

356
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:21,941
go steaI husbands
from your own viIIage, you whore!

357
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:24,860
We knew she had one Iover,
but two?

358
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:28,656
But where does the dentist fit in?

359
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:30,199
He fits in between her Iegs!

360
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:33,578
Her father was forced
to quit the schooI in disgrace.

361
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,706
He never wants
to see his daughter MaIena again.

362
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,167
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

363
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:45,339
That dragon of a wife
wiII drag him into court!

364
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:48,884
What's the dentist got to do
with it, poor guy?

365
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:52,430
MaIena's the whore!
She shouId be taken to court!

366
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,182
That Lt Cadei
seemed Iike such a gentIeman.

367
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,685
How couId he get mixed up
in this?

368
00:39:57,811 --> 00:40:01,105
Everyone knows
she's a home wrecker.

369
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:03,566
The Iieutenant was asking for it!

370
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,652
She's not from here.
She forgets where she is.

371
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:09,196
WiII they go to court?

372
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,742
Of course, she couId go to jaiI.
He's a married man!

373
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:17,830
The dentist needed three stitches
in his head.

374
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:20,958
But the dentist
swore at the soIdier first.

375
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,544
That's insuIting an officer.

376
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,838
We'II aII end up in court!

377
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:28,257
WhiIe we were
watching her caboose

378
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:31,719
the Iieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train!

379
00:41:27,984 --> 00:41:30,736
She's either going
to the Iawyer's or the notary's.

380
00:41:30,862 --> 00:41:33,864
Sure, but what wiII she do
with two oId men Iike them?

381
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,702
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

382
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,579
Can I heIp you?

383
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,541
May I speak
to Lawyer Centorbi?

384
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,501
PIease have a seat.

385
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:50,589
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

386
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:54,719
Can it be true?
BeautifuI Madonna!

387
00:42:05,647 --> 00:42:07,481
Have her come in.

388
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:12,445
PIease sit down.

389
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,071
Charmed.

390
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:23,247
We now continue with the testimony
of MaddaIena Bonsignore,

391
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:24,790
the widow Scordia,

392
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:26,959
caIIed MaIena.

393
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,129
She couId get two years in prison.

394
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,592
Everything wiII be fine, trust me.

395
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:52,902
You're accused of invoIving
Dr Gaspare Cusimano

396
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,863
in a secret
and amorous reIationship

397
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:59,366
aimed at the breaking up
of his famiIy.

398
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,494
Do you know Dr Cusimano?

399
00:43:03,121 --> 00:43:04,121
Yes.

400
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:09,126
Are you or have you ever been
his fiancée?

401
00:43:09,252 --> 00:43:11,253
AbsoIuteIy not.

402
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:14,340
How couId I be engaged
to a married man?

403
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,927
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusuaI hour

404
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,429
on his way to your house?

405
00:43:20,555 --> 00:43:21,639
I don't know.

406
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,725
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?

407
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,868
Yes, once.

408
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,625
Where?

409
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:51,418
At my house.

410
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,220
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He Iooks stupid, but...

411
00:44:01,346 --> 00:44:04,723
How Iong did he stay?

412
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,433
Not Iong.

413
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,143
What did you do?

414
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:13,440
He brought me some medicine
for my father.

415
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:18,696
If it was for your father,
why did he bring it to you?

416
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,947
I don't know.

417
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:25,244
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

418
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,621
He said goodbye and Ieft.

419
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,252
Then why

420
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:35,880
has Cusimano,
a reputabIe professionaI,

421
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,631
who, five years ago,

422
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:40,718
had the honour of extracting
one of II Duce's teeth

423
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,305
pubIicIy decIare
that he is your fiancé?

424
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,224
He made that up.

425
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,934
I had nothing to do with it.

426
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,769
Your husband's crazy.

427
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:55,816
What kind of reIationship
did you have with Lt Cadei?

428
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,863
I'm a widow.

429
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,782
My business
and that of Lt Cadei

430
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,201
are no concern of the Iaw.

431
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,955
AII right.

432
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:13,876
Did you know that,
as a resuIt of these affairs

433
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,003
Lt Cadei was transferred
to AIbania?

434
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:17,254
One down.

435
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,591
And before his departure,
he was questioned in judiciaI inquiry.

436
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,842
CIerk.

437
00:45:21,968 --> 00:45:27,348
He decIared to have encountered
the widow Scordia onIy twice

438
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,350
in her home

439
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:33,520
and to have had
no amorous reIationship

440
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:37,983
considering their reIationship
"just a casuaI friendship."

441
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,405
Son of a bitch.

442
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:47,284
Lt Cadei was received
by my cIient

443
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:51,872
and she makes no secret
about having had for him

444
00:45:51,998 --> 00:45:54,291
certain feeIings.

445
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:58,170
But unIike the married Cusimano

446
00:45:58,296 --> 00:46:00,673
who was, Iet's face it, guiIty

447
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,050
of a pre-seniIe dimming
of the senses

448
00:46:03,176 --> 00:46:07,763
of an intoxicating
kaIeidoscope of desires...

449
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:08,931
What's he saying?

450
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:14,728
UnIike the famiIy man Cusimano,

451
00:46:14,854 --> 00:46:16,689
Cadei is...

452
00:46:17,273 --> 00:46:20,067
...and was

453
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:22,778
a bacheIor!

454
00:46:22,904 --> 00:46:25,239
CIever, that Iawyer.

455
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,700
He's a bacheIor himseIf.

456
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:32,329
CarefuI investigation
of the facts teII us, therefore

457
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:35,833
that the Scordia woman
committed no other crime

458
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,585
than that of being iII-fated,

459
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,129
aIone

460
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,256
and beautifuI.

461
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,216
Here is her crime:

462
00:46:44,342 --> 00:46:46,010
her beauty!

463
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,512
And from here, the envy,

464
00:46:48,638 --> 00:46:50,472
the Iies,

465
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:52,266
the disgrace

466
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:57,312
that have deprived her
even of a father's trust!

467
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:00,941
And yet, she herseIf
is stiII in siIent agony,

468
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:03,944


mourning over
that unmarked war grave

469
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:07,656
in faraway East Africa.

470
00:47:07,782 --> 00:47:10,951
In the beating heart
of our argument

471
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,121
is an audacious,
but nonetheIess vaIid, thesis,

472
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:18,375
which asks just one question:

473
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:20,753
Can a young woman

474
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:25,632
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the Iove of country

475
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:30,637
hope for protection
in the sheIter of a new Iife?

476
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:34,558
Does she have the right
to yearn for, and to write

477
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:37,895
a new ending
to her own Iove story?

478
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:40,606
Your Honour,

479
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,983
the citizens of CasteIcuto repIy:

480
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:44,234
"Yes!"

481
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,705
WiII Cusimano Ieave me aIone now?

482
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:58,665
Of course.

483
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,585
He's been put into
a psychiatric cIinic.

484
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:04,880
He wants to voIunteer
for the Forces in East Africa.

485
00:48:05,006 --> 00:48:09,218
He doesn't reaIise
we Iost Africa ages ago!

486
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,053
But Iet's forget Cusimano

487
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,639
and the fickIe Lieutenant Cadei.

488
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,183
Let's get to us!

489
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,147
I know it's not much.

490
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:26,110
But it's aII I have.
They've cut my pension.

491
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,445
Don't you understand?

492
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:31,615
That's peanuts!

493
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:34,284
My fee is much more than that.

494
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:37,996
You'II never have enough money!

495
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,125
But how wiII I ever repay you?

496
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,961
It's very easy, my sweet.

497
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:48,715
- What are you saying?
- Be with me, my Iove!

498
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,175
I'm in Iove with you!

499
00:48:55,473 --> 00:49:00,269
A woman shouIdn't be aIone
during these hard times.

500
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,647
I am a weaIthy man.
You won't find better.

501
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:09,069
I'II take care of your father.
You'II never have to worry again.

502
00:49:26,462 --> 00:49:27,629
I forgive her.

503
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:30,799
She did it
to pay her Iawyer's fee

504
00:49:30,925 --> 00:49:32,384
onIy once and never again.

505
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,845
But you didn't keep our agreement.

506
00:49:36,764 --> 00:49:39,099
Now we're even.

507
00:49:39,225 --> 00:49:47,399
...in the South, the AIIied bombings
have forced thousands to flee.

508
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:54,156
Refugees are pouring into
the countryside and the port towns.

509
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,450
Citizens of these regions
have been aIerted

510
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:00,412
to possibIe severe food shortages
and outbreaks of disease.

511
00:50:27,148 --> 00:50:29,983
Signora MaIena,
a more capabIe person than me

512
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:33,820
wrote that the onIy true Iove
is unrequited Iove.

513
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,906
Now I understand why.

514
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:39,034
It's been so Iong since you
Iast came out of your house.

515
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,996
But the Ionger we are apart,
the stronger my Iove becomes.

516
00:50:43,122 --> 00:50:47,334
Τhey say you're about to marry
Centorbi, the Iawyer.

517
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,461
I know how badIy
they treat you here

518
00:50:49,587 --> 00:50:53,131
how the women in the market
won't seII you any good food

519
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,550
and no man wouId hire you
for fear of his wife.

520
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:59,096
But how wiII you manage to Iive
with a fat, oId man,

521
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:03,517
so ugIy that no girI
ever wanted him?

522
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:08,563
Τhey say he never washes
and stinks Iike a goat.

523
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,400
How wiII your smooth, white skin,

524
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,819
bear rubbing against
the sweat of an oId man,

525
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:17,781
who never does anything
without his mother's consent?

526
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,309
Is it true you're getting married?

527
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,770
What are you writing?

528
00:51:48,896 --> 00:51:51,148
Give me that! Let me see!

529
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:56,611
Get out!

530
00:52:17,383 --> 00:52:19,384
Stand up straight.

531
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,511
A IittIe Ionger, Don PIacido.

532
00:52:21,637 --> 00:52:25,557
More room in the waist,
for when he gets bigger.

533
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:27,017
WiII they be ready tomorrow?

534
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:30,687
The war has ruined my business,
but it stiII takes time.

535
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:33,231
...as AIIied bombings continue.

536
00:52:40,114 --> 00:52:41,198
Wait for me.

537
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,913
Lord, heIp me with my mother,
I beg you.

538
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,921
Moron!

539
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,214
Idiot!

540
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,009
You can't treat me Iike a chiId.
I'm a grown man!

541
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,304
Get this straight!

542
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:07,974
Your father's good name wiII never
beIong to that disgusting whore!

543
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:12,187
Never! Never!

544
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,630
The Iawyer was Ieft high and dry!

545
00:53:38,756 --> 00:53:42,634
His mother stiII bathes him
every Saturday!

546
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,387
MaIena aIways has someone
throwing a wrench in the works!

547
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:49,516
It won't be hard finding someone
to repIace the Iawyer!

548
00:53:49,642 --> 00:53:51,143
Come on, sit down.

549
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:55,021
The next in Iine
aIready has a pIan.

550
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:58,233
Yeah, his pIan is in his pants.

551
00:53:58,359 --> 00:54:01,361
- A cut and shave.
- Right away, sir.

552
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,375
Good morning, Antonio.

553
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:05,091
I brought some sugar and flour.

554
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,636
- What about the bread?
- The best.

555
00:55:11,098 --> 00:55:14,017
- I can't pay right now.
- That's no probIem.

556
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:17,562
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you some money.

557
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:28,842
Hurry, there's someone eIse
over here!

558
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:32,095
Stand back!

559
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,614
It's Professor Bonsignore.

560
00:56:51,657 --> 00:56:54,075
MaIena's father.

561
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,190
I'm here for you.

562
00:57:27,526 --> 00:57:29,986
CondoIences, Signora Scordia.

563
00:57:31,947 --> 00:57:34,199
CondoIences.

564
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,872
Step aside, kid.

565
00:57:40,998 --> 00:57:44,668
Signora, what can we do?
We're in the Lord's hands.

566
00:57:50,132 --> 00:57:52,967
Don't forget my offer.

567
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:55,595
You don't have to go hungry.

568
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:02,060
Attention, IoyaI citizens!
This is "a caII to arms".

569
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:04,688
We must maintain our faith
and hope in the RepubIic

570
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:10,318
in the face
of imperiaIistic aggression!

571
00:58:10,444 --> 00:58:13,279
Despite recent setbacks
on the front

572
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:18,118
and escaIating hardships at home

573
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:21,788
remember that nothing can dim

574
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:26,126
our fervour
for our gIorious homeIand!

575
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,511
Can you beIieve it?

576
00:59:18,637 --> 00:59:20,346
Just a few years ago,
II Duce promised

577
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:23,099
that the Nazis
wouId never occupy SiciIy.

578
00:59:23,225 --> 00:59:25,226
Now he's soId us down the river!

579
00:59:25,352 --> 00:59:29,272
Look!
The Germans are everywhere!

580
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:56,883
- Look who's here.
- She's a redhead now.

581
00:59:57,009 --> 00:59:59,344
Look how she's put together.

582
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,805
I'd Iike to cut off that hair.

583
01:00:06,393 --> 01:00:08,770
I'd skin her aIive!

584
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,109
How disgusting!

585
01:01:09,164 --> 01:01:10,832
- Who is it?
- It's me.

586
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,793
- Me who?
- SaIvatore. Antonio sent me.

587
01:01:13,919 --> 01:01:16,212
I brought you some more food.

588
01:01:16,338 --> 01:01:17,589
Come in.

589
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,189
- Your hair Iooks terrific.
- Do you Iike it?

590
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:38,401
- Yes, it makes you Iook younger.
- Thank you.

591
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,621
I can come every Thursday!

592
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:52,248
As Iong as you bring the food.

593
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,515
Now she's even screwing
the Germans.

594
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:13,227
- Who's that?
- MaIena Scordia, the sIut.

595
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:17,815
She's teamed up
with that other whore, Gina.

596
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,776
But with the Germans?

597
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,654
Seems there are gymnastics
at the Moderno HoteI.

598
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,616
The two whores run
from room to room

599
01:02:26,742 --> 01:02:30,536
servicing a dozen officers
at a time.

600
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,622
HoIy shit!

601
01:03:04,154 --> 01:03:07,115
My good woman, this chiId
is possessed by the deviI!

602
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,574
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

603
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:27,510
That's enough!

604
01:03:27,636 --> 01:03:30,888
It Iooks Iike you're posing for
MicheIangeIo's Pieta of the poor!

605
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:37,478
EviI eye on bIood is fed.
HoId on fast tiII death is past.

606
01:03:37,604 --> 01:03:41,691
Exorcise the deviI from this chiId.

607
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:43,735
Goat red, on wood fed,
hoId on fast.

608
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:47,697
Head and taiI,
eviI eye reIease this chiId.

609
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:49,907
Cast the deviI into the wiId.

610
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,702
ShamefuI! DisgracefuI!

611
01:03:52,828 --> 01:03:55,788
They cured my uncIe this way

612
01:03:55,914 --> 01:03:57,707
and he had choIera!

613
01:03:57,833 --> 01:04:00,585
Your son's not sick!
He's becoming a man!

614
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:04,380
With a dick this big,
he needs to fuck!

615
01:04:20,814 --> 01:04:22,899
Renato, wait here for me.

616
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,992
Come here. Come on.
CIose the door.

617
01:04:33,118 --> 01:04:36,287
- My father?
- He's coming.

618
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:38,498
Ladies!

619
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,458
Choose the one you Iike.

620
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:43,503
Ladies!

621
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,463
What do we have here?

622
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:47,757
Fresh young meat.

623
01:05:04,316 --> 01:05:06,818
Lupetta, up to the room.

624
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,364
Treat him right.

625
01:05:19,706 --> 01:05:21,999
- What's your name?
- Amoroso Renato.

626
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:24,043
What a romantic name!

627
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:27,922
Tonight we either die in a bombing
or end up in jaiI.

628
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:34,637
Go ahead.

629
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,874
- Is it your first time?
- No.

630
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:48,502
I've imagined it many times.

631
01:07:49,147 --> 01:07:52,900
Let's go give that shameIess whore
what she deserves.

632
01:07:57,864 --> 01:08:00,866
Stay back.
This is between the women.

633
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,170
Now you'II see what happens
when you steaI our men

634
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,131
and sIeep with the fiIthy Germans.

635
01:09:09,227 --> 01:09:13,064
It's the end
of spreading your Iegs, whore!

636
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:22,114
Now Iet's see
what men make of you!

637
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:26,410
This wiII teach you some respect!

638
01:09:38,715 --> 01:09:40,383
The wicked come to a wicked end.

639
01:09:45,555 --> 01:09:48,557
The madame is served.

640
01:10:57,335 --> 01:10:59,336
Get Iost!

641
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:01,714
Disappear!

642
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:58,701
I know that face.
Who is it?

643
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:03,831
Nino Scordia, MaIena's husband.

644
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:07,626
MaIena, the one who did it
with the Germans.

645
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:17,803
Poor guy.
He was better off dead.

646
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,519
Isn't that MaIena's husband?

647
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:57,426
Hey, Giovanni,
there's a strange guy.

648
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:07,019
Do you know MaIena Scordia?

649
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,979
Who's she?

650
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:11,356
Who are you?
This is my famiIy's house!

651
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,400
We don't know anything.

652
01:16:13,526 --> 01:16:16,445
When we came,
no one was Iiving here.

653
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,405
No one?

654
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,089
Poor guy.
No one wiII teII him the truth.

655
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:40,093
What wouId you say,
"I hear your wife is a prostitute"?

656
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,806
I hear she's stiII
a great piece of ass.

657
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:47,434
I Iost an arm. I wasn't dead!

658
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,188
Then I was taken prisoner in India
and I contracted maIaria.

659
01:16:51,314 --> 01:16:52,815
TeII him.

660
01:16:57,153 --> 01:16:58,987
Me "boy-bar."

661
01:16:59,113 --> 01:17:01,532
I have to get the coffee cups.

662
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:07,871
My famiIy has Iived in this town
for generations.

663
01:17:07,997 --> 01:17:09,748
Now no one wiII taIk to me.

664
01:17:09,874 --> 01:17:12,417
My house is a refugee camp,
and my wife has disappeared.

665
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:15,087
No one in town knows where she is.

666
01:17:25,014 --> 01:17:27,850
HeIp me find her.
I want to bring her home.

667
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:55,085
Excuse me. Don't you remember me?
I'm Nino Scordia.

668
01:17:55,211 --> 01:17:57,671
You mistake me for someone eIse.

669
01:17:57,797 --> 01:17:59,047
CouId I have a Iight?

670
01:17:59,173 --> 01:18:02,175
You were the Fascist secretary,
and you were his deputy.

671
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:03,385
You can heIp me.

672
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:05,345
Do you know what happened
to my wife?

673
01:18:05,471 --> 01:18:08,265
Didn't she join
the Communist Party?

674
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:10,851
She was photographed

675
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:13,520
with her arms
around the Commie Ieader.

676
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:18,066
You're a famiIy of heroes!

677
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,321
You're right.

678
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:26,783
Those who fought the war
for you bastards aren't heroes.

679
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:31,413
Go take a waIk through
the brotheIs of SiciIy.

680
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:35,959
You may find your wife there!

681
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:38,939
Wait a minute. Come back!

682
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,781
Dear Signor Scordia,

683
01:19:47,907 --> 01:19:51,827
forgive me if I don't have the courage
to speak man to man.

684
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,621
These Iast months have
taught me much about courage,

685
01:19:54,747 --> 01:19:57,332
even if I have found IittIe myseIf.

686
01:19:57,458 --> 01:20:01,503
I'm the onIy one who knows
the truth about your wife.

687
01:20:01,629 --> 01:20:04,756
Around here, they onIy say
bad things about her.

688
01:20:04,882 --> 01:20:05,966
But beIieve me,

689
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:08,885
your wife MaIena
was faithfuI to you.

690
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:13,015
You are the onIy man she Ioved.
This is the honest truth.

691
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,517
It is true,
a Iot of things happened,

692
01:20:15,643 --> 01:20:19,312
but back then,
you had been dead a Iong time.

693
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:22,649
Τhe Iast time I saw her,
she was on a train for Messina.

694
01:20:22,775 --> 01:20:24,359
Best of Iuck.

695
01:20:24,485 --> 01:20:28,697
I shouId sign "a friend",
Iike aII anonymous Ietters,

696
01:20:28,823 --> 01:20:31,283
but my name is Renato.

697
01:21:10,114 --> 01:21:11,990
Good morning, Judge.

698
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:16,369
AII is weII, thank God.

699
01:21:16,954 --> 01:21:19,956
Eat up, my sweet pea.

700
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:33,929
Sons of bitches!

701
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,473
Look who's here!

702
01:21:36,599 --> 01:21:38,683
Giorgio, Iook who's here!

703
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:43,081
Why are you aII Iooking
at that woman?

704
01:22:43,207 --> 01:22:44,207
It's nothing.

705
01:23:12,528 --> 01:23:15,864
I saw them in the square.
They were waIking arm in arm.

706
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:17,991
Quiet. She's here!

707
01:23:19,118 --> 01:23:22,621
It took a Iot of courage
to come back.

708
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:24,539
Look who's here.

709
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:30,003
I heard it,
but I didn't beIieve it.

710
01:23:30,129 --> 01:23:34,216
What have they got to Iook at?
They shouId Ieave her in peace.

711
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:37,510
She's got some wrinkIes
around her eyes.

712
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:38,929
She's put on weight too.

713
01:23:41,515 --> 01:23:43,767
But she's stiII beautifuI.

714
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:46,478
Good morning, Mrs Scordia.

715
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:02,953
Good morning.

716
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:10,210
Want some nice tomatoes?
They cost Iess over there.

717
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:11,836
Thank you.

718
01:24:14,298 --> 01:24:17,008
Nice things here!

719
01:24:17,134 --> 01:24:19,386
Like it, Signora MaIena?

720
01:24:20,137 --> 01:24:22,264
- Try it on.
- No, that's okay.

721
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:25,225
- It's no probIem.
- Another time.

722
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:27,143
Give me your bag.

723
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,229
We'II discuss it Iater.

724
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,821
Good morning, Signora MaIena.

725
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:34,210
It's okay. I'II get it.

726
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:40,091
Thank you.

727
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:44,054
Thank you for your heIp.

728
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:52,937
Good Iuck, Signora MaIena.

729
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:22,884
I pedaIIed as fast as I couId,

730
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,511
as if I were escaping

731
01:26:24,637 --> 01:26:28,556
from Ionging, from innocence,
from her.

732
01:26:28,682 --> 01:26:31,768
Time has passed,
and I have Ioved many women.

733
01:26:31,894 --> 01:26:35,063
And as they've heId me cIose,

734
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:38,983
and asked if I wiII remember them

735
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:43,363
I've said,
"Yes, I wiII remember you."

736
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:48,118
But the onIy one
I've never forgotten

737
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:50,912
is the one who never asked...

738
01:26:51,038 --> 01:26:52,122
MaIena.
