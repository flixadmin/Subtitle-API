Told her I love her.

You all shunned me because I

I was an aberration.

50

A disposable hero.

I wanted the pain to end.

And that's when I realized
the truth, Barry.

God feels no pain.

58

All I had to do
was become one.

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,057
And I only need
two more things:

60
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,725
for Iris to die

61
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,312
so that you are driven
so far into the dark

62
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,481

00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,569

65

given who I'm talking to,

66
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,782
but I'll keep that one
to myself.

67

- What happens if
I kill myself?

68
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,997
If I die, then you'll
never be created.

69

a tricky thing.

Four years from now,

future Flash creates...

109
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,379
a time remnant
to fight Savitar.

00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,840
But Savitar lets
that remnant live

so that<i>it</i> can later</i>
become Savitar.

So once Savitar is imprisoned

this remnant starts
to go crazy.

And he goes back in time

Which came first, Savitar
or the time remnant?

It was...

149

it was his eyes.

I've seen that in myself.

When I think about how my

Sometimes I want to repay that
violence with more violence.

154
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,928

Do you hear me?

164
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,496
We are going to stop Savitar.

165
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,417
- [sighs deeply]
- You are not alone. He is.

166
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,420
And he is not a god.

167
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,634
- Jay told me that
we're not gods.

168
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,844
He was wrong.

169
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,430
We could be.

170
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,141
Any speedster, and it
wouldn't take much.

171
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,351
When the love that we
feel in our hearts

172
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,395
is drowned in anger...

173
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,440
when the bad memories
outweigh the good ones.

174
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,860
What am I going to
have to become to stop him?

175
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,284
- Hey! Oh, bad time?

176
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,952
- No, man, what's up?

177
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,246
- I just came up with
the best idea ever.

178
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,457
Either that or it's
the worst idea ever.

179
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,499
But...
- It's an idea.

180
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,169
- It's an idea!

181
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,920
- You want to give me a perm?

182
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,047
- It's not for your hair,
Steel Magnolia.

183
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,757
This is for your brain, okay?

184
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,885
I want to stop you from
making new memories.

185
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,720
- What are you talking about?

186
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,139
- Savitar knows everything
we're gonna do

187
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,307
because he remembers doing it.

188
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,184
He's a future Barry.

189
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,603
So what if Barry can't
remember what we're doing now?

190
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,398
- You want to mess
with his brain?

191
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,066
- Just a little bit.

192
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,943
It's a minimal procedure.

193
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,154
It'll still be the same Barry
you know and love,

194
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,239
except he just won't be able
to retain new information.

195
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,324
- There's two types
of memory, Allen.

196
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,367
Short-term and long-term.

197
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,534
Long-term is where you...

198
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,161
- Okay, Julian, just stop.

199
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,163
This is my presentation;
I'm the expert here.

200
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,373
This is the part of your brain

201
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,665
that retains new information

202
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,791
before sending it to the cortex

203
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,543
to be stored forever.

204
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,504
So what if we block that chain

205
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,464
with a magnetic disruption?

206
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,383
- So Savitar won't
be able to remember

207
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,301
whatever strategy we
come up with to defeat him.

208
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,012
- Which means he can't be
two steps ahead of us anymore.

209
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,348
- With any luck, we'll actually
put him one step behind.

210
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,557
- Beautiful.

211
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,975
Cause and effect.

212
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,186
- Barry, what do you think?

213
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,149
- Let's do it.

214
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,529
- Wait, wasn't Caitlin the
expert on brains around here?

215
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,322
- She was.

216
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,991
But this is something we'll
have to do without her.

217
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,576
- I trust you.

218
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,372
- You won't feel a thing.

219
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,416
- Okay, let's get this
show on the road.

220
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,959
The disrupter is attached
to your hippocampus.

221
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,878
So it's ready.

222
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,422
- Okay, ready for zapping.

223
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,465
- Can we not call it "zapping"?

224
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,675
- Ready to activate.

225
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,261
In three...

226
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,303
two...

227
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,388
one.

228
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,683
<i>- Sweet dreams,
my beautiful boy.</i>

229
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,852
<i>- Way to go, slugger.
- Run, Barry, run!</i>

230
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,938
<i>- I have watched you be in love
with Iris...</i>

231
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,524
<i>- Maybe we were meant
to be together.</i>

232
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,859
- Okay, that should do it.

233
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,112
- All right.

234
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,614
Right. [clears throat]
How do you feel?

235
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,325
- I feel fine.

236
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,993
- You see? He feels fine.

237
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,162
[nervous laughter]

238
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,790
- Barry...

239
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,000
- Barry?

240
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,168
- Barry.

241
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,212
- Who's Barry?

242
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,256
- Not fine.

243
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,716
- Um, who are all of you?

244
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,600
- What's going on?

245
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,767
Seriously, who are you guys?

246
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,269
- Okay, Barry, stay calm.

247
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,853
- Who's Barry?
- Cisco!

248
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,397
- Slight miscalculation.

249
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,607
- Slight wouldn't be
a word I'd use.

250
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,941
- Where the hell am I?

251
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,568
Is this a dentist office?

252
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,320
- No, no. This is S.T.A.R. Labs.

253
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,322
- Labs? A laboratory?

254
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,282
St...a laboratory?
What are you?

255
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,825
Are you guys
experimenting on me?

256
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,453
- No one is ex...
well, yes, technically, yes.

257
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,329
But...but it was consensual.

258
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,455
- You were?
- Yes.

259
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,539
- You... Why can't I
remember anything?

260
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,249
Why can't I remember my name?

261
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,544
- Your name is Barry.
- My name's not Barry.

262
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,045
I don't know what my name is,
but my name's...

263
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,840
"Bartholomew Henry Allen."

264
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,301
That's not a good name.
- Look, Barry...

265
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,345
- Are you sure I don't
go by "Bart"?

266
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,887
Can..."Bart" feels more
natural to me.

267
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,389
Can we go with Bart?

268
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,516
- Bart's kinda cool.
- Okay.

269
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,724
- Wally!
- Okay, hey.

270
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,477
Let's just get you
back in the chair.

271
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,645
- No! No, no, no.

272
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,396
I'm not...I'm not
getting in the chair.

273
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,398
No, how do I know you
didn't kidnap me here

274
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,941
to do some weird
brain surgery on me?

275
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,234
Or maybe you're like
those criminals

276
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,611
who trick people
into hotel rooms

277
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,029
so they can steal
their kidneys.

278
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,280
[gasps] Do I still
have my kidneys?

279
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,157
- We don't want your kidneys.

280
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,826
- Okay, Barry, look
at these photographs.

281
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,911
We're your friends.

282
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,247
Your family.

283
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,501
We just want to help you, okay?

284
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,385
- That's a nice ring.

285
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,927
Who's the lucky guy?

286
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,225
- You are, Barry.

287
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,768
Look, I know
you're scared, okay?

288
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,396
You can trust us.

289
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,524
- Cisco.

290
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,983
A minute.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,943
- I'm gonna be right back,
okay?

292
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,697
Wally, stay with him, okay?
- Me?

293
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,992
- So how do we know each other?

294
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,704
- Oh, I'm your brother.

295
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,837
- There is no sign of any
permanent structural damage.

296
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,882
- Then why can't
he remember anything?

297
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,634
- Julian?

298
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,135
- He appears to be suffering
from some sort

299
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,304
of psychogenic
retrograde amnesia.

300
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,931
- Amnesia.

301
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,641
- What if we didn't
account for Barry's

302
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,727
increase neural velocity
due to his super speed?

303
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,354
- Wait, do we think
he knows he's The Flash?

304
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,690
That he has super speed?

305
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,275
- Hey, Barry. Catch.

306
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,529
- Sorry.

307
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,656
- Oh, my Lord.

308
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,241
- He's, like, god-awful.
- He's pathetic.

309
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,992
- Can't we flip a switch...
undo it?

310
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,078
- Okay, we are not flipping
any more switches

311
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,162
until we figure this thing out.

312
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,457
[cell phone vibrates]

313
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,959
- It's Cecile.
Hey, babe.

314
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,462
An emergency?

315
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,089
All right, bye.

316
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,508
Okay, Cecile needs Barry
at CCPD, like, right now.

317
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,218
She says it's urgent.

318
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,387
- He can't possibly go out
in that condition.

319
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:28,683
- Okay, um, my dad and I
will take Barry to Cecile.

320
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,728
You and Cisco figure out a way
to get Barry's memory back.

321
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,811
And fast.

322
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,938
Yeah?

323
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,565
- Okay.
- Okay.

324
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,778
- You don't want to work?

325
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,613
Well then, I don't need you!

326
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,242
- Um, am I to infer that, uh,

327
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,868
you've hit a little speed bump

328
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,496
in your quest to build a device

329
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,539

microgenerator projectile.

331
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,752
No, I know. It doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.

332
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,754
- No, it doesn't. How about...

333
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,838
we call this
fancy device of yours...

334
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,716
- You know, you probably
shouldn't...

335
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,426
- Call it the...
- Speed Force Cannon.

336
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,512
- Speed Force Bazooka.

337
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,430
- Speed Force Gun.

338
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,766
[together] Speed Force Bazooka.
- Is better, yeah.

339
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:10,975
- But if the Speed Force Bazooka

340
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,560
doesn't start working soon,

341
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,728
we're gonna have to start
calling it

342
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,895
the Speed Force Epic Fail.

343
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,147
- Why? What's the problem?

344
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,816
- The accelerometer.

345
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,025
It sucks a hell of a lot
of air watts, which...

346
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,110
- Stop talking science!

347
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,154
You need to take a step back

348
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,823
from the Speed Force Bazooka.

349
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,449
- There's not time.
- There's always time!

350
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,077
Because sometimes,
to move forward,

351
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,746
you have to take a step back.

352
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,748
Step... back.

353
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,999
You see? Yes.

354
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,334
Shake a little...[mumbling]

Shake out those shoulders.

356

I feel like...oh, oh, my gosh.

357
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,130
The tension in your shoulders...

358
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,924
Think of something
that calms you.

359
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,343
- Coffee.

360
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,221
- Oh, yes.

361
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,515
- But not just any coffee.
Piping hot...

362
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,141
- Yep.

and coriander...

364

You can call me Bart.

Where's the fire?

- Ah, it's funny you should
put it like that.

383
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,813
Lucious Coolidge.
- Who?

384
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,440
- Heat Monger.

385
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,982
- The worst arsonist
Central City's seen

386

since Mick Rory
went off the grid.

That is, until Flash here
stopped him.

389

- Uh, ah, so what...
what is the problem?

390
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,243
- Judge Hankerson.

391
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,578
He's got an opening
in his docket,

392
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,371
so he moved Coolidge's
probable cause hearing

393
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,706
up to this afternoon.

394
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:57,874
Barry was the CSI on the case.

395
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,459
So I need him to testify

396
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,377
in order to hold Coolidge
over for trial.

397
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,212
- Uh, yeah, no.

398
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,672
Barry can't do that.

399
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:05,882
- Why not?

400
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,719
- Uh...

401
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,346
- What do you mean
he has amnesia?

402
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,723

403
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,225

like a Flash thing?

407
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,358
Was he battling a super villain
who used his evil powers

408
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,359
to steal Barry's memory?

409
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,027
- [laughs]

410
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,905

accidentally did this

411
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,531
to him ourselves.

412
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,032
- Why?

413
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,576
- That doesn't matter.
What does matter

414
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,620
is you stalling that judge.

415
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,789
Barry is in no condition
to testify in court.

416
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,916
- Joe, if Barry can't testify,

417
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,292
Coolidge walks.

418
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,085
And then God help us all.

out something.

down at the courthouse.

all right?

427

00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,329
It just seems like
everybody's upset

431
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,331
and it feels like it's my fault.

432
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,250
- No. No, not at all.

433
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,836
Look, we just want you
to get back to normal.

That's it, okay?

435
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,508
- Well, I would, if I could
remember what normal is.

436
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,260
I mean, what have you and I
been doing lately?

437
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,429
Are we planning the wedding?

438
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,807

Am I a warm weather guy
or a cold weather guy?

441

to worry about, okay?

I'm already feeling hungry.

some food in you.

00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,050
- What just happened to me?!

650
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,932
- These powers are so cool.

651
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,641
I can literally feel electricity

652
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,935

653
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,103
I mean, is it always like this?

00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,146
This is amazing.

655
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,566
We just walked into a buzzkill.

656
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,608

dampens the mood.

- Joe, don't.

is she doing here?

659
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,613
- She wants to help.
- Help?

660
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,241
- With what?

661
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,077
- With the fact that
I lost my powers.

662
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,955
- Barry, why don't you
give us a minute?

663
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,957
- Sure, yeah.
Are you like a super villain?

664
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,793
Just asking. Okay.

665
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,296
- How did this happen?

666
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,630
- You got rid
of Barry's memories.

667
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,092
What Barry remembers,
Savitar remembers.

668
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,885
- So Savitar's lost
his memories too?

669
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,472
- Savitar loses his memory,
he doesn't go along

670
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,014
with the plan
to give Wally powers.

671
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,640
- Cause and effect.

672
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,477
But if you let me help you
figure out how

673
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,061
to get Barry's memories back,

674
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,813
everything goes back
to the way it was.

675
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,022
- Kid Flash runs again.

676
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,774
- And Savitar survives.

677
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,443
- And Iris dies.

678
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,194
- Life's full
of difficult choices.

679
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,404
- Or it isn't.

680
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:36,863
If Savitar gets his memory back,

681
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,906
what's in it for you?

682
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,200
- That's my business.

683
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,453
You think that Barry
can become The Flash?

684
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,331
- Yeah. He can learn.

685
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,373
- I still know how
to do everything.

686
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,374
I can teach him.

687
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,875
- Okay.

688
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,919
Maybe this is how
you defeat Savitar.

689
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,006
But there's still
a lot of villains

690

in this city, and no Flashes
to protect it.

Is that really a chance
you're willing to take?

692

- Hi.

693

- I'm still here.
- Yeah, you are.

694
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,270
- Because when you left,
I stayed.

695

But you know what, I...

I have a job to do.

we had this very

So anyway, we were struggling,

746
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,308
and we were burning
the midnight oil,

747

"Come on, you dumb-nium
