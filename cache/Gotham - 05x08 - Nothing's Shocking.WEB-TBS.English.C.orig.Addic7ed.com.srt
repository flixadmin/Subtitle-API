1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,128
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:06,398 --> 00:00:07,614
Alfred.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,273
- The manor.
- It's my fault.

4
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:11,636
Mr. Cobblepot.

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,881
This never would have happened
if you stayed with me!

6
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:19,673
You're having a baby with Barbara.

7
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:20,938
<i>You don't think I'm fit</i>

8
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,240
- to be a mother?
- What do you think?

9
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:25,576
- You're leaving Gotham.
<i>- I believe the time</i>

10
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:28,403
<i>has come for a change of scenery.</i>

11
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:30,197
You found a way out of Gotham?

12
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:31,740
It's a submarine.

13
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,576
Reunification with the mainland hangs on

14
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:38,330
<i>by a thread. Toxic chemicals
rain down onto the city,</i>

15
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>and the government
cuts us adrift for good.</i>

16
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:44,086
<i>Gotham's Golden Rule.</i>

17
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:45,504
No heroes.

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,005
No heroes.

19
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:48,382
Watch out for him.

20
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,767
He thinks he's a white knight.

21
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:53,103
<i>He's a loose cannon.</i>

22
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:13,949
You two here to pick up
your grandchildren?

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,033
Come on, Babs.

24
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,294
You got the only full bar in Gotham.

25
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,823
And if you two dinosaurs want
to keep coming here,

26
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:21,456
you better up your intel.

27
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:24,876
We got a lead on
some black market heating oil.

28
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:28,922
One drink.

29
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,975
To share.

30
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,310
Then you can go wheeze to death
somewhere else.

31
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:43,654
Would you look at that?

32
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:47,992
Dix! Look at you,

33
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:51,508
up and walking around,
you old son of a bitch.

34
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,905
I've been looking for you two
for a while now.

35
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,499
Well, you found us.

36
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:58,910
You two ever think about the past?

37
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,838
What we did?

38
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:03,165
What are you talking about, Dix?

39
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,916
About her.

40
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:08,053
About what we did to the girl.

41
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:12,683
Who is that? It is like

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,436
the living dead in here. Enough of this.

43
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:23,360
Hey, Gramps!

44
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:25,353
Oh!

45
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:34,152

46
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:38,465
Can you please repeat
your story for Mr. Wayne, madam?

47
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:41,787
We live in the shelter on West End.

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,044
There are so many of us
crammed in there. Uh...

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,960
so much uncertainty, fear.

50
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:51,664
And with the river poisoned,
it should've been awful,

51
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:54,167
but... people came together,

52
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:55,960
made it a home.

53
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,716
What happened?

54
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:59,853
Couple of weeks ago, we...

55
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:02,841
heard rumors about something
underneath the building...

56
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:05,718
...where it connects to the sewer.

57
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,765
Then people started going missing.

58
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:12,090
Hank, my husband,

59
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,641
wanted to look for them.

60
00:03:17,276 --> 00:03:19,168
Said we were a family.

61
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,826
So the two of you
went searching for them.

62
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,559
It was so dark.

63
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:27,519
I didn't see what attacked us.

64
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:29,947
I hit my head.

65
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:32,783
And when I woke up, Hank was gone.

66
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,396
Please, Mr. Wayne.

67
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,428
We have a daughter.

68
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,871
We'll do everything we can.

69
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,960
Should we tell Gordon?

70
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:54,265
He's stretched thin as it is.

71
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,173
Alfred, we don't know who
or what is down there.

72
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,994
We know there's a man
down there, in danger,

73
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,064
and we know this lady sent for us.

74
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:05,149
So go on, then. What do
you think we should do?

75
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,776
Let's go find him.

76
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:14,054
Under normal circumstances,
I wouldn't call you

77
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:15,663
for a couple of stiffs.

78
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:17,976
What do you normally do when a couple
of your patrons get stabbed?

79
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:19,253
Bury the bodies.

80
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,023
Find out who did it and
then bury those bodies.

81
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:23,163
See, that's not something
you should be telling a cop.

82
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,998
We're living
in a different world, Harvey.

83
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:28,031
- So why<i> did</i> you call us?
- Take a look.

84
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:33,789
Boggs and Lewis.

85
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,136
You know them?

86
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:36,554
They were cops.

87
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:37,766
They were gone before you joined.

88
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:39,313
- What happened?
- They came around,

89
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:41,219
peddling third-rate intel.

90
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,000
It was closing time, so I let 'em in.

91
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:45,213
And then some other fossil knifed them.

92
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:46,500
You saw him?

93
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,390
Yeah, he must've snuck in.
Looked like a cop, too.

94
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:49,570
These two knew him.

95
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:51,278
Bartender said they called him

96
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:53,071
Micks... Hicks...

97
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:55,783
- Dix?
- Maybe.

98
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,056
No way.

99
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:00,105
Dix was Harvey's old partner.

100
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,030
Well, there we go. Case closed.

101
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,592
So you're telling me this guy
rolled in here in a wheelchair,

102
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,232
stabbed these two, and rolled on out?

103
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,180
He wasn't in a wheelchair.

104
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:09,756
Then it couldn't be Dix.
He's been paralyzed

105
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,850
for the last 15 years.

106
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,824
Harvey, you're confusing me
with someone who cares.

107
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,672
I called you as a courtesy.
And now I'm wishing

108
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,340
I just dumped these two
corpses in an alley.

109
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,133
Do we even know
if Dix is still in Gotham

110
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,599
after the bridges blew?

111
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,140
I heard he moved into an
apartment about a year ago.

112
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:28,382
I meant to check up on him,
but... it can't be him.

113
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,576
I hear what you're saying,
but we should still talk to him.

114
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,209
Maybe he knows something.

115
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,283
Fine.

116
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:44,084
How are you feeling?

117
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,753
- I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
- Look,

118
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,747
I've been giving you space,

119
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:50,237
but we have to talk
about how this is gonna work.

120
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,768
I'm gonna be a part of this kid's life.

121
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:53,721
Oh, you seem pretty confident
about that.

122
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:54,914
I am.

123
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,648
Reunification's gonna happen.

124
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:57,905
You should think
about what kind of person

125
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,603
you want to be when it does.

126
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,886
It's a chance for you to start anew.

127
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,347
I like who I am.

128
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,274
Uh-huh.

129
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:41,755
You were due hours ago.

130
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:43,403
Yes, I was.

131
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,008
But I had to get us lunch.

132
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,515
- And I met Dale.
- I see that.

133
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:48,888
Do you see this?

134
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:52,687
Our<i> secret</i> plan to get off this island.

135
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:53,842
Relax.

136
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,425
Dale is completely trustworthy.

137
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:58,715
How do you know we can trust him
if you just met him?

138
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,218
Because he's mute and dumb as a post.

139
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,042
Look, I know you're paranoid
about people watching us.

140
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:07,316
Someone<i> is</i> watching us!

141
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:11,019
Why do you think I installed
this alarm system?

142
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,530
And as safe as I feel

143
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,816
with your jingle bell
contraption in place,

144
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,901
I went out and procured us some muscle.

145
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:20,153
You're welcome.

146
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:22,239
At least you're doing something.

147
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,782
Ah.

148
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:27,085
How's my SS<i> Gertrud</i> coming along?

149
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:30,330
<i>Our</i> submarine is coming along
just fine, thank you.

150
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:32,082
I've been working on the sonar,

151
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,167
which, turns out, is...

152
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,564
far more complex than I anticipated.

153
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,056
Well, I am confident
you will figure it out.

154
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,844
Of course I will figure it out.

155
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:47,598
Because I figure everything out.

156
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,859
The navigation system.

157
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:51,861
The oxygen exchange.

158
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,270
I will figure everything out,

159
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,198
because I'm the only one working!

160
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,675
This was supposed to be a partnership.

161
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,035
It is!

162
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,278
I already did my part

163
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,330
by stealing everything valuable
in Gotham,

164
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:05,627
- of which you get half!
- No!

165
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:06,823
Your goons stole it,

166
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,786
and then you killed 'em.

167
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:11,955
Are you expecting someone?

168
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,472
Who would I be expecting, Oswald?

169
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,217
I told you someone's watching us.

170
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,636
Dale, go do what I pay you for.

171
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:21,675
Protect us!

172
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:26,137
Wait!

173
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:29,380
Penn?

174
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,935
Hello, Mr. Cobblepot.

175
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,283
Are you... are you really... I...

176
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,615
I-I don't believe it. Y-You're alive.

177
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,452
Indeed, sir. I-I am.

178
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:45,640
But you-you were shot. I-I was there.

179
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:46,915
This whole time,

180
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,083
I thought you were dead,

181
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,642
but you're alive!

182
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,465
You're only coming to me<i> now?!</i>

183
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,925
I-I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

184
00:08:57,002 --> 00:09:00,343
I wanted to come see you, but...

185
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:03,474
he wouldn't let me.

186
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,975
"He"?

187
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:06,977
"He" who?

188
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:09,951
Mr. Cobblepot...

189
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:13,843
...this...

190
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,287
is...

191
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:21,616
...Mr. Scarface.

192
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:32,452
Wonderful.

193
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,170
<i>Look, I'm sure Dix is in the clear,</i>

194
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:39,312
but we do have to ask.

195
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,805
That's not it.

196
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:45,057
I just... I feel bad.

197
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:47,774
I should've been by before.
I'm all he's got.

198
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,394
Well, look,

199
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:51,521
what can you do, right?

200
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,695
Dix!

201
00:09:58,772 --> 00:09:59,914
What the hell?!

202
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,082
Bullock?

203
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:02,491
That you?

204
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,700
Yeah!

205
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:04,919
Don't shoot!

206
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,420
Okay.

207
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:08,997
Come in.

208
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,333
Uh-huh.

209
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,427
Is that the way
you always answer a door?

210
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:16,517
Nowadays, you can't be too careful.

211
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,433
Especially someone like me.

212
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:19,749
A kid comes in,

213
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:21,269
he'd cut my throat for a cup of soup.

214
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:22,366
Uh-huh.

215
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,890
Anyway, I wasn't expecting you.

216
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,599
Figured you forgot about me.

217
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,178
Look, partner,

218
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:30,945
when the bridges came down,
I got busy and...

219
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,605
Oh, sure, sure. You forgot me.

220
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,291
Everybody forgets.

221
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:36,951
I didn't forget.

222
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:40,558
Planning on taking a trip?

223
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,864
Maybe.

224
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,624
I like to keep a bag
packed, just in case.

225
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:46,218
Yeah? Where were you last night?

226
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:47,461
Where was I?

227
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:49,246
I was right here.

228
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:50,356
Anybody else here with you?

229
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,082
Anybody that can back up your story?

230
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,165
You're asking me
if I was out there killing

231
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,345
Boggs and Lewis?

232
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,977
Does it look like I was out
there killing Boggs and Lewis?

233
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,145
So you heard about that?

234
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,449
Let me tell you something.

235
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,814
If it meant

236
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,474
that I can get out of
this son of a bitch wheelchair,

237
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:13,812
I would confess right here
and now to Boggs, to Lewis,

238
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:15,788
to anybody you want me to confess to.

239
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:18,366
All right, fine.
But you were a detective.

240
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:19,827
What would you say if you were us?

241
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:22,491
We come in here, you're
packing a suitcase.

242
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:27,081
I would say either I did it,
which I didn't,

243
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:30,954
or I'd be very worried that I'd be next.

244
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:32,694
What do you mean, you being next?

245
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:35,009
What's your connection
to Boggs and Lewis?

246
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:38,295
Come on. What?

247
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,591
Nothing. I just worked
with them. That's it.

248
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:47,229
We, uh... we worked a case together.

249
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:49,765
The four of you?

250
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,433
Yeah.

251
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,099
Dix wasn't my partner then.

252
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:56,146
I was a rookie cop.

253
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,856
Wet behind the ears.

254
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:58,815
So what was the case?

255
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,317
Woman killed her husband.

256
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:03,487
As far as I can remember,
it was pretty open and shut.

257
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:06,206
But at least we can agree
that Dix didn't walk

258
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:08,441
into The Sirens and stab those two guys.

259
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:13,081
So who did? Barbara said Boggs
and Lewis recognized the killer.

260
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:14,463
They called him "Dix."

261
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,416
We come in here, he's packing
a suitcase, he shoots at us.

262
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,955
This stinks, Harvey.

263
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,740
Hey.

264
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,297
You all right?

265
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:43,146
What the hell?

266
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,638
These basements run
along Gotham's sewers.

267
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:03,365
The river is right next to it.

268
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:05,848
You mean the river filled
with Jeremiah's toxins?

269
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,329
Who knows what kind of damage
these chemicals could do?

270
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,081
Yeah, you're right.

271
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,336
Just don't you touch anything.

272
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:31,712
Hold on.

273
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,197
Oh.

274
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,208
Bite marks.

275
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:48,785
Animal?

276
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,788
Well, it's no human I've ever seen.

277
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,799
Whatever it was...

278
00:13:55,655 --> 00:13:57,664
...it dragged him that way.

279
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:01,673
Seems like human skin.

280
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,967
Here's the file you asked for.

281
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,302
Victoria Cartwright.

282
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,614
- How'd you, uh...?
- I had Harper

283
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,556
run every case the four of you worked,

284
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,568
cross-referenced with any woman
that killed her husband.

285
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,561
Do I need to read it, or are
you gonna tell me what's in it?

286
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,188
Victoria Cartwright was a banker.

287
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,024
She led a very boring life.

288
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,859
Until she snapped and

289
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:23,820
put two .38 caliber slugs
into her husband.

290
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,405
End of story.

291
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,567
You guys rehearse that?

292
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,089
Says there was no physical evidence.

293
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,706
She was convicted on the statement

294
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:37,834
of her seven-year-old daughter, Jane.

295
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,253
This was 20 years ago. Where's Jane now?

296
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:42,114
What's the point? The killer's a man.

297
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:44,348
A man that can imitate friggin' faces.

298
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:45,983
What was the name
of the guy that Strange

299
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,390
got to imitate you? A Basil something?

300
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,107
That's who we should be looking for.

301
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:52,249
That was different, and you know it.

302
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:53,663
Do we have an address for this Jane?

303
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,102
No. But the family's old
home is in the Green Zone,

304
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:58,806
- just east of the clinic.
- Jim, it's a dead end.

305
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,493
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

306
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,278
You know what? Why don't you hang back?

307
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:08,246
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. You benching me?

308
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,792
Killer's still out there.
Keep an eye on your partner.

309
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,966
Penn. Arnold.

310
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:23,872
It's... Arthur.

311
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,808
You're holding a doll.

312
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,802
It's not a doll.

313
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:31,062
It's a dummy.

314
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,257
Oh, this is great.

315
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,571
I'm going back to work.

316
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,696
- Excuse me.
- You're saying

317
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,218
he made you come here?

318
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,512
Mr. Scarface is very persuasive.

319
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,066
Persuasive?

320
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,548
He made me tell him about your...

321
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,073
Treasure.

322
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,714
Penn...

323
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,222
I think you need a rest.

324
00:15:57,995 --> 00:15:59,797
And perhaps a psychiatrist.

325
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,975
Then we can discuss
you resuming your former duties.

326
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,080
Obviously, I won't pay you
for the time you were gone.

327
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,726
Shut your piehole!

328
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,347
This the one you were telling me about?

329
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:14,472
Punk who thinks he's in charge?

330
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:15,517
Yes, sir.

331
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,302
That's Mr. Cobblepot.

332
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:20,555
Oswald, if you don't
make him leave, I will.

333
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:23,725
- Yeah.
- No one's going anywheres.

334
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:25,236
Penn,

335
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:28,431
show these dewdroppers we're serious.

336
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,123
Forgive me.

337
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:42,418
Now, let's talk turkey...

338
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:45,026
turkeys.

339
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:52,020
- What a mess, huh?
- Yeah.

340
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,727
Boggs and Lewis were
idiots, complete idiots.

341
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,482
They should've known when
they see a guy walking,

342
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:00,453
that it ain't me.

343
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,463
You think the Cartwright girl
said something?

344
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,792
How would I know?

345
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:10,964
So, how you been
since the bridges came down?

346
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,287
You getting enough food?

347
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,542
Medicine?

348
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,388
What if I said "no"?

349
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,669
I'd feel like crap.

350
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:21,618
Then no.

351
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:27,388
The Cartwright girl is dead.

352
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:32,380
A buddy of mine, who was a screw
over at Arkham, he said

353
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,857
she was an inmate there, and
she died a couple of years ago,

354
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,122
so this has nothing to do with her.

355
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:52,239
GCPD!

356
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:54,074
Coming in.

357
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,669
Check upstairs.

358
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,433
Looks like this place

359
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,839
has been abandoned since
before the bridges came down.

360
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:23,511
Yeah.

361
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,008
What the hell?

362
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:23,048
What the hell was that?

363
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:21,671
Someone's been living here.

364
00:20:21,748 --> 00:20:23,974
What's that smell?

365
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,801
Everything all right?

366
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,533
All good. No one's here.

367
00:20:50,838 --> 00:20:52,396
Hey!

368
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:07,860
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!

369
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:15,517
We found your handiwork.

370
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,250
Nothing to say?

371
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:27,171
You're gonna have to take that mask off.

372
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:31,207
The only way you're gonna keep
that mask on is if you talk.

373
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,717
<i>Otherwise,
I'm gonna reach over this table,</i>

374
00:21:32,787 --> 00:21:35,021
<i>and I'm gonna rip it off of your face.</i>

375
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:41,668
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

376
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:44,054
You're not Jane Cartwright?

377
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:47,789
Because you were in her childhood home.

378
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:50,684
You're about the right age.

379
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:52,938
Talk to me, Jane.

380
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:55,803
I know after your mother

381
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,852
was convicted, you ended up
a ward of the state.

382
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,418
In and out of institutions
until you ended up in Arkham.

383
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,997
Then you vanished.

384
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,137
Some say died.

385
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,002
What happened to you?

386
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,669
Me?

387
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:14,765
Nothing happened to me.

388
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,200
Okay.

389
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:22,459
What happened to Jane?

390
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:24,900
Oh.

391
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,907
Lots happened to Jane.

392
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:37,195
She was taken from Arkham.

393
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,921
Down, down...

394
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,226
down, the doctor did things to her,

395
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:43,968
experiments on her and others.

396
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:46,705
You're talking about Hugo Strange?

397
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,406
You were taken to Indian Hill?

398
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:53,102
The professor was obsessed
with the power to change.

399
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:55,993
The way a chameleon
would change its skin.

400
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,406
He wanted humans to have that power.

401
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,127
He made it so Jane
could change her skin...

402
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:05,316
her bones, her hair,
the color of her eyes.

403
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:07,525
All it takes is a single touch,

404
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:10,043
and her body becomes a mirror.

405
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:14,196
When it's done, she sheds
her skin and starts anew.

406
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,163
It remembers everyone it touched.

407
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,517
It's touched you, Detective.

408
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:30,168
<i>We can help you, Ms. Cartwright.</i>

409
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:33,510
Jane Cartwright is dead.

410
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:36,276
She died in Arkham.

411
00:23:39,357 --> 00:23:41,763
That's when Jane Doe was born.

412
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:46,638
So why kill all these cops?

413
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:51,402
Do you want to know why they died?

414
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:57,231
Ask your friend.

415
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:47,808
What is that?

416
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:58,809
Aw.

417
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,505
We should head out.

418
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,424
My battery's dying.

419
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,588
Please. He's coming. He's coming.

420
00:25:10,654 --> 00:25:13,502
- Who's coming? What happened?
- He's going to kill me.

421
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:16,268
I barely got away.

422
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,565
- Are you Hank?
- Yes.

423
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,338
Your wife sent us.

424
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:22,847
- Is anyone else left alive down here?
- They're all dead.

425
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,822
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

426
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:28,909
Oh, God. Oh, God.

427
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,014
Oh, God.

428
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:56,195
Hank!

429
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,333
Hank! Hold on, Hank!

430
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,359
Hand over the heaters!

431
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:10,205
If you don't mind.

432
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:14,210
Mr. Penn, can't we
just talk this through?

433
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:16,129
Get back!

434
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:17,909
I'm so sorry.

435
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:22,116
At least tell me what
happened after Haven.

436
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,350
Help me to understand...

437
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:25,952
this.

438
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,234
Go on.

439
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:31,796
Sing your song.

440
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:35,951
After I was shot...

441
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:39,272
I woke up in the GCPD morgue.

442
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:42,072
I was alone.

443
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:46,368
I patched my wounds
as best I could and crawled out.

444
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,717
I hid in a store.

445
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,040
An abandoned magic shop.

446
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:56,373
That's where Mr. Scarface found me.

447
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,357
And he told me all about you.

448
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:03,469
How you used him.

449
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:06,375
Chewed him up and spat him out.

450
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:09,312
Treated him like a palooka!

451
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,414
That's a lie!

452
00:27:10,476 --> 00:27:13,738
Oh, please, Oswald. It's what you do.

453
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:14,854
Arnold...

454
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:16,957
Arthur.

455
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,098
What do you want?

456
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:20,109
I don't want anything.

457
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:23,693
But Mr. Scarface, well...

458
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,419
...he wants your treasure.

459
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,479
And...

460
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:30,052
to be boss.

461
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:34,040
Really?

462
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:38,804
The-the dummy wants to be
the boss of Gotham?

463
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,316
Bingo! Now, give me the key

464
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,320
- to your treasure room.
- Why would I do that?

465
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:45,268
You're obviously gonna kill me anyway.

466
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:47,601
What am I doing?

467
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:49,842
I'm talking to a doll.

468
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,031
Dummy.

469
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,143
- Seriously?
- You know what, Oswald?

470
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:54,821
Honestly, you deserve this.

471
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:57,884
- Nobody asked you.
- You are opportunistic,

472
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:01,017
your loyalty is... shaky, at best,

473
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:04,831
and you will hurt anyone,
anyone to get what you want.

474
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:09,769
I hardly think you're
one to throw stones!

475
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,115
- Listen, Penn...
- Eyes down here, pal.

476
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,678
Sorry.

477
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:17,881
Mr. Scarface, I got a question for you.

478
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,230
Shoot.

479
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:23,439
After you get your...

480
00:28:23,464 --> 00:28:25,793
tiny wooden hands on that treasure,

481
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:26,846
what are you gonna do?

482
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,229
Where are you gonna go?

483
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,064
People are gonna come
after you eventually.

484
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,992
Then I'll, uh...

485
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,346
I'll take 'em all on! Yeah.

486
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:37,941
- Show 'em who's boss.
- Ah.

487
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:40,601
You wouldn't have to do that

488
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,765
if you could get off this
island, now, would you?

489
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,648
What are you doing?

490
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:47,781
Shut it! Let the smart one talk.

491
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,003
How do<i> you</i> feel...

492
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,210
about submarines?

493
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:00,762
What are we doing here?

494
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:02,847
I just wanted to take us, uh,

495
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:04,807
someplace quiet

496
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:07,694
where we could talk.

497
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:12,771
- We did a bad thing.
- Oh, come on, not that again.

498
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,308
We put a killer in jail, all right?

499
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,785
What do you keep moping about?

500
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,998
She was guilty.
She got what she deserved.

501
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:21,239
Drop it.

502
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,169
Did you get what <i>you</i> deserved?

503
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,368
What?

504
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:27,548
You made that girl into a murderer.

505
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:30,050
Oh, come on.

506
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:31,459
You...

507
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:34,003
your friends...

508
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,956
- the kid.
- Come on, you're...

509
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:39,300
I'm gonna make sure you
never do that again.

510
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,375
Harper, where's Dix?

511
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:49,644
I saw Bullock take him in the back.

512
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,461
Barbara. What are you doing here?

513
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:55,303
Seems my bartender overheard
the killer say something

514
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,373
before he ice-picked Harvey's pals.

515
00:29:57,398 --> 00:29:59,194
I thought I'd be a good citizen.

516
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:00,873
Okay.

517
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,966
"The kid's guilty, too."

518
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:04,425
The kid.

519
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:08,616
Listen... what you said before,

520
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,694
about me being a known criminal.

521
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:13,251
I was on some list your army buddy had.

522
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:15,585
When the government rolls in,
am I gonna be arrested?

523
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,780
Honestly, I don't know.

524
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:19,547
But that would work out for you, right?

525
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:22,088
I go to jail. You get the baby.

526
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,536
I don't want that.

527
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,719
Is that a promise?

528
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:27,704
I go straight, I'm clear?

529
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:29,041
Stay right here.

530
00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:31,956
Hey, Harvey, where'd you take Dix?

531
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:34,292
I didn't take Dix anywhere.

532
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,687
Oh, God. Oh.

533
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,558
She got into your locker.
Must have taken your clothes.

534
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:47,695
We have to lock down the GCPD.

535
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:50,804
Hey, Harvey.

536
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:53,149
We'll find her.

537
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:54,575
Come on.

538
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,491
Look at the size of it.

539
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,652
Living down here,

540
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:06,700
the toxins in the river

541
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:08,614
must have driven him mad.
Get out of here! Now!

542
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,945
Alfred!

543
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:45,626
- I'm sorry!
- Alfred!

544
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,393
Alfred! Stop!

545
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:50,338
Stop. Stop...

546
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:04,466
All right, everybody, listen up.

547
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:07,532
GCPD is now in lockdown.

548
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:10,764
Nobody goes in or out unless I say so.

549
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:12,172
She could look like anybody by now.

550
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,830
How are we supposed to find her?

551
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:16,429
Jim!

552
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,886
Barbara? What happened?

553
00:32:18,963 --> 00:32:21,207
What do you mean, what happened?
I've been attacked.

554
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,551
Where'd she go?

555
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:23,920
Wait a minute.

556
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:26,819
How do we know it's really you?

557
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,041
Seriously?

558
00:32:29,371 --> 00:32:31,303
This isn't proof enough?

559
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,492
- What the hell?
- That's her.

560
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,224
She's the imposter. Shoot her!

561
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:41,433
It's me, you idiot.

562
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:43,805
That sounds like Barbara.

563
00:32:45,454 --> 00:32:47,672
Barbara.

564
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,725
Tell me where we first met.

565
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:55,614
Don't shoot.

566
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,449
I'm leaving here.

567
00:32:57,525 --> 00:33:00,327
Anyone tries to follow me, she dies.

568
00:33:02,122 --> 00:33:04,289
- Shoot her.
- We can't risk it.

569
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,110
Stay back!

570
00:33:09,982 --> 00:33:11,798
Bullock, wait!

571
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,886
I'm fine.

572
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,105
All right, take her to my office.

573
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,549
- Don't let her out of your sight.
- Okay.

574
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,008
I cannot believe that you
told him about the sub.

575
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,282
And that you're playing
along with his psychosis.

576
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,232
Obviously, he was gonna kill you.

577
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,368
I bought us time.

578
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:46,611
I have an idea.

579
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:48,712
If you can just keep him busy
and wait for the signal.

580
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,322
Wait, what's the signal?

581
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:51,733
Quit your jawing.

582
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,580
So...

583
00:33:54,657 --> 00:34:00,178
Mr. Scarface and I
have discussed our options.

584
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,548
And the submarine
sounds like a good plan.

585
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:05,453
And since we'll need

586
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,852
the smart one to build this hayburner,

587
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,096
he can keep sucking air.

588
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,357
But Penguin ain't so lucky.

589
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:15,858
Do it, Penn.

590
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:17,860
Ventilate that mook.

591
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,565
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.
- Oh.

592
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,704
I wish things would've
turned out differently.

593
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:29,309
Arthur, I want you to listen
to what I'm saying.

594
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,742
You accuse me of manipulating you,
but what about him?

595
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:34,087
I never asked you to kill anybody.

596
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:37,767
- That is true.
- Hey.

597
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:40,877
Think of everything
that we went through together.

598
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,751
Sofia Falcone.

599
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,665
Getting cut off
from the mainland. Starving.

600
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:47,923
You mean Penn was starving!

601
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:52,226
Fighting for scraps
while your dog ate steak.

602
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:55,299
I welcomed you into my home.

603
00:34:56,283 --> 00:35:00,146
And yes, I was not a good friend.

604
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,865
To you or to anyone.

605
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:07,019
It's why I'm alone.

606
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,088
But I saw you for what you are,

607
00:35:11,113 --> 00:35:13,428
and I valued that.

608
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,203
That must be worth something.

609
00:35:19,511 --> 00:35:21,533
Applesauce!

610
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:23,994
You're a liar and a thief.

611
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:26,714
All you do is take,

612
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:28,136
take...

613
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:29,714
Take.

614
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:32,401
And you never give anything.

615
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:35,209
You worked me to the bone.

616
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,312
Forced me to be your puppet.

617
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:41,152
Well, no more.

618
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:45,856
You hear me?

619
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:49,317
No more.

620
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:55,955
Take that. And that.

621
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,306
No.

622
00:36:09,054 --> 00:36:11,238
Mr. Cobblepot.

623
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:14,598
You freed me.

624
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:17,505
How can I ever thank you?

625
00:36:17,584 --> 00:36:20,373
Aah!

626
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:26,527
Why did you do that?

627
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:28,855
He wasn't the threat.
The dummy was the threat.

628
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:30,746
Oswald.

629
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:34,312
I accept you for the
person that you are.

630
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:38,325
Just as you accept me for
the cold logician that I am.

631
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:41,396
That's why this friendship is great.

632
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,669
And as friends,

633
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:46,083
I think we can both
agree that that lunatic

634
00:36:46,108 --> 00:36:48,159
had to be stopped.

635
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:56,515
Perhaps, Edward...

636
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:59,477
we really are meant for each other.

637
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,967
Jane.

638
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:29,974
I know you're up here.

639
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:47,788
Jane. I knew you'd be here.

640
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,912
I'm sorry.

641
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:55,500
It was my job to protect you,
and I let you down.

642
00:37:57,002 --> 00:37:59,955
You made Jane into a killer.

643
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:03,874
You and your friends.
There have to be consequences.

644
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:07,116
You killed three men already.
When is it enough?

645
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:09,931
When you're dead.

646
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:12,880
Put the gun down!

647
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:15,288
Shoot me.

648
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:19,639
You killed Jane years ago,
and you didn't even know it.

649
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:21,764
Just shoot me.

650
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:31,340
Let me see your face.

651
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,905
Your real face.

652
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,741
Why? So you can see
what a monster she is?

653
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:44,598
Hugo Strange only destroyed her face.

654
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:46,774
You destroyed her soul.

655
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,571
Let me see it.

656
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:17,765
You see?

657
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:20,835
You see what they did?

658
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,247
Jane...

659
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:31,233
we can work this out.

660
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:32,936
Just put the gun down.

661
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:36,256
The only way this ends is
with one of us dead.

662
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,126
Oh, Hank, thank God you're alive.

663
00:39:56,204 --> 00:39:58,790
The nurse thinks the man that
attacked us will never recover.

664
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:00,111
The toxins in the river

665
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:02,782
have done irreparable damage
to his brain.

666
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:04,415
I just think it's a
shame we couldn't save

667
00:40:04,454 --> 00:40:07,076
the rest of the people who
went missing, Master Bruce.

668
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:09,403
We should've went to Gordon
from the start.

669
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,801
- We were reckless.
- Ah, that's nonsense.

670
00:40:11,872 --> 00:40:14,456
We took decisive action.
We saved a man's life.

671
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:16,196
The people in this city
have suffered, Master Bruce.

672
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:19,011
They need someone that
will protect them.

673
00:40:20,844 --> 00:40:22,640
I agree.

674
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:26,681
But there are better ways
to find absolution.

675
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:31,291
I, um, I don't follow.

676
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:34,191
What happened to Wayne Manor
wasn't your fault.

677
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:37,746
I know you've been blaming yourself.

678
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,800
You didn't destroy our home, Alfred.

679
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:42,693
But I feel like I did.

680
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,568
I feel like I wasn't strong enough

681
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:48,357
to fight Tetch or that bastard Valeska.

682
00:40:49,685 --> 00:40:51,928
I feel like because of my weakness,

683
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:54,968
you lost your last tie to the past.

684
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,430
You lost your home, Master Bruce.

685
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:04,755
I must never be that weak again.

686
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:10,884
Part of being a family
is that we can be strong

687
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:12,866
for each other.

688
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,647
And when did you get so smart?

689
00:41:21,157 --> 00:41:23,139
I had a good teacher.

690
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,641
Victoria Cartwright killed her husband.

691
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:33,349
After we arrested her, she admitted it.

692
00:41:33,845 --> 00:41:35,550
Later, she recanted.

693
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:38,768
But the physical evidence wasn't there.

694
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:41,808
I was a new cop.
I wanted to make detective.

695
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:44,245
So you leaned on Jane.

696
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,900
Coerced a statement out of
her to put her mother away.

697
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:50,324
The woman was guilty.

698
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:54,136
Later I found out the husband...

699
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,943
beat the mother and Jane.

700
00:41:57,673 --> 00:41:59,711
I didn't know till after.

701
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:06,047
The bartender overheard Jane
say something about,

702
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:07,754
"the kid's guilty, too."

703
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,731
She meant the young cop.

704
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,048
She meant you.

705
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,108
I knew something was wrong.

706
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:21,465
I felt it.

707
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,957
I said something, and they told me
to keep my trap shut,

708
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:28,812
just close the case, put a bow on it.

709
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:34,471
After a while, I stopped feeling it.

710
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:38,648
And I went down that path
for a long time

711
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,281
until I met you.

712
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,540
However much I've changed...

713
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:51,227
I can't change the past.

714
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,879
I made that girl a killer.

715
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,793
What do you want from me, Harvey?

716
00:43:00,562 --> 00:43:02,614
Forgiveness?

717
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,714
Can't give that to you.

718
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:11,058
I just needed you to know.

719
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:31,128
