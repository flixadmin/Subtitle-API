Alma.

00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
Okay, Alma.

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,720
We're going to the hospital.
We'll be there shortly.

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,400
Don't worry, you'll be okay.

28
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,160
I think I've been selling weed to a cop.

00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,800
What?

30
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,720
She set a trap for me.

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,800
Plus, there's a weird car outside,

32
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,200
which is bound to be undercover,
and they're going to arrest us all, David.

33
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,880
Greta, calm down, okay? Where's the car?

34
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
On the street.

35
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,240
It's not undercover.

36
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,800
The neighbors bought a new car.

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,600
-It's all right.
-I swear, I want to die!

38
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,760
It's all right, Greta, okay?
But I need you to focus

39
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,360
and tell me what happened
from the beginning, okay?

40
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,360
Don't lie to me. It's important.

41
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
Hi, Alma.

42
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,360
How are you feeling?

43
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,800
Well...

44
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,520
The tests turned out well.
You were very lucky.

45
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,720
There are no fractures
or internal bleeding,

46
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,560
but we'll keep you in observation
until tomorrow at least.

47
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,720
-Okay?
-Okay.

48
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,880
Are my parents here?

49
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,840
Yes, I spoke to your father.

50
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,560
Don't worry.

51
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
I'll let him in for a moment.

52
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,560
Let's see.

53
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,880
Good.

54
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
I'll take off the neck brace.
You don't need it anymore.

55
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,480
Here's your father, honey.

56
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,760
Just for a moment.

57
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Dad.

58
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,800
-Hi.
-Hi.

59
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,000
How are you?

60
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
Okay.

61
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,480
Almost... Nothing broken.

62
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,360
Having such a hard head
has its advantages.

63
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,680
How did you get run over?

64
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,560
I was running and didn't look.

65
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,080
I wanted to get to the protest with Mom.

66
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,600
-She knows I'm okay, right?
-Yes, of course.

67
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
She's with Pablito at home.
She said to give you a kiss.

68
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,200
Hey, maybe I can leave, right?

69
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,640
-I'm fine.
-Yes.

70
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,760
On my back,
like when you were sick that time.

71
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,080
Remember?

72
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
Get some rest.

73
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,720
I'll come get you in the morning.

74
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,760
{\an8}ALBERTO:
ARE YOU AWAKE?

75
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,880
{\an8}ALBERTO: I CAN'T SLEEP.
DAMMIT, THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL

76
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
-Can I have some water?
-Not now, hon.

77
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,520
The doctor will be here soon,

78
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
and she decides
if you can eat or drink anything.

79
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,000
-Get some rest, all right?
-Okay.

80
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,880
Berta?

81
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,960
Is that you?

82
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,520
It's Alma.

83
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,400
Why are you here?

84
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,360
I got hit by a car.

85
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,760
You?

86
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,960
Well...

87
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,640
I tried to kill myself.

88
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,040
<i>We'll probably stay for dinner
and be back late.</i>

89
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,160
<i>-No parties.
-No, don't worry.</i>

90
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,840
<i>-Besides, I have some work to finish.
-Well...</i>

91
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,160
<i>Hungry, boy?</i>

92
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,080
Take care of them, okay?

93
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,760
I got 112 pills ready.

94
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,040
What a contradiction, right?

95
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,400
One hundred and twelve.

96
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,680
It's amazing you're okay.

97
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,680
I didn't take them all.

98
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,160
My mom came home
before she was supposed to.

99
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
I think that

100
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,960
she had a feeling
I was going to try again.

101
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,560
You already tried?

102
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,880
Twice.

103
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
Dammit, Berta.

104
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,720
But

105
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,360
why?

106
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,520
I can't take it anymore.

107
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,520
I can't cope
with another fucking breakdown.

108
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,920
I can't do it.

109
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,080
I can't cope with the panic attacks,

110
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,640
with the shakes,

111
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,840
the diarrhea, the vomiting...

112
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't look at me like I was sick.

113
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm not.

114
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
It's been like that
since he started raping me.

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
Who?

116
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,840
You know him.

117
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm sure he still teaches you history.

118
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,240
What?

119
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,200
It all started with my parents' divorce.

120
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,880
<i>It was a horrible time.</i>

121
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,800
<i>I was so fucked up.</i>

122
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,080
Shit!

123
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,240
I hate you!

124
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,080
Son of a bitch!

125
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,760
<i>He was the only one</i>

126
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,040
<i>who noticed.</i>

127
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,120
<i>He was nice to me. He...</i>

128
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
-Hi there.
-Hi.

129
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,440
<i>He told me
he'd gone through the same thing,</i>

130
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,400
<i>that he knew how I felt.</i>

131
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,440
<i>So,</i>

132
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,280
<i>I latched onto him like a lifeline.</i>

133
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,320
<i>I'd look for him in the yard.</i>

134
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,240
Hello.

135
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,800
<i>He made me feel good.</i>

136
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,040
Why all alone?

137
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,720
<i>He'd tell me I was special.</i>

138
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,840
I started to think he liked me too.

139
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,440
I told him my secrets...

140
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,320
my private stuff...

141
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,320
and I sent him photos.

142
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
One afternoon,

143
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,440
he took me to his office...

144
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,240
and...

145
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,120
he made me...

146
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,200
touch him.

147
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,200
He cleaned himself on my uniform.

148
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,840
On my way home, I threw it in a dumpster.

149
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,080
That way, I could pretend...

150
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,000
like it never happened.

151
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
Like it wouldn't happen again.

152
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,320
But it wasn't like that.

153
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,920
You didn't tell anyone?

154
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,160
Tell who?

155
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,160
I was terrified...

156
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,880
that people wouldn't believe me...

157
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
or...

158
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,440
they'd think I'd asked for it.

159
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,200
<i>The abuse stopped, but...</i>

160
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,560
<i>something had broken in me.</i>

161
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,440
<i>I was seriously depressed.</i>

162
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,760
<i>Every night I got high
with whatever I could get my hands on.</i>

163
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,920
That's when I tried to kill myself
the first time.

164
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,720
Ladies, go back to bed.

165
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,800
I'll give you something to help you sleep.

166
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,880
Are you okay?

167
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,920
Are you going to keep pretending
you didn't know, Alma?

168
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,560
You were there.

169
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,520
Good morning, honey.

170
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,800
-How are you?
-Where's Berta?

171
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,760
They took her up to the ward.

172
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,240
Think she told anyone?

173
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,960
I don't know.

174
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,080
Fuck.

175
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,200
After yesterday, anything is possible.

176
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,440
-Hi, babe.
-Hi.

177
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,440
I was texting you all night.

178
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,560
I fell asleep.

179
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,400
You're not mad, right?

180
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,040
We were joking.

181
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,640
No, I know. I'm going to the washroom.

182
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Fuck.

183
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,960
TYPES OF COMPANIES

184
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,000
The origin of the funds may be net,
belonging to the company,

185
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,480
or they may be passive...

186
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,680
This means that their profits increase...

187
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,920
They're just back from a work trip,
and we went to a cool hotel.

188
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,000
Nata.

189
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,240
Hey.

190
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,560
I passed a police car on my way home,

191
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
but it kept going.

192
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,080
Hey, I think that,

193
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,960
after last night,

194
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,080
we should call it a day.

195
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,160
-What?
-I mean the houses.

196
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,960
I've been preparing this moment
all fucking day, and you fuck it up.

197
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,320
I don't know why I'm surprised.
You can fuck up anything.

198
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,440
But it's over, because...

199
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,320
Never mind.

200
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,720
That's it. We're done.

201
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,400
-What? Wait, Nata. Listen...
-Don't fucking touch me!

202
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,400
You wanted your friends to fuck me.
You fucking disgust me.

203
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,000
What? You said you wanted to get it on
with several dicks.

204
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,000
It was a fantasy, idiot.
I wanted to make you horny.

205
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,720
You want to party?
Call Christian and show him your ass.

206
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,160
Who knows? You might like it.

207
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,600
-Don't talk to me like that.
-I'll talk to you how I like.

208
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,880
And don't piss me off, or I'll tell
my mother, then bye-bye Canada.

209
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,080
-Nata.
-One more thing.

210
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
I'm dumping you, okay?

211
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,040
So until the end of the year,
you'll look sad and shut the fuck up.

212
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,320
Nata, wait.

213
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,520
And wait for the next bus,
because I'm not going with you.

214
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,760
-What's this, Natacha?
-Jeez, Mom, you scared me.

215
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,680
-What are you doing here?
-What's this?

216
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,720
Well,

217
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,760
someone lent it to me. It's...
for a costume party. I'm Mariah Carey.

218
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,960
Another house was broken into last night.

219
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,200
The neighbors saw a group of boys come out

220
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,840
and a girl dressed in Christmas pajamas.

221
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,200
Christ, Nata, it was you.

222
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,000
MER: HEY, I'M WAITING FOR YOU.
ARE YOU COMING?

223
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,560
MER: EVERYTHING OKAY?

224
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,520
MER: IT'S A BIT LATE. RAIN CHECK?

225
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,920
MER: HOPE YOU'RE OKAY

226
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,200
SORRY, MY PHONE DIED IN THE AFTERNOON.
SMALL PROBLEM. NOTHING SERIOUS

227
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,160
MER: SEE YOU SATURDAY?

228
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,040
<i>Door opening.</i>

229
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,160
Do you want a piggyback?

230
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,760
Relax, honey. It's all fine.
Come here, honey.

231
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,960
Do you want some soup?

232
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,640
Later, thanks.

233
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,240
Does it hurt?

234
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,760
Yes?

235
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,880
You'll need a different haircut.

236
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,800
Are you all right?

237
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,560
Hey?

238
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,360
Do you want to talk?

239
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,680
I met...

240
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
I met Berta

241
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,400
in the hospital.

242
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,720
A coincidence. She...

243
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,960
She tried to kill herself.

244
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,640
She can't stand living, you know.

245
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,640
Well,

246
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,800
it's okay, sweetheart.

247
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,040
I wasn't always good to her, Mom.

248
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,520
It's not your fault.

249
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,120
-Are you sure, honey?
-Yeah.

250
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,400
-Really? There's no going back.
-Right.

251
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,560
I want the whole wound to show.

252
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,560
The whole thing?

253
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,680
The whole thing.

254
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,640
Okay, let's do it.

255
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,880
-Here I go.
-Okay.

256
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,160
-I'm starting.
-Wait.

257
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,400
-Yes, or no?
-Okay. Be careful, okay?

258
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,320
Yes.

259
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,480
There I go.

260
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
God...

261
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,920
You look gorgeous.

262
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,160
You think so?

263
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,480
Yeah, deadly.

264
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,080
How are things at home?

265
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,600
They haven't murdered me
and buried me in the garden,

266
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,960
like family killers,

267
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,160
and that's more than what I expected.

268
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,800
What are you going to do about the cop?

269
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,640
Do you think I should go see her?

270
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,680
I think it's the worst idea ever.

271
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,360
I think you should delete the number
and avoid the store for a while.

272
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,240
I'll see. Maybe.

273
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,720
Hear anything from Nata?

274
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,040
I think she's grounded.

275
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,080
Your father and I
are so disappointed, Natacha.

276
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,360
Why did we spend all that money
on your education?

277
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,840
For God's sake, you're a savage.

278
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,960
Are you calling the police?

279
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,200
Of course not.

280
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,920
Can you imagine the financial
and legal consequences of that?

281
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,680
But that doesn't mean
you're not getting punished.

282
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,320
-I'm going to my room.
-We're not finished.

283
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
Are you a drug addict?

284
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,560
What? No. Dad.

285
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,600
The police found joints
in the ashtrays in the house.

286
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,080
-Don't lie to me.
-I said I don't smoke.

287
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,120
Who's your dealer?

288
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,080
I've never scored or even rolled one.

289
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,400
You won't cooperate? Fine.

290
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,800
You leave me no choice.

291
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,400
The next day she took me to rehab.

292
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,440
She shat herself.

293
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,640
As soon as we got there,
a toothless junkie appeared,

294
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,040
and my mother ran
as if she'd seen the clown from <i>IT.</i>

295
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,880
That's it.

296
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,800
Grounded with no allowance.

297
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,320
I can't go out on weekends.

298
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,920
But it doesn't matter.
I don't have anything to do.

299
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,800
You should report them, Nata.

300
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,560
-Report what exactly?
-That they tried to rape you?

301
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,760
Girl, you're such a drag.

302
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,240
Nothing happened. That's that.

303
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,000
They didn't hurt you,
but they thought about it.

304
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,560
What would've happened
if the cops hadn't arrived?

305
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,200
You don't get it.

306
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,840
I can't accuse them of anything.

307
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,960
What would people say about me?

308
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,480
-What?
-That I'm a slut.

309
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,240
That I asked for it.
That I wanted it to happen.

310
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,920
I've read about cases,

311
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,800
really serious ones, and in the end,

312
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,280
they took no notice of her,
didn't believe her.

313
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,240
Nata,

314
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,120
everyone should know how shitty
Alberto and his friends are, okay?

315
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,000
Make them tell everyone
what they tried to do

316
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,400
and beg for your forgiveness.

317
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,920
They should wear a fucking sign
around their necks

318
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,400
for the rest of their lives.

319
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,960
That bump on the head
left you a bit disturbed.

320
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,240
What the fuck's wrong with you?

321
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm in a bad way.

322
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,120
Yeah.

323
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm sorry.

324
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,840
{\an8}IT'S DAVID. THIS IS MY NEW NUMBER.
HOW ARE YOU?

325
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,760
{\an8}BETTER, IT WAS JUST A SCARE.
THE CAR WAS GOING SLOWLY.

326
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,840
{\an8}HOW ARE YOU?

327
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,720
{\an8}<i>Good.</i>

328
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,960
{\an8}<i>Hey, we had a date planned, right?</i>

329
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,320
{\an8}<i>We can take a rain check if you like.
I guess you're not up for partying.</i>

330
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
{\an8}<i>But I'd like to see you.</i>

331
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,600
<i>A cigarette and a walk
around the neighborhood?</i>

332
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,280
<i>We could have a non-date.</i>

333
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,640
<i>Are you into it?</i>

334
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,240
Hey.

335
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,160
Hi.

336
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,640
Get it straight, this is not our date.

337
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,600
It's not.

338
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,120
<i>She was in shock.</i>

339
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,080
She couldn't believe the mess
she'd gotten into.

340
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,400
She was terrified.

341
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,000
Right.

342
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,360
Me too.

343
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,120
Every time I got to a roundabout,
I imagined a police roadblock, and...

344
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,000
I was shit-scared.

345
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,120
Take it easy.

346
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,600
It's all right.
I've got it all under control.

347
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,800
No, it's not that.

348
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,120
I'm sensitive since the accident.
It must be the hit I took.

349
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,400
Is that a joint?

350
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,600
-No.
-Jeez.

351
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,600
No weed on our first non-date.

352
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
On the second?

353
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,120
We'll see.

354
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,680
You know the best thing
about the accident?

355
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,640
What?

356
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,560
They jacked me up
with loads of painkillers,

357
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,480
and I got totally wasted.

358
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,480
-You did?
-Yeah.

359
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm up for getting run over every weekend.

360
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,840
It'll save me money.

361
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,080
Can I see the wound?

362
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,880
See? I'll have a scar.

363
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,880
It's cooler than a tattoo.

364
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,320
Cooler than yours, for sure.

365
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,120
You look very pretty.

366
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,320
I like how you kiss.

367
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,760
I've been practicing.

368
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,880
<i>I just have to convince her
I've stopped selling.</i>

369
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,800
I'll tell her
that this is the last I can give her.

370
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,920
She'll leave me alone.

371
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,040
I need five grams at least.

372
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,520
Stop, Greta.

373
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,920
Stop it.

374
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,800
Stop.

375
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,800
You don't...

376
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,640
You don't like me...

377
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Last year I was diagnosed with cancer.

378
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,960
It's...

379
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,560
Well, that's it.

380
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,000
It was breast cancer.

381
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,520
And...

382
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,680
I had a mastectomy.

383
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,440
I haven't shown anyone my body
because I'm not very comfortable.

384
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,600
Are you okay now?

385
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,600
Yes, health-wise, yes.

386
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,520
But I'm not so great after all this.

387
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,760
<i>The day I saw you in the store</i>,

388
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,080
<i>something happened.</i>

389
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,520
<i>Something happened I can't explain.</i>

390
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,080
<i>After that day, I went back to the store
because I wanted</i>

391
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,880
<i>to see you again.</i>

392
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,720
<i>And</i>

393
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,200
<i>when I was there, I had the feeling
you were looking for me too.</i>

394
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,720
<i>So I hung around.</i>

395
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,280
<i>I was waiting for you.</i>

396
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,640
I've gone upmarket on junk pastries.

397
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,160
<i>And then, the weed was the perfect excuse
to see you again.</i>

398
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,520
<i>I know this is totally crazy.</i>

399
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,840
<i>I didn't think this would be my future,</i>

400
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,360
<i>but until very recently,</i>

401
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,080
<i>I thought I wouldn't have one.</i>

402
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,440
I'm pathetic, right?

403
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,200
No way.

404
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,800
Mer, are you investigating me?

405
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,640
What?

406
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,160
I don't get you.

407
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,880
I know you're a cop.

408
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,440
If you're investigating me,
you can tell me.

409
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,440
Why would I investigate you?

410
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,240
The weed?

411
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,560
I'm in another department.
I'm not in narcotics.

412
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,960
Who told you I was a cop?

413
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,880
Some people I know showed me
photos of you going into work.

414
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,360
-Photos of me?
-Yeah.

415
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,960
Okay. I...

416
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,200
Okay, I thought
you were setting a trap for me,

417
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,680
and you were investigating me...

418
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,520
to arrest my brother.

419
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,360
If you knew I was a cop,
why did you come back today?

420
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,200
What's all this about?

421
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,840
Fuck.

422
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,280
Did you want to get it on with me
to blackmail me?

423
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,280
Yes.

424
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,480
How old are you?

425
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,040
Seventeen.

426
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,760
Okay.

427
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,640
I promise, you and your brother
won't have any trouble, but

428
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,280
this should end here.

429
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,480
You should go.

430
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,200
<i>-There's really no need.
-There is. I want you to have it.</i>

431
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,200
<i>I mean it.</i>

432
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,640
-Shall I take you to school?
-Okay.

433
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,640
Alma!

434
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
-You did it again.
-What?

435
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,360
Everyone's talking about you again.

436
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,480
-It's the haircut.
-It's cool.

437
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,720
But it's not that.

438
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,280
Someone said you'd died.
So now you're a fucking legend.

439
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,320
Right.

440
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,560
Alma, how are you? Okay?

441
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,440
-What do you think?
-Pretty wild, huh?

442
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,600
-You've got some ovaries, girl.
-Good God.

443
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,600
We did summaries
so you can prepare for the exams.

444
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,360
-Thanks. You're the best.
-Not at all.

445
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,040
I saw the ambulance. Can I see it?

446
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,760
-Can I take a photo?
-No.

447
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,000
-You can't.
-Right.

448
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,440
Alma.

449
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,000
-Hi, guys.
-Hello.

450
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,360
How are you? Let's see.

451
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,680
Fine. It was a scare.

452
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,280
It's not bad.

453
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,760
We're so glad you recovered so quickly.

454
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,480
Did the batteries run out
on your electric razor?

455
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,120
-Take no notice of him.
-Sorry.

456
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,480
You look gorgeous.
You've got a Viking warrior queen vibe.

457
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,880
Thanks.

458
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,280
Yeah, I ran out of battery.

459
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,000
You can count on us
for anything, you know?

460
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,800
Guys, to class, please. It's almost time!

461
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,360
-Me too?
-You especially.

462
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,280
Right, bye.

463
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,520
Jackrussell shoots!

464
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,080
Crap. Way off.

465
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,200
Those fuckers Kevin and Jota
must be to blame.

466
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,480
They're sketchy guys.

467
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,520
So here we are at home.

468
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,760
DAMN SHITTY SHAVING JOB
YOU DID ON YOURSELF, SLUT

469
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,120
WHEN I FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE,

470
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,960
I'M CUTTING OFF THAT SHITTY WORM
AND FEEDING IT TO THE BIRDS.

471
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,280
Bitch.

472
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,920
NEGATIVE

473
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,760
How are you, Gregory?

474
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,160
What?

475
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,960
Hello.

476
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,520
She told you, too, right?

477
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,520
That's why you're always so sad.

478
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,080
-Good morning, honey.
-Hi.

479
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,000
Come in.

480
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,320
Berta said you'd met in the hospital.

481
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,160
-How are you?
-Good.

482
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,560
No side effects, except for this haircut.

483
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,960
-It suits you. You look lovely.
-Thanks.

484
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,160
Go on up. Berta's in her room.

485
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,040
Berta! Alma came to see you.

486
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,000
Hey.

487
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,480
How are you?

488
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,520
Just like new.

489
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,560
They've given me cool pills.

490
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,800
Now I see everything all rosy,
and I want to live life to the full.

491
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,720
I'm glad.

492
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,640
Why are you here so early?

493
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,520
I wanted to talk to you.

494
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,080
What's wrong?

495
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,960
Three years ago,

496
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,520
I was there.

497
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,480
<i>I had an upset stomach,</i>

498
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,600
<i>and our restrooms were always clogged.</i>

499
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,720
<i>So I went to the teachers' one.</i>

500
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,440
<i>I heard his voice.</i>

501
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,720
Look me in the eye.

502
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,320
You'll always look me in the eye, right?

503
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,840
I like it a lot.

504
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,000
<i>He seemed angry.</i>

505
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,200
<i>I couldn't hear what he said</i>,
<i>but it seemed bad.</i>

506
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,360
<i>I went over it again and again.</i>

507
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,840
I couldn't explain it.

508
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,720
I decided not to tell anyone
and pretend it never happened.

509
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm so sorry, Berta.

510
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,000
-Forgive me.
-No.

511
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,520
You don't have to say sorry.

512
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,360
You were a shit-scared 13-year-old.

513
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
-It wasn't your fault.
-But if I'd said...

514
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,120
Maybe they'd have arrested him,
and I'd have avoided the depression

515
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,400
and the three suicide attempts,
or maybe not.

516
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,840
You know?

517
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,480
I always thought you knew something.

518
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,960
It couldn't be a coincidence
you just started avoiding me in the yard,

519
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,320
and you avoided me
when you saw me in the corridor.

520
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,800
-You should report it, Berta.
-No.

521
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,640
I believe you. I could go with you.

522
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,120
No.

523
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,480
No, really, you've helped me
more than you know, but

524
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,160
no.

525
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,920
At least say what he did to you.

526
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,600
I can't. I won't report him.

527
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,360
It's not just about you, Berta.

528
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,880
We're still in time to stop tons of girls

529
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,840
from going through what you did.

530
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,120
I'm sure that bastard
is looking for a new victim.

531
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,640
I can't. Anyway, I don't have proof.

532
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,000
If I reported him,
it would be my word against his.

533
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,080
I was there.

534
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,960
No, you saw me talking to him.

535
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,800
You don't know
what happened in that office.

536
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,200
I believe you.

537
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,440
That doesn't matter.

538
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Anyway,

539
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,880
if I reported him,
I'd have to go through it all over again.

540
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,120
I'd relive

541
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,400
every day of that fucking year.

542
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,200
I can't do it, Alma.

543
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,240
Just thinking about it
makes me want to die.

544
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,080
Please, Alma.

545
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,440
Promise me you won't tell.

546
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,880

552
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,440

553
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,160

<i>invisible,</i>
