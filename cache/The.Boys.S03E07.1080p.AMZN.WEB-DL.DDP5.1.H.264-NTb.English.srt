00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,399
that could happen
to any one of us.

160
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,027
Yeah.

161
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:46,323
That's the difference
between you and me.

162
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,159
You need to be a Supe.

163
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,246
I can't wait till it's over.

164
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,248
[sighs]

165
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,792
[quietly] Maeve...

166
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,085
[sighs]

167
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,715
Why are you letting me live?

168
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,468
[grumbles]

169
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,928
Maeve.

170
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,055
You know,

171
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,308
back when things were, uh,

172
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,978
better between us...

173
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,813
[sighs]

174
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,815
...I used to dream
of having kids with you.

175
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,567
[chuckles] No, I did.

176
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,444
A family. Nesting, you know.

177
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:28,323
I-I mean, can you imagine
how perfect our kids would be?

178
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,117
Sublime.

179
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,994
Twice as strong as Ryan.

180
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,329
No kid of mine would
ever know a room like this,

181
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,581
I'll tell you that.

182
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,542
Just so you know,

183
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,295
I'll fucking shatter whatever
you try to stick up there.

184
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,339
Maeve! Don't be so crass.
We're not savages.

185
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,259
I respect what you are,
even if you don't.

186
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,927
I would never
force myself on you.

187
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,012
[sighs]

188
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,433
But I am gonna
harvest your eggs.

189
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:02,524
[stammers] That way,
if... God forbid... you do die,

190
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,027
whether by accident or choice,
you'll die knowing

191
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,030
that the very best of you
carries on.

192
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,865
With me.

193
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:14,786
See, Maeve,
I'm not letting you live.

194
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,705
I'm keeping you alive.

195
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:23,629
This is still
a top-three day in my life.

196
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,134
Because today is the day
I saw you scared.

197
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,098
[laughs]

198
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,395
[door whirring]

199
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,066
[door closes]

200
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,402
[Mother's Milk] The hell
happened to you two?

201
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,404
[Frenchie] It is but trivial.

202
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,447
[Mother's Milk] Trivial, my ass.

203
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,199
Y'all look like y'all got
hit by a truck.

204
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,617
[Starlight] Oh, my God, you
shouldn't even be on your feet.

205
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,244
Come here, come here.

206
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,703
Come on.

207
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,664
Yeah, um, we're just gonna
go lie down for a minute.

208
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,123
Okay? Come on.

209
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,542
She insisted
when you called, right?

210
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,422
Butcher is everyone's
problem now.

211
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,258
We're here to help.

212
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,968
Oh.

213
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:13,845
[clattering]

214
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,264
Frenchie, are you high?

215
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,182
Well, that goes without saying.

216
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,062
Okay, satellite view
has Mindstorm's place

217
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,899
about two miles in, due west.

218
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,443
Two miles?

219
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,445
Fuck me.

220
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,948
We could've parked closer.

221
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:38,078
So, do you mind telling us
what we're walking into here?

222
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,663
All you got to know is,

223
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:43,292
if he tries to make eye contact
with you, close your eyes.

224
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,210
Or what?

225
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,628
Just don't make
eye contact with him,

226
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,130
then you got nothing
to worry about.

227
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,264
Hey, why do you keep buying him,
like, Hefty bags full of weed?

228
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,765
[Butcher] Better high
than mental.

229
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,227
Takes the edge off his PTSD.

230
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,603
Wait, he has PTSD?

231
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,897
Yeah, I saw it at Herogasm.

232
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,358
It's why he keeps blowing
the fuck out of everything.

233
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,362
We got to keep that cunt
dozy as a lamb.

234
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:18,201
So, just to recap,
uh, he's radioactive,

235
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,330
highly traumatized
and heavily self-medicated.

236
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,790
Feels good, feels right.

237
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,709
[scoffs] Tell me about it.

238
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,212
I mean, what sad bastard
self-medicates like that, eh?

239
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,008

Earving,

244
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:26,436
sooner or later, you're gonna
have to t-t-talk about it.

245
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,773
Remember when you were nine,

246
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,442
a-and you hid in that
ball pit right over there,

247
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,988
after you p-p-p-paralyzed
Lewis Frankel?

248
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,741
This is just like that.

249
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:43,036
[sighs] You can't hide
from Soldier Boy.

250
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,665
We're your best pals, aren't we?

251
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,751
We got you through that erection
in the seventh grade,

252
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,505
that Hard Rock Cafe
m-m-massacre in Lagos.

253
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,341
And by golly,
we'll get you through this, too.

254
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,469
- You got that...
- That's right.
- You're our friend.

255
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,696
What'd you say?

256
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,573
- What?
- What?

257
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,702
Nothing, mate.
No one said nothing.

258
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,208
[sighs]

259
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:34,254
Hey, hey. Uh, your...
your brain's leaking.

260
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,846
Oh, fuck.

[whistling]

265
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,913
What the fuck is this shite?

266
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,292
Mum.

267
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,794
Oi, Mum.

268
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,090
Fucking Mindstorm.

269
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,596
Knock it off,
you little fucking freak.

270
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,056
- Come on,
- [Hughie] Butcher, wake up.

271
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,724
- Wake up!
- [Soldier Boy] Fucking freak

272
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,518
- slipped away. He's gonna pick us off...
- Butcher, wake up.

273
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,978
- ...one by one.
- Come on, wake up, Butcher. Butcher!

274
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,980
- Wake up.
- No, you're wasting your time, he's gone.

275
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,191
- What did Mindstorm do?
- Well, if it's his usual MO,

276
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,776
trapped him
in an endless nightmare

277
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,237
till he dies
of terminal dehydration.

278
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,696
No, there's got to be
a way we can wake him up.

279
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,324
Mindstorm put him into this.
He can snap him out.

280
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,035
- Okay, great, great. Uh...
- But he's about to be dead.

281
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,161
Wait, wait, just hang on. If we,
if we, if we grab Mindstorm,

282
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,663
we make him help Butcher...

283
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,540
- No way.
- And then, and then you can kill him,

284
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,500
- Then you can go to town on him, man. I don't give a fuck.
- Hey.

285
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,876
If you're gonna act hysterical,
I'm gonna slap you

286
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,586
like I'm Connery.

287
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,548
Now, unless you want to end up
like your friend there,

288
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,049
it ain't worth the risk.

289
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,804
Look, chin up, okay?
Deal's a deal.

290
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,139
You help me finish this,
I'll kill Homelander.

291
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,184
Butcher would have given up his
life for that in a heartbeat.

292
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,145
So, we doing this or not?

[groans]

294
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,317
Leave it. We got to move fast.

00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,405
Ah.

296
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,865
Do you hear that?

297
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,868
Uh... [clears throat] You might
want to lay off the weed, huh?

298
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,954
And you might want
to gargle my ball sack.

- Why the fuck am I naked?!

952
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:13,808
[Hughie] I can explain, okay?

953
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,268
You're with Soldier Boy.

954
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:16,894
- You're trying to fucking kill me.
- No!

955
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,188
- No. No, I just saved your life.
- Leave me alone!

956
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,149
Please, calm down. I only want
to talk, okay? Just talk.

957
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:22,567
[Mindstorm] I'm not bothering
anyone. I'm just trying

958
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,027
to get away
from all the fucking voices.

959
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:25,320
I'm just trying to get away
from the voices.

960
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,155
I'm just trying to get away
from the voices!

961
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,574
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
open my eyes, all right?

962
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,659
Please don't coma me.
[breathing shakily]

963
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:37,290
Okay. Hey. We're cool.

964
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,375
Very chill. Very cool.

965
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,838
Also, we-we don't have
to do this naked.

966
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,006
All right?

967
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,966
Just-just clothes.
They're clothes.

968
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,718
I'm gonna reach in.
I'm gonna grab you some,

969
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,386
- okay?
- [zipper rasps]

970
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:58,019
Look. Look, hey,
I don't want to be here.

971
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,979
I-I was pretending
to be someone I'm not.

972
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:02,899
I'm not like Soldier Boy.
That guy's full of shit.

973
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,692
I mean, no one is that tough,
and then...

974
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,194
And the people who say they are?

975
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:07,612
They're lying.

976
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:09,572
And I'm... I'm done.

977
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:10,865
I want to go home.

978
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,867
So, I'm just...

979
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,994
I'm begging you...

980
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:17,163
to please wake up my friend.

981
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,208
[Mindstorm] I've been
inside his head.

982
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,085
- That guy's a piece of shit.
- [Hughie] It doesn't matter.

983
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:24,629
I-I don't want to be someone
who leaves people behind.

984
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,297
I want to be someone
who saves his family.

985
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:27,882
And for better or worse...

986
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,426
[voice breaks]
...he's family.

987
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,594
- Please wake him up.
- No.

988
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:33,596
- No way.
- I can get you out of here.

989
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,515
If you just please,

990
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:37,058
please wake him up,

991
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,060
I'll teleport you away.

992
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,561
You'll be safe

993
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,189
away from everyone,
including Soldier Boy.

994
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,650
I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

995
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,529
And I will never tell a soul
where that is.

996
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:50,905
Hand to God.

997
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,287
[inhales]

998
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,831
[Butcher] No.

999
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:01,290
Not here.

1000
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:04,001
So, that's it then, Billy?

1001
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,379
Jesus, Lenny.

1002
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:07,547
Just gonna piss off,

1003
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,549
no goodbye or nothing like that?

1004
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,509
[young Butcher] I'll be back
Christmas, once I got everything

1005
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,720
sorted at the barracks, you can
maybe come out and see me.

1006
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,347
Billy.

1007
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:18,141
Please don't leave me alone
with him.

1008
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,268
I can't hack it.

1009
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:23,229
You'll be all right.

1010
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,024
No, he won't.

1011
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:28,693
- Fucking listen to him.
- [young Butcher] If I stay,

1012
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:29,736
I'm gonna end up killing him,

1013
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:31,612
get sent off to Borstal,
or prison,

1014
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,532
and what's that gonna do
to Mum, hmm?

1015
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,451
Break her bloody heart,
is what it'd do.

1016
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:38,244
Besides,

1017
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:41,456
the old cunt hates me the most,

1018
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:44,459
so maybe if I'm gone,
he'll leave you be.

1019
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,419
You stupid fucking twat.
Don't you leave him.

1020
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:50,715
I got to go, Len.

1021
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,759
- Billy, please.
- Leave off.

1022
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,135
For fuck's sake, Lenny,

1023
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:56,345
it ain't my job
to look after you.

1024
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:59,348
Don't be such a fucking poof
all your life.

1025
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:11,694
Right.

1026
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,366
Please,

1027
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,868
don't go.

1028
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,856
You served me up to him
on a plate.

1029
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,317
No, I...

1030
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,819
I didn't.

1031
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,153
I-I wouldn't.

1032
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:57,949
It's been six months,
and you come home to check on me

1033
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,242
not once.

1034
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,827
Len, I-I'm sorry, but they...

1035
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:03,704
they just wouldn't let me out
of the barracks.

1036
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:13,005
Oh, Jesus, please.

1037
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,757
- Please, fuck, no.
- He's beating the living shit

1038
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:15,758
out of me, Billy.

1039
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:17,635
Day in and day out.

1040
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,221
- I can't take no more.
- Please, Len, don't.

1041
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:23,349
You fucking knew what he'd do.
It's your fault.

1042
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,685
No, don't say that.
That's... that's not true.

1043
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,103
I... I'm not that bastard.

1044
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:30,523
Come off it, Billy.
You always have been.

1045
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:33,276
'Cause anyone
who's ever loved you,

1046
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,403
you end up getting
them killed, don't you?

1047
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,032
Me. Becca.

1048
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:41,617
Now, Hughie,

1049
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:43,327
the last person
on God's green earth

1050
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:45,580
trying to stop you from being
a monster, and what do you do?

1051
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,499
Drag him down to your level.

1052
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,626
When he dies,

1053
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,753
and he will,

1054
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,255
then no one can stop you.

1055
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,467
Can they?

1056
00:52:58,551 --> 00:52:59,468
[Butcher] No!

1057
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:00,678
- Lenny, no!
- [gunshot]

1058
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,930
[panting]

1059
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,811
I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry!

1060
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:09,896
Sorry for what?

1061
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,151
- Hughie.
- It's okay, Butcher.

1062
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,361
It's okay. You're all right.

1063
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:18,821
Here. You're okay.

1064
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:20,573
Hey, kid.

1065
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,201
Right, right, yeah.

1066
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:26,412
Okay. Deal's a deal.

1067
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,539
- Where we headed? [gasps]
- [screaming]

1068
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:42,345
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1069
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:56,943
[Hughie grunts]

1070
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:58,569

[groans]

1072
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,782
Hiya, Dan.

1073
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:05,159
It's-it's not what you think.
It wasn't my idea.

1074
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,953
Oh, I know. It was Noir's,

1075
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:08,704
but how does that work, huh?
'Cause no way

1076
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:10,790
he makes a fucking move
without Vought.

1077
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:13,084
- They gave him the green light.
- Why would they do that?

1078
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:15,169
[panting]

1079
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,796
[indistinct conversation]

1080
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:21,258
What? That's impossible.

1081
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:24,553

[gasps]

1084
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,875
What'd he say?

1085
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,487
[sniffles]

1086
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,659
[cell phone buzzing]

1087
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,456
Hello?

1088
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:35,124
I need to talk to Hughie.
Where is he?

1089
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,125
<i>[Butcher over phone] Oh,
Starlight.</i>

1090
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,626
How delightful.

1091
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,545
He's just popped out for a bit.

1092
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,338
- Okay, well, he's not answering his phone.
- <i>Bit hard to keep</i>

1093
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:43,841
a phone when you're teleporting
all day, innit, love.

1094
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:47,344
- <i>How can I help?</i>
- Temp V is gonna kill you both.

1095
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,221
Well, it's gonna
have to join the queue.

1096
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:51,390
I was just in the lab.
It causes lesions.

1097
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:54,643
Okay? It turns your brain
into fucking Swiss cheese,

1098
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,353
<i>so, please, be honest with me,</i>

1099
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:58,689
and tell me how many doses
have you taken?

1100
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:02,860
- Just a couple.
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>

1101
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,113
Butcher, three to five doses
kills you.

1102
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:08,699
You need to tell Hughie.

1103
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,204
Yeah, yeah. I will, I will.
I promise.

1104
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:16,123
<i>Okay, but I'm calling back
every five minutes until...</i>

1105
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:19,043
- [phone beeps disconnected]
- Butcher?

1106
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,795
Goddamn it.
