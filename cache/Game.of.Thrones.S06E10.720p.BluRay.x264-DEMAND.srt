1
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,207
Your Grace.

2
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,841
The trial will be getting underway soon.

3
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,561
You got my money?

4
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,085
Later. Go away.

5
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,090
Grand Maester.

6
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,769
Ser Loras Tyrell.

7
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,844
Are you prepared to stand trial

8
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,447
and profess your guilt or innocence
before the Seven?

9
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,003
There'll be no need for a trial.

10
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,561
I confess before the Seven

11
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,290
and freely admit to my crimes.

12
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,646
To which crimes will you be confessing?

13
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,960
All of them.

14
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,883
I lay with other men

15
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,282
including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

16
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,728
I perjured myself before the gods.

17
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,647
I am guilty of depravity,

18
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,650
dishonesty,

19
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,846
profligacy,

20
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,964
and arrogance.

21
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,165
I see that now.

22
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,091
I humble myself before the Seven

23
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,243
and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

24
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,041
The gods' judgment is fierce,

25
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,290
but also fair.

26
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,364
The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

27
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,249
beyond the reach of justice.

28
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,521
But the Mother shows her mercy
to those who kneel before her.

29
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,211
I take full responsibility for my many sins

30
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,891
and unburden myself of my desires.

31
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,202
My only remaining wish

32
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,771
is to devote my life to the Seven.

33
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,009
May I be a living example of their grace
for others to witness.

34
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,127
You understand fully what this means?

35
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,286
I do.

36
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,522
I will abandon the Tyrell name
and all that goes with it.

37
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,086
I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

38
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,965
I will never marry

39
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,368
and I will never father children.

40
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,120
Brother Loras,

41
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,762
I ask you to dedicate your life
to the seven gods.

42
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,489
Will you fight to defend your faith
against heretics and apostates?

43
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,841
I will.

44
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,321
No, I can't let them...

45
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,324
Faith is the way, Father.

46
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,007
All right.

47
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,771
I'm ready.

48
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,205
I have to go. I'm...

49
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,885
I'm late for the trial.

50
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,250
You mutilated him.

51
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,251
You gave me your word.

52
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,449
And I have kept my word.

53
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,325
Once the Queen Mother's trial is concluded,
Brother Loras is free to leave.

54
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,368
And where is the Queen Mother?

55
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,722
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

56
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,046
It appears the Queen Mother
doesn't wish to attend her own trial.

57
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,525
Go to the Red Keep
and show her the way.

58
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,765
Get the others.

59
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,650
Where's the king?

60
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,645
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

61
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,120
What's the meaning of this?
I was told that...

62
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,121
Ah.

63
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,202
I have more important things
to do with my time

64
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,810
than waste them in the presence...

65
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,326
Please, Grand Maester. I
bear you no ill will.

66
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,321
Please forgive me if you can.

67
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,162
This pains me, my lord.

68
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,683
Whatever your faults, you do not deserve
to die alone in such a cold, dark place.

69
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,322
But sometimes before
we can usher in the new,

70
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,882
the old must be put to rest.

71
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,644
The longer you wait, the
worse it'll be for you.

72
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,245
What are you doing?

73
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,010
There's something wrong.

74
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,881
You have
nothing to fear, Your Grace.

75
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,724
The trial will begin shortly.

76
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,450
Cersei is not here.

77
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,921
Tommen is not here.
Why do you think they're not here?

78
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,164
If the accused is not here,
she will be tried regardless.

79
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,442
We cannot escape the justice of the gods...

80
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,251
Forget about the bloody gods
and listen to what I'm telling you.

81
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,608
Cersei understands
the consequences of her absence

82
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,603
and she is absent anyway,

83
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,002
which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

84
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,328
The trial can wait. We all need to leave.

85
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,402
We all need to leave now!

86
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,241
Loras.

87
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,245
Stay with me.

88
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,206
Let me through. Let me through!

89
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,090
Get out of my way!

90
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,250
Let us through!

91
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,845
Confess.

92
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,726
Confess.

93
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,120
- No.
- Confess.

94
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,085
Confess. It felt good.

95
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,564
Beating me, starving me,

96
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,080
frightening me, humiliating me.

97
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,725
You didn't do it because
you cared about my atonement.

98
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,602
You did it because it felt good.

99
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,245
I understand.

100
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,482
I do things because they feel good.

101
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,247
I drink because it feels good.

102
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,081
I killed my husband
because it felt good to be rid of him.

103
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,766
I fuck my brother because it feels good
to feel him inside me.

104
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,562
I lie about fucking my brother

105
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,406
because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

106
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,965
I killed your High Sparrow

107
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,129
and all his little Sparrows.

108
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,446
All his septons, all his septas,

109
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,044
all his filthy soldiers,

110
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,610
because it felt good to watch them burn.

111
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,603
It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

112
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,285
No thought has ever given me greater joy.

113
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,648
Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

114
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,928
You've always been quiet.

115
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,800
I said my face would be the last thing
you saw before you died.

116
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,046
Do you remember?

117
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,166
Good.

118
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,369
I'm glad to see your face.

119
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,404
I'm ready to meet the gods.

120
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,686
What?

121
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,285
Now?

122
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,327
Today?

123
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,927
You're not going to die today.

124
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,802
You're not going to die for quite a while.

125
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,965
Ser Gregor.

126
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,283
This is Ser Gregor Clegane.

127
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,884
He's quiet, too.

128
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,004
Your gods have forsaken you.

129
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,328
This is your god now.

130
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,726
No.

131
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,607
No.

132
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,571
Shame.

133
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,840
Shame.

134
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,166
Shame.

135
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,889
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

136
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,085
Very sorry.

137
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,481
For House Lannister!

138
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,523
Hear me roar!

139
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,287
For House Frey!

140
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,522
We stand together!

141
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,564
May we stand together
through the centuries,

142
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,689
good friends to the last.

143
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,242
And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

144
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,483
may we speak the words of our alliance,

145
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,960
"The Freys and the Lannisters

146
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,690
"send their regards."

147
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,841
You don't even have to do anything, do you?

148
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,801
You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,
and all the birds come pecking.

149
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,609
You're welcome to her.

150
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,684
She doesn't want me.
She wants your golden fingers up her twat.

151
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
Those two have their eyes on you.

152
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,764
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

153
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,727
Not my type.

154
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,241
Not blonde enough?

155
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,243
Ladies, have you met
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

156
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,846
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

157
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,048
- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

158
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,881
Fuck it.

159
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,363
No need to call me "ser"
just because I'm an anointed knight.

160
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,722
This came together rather well.

161
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,648
Your father would be pleased.

162
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,404
I'm sure he would be.

163
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,566
Huh.

164
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,401
Edmure is back in a cell.

165
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,806
Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

166
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,882
Give the family a bad name.

167
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,321
So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

168
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,284
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

169
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,002
Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

170
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,651
I'm a bit old for all that.

171
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,087
No, but back in your day.

172
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,526
The purpose of fighting
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

173
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,485
I've defeated mine.

174
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,801
Riverrun belonged to House Tully
for a thousand years.

175
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,490
Now it's mine.

176
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,050
What do you call that?

177
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,321
Victory.

178
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,801
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

179
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,569
Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?

180
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,131
The Tullys mocked me for years.

181
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,168
The Starks mocked me.

182
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,287
Where are they now?

183
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,566
You talk about war as if you're an expert,

184
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,927
but the one battle I remember you fighting,

185
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,844
you were captured by Robb Stark,
the Young Wolf.

186
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,211
But it doesn't matter.

187
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,844
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

188
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,281
We know what it's like
to have them grovel to our faces

189
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,727
and snigger behind our backs.

190
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,130
We don't mind, do we?

191
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,844
Fear is a marvelous thing.

192
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,370
They don't fear the Freys, though.
They fear the Lannisters.

193
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,247
We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

194
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,607
If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

195
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,409
every time you lose them,

196
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,165
why do we need you?

197
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,680
Show me.

198
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,284
Your Grace, there's no need...

199
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,691
Show me.

200
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,362
What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

201
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,046
As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

202
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,363
perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?

203
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,481
He should be with his grandfather,

204
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,361
his brother, his sister.

205
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,491
Burn him.

206
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,606
And bury his ashes
where the Sept once stood.

207
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,849
Whoa. Whoa.

208
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,645
Hello.

209
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,490
From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.

210
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,321
I'm...

211
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,485
I'm to be the new maester.

212
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,081
Hmm.

213
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,371
According to our records,
Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

214
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,726
He died.

215
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,371
We received no report
from the maester at Castle Black.

216
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,603
Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

217
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,771
He's since passed away.

218
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,884
Which is why I'm here.

219
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,289
This is irregular.

220
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,843
Yes, well, I suppose
that life is irregular.

221
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,929
The archmaester
will discuss these irregularities with you.

222
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,245
In the meantime,
you are permitted to use the library.

223
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,240
Follow me.

224
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,010
No women or children.

225
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,682
When we had feasts,

226
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,368
our family would sit up here

227
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,929
and I'd sit down there.

228
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,408
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

229
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,771
You had a family.

230
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,001
You had feasts.

231
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,286
Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most.

232
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,405
What is that?

233
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,526
Tell him.

234
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,528
Tell him who it belonged to.

235
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,965
The Princess Shireen.

236
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,565
Tell him what you did to her.

237
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,125
Tell him!

238
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,280
We burned her at the stake.

239
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,960
Why?

240
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,371
The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

241
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,441
It was the only way.

242
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,841
You burned a little girl alive!

243
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,240
I only do what my Lord commands.

244
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,284
If he commands you to burn children,
your Lord is evil.

245
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,284
We are standing here because of him.

246
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,288
Jon Snow is alive because
the Lord willed it.

247
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,126
I loved that girl like she was my own.

248
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,283
She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

249
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,800
So did her father.

250
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,645
So did her mother.

251
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,167
Her own blood knew it was the only way.

252
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,890
The only way for what?

253
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,371
They all died anyway.

254
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,403
You told everyone Stannis was the one.

255
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,721
You had him believing
it, all of them fooled.

256
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,882
- And you lied.
- I didn't lie!

257
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,406
I was wrong.

258
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,086
Aye, you were wrong.

259
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,524
How many died because you were wrong?

260
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,407
I ask your leave
to execute this woman for murder.

261
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,130
She admits to the crime.

262
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,002
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

263
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,211
I've been ready to die for many years.

264
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,444
If the Lord was done with me,
so be it, but he's not.

265
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,691
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

266
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,051
You know the Great War is still to come.

267
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,684
You know the army of the dead
will be upon us soon.

268
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,046
And you know I can help you win that war.

269
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,171
Ride south today.

270
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,728
If you return to the North,

271
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,041
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

272
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,811
If you ever come back this way,

273
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,167
I will execute you myself.

274
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,131
I'm having the lord's chamber
prepared for you.

275
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,609
Mother and Father's room?

276
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,964
You should take it.

277
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,324
I'm not a Stark.

278
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,964
You are to me.

279
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,531
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

280
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,648
You deserve it.
We're standing here because of you.

281
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,927
The battle was lost
until the Knights of the Vale rode in.

282
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,729
They came because of you.

283
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,290
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

284
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,089
- He did.
- And you trust him?

285
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,847
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

286
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,128
I should have told you about him,

287
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,287
about the Knights of the Vale.

288
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,011
I'm sorry.

289
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,969
We need to trust each other.

290
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,571
We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.

291
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,246
We have so many enemies now.

292
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,247
Jon.

293
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,567
A raven came from the Citadel.

294
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,170
A white raven.

295
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,606
Winter is here.

296
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,005
Well, Father always promised, didn't he?

297
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,043
The last time a Tyrell
came to Dorne, he was assassinated.

298
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,491
A hundred red scorpions, was it?

299
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,126
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

300
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,000
You murder your own prince,
but you expect me to trust you?

301
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,163
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

302
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,408
You came to Dorne
because you needed our help.

303
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,449
What is your name again? Barbaro?

304
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,408
- Obara.
- Obara.

305
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,485
You look like an angry little boy.

306
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,325
Don't presume to tell me what I need.

307
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,811
Forgive my sister.

308
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,649
What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

309
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,291
Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?

310
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,201
No? Good.

311
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,044
Let the grown women speak.

312
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,485
The Lannisters have declared war
on House Tyrell.

313
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,640
They have declared war on Dorne.

314
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,128
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

315
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,848
Cersei stole the future from me.

316
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,641
She killed my son.

317
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,483
She killed my grandson.

318
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,048
She killed my granddaughter.

319
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,811
Survival is not what I'm after now.

320
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,009
You're absolutely right.

321
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,761
I chose the wrong words.

322
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,320
It is not survival I offer.

323
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,648
It is your heart's desire.

324
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,009
And what is my heart's desire?

325
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,327
Vengeance.

326
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,727
Justice.

327
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,609
Fire and blood.

328
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,124
Your ships are nearly ready.

329
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,367
I saw them painting the sails.

330
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,401
I'm curious to see how the Dothraki
do on the poison water.

331
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,084
You're not coming with us.

332
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,370
New strategy?

333
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,049
You want the Second Sons
to attack from the west coast?

334
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,921
If we take Casterly Rock,

335
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,649
the Lannisters will have nowhere to run
when you hit King's Landing.

336
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,722
You're not going to Westeros.

337
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,720
You're staying here with the Second Sons.

338
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,891
There's finally peace in Meereen.

339
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,725
You will keep the peace
while the people choose their own leaders.

340
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,166
Fuck Meereen.

341
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,247
Fuck the people.

342
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,288
I'm here for you, not them.

343
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,124
You promised me.

344
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,124
"My sword is yours. My life is yours."

345
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,327
This is what I command.

346
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,962
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,
I'll need to make alliances.

347
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,404
The best way to make alliances
is with marriage.

348
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,730
Who are you marrying this time?

349
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,327
I don't know. Maybe no one.

350
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,688
But you need to lure
all the noble houses to the table?

351
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,364
Are you a queen or fish bait?

352
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,890
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

353
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,281
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

354
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,125
So that's what you want? To be my mistress?

355
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,201
I'm not proud.

356
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,842
I don't care what perfumed aristocrat
sits beside you in the throne room.

357
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,770
I don't want a crown. I want you.

358
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,044
I love you.

359
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,645
And I make you happy.

360
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,845
You know I do.

361
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,447
Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.

362
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,367
I can't.

363
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,965
The dwarf told you to do this?

364
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,804
No one tells me to do anything.

365
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,242
Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic.

366
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,765
I'm no use to you over there.

367
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,205
Don't get angry.

368
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,489
I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.

369
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,130
Who comes after you?

370
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,363
Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn,
the Mother of Dragons?

371
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,841
A great number of women, I imagine.

372
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,969
Specific orders will be left for you

373
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,283
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

374
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,930
The Bay of Dragons?

375
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,923
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

376
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,249
You'll get that throne you want so badly,
I'm sure of it.

377
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,443
I hope it brings you happiness.

378
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,366
I pity the lords of Westeros.

379
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,684
They have no idea what's coming for them.

380
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,207
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

381
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,009
How did he take it?

382
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,411
No tears.

383
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,645
I know it was hard for you.

384
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,842
You turned away a man who truly loves you

385
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,605
because he would have been a liability
in the Seven Kingdoms.

386
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,001
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

387
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,082
if it's any consolation.

388
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,930
It's not.

389
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,287
No, I suppose not.

390
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,004
I'm terrible at consoling.

391
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,320
Yes, you really are.

392
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,805
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

393
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,326
You have your armies, you have your ships,
you have your dragons.

394
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,281
Everything you've ever wanted
since you were old enough to want anything,

395
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,249
it's all yours for the taking.

396
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,163
Are you afraid?

397
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,451
Good.

398
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,931
You're in the great game now.

399
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,002
And the great game's terrifying.

400
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,800
The only people who aren't afraid of
failure are madmen like your father.

401
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,404
Do you know what frightens me?

402
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,486
I said farewell to a man who loves me.

403
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,971
A man I thought I cared for.

404
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,324
And I felt nothing.

405
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,484
Just impatient to get on with it.

406
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,128
He wasn't the first to love you

407
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,122
and he won't be the last.

408
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,643
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

409
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,851
For what it's worth,

410
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,605
I've been a cynic
for as long as I can remember.

411
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,090
Everyone's always asking me
to believe in things.

412
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,522
Family, gods, kings, myself.

413
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,046
It was often tempting
until I saw where belief got people.

414
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,047
So I said, "No, thank you," to belief.

415
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,367
And yet, here I am.

416
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,527
I believe in you.

417
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,964
It's embarrassing, really.

418
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,407
I'd swear you my sword,

419
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,045
but I don't actually own a sword.

420
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,883
It's your counsel I need.

421
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,490
It's yours.

422
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,891
Now and always.

423
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,851
Good.

424
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,846
I, um...

425
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,609
I had something made for you.

426
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,890
I'm not sure if it's right.

427
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,525
Tyrion Lannister,

428
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,843
I name you Hand of the Queen.

429
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,521
You're not one of mine, are you?

430
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,045
No, my lord.

431
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,849
Didn't think so.

432
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,842
Too pretty.

433
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,651
Where are my damn moron sons?

434
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,247
Black Walder and Lothar promised
to be here by midday.

435
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,564
They're here, my lord.

436
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,689
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

437
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,000
Tell them to come here now.

438
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,162
But they're already here, my lord.

439
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,006
Here, my lord.

440
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,330
They weren't easy to carve.

441
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,004
Especially Black Walder.

442
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,926
What...

443
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,929
My name is Arya Stark.

444
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,411
I want you to know that.

445
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,281
The last thing you're ever going to see

446
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,966
is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.

447
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,684
Forgive me, my lady.

448
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,084
If you're at prayer.

449
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,683
I'm done with all that.

450
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,087
I came here every day when I was a girl.

451
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,762
I prayed to be somewhere else.

452
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,726
Back then I only thought about what
I wanted, never about what I had.

453
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,050
I was a stupid girl.

454
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,724
You were a Child.

455
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,124
What do you want?

456
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,441
I thought you knew what I wanted.

457
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,045
I was wrong.

458
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,407
No, you weren't.

459
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,241
Every time I'm faced with a decision,
I close my eyes and see the same picture.

460
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,731
Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself

461
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,645
will this action help
to make this picture a reality?

462
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,529
Pull it out of my mind

463
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,244
and into the world?

464
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,201
And I only act if the answer is yes.

465
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,769
A picture of me on the Iron Throne

466
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,364
and you by my side.

467
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,528
It's a pretty picture.

468
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,723
News of this battle will spread quickly
through the Seven Kingdoms.

469
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,286
I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

470
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,727
You've declared for other houses before,
Lord Baelish.

471
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,610
It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

472
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,808
The past is gone for good.

473
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,882
You can sit here mourning its departure
or you can prepare for the future.

474
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,962
You, my love,

475
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,882
are the future of House Stark.

476
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,807
Who should the North rally behind?

477
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,129
A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn
Stark born here at Winterfell

478
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,407
or a motherless bastard born in the South?

479
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,848
This is where I leave you.

480
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,524
You're not coming with us?

481
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,642
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

482
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,003
Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

483
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,051
Strong magic

484
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,441
to protect men from what lies beyond.

485
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,051
And while it stands, the dead cannot pass.

486
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,927
I cannot pass.

487
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,326
Where will you go?

488
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,285
The Great War is coming

489
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,723
and I still fight for the living.

490
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,971
I'll do what I can,

491
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,450
as long as I can.

492
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,282
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

493
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,528
I wish you both good fortune.

494
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,411
Are you sure you're ready for this?

495
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,682
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.

496
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,683
I have to be ready for this.

497
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,371
Ned?

498
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,405
Lyanna.

499
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,525
Is that you?

500
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,608
Is that really you?

501
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,284
You're not a dream?

502
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,569
No, I'm not a dream.

503
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,766
I'm here.

504
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,524
Right here.

505
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,921
I've missed you, big brother.

506
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,722
I've missed you, too.

507
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,684
I want to be brave.

508
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,680
You are.

509
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm not.

510
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,444
I don't want to die.

511
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,167
You're not going to die.

512
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,685
Get her some water.

513
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,888
- No, no water. Just listen.
- Is there a maester?

514
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,803
Listen to me, Ned.

515
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,531
If Robert finds out, he'll kill him.

516
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,806
You know he will.

517
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,369
You have to protect him.

518
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,449
Promise me, Ned.

519
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,611
Promise me.

520
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,444
Promise me, Ned.

521
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,001
Promise me.

522
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:36,290
You can't expect Knights of the Vale
to side with wildling invaders.

523
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,840
We didn't invade.

524
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,160
We were invited.

525
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,366
Not by me.

526
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,171
The free folk, the Northerners,
and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely,

527
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,208
fought together, and we won.

528
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,445
My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

529
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,480
The Boltons are defeated.

530
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,324
The war is over.

531
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,401
Winter has come.

532
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,443
If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

533
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,483
We should ride home
and wait out the coming storms.

534
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,050
The war is not over.

535
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,003
And I promise you, friend,

536
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,163
the true enemy won't wait out the storm.

537
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,571
He brings the storm.

538
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,680
Your son was butchered
at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

539
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,489
but you refused the call.

540
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,044
You swore allegiance
to House Stark, Lord Glover,

541
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,646
but in their hour of greatest need,

542
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,722
you refused the call.

543
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,002
And you, Lord Cerwyn,

544
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,923
your father was skinned alive
by Ramsay Bolton.

545
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,287
Still you refused the call.

546
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,648
But House Mormont remembers.

547
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,406
The North remembers.

548
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,041
We know no king but the King in the North
whose name is Stark.

549
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,405
I don't care if he's a bastard.

550
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,245
Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins.

551
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,166
He's my king from this
day until his last day.

552
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,926
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

553
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,240
and truly.

554
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,923
My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.

555
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,288
I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

556
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,761
I didn't commit my men to your cause

557
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,207
'cause I didn't want
more Manderlys dying for nothing.

558
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,887
But I was wrong!

559
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,806
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding!

560
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,370
He is the White Wolf.

561
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,168
The King in the North!

562
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,527
I did not fight beside you on the field

563
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,050
and I will regret that until my dying day.

564
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,647
A man can only admit when he was wrong

565
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,370
and ask forgiveness.

566
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,568
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

567
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,046
There will be more fights to come!

568
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,647
House Glover will stand behind House Stark

569
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,007
as we have for a thousand years!

570
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,087
And I will stand behind Jon Snow,

571
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,288
the King in the North!

572
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,765
The King in the North!

573
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,728
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

574
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:24,046
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

575
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,480
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

576
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,960
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

577
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,645
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

578
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,688
Company halt!

579
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,886
Halt!

580
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,764
Halt!

581
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,841
Come on.

582
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,805
I now proclaim
Cersei of the House Lannister,

583
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,603
First of Her Name,

584
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,008
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

585
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:29,243
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

586
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,208
Long may she reign.

587
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,408
Long may she reign.
