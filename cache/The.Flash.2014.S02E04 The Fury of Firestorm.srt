Hey, I was just looking for you.

161
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:41,668
I would've called, but I don't
have your number yet, so.

162
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,103
Oh, yeah--

163
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:44,971
No, no, no, I just wanted
to show you this.

164
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:46,239
These were just found

165
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:47,507
in an alley
off of Eastwood Avenue.

166
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,809
What are these, teeth?

167
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:50,210
Shark teeth.
[laughs]

168
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:51,945
And I have an eyewitness
that says

169
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:56,616
he saw a shark walking
on land--a man-shark.

170
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:58,118
- Man-shark? [laughs]
- Yeah.

171
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
Sounds like
a bad sci-fi movie.

172
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,388
Or awesome sci-fi movie.

173
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,290
[laughs] Totally.

174
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,092
Um...

175
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:06,526
Are you for real?
You think there's actually,

176
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:07,961
like, a shark--

177
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:10,931
Yeah, I mean, I know
it sounds really wacko...

178
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,099
- Mm-hmm.
- But, I mean,

179
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:13,100
nothing seems impossible
now that

180
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:14,601
we have meta-humans,
right?

181
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:15,969
And I thought it would be fun,
you know,

182
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:18,105
for us to work together again
on a case.

183
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:19,539
Yeah, I mean,
I really--

184
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,241
I'd love to work on anything
with you.

185
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,376
Um, it's just, you know,

186
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:26,713
meta-humans aren't
really my thing.

187
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:29,483
Oh, okay, yeah, that's fine.
I can handle it.

188
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:32,018
No, you--look,
how about I just--

189
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,522
I'll run a test,
see where the teeth came from.

190
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:36,590
That would be amazing.

191
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:37,657
- All right, cool.
- Thanks.

192
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,658
Yeah, sure.

194

195
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,697
How's your man-shark case
coming?

196
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,132
It's good.
I was just gonna go

197
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:46,800
and canvas the area,
see what else I can dig up,

198
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:49,269

to run some tests for me.

- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:52,806
So, progress.
Thanks again.

Mm-hmm.

If I didn't know any better,

I'd say you were flirting

No, I'm--

What is it with you and Iris
and my partners?

00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,989
Hey, how is Iris, by the way?

209
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,524
[phone vibrates]
Eh, she's pretty nervous

210
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:11,591
about seeing her mother

211
00:08:11,593 --> 00:08:12,759
after all these years.

212
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,194
Yeah.

213

Hey, you know what, I gotta go.

214
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:17,864
It's Cisco.
It's about Professor Stein.

215
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,299
Okay, go.
I'll cover you with Singh.

216
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:21,468
All right, thanks.

217
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,539
Well, I must admit,
I never imagined

218
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,742
the Sphinx's riddle about a man
requiring three legs

219
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:30,010
would ever apply to me,

220
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:32,579
but if this device
keeps me mobile,

221
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,147
then I will gratefully oblige.

222
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,050
Hopefully, you won't need it
for much longer.

223
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:39,152
There was no agglutination
in the blood samples,

224
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:41,021
and cross-matching
was negative for both,

225
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:42,522
and it appears that
the dark matter

226
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,124
from the Particle Accelerator
explosion

227
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:45,959
mutated their genes
in a very similar way

228
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:47,427
it did to yours.

229
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:49,462
I think they're both
potential matches.

230
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:50,697
So who do we go with?

231
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,899
Well, my first choice
is Henry Hewitt.

232
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:56,136
He graduated summa cum laude
from Hudson University

233
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:57,771
with a double major
in Applied Physics

234
00:08:57,773 --> 00:08:59,005
and Bioengineering.

235
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,674
A Hudson boy,
I like him already.

236
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:03,410
Now, what about this other guy
Jefferson Jackson?

237
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,846
High school quarterback,
4.0 student.

238
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:08,515
He's got the physical
attributes.

239
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:11,585
And it looks like more of his
alleles match than Hewitt's.

240
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:13,954
Doesn't that mean
that he's more compatible?

241
00:09:13,956 --> 00:09:17,290
On paper, perhaps,
but Hewitt is a scientist.

242
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,860
Clearly, he's trying to make
something of his life.

243
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:22,329
I think he'd be open
to something like this.

244
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:23,496
I think we should meet
with both of them

245
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:24,598
before we make a decision.

246
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,932
That's an excellent idea.

247
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,500
I'll see if I can
get Hewitt here.

248
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,935
All right, in the meantime,

249
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,136
we'll go meet with
Jefferson Jackson.

250
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:31,771
And I will try to find
something else

251
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,441
to help keep you stable.
