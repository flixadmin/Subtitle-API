Well, I imagine you must all be feeling
a little bit confused right about now.

This is a hostage situation.
A terrorist attack...

-Why would you do that?
<i>-Because I love my country.</i>

-Yeah. That's what Felicity said.

I hate when that happens.

Five years on a deserted island.

It must have been difficult, if not impossible,
to hold on to your sanity all those years.

And now here you are,

to come home, be with my family.

396
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,502
I imagine the restraining order your wife filed
against you impedes that plan somewhat.

397

Not only is he untrained, he's unstable.

-"Unstable"?
-Yeah. Yes. Yeah, he's unstable, Felicity.

411
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,408
Because he's flying around in a weapon...

-Not true.

wanting me to be happy was just talk.

-What I deserve...

...is to be with someone

Ray told me he wanted a true partner.
In his work, in his mission and in his life.

Ray wants to be a hero

that he can't be.

459
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,764
...can just shoot your way in here.

460
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,481
Wait. There were four of you.

461
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,857
Unh!

462
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,574
John, 7 o'clock.

463
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,050
You've been a very, very bad boy.

464
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,555
Go. Go. Go. Everybody go, go, go!
Get out. Go.

465
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,015
Move! Move! Move!

466
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,017
Move! Move!

467
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,394
Come on.

468
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,606
Come on, let's go. Quickly.

469
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,942
What about you, baby?
How are you getting out?

470
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,694
LAWTON:
<i>I'm not.</i>

471
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,489
That's not part of the plan.
You said you could find your way.

472
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,368
Yeah, I lied.
Someone needs to cover your escape.

473
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,079
Me up here is what
gets you out down there alive.

474
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,873
Why?

475
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,377
You and your new wife, you just get back
to your baby girl. All right, John?

476
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,379
Go. Go. Go.

477
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,593
Move. Move.

478
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,096
Go. Go.
Move. Move.

479
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,650
-Keep on moving.
-Go. Go. Go.

480
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,818
Go. Go. Go.

481
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,654
Come on, Floyd.

482
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,334
No!

483
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,585
No.

484
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,266
How are you?

485
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,689
My ego's bruised.

486
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:37,028
And my arm, and my back,
and my rotator cuff.

487
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,865
I'm so sorry about...

488
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,201
...all of this.

489
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:48,540
Ah, well, actually, I think I'm the one
who owes you an apology.

490
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:55,213
You told me Oliver was innocent, and I
didn't trust you. I want you to know that I do.

491
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,300
About what you said earlier...

492
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,138
...about wanting a true partner...

493
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,726
...is that offer still good?

494
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,061
Yeah.

495
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,731
Once I make an offer.

496
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,657
<i>The Greddian separatists
were led by Floyd Lawton...</i>

497
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,660
<i>...a former sniper
for the United States Army.</i>

498
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,830
<i>Lawton was discharged five years ago
and since then...</i>

499
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:32,083
<i>...has been linked
to numerous terrorist organizations.</i>

500
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,880
<i>Lawton died as a result of an explosion
intended for a group of hostages...</i>

501
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,883
<i>...including Senator Joseph Cray.
But Cray managed...</i>

502
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,177
He paid the hostages for their silence.

503
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,013
Yeah. Well, the dollar
goes a long way in Kasnia, right?

504
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:51,269
I tried to set the record straight.
Waller blocked me.

505
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,274
Johnny, there's something else.

506
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,110
Yes, there is.

507
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,871
-I'm leaving Team Arrow.
-What?

508
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,582
Lawton was right.
We can't keep living like this.

509
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:18,129
It only works until it doesn't.
And then what?

510
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,633
I can't do that to Sara.

511
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,469
And what about this city?

512
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,224
The work you and Oliver do,
it's good work.

513
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,644
Not like what I've
been doing for far too long.

514
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:38,107
Which is why I resigned.

515
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:42,403
Lyla, no. You love your job.
And you're damn good at it.

516
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,490
If what happened with Cray can be allowed,
I don't want to be.

517
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,160
What I want is to set
a good example for our daughter.

518
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,831
I want her to be proud of me.

519
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,624
Lyla.

520
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:56,960
I'm proud of you.

521
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,505
I'm proud of you, Lyla.

522
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,633
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

523
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,435
-Hey.
-Hi.

524
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,480
-Where you off to?
-Ray has a meeting with the mayor.

525
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,024
Seems he's had
a change of heart about the Arrow.

526
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,234
Huh.

527
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,695
-Thanks.
-For what?

528
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,947
Proving me right.

529
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,873
-Hey.
-Hi.

530
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,374
What did I miss?

531
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,211
Oh, not much. I'm glad you're back.

532
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:45,717
So am I. Turns out Lyla and I
are not very good at vacations.

533
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,470
-The Republic of Kasnia, huh?
-Mm-hm.

534
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,223
And Floyd Lawton?

535
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,808
Yeah.

536
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,228
You were right, Oliver.

537
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,232
Doing what we do,
having loved ones at home...

538
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,569
...it's complicated.

539
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,905
Well, the things that matter always are.

540
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,406
To Floyd Lawton.

541
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,744
[SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN]

542
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,000
Any luck finding your imposter?

543
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,835
He's still out there.

544
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:24,255
We have to stop this guy before
he puts arrows in any more criminals.

545
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,092
Or before he starts putting them
in innocent people.

546
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,972
RAY:
Madam, I have it on good authority...

547
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,891
-...he's been set up.
-Hold on a second.

548
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,352
You're telling me you think
the Arrow's innocent?

549
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,688
Of these murders, yes.
I believe he's being framed.

550
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,732
We need to address the media right away.

551
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:45,026
Tell them what?
Some genius changed his mind?

552
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:49,072
You're letting your personal feelings
towards the Arrow cloud your judgment.

553
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,699
Maybe I'm seeing more clearly
than I have for years.

554
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,118
Enough, both of you.
I am tired of listening...
