1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,042
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,965
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,600
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,331
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,526
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,842
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,088
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,970
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,805
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,486
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,603
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,683
CISCO: <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,684
JESSE QUICK: <i>Grodd, he's got my dad.</i>

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,922
Harry's my friend.
I'm not gonna just abandon him.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,447
<i>I'm going back to Earth-2.</i>

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,291
Now I am the ruler of Gorilla City,

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,131
and all the gorillas will follow
anything I order.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,884
Grodd, the gorilla?
He's talking through Wells?

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,087
Yeah.

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,765
Who is this gorgeous intruder?

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,366
Her name is Gypsy. She's a collector.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,726
Open a breach!

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,484
Time to warp out of this madhouse.

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,324
GRODD: <i>You will open the breaches,</i>

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,690
<i>and Central City will fall before Grodd.</i>

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,851
Barry.

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,162
- BARRY: <i>Good morning.</i>
- Good morning.

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,328
You're in a good mood
for 6:30 in the morning.

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,244
Yes, I am. Was I too loud?

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,640
I did make breakfast.

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,690
We got pancakes and waffles,
some French toast,

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,330
bacon and sausage, perfectly cooked.

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,525
And I picked up some of that dark roast
that you love so much.

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,769
Barry Allen, what has gotten into you?

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,083
Being with you makes me
want to do things like this.

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,285
Come here.

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,330
I love you.

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,486
I love you.

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,563
Um, so do you actually want
any of this, or...

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,449
Um, yes.

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,564
And some of the food, too.

42
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,921
Yeah.

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,687
Whoa.

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,041
<i>Nice.</i>

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,800
What are you doing?

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,690
Ah! I'm decorating.
Look at this place.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,051
- You're decorating the speed lab?
- Yes, I'm decorating the speed lab.

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,165
You know, 'cause Francisco, you know,
he wouldn't let me decorate the cortex

49
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,721
'cause I made it look oh-so-jolly
for Christmas time.

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,290
- What are the balls for?
- Do you know what those are? Lanterns.

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,851
You know what I always say,

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,242
"A fellow that can't tell the difference
between balls and lanterns"

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,084
"is in trouble when the lights go out."

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,081
Oh!

55
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,881
You go front to back. Toothbrushing.

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,247
You go front to back?
'Cause I'm a small-circles kind of guy.

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,164
I wonder how the other Wells
brushes his teeth.

58
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,601
The murderer?

59
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,650
I'm fascinated by the subtle differences
between us, you know?

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,802
- And the not-so-subtle ones.
- Like what?

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,282
Like the fact that I'm a genius,
and you're a moron.

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,649
Okay. See you at the party.

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,131
Wow, what a transformation.

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,890
Again.

65
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,807
So, this is H.R.'s contribution
to the team,

66
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,766
being Martha Stewart?

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,169
Guys, he's just trying
to do something nice.

68
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,288
Heads up!

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,890
I'm not really good with this kind
of thing. You know what I've got to do?

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,122
I've got to take some lessons
from that guy in the green elf suit

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,248
- over there in Star City. What's his name?
- BARRY: <i>Green Arrow.</i>

72
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,241
- What is all this?
- Friends Day. Ta-da!

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,642
- What?
- Yeah. Friends Day.

74
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,961
"Friends"?

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,965
Oh. It's my Earth's equivalent
of Valentine's Day.

76
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,925
And I thought, like, after, you know,
our success with the gorillas,

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,009
that we should, like, celebrate the love.

78
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,606
- Was all this necessary?
- Yeah, Joe.

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,569
Speaking of, where is your lady friend?

80
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,927
- 'Cause I'd like to...
- No, you wouldn't like to do anything.

81
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,402
She's at work,
which is where I should be going.

82
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,721
Yeah. I...

83
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,331
H.R.: <i>Look what I have,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

84
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,290
I have your own personal Friends Day card.

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
- For yours truly, Ms. West.
- Thank you, H.R.

86
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,601
- Captain. The leader of the ship.
- Thanks, H.R. Thank you.

87
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,807
You're so welcome.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,367
Oh, hi, Jesse So Quick.

89
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,485
Yeah, 'cause I also made one
for your grumpy old dad.

90
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,404
- Ah, you know what I like? Your vibe.
- Thank you.

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,167
Caitlin. Oh. I forgot the coffee.

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,764
"You have sped into my heart,
Jesse Quick."

93
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,042
Oh, well, I guess that makes two of us.

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,362
Uh, H.R. is nothing like my dad.

95
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,247
He's so sweet and thoughtful
and understanding.

96
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,044
- We should tell him.
- Tell your dad about you moving here?

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,850
- Yeah.
- Um, now?

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,889
Yeah, I mean,
H.R. said there'd never be a perfect time.

99
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,725
- Just got to rip the Band-Aid off.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,206
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay.

101
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,290
- H.R. does make a good point.
- Yeah, what's that?

102
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,961
It was a really big win for the team,
beating Grodd.

103
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,851
I mean, we stopped a gorilla attack
from happening.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,570
Yeah, look at you, changing the future.

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,883
We're all changing the future,
one headline at a time.

106
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,527
Look, I don't know
what the future's gonna bring,

107
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,245
but I hope every day is with you,

108
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,564
which is why I wanted to ask you,

109
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,085
Barry Allen,

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,042
- will you be my friend?
- Always.

111
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,721
Hey.

112
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,321
Hey.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,411
H.R. made this for you.

114
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,763
H.R. is an idiot.

115
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,164
So there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

116
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,521
Okay.

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,604
- So I'm just gonna say it.
- I think that's wise.

118
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,805
I'm gonna move to Earth-1.

119
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,810
- What?
- I'm gonna stay here.

120
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,651
Why would you do that?
Grodd is no longer a threat.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,968
No, it's not that. Uh...

122
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,524
I want to be with Wally.

123
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,410
<i>This whole thing has made us realize</i>

124
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,961
that we have no idea what's gonna happen,
you know, and...

125
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,841
And if we're gonna go through something,
we want to go through it together.

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,526
Yeah.

127
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,646
This guy?

128
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,847
You like him?

129
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,321
Yeah.

130
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,811
He makes you happy?

131
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,920
Dad.

132
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,641
Okay.

133
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,606
That's it?

134
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,810
You're not gonna yell?

135
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,643
You're not gonna throw that over there?

136
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,041
Your happiness is what matters to me.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,243
You're both adults.
I respect your decision.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,650
Don't screw it up.

139
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,805
Okay, that was weird.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,004
I guess that this means
that we've got to find you a place.

141
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,329
Me? More like us.

142
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,530
You know, sometimes it seems

143
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,842
like everybody else
gets to have their love donut.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,766
- Where's my love donut?
- Love is complicated.

145
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,730
Hmm. So, uh, where's Julian?

146
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,440
He's taking care
of some family matters in London.

147
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,967
Just so you know, we are just friends.

148
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,248
Yeah, the friend zone. I know it well.

149
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,004
Pretty sure
I have a permanent residence there.

150
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,766
You know,
maybe I should just swallow the pill.

151
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,691
Maybe my game just ain't strong.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,684
Your game is so strong.

153
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,045
For what it's worth,
I think Lisa Snart was totally into you.

154
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,441
Lisa Snart.

155
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,444
Not that I would actually
let you date her.

156
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,443
Cisco, I promise, there is
a beautiful, intelligent woman out there

157
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,962
who's gonna challenge you
to be your best version of yourself.

158
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,123
In fact,
she could be right around the corner.

159
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,447
Gypsy.

160
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,046
Who the hell is this?

161
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,446
Where am I?

162
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,131
H.R.: Oh!

163
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,840
Why am I locked up?

164
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,526
H.R.: Oops.

165
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,283
My powers don't work in here.

166
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,966
Yeah, it's kind of the point of the cell.
What happened?

167
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,725
I thought we were all on the same page.

168
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,606
I spared your life, and you said
you'd go back to Earth-19

169
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,125
and tell everyone you killed H.R.

170
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,850
That's exactly what I did.

171
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,760
- I told the council you were dead.
- I don't believe you.

172
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,649
I didn't come here to take you back.

173
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,121
- I'm telling you.
- Then why are you here?

174
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,406
I don't know.

175
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,970
The last thing I remember,
I was on Earth-2,

176
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,846
hunting down another breacher.

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,446
Wait. You were just on Earth-2? Where?

178
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,445
In the African jungle,

179
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,326
- where I saw...
- Let me guess. A gorilla?

180
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,602
Super tall? Anger management issues?

181
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,725
Grodd must have taken control of her
and sent her here to kill us.

182
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,485
CISCO: <i>Yeah, but she's on
a different Earth than him,</i>

183
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,246
and Grodd's telepathy
can't cross dimensions like that.

184
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,290
Grodd said he always thinks ahead,
just like the Reverse-Flash.

185
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,647
He didn't have you to open a breach,
so he used Gypsy instead.

186
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,963
So that means Grodd's here.

187
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,324
Something tells me he's not alone.

188
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,564
- Any sign of him yet?
- Not since you asked 30 seconds ago.

189
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,245
Okay, he's a giant gorilla,

190
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,402
who's probably leading
an army of giant gorillas.

191
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,721
How can you not find him?

192
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,644
He's probably figured out a way
to scramble our satellites.

193
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,689
We're talking
about a genius super-ape here.

194
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,969
And a master strategist
who successfully fooled us on my Earth.

195
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,601
Yeah, we Wellses, we don't fool easy,
do we, Hard Hat?

196
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,046
Don't call me "Hard Hat."

197
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,362
We have to find him
before he hurts somebody else.

198
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,201
Don't worry, Barry. We will.

199
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,561
Every time I think we've beat him,

200
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,041
he comes back stronger, smarter,
and more dangerous.

201
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,411
He's evolving.

202
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,204
I keep trying to fight him the same way.

203
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,086
Okay, guys, look, we just have to come up
with a different way to beat him.

204
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,003
What we need to do
is get ahead of him for once.

205
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,685
We can. You've seen the future.

206
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,967
<i>You know there's an attack.</i>

207
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,690
If we just figure out
where that attack happens,

208
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,928
we can launch a preemptive strike
against Grodd.

209
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,048
We can stop the attack
before it ever starts.

210
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,281
And fortunately, we have someone
who can foresee future events.

211
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,491
- Before they happen.
- Okay, okay, there's only one problem.

212
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,045
I can only vibe what Barry saw,

213
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,010
and a ticker on the side of a bus stop
doesn't give us a whole lot of info.

214
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,604
What if we widen the scope of your vibe?
Then you can see more of the future.

215
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,730
Yes, I can do that.

216
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,082
- I just need to borrow your vibe gear.
- Harry, that's my only pair.

217
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,691
- I'll be careful.
- It's my only pair.

218
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,286
West, come with me,
you have an engineer's mind.

219
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,602
Yeah, sure. Happy to help.

220
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,044
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

221
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,163
Can you talk to Joe,
see if he can rally CCPD?

222
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,766
Yeah. Yeah, I'll let him know
that an army of sentient gorillas

223
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,769
is about to storm the city.
He's gonna love that.

224
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,007
Yeah.

225
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,481
What about Gypsy?
She's a really powerful meta.

226
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,722
Yeah, but how do we know
she's not a Grodd sleeper agent?

227
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,041
She's not. I checked her out.

228
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,329
- Can you convince her to help?
- Bruh, she won't say no to me.

229
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,961
No way.

230
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,971
You've got three speedsters, an ice queen,

231
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,441
and a guy who vibes
almost as well as I do.

232
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,250
You don't need my help to stop Grodd.

233
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,131
Need I remind you, you're the one
who brought Grodd here in the first place.

234
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,367
Not by choice.

235
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,801
I was chasing a fugitive
from my world on Earth-2

236
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,203
when Grodd ambushed me
and turned me into his damn puppet.

237
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,081
Okay, so then this is the perfect
opportunity for payback, right?

238
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,084
Don't tell me you're gonna run away
from this.

239
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,406
- I never run.
- Then stand and fight with us.

240
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,321
We need you.

241
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,321
You need me?

242
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,924
Are you trying to Luke Starkiller me?

243
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,845
What if I am?

244
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,410
Is that what it's gonna take
to get you to stay?

245
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,850
Here's a bonus, you get to spend
extra time with this face.

246
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,006
And look at this face. Come on.

247
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,961
Who doesn't want to get to spend
extra time with this guy?

248
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,521
What?

249
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,007
The things I saw,
when Grodd was in control of my mind,

250
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,209
the horrors in that monster's head,
I can never un-see them.

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,163
- What horrors?
- The city in ruins,

252
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,291
<i>people in pain, death everywhere.</i>

253
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,531
That's what Grodd wants,
what he's planning.

254
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,046
I'm sorry, Cisco. This is your fight,

255
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,721
not mine.

256
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,043
Now, if you don't mind,
I still have a fugitive to catch, so...

257
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,201
Okay.

258
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,006
I understand.

259
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,010
Take care of yourself, Cisco.

260
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,287
Admit it. You are so into me.

261
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,726
West.

262
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,964
How are we coming along with that gear?

263
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,929
I've made all the adjustments
you asked for,

264
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,764
so we should be good to go.

265
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,809
- Good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

266
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,847
Great.

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,925
Um, how exactly is this gonna help Cisco
vibe any differently?

268
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,770
Uh, simple science.

269
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,288
We just broaden
the overall harmonic resonance

270
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,965
of Cisco's vibrational frequencies

271
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,885
all while focusing them
on a fixed temporal locus.

272
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,764
- Couldn't be easier.
- Yeah.

273
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,725
You know, I've got to admit, Harry, I was
super surprised at how cool you were

274
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,120
with Jesse staying on this Earth.

275
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,730
I thought, for sure, you were gonna freak
out and throw something or throw someone.

276
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,323
Well, my daughter's happiness
is of the utmost importance to me,

277
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,246
and you make her happy.

278
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,807
I'm gonna do everything in my power
to keep it that way.

279
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,610
I appreciate that, West.

280
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,964
I'm sure Jesse will too after I'm gone.

281
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,648
We're gonna come visit you
on Earth-2 a bunch,

282
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,882
so you don't have to worry
about that, Harry.

283
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,210
Yeah, right.

284
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,647
Well, means the world to me,

285
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,531
seeing as I don't know
how much time I have left.

286
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,691
Wait. You're sick?

287
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,691
I'm not as well as I once was.

288
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,684
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes.

289
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,723
I have seen a doctor, West.

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,604
Is it serious?

291
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,205
Oh, man, Harry.

292
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,001
Man. Um...

293
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,209
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

294
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,085
Does Jesse know?

295
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,601
Appreciate it if you keep this between us.

296
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,206
She doesn't know,
and we wouldn't want to upset her.

297
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,051
Hey, SWAT's ready to roll
whenever y'all are.

298
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,366
- <i>We find Grodd yet?</i>
- We're about to.

299
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,200
Cisco, you ready?

300
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,404
- Harry, this thing, if it fries my brain...
- "It's an improvement."

301
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,848
- Was that <i>Rocky?</i>
- Yeah, Burgess Meredith.

302
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,361
Yeah, I'm ready.

303
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,763
Word of warning. Vibing blind,
it's like surfing a monster wave.

304
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,524
You need to stay above the temporal flow.

305
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,921
Otherwise, your consciousness
can get sucked under.

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,561
- And then what happens?
- I don't know. Guess we'll find out.

307
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,609
Wait. What?

308
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,844
HARRISON: <i>Where are you, Ramon?
What do you see?</i>

309
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,611
CISCO: <i>I'm at an intersection.
State and Oakhill.</i>

310
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,245
I think this is where it goes down.

311
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,250
That's a block away from the bridge.

312
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,086
That leads right to the heart of town.
If those gorillas get over that bridge...

313
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,925
- They'll overrun the city in no time.
- Not if we stop them first.

314
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,889
Eyes wide, everybody.

315
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,607
Grodd's army could be here any second,
all right?

316
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,446
- There's no sign of them.
- You sure this is the right place?

317
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,604
- According to Cisco, this is it.
- Was it the right time?

318
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,205
We're too early.

319
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,611
No, Flash.

320
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,807
Too late.

321
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,966
- Grodd.
- I remember,

322
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,964
this human is important to you.

323
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,449
- Now, he's all mine.
- No! Hey, do not hurt him.

324
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,843
- I'm the one you want, right?
- I warned you, Flash.

325
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,927
And now, I'm here on First Earth
to make good on my promise.

326
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,891
And when I'm finished,

327
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,120
this city and all the puny humans
will die.

328
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,044
No!

329
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,522
Joe!

330
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,487
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

331
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,005
I don't get it. How is attacking
Detective Joe West a part of Grodd's plan?

332
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,208
- It wasn't.
- Then what was it?

333
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,086
A distraction.

334
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,001
GENERAL: <i>I don't care if Senator Ford
is having doubts.</i>

335
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,925
If the secretary doesn't approve
that budget first thing in the morning,

336
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,844
we're gonna have to make
some serious cuts...

337
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,766
The hell was that?

338
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,604
That damn gorilla almost got me this time.

339
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,046
Shouldn't even have a scar.

340
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,041
Do you remember anything
from when Grodd was controlling you?

341
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,407
Not really. There's just some flashes.

342
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,841
Flashes of what?

343
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,966
They were, like, these images,
places I've never seen before.

344
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,044
It was like I was seeing
what he was seeing.

345
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,409
Gypsy said the same thing.

346
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,087
Uh-oh.

347
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,849
Here we go. I know that look.
That's the "I have a genius idea" look.

348
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,841
A couple years back on my Earth, there was
a neuroscientist that was able to achieve

349
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,091
memory recovery using transcranial
magnetic simulators on brain-damaged...

350
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,971
We use that here
but more as a depression treatment.

351
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,930
Well, in this experiment,
the neuroscientist focused all the energy

352
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,321
on the occipital cortex of the patients,

353
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,882
allowing them to achieve
almost full memory recollection.

354
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,088
So you think the connection Grodd creates

355
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,925
in the brains
of those he mind-controls goes

356
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,563
- both ways?
- Could be.

357
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,526
Maybe we could use Grodd's memories
that he left behind in Joe

358
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,250
to figure out what his plan is.

359
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,761
We'd just make some TCM simulators.
All it takes is some...

360
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,251
- Magnets.
- Throw together some magnets,

361
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,851
- make a helmet out of them.
- JOE: Hold on.

362
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,446
Y'all want to put a bunch of magnets
against my skull

363
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,922
to look into the mind
of a psychotic, murderous ape?

364
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,127
- Yeah.
- Fine.

365
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,409
Let's make it happen,
before Grodd tries to kill somebody else.

366
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,807
CAITLIN: It's gonna be okay.

367
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,966
Hey.

368
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,290
Is everything okay?

369
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,966
Just tired of seeing the people
I care about be put in harm's way.

370
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,444
Yeah, but like always, we're gonna work
together and come up with a plan.

371
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,724
We're gonna stop Grodd, Barry.

372
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,365
And then what?

373
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,046
We just send him back?

374
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,444
He's just gonna come here again.

375
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,722
We have to end this once and for all.

376
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,091
Wait.

377
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,121
What? You want to kill Grodd?

378
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,327
Why not?

379
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,649
That's how their society in Gorilla City
works, kill or be killed.

380
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,606
That's why he wanted me to kill Solovar.
And you know what? I should have.

381
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,685
I showed too much mercy.

382
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,606
No, you did what was right, Barry,
as you always do.

383
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,524
That's what makes you a hero.

384
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,844
Oliver has killed.
He's still considered a hero.

385
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,371
Yeah, and he lives with the weight
of that decision every single day.

386
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,611
I think that,

387
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,968
sometimes, the only way to stop
bad things from happening

388
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,969
is to just get rid of what's causing them.

389
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,210
What is this really about?

390
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,249
Grodd or what happens to me?

391
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,446
I kill Grodd, his attack never happens,

392
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,288
that changes the future,
and you live, yeah.

393
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,887
Your humanity, showing mercy,

394
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,611
that is what separates you
from everyone else.

395
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,887
That's the reason
that everyone looks up to you.

396
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,490
Don't compromise who you are, ever.

397
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,363
Losing what makes the Flash "the Flash,"

398
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,242
my life isn't worth it
if that's the cost to save me.

399
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,571
Here you are.

400
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,651
Hey, you know your dad's
gonna be all right.

401
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,686
What's wrong?

402
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,009
Look, I've been thinking, and I...

403
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,921
I don't think you should stay here.
I think it was a bad idea.

404
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,681
- Wally, you asked me.
- Yeah, and I shouldn't have.

405
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,930
I think you should go back to Earth-2.

406
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,241
Spend as much time with your dad
as you can.

407
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,931
Spend as much time with my dad as I can?

408
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,602
- Wally, what are you talking about?
- Your dad is sick, Jesse.

409
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,240
He's really sick.
He doesn't have much time left.

410
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,731
- Did he tell you that?
- I'm so sorry.

411
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,048
He is unbelievable.

412
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,320
So all you have to do is concentrate
on your memories of Grodd, okay?

413
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,363
Yeah, that won't be a problem.

414
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,321
All right.

415
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,245
- Hey, dead man. Seriously?
- Hmm?

416
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,811
You told Wally you were dying?

417
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,166
- Dying?
- You're dying?

418
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,650
I didn't say I was... I said I didn't know
how much time I had left.

419
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,609
- None of us...
- What is wrong with you?

420
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,524
Is there seriously nothing you won't say
to get me to stay by your side?

421
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,961
- I don't...
- <i>Look, whatever.</i>

422
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,088
I'm moving here,
whether you like it or not.

423
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,081
So all you have to do is concentrate

424
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,526
- on your memories of Grodd.
- Yeah.

425
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,808
- You ready?
- Waiting on you, dead man.

426
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,247
Hey, if I start to Grodd-out at any point,
cut the power off immediately.

427
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,880
- Of course.
- All right, Joe, you ready?

428
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,324
- Yeah.
- All right, then.

429
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,529
So here we go.

430
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,081
Joe?

431
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,406
- I didn't know he could draw.
- CISCO: <i>Well, that's the thing.</i>

432
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,005
<i>Anybody can actually draw.</i>

433
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,289
It's just that some have more developed
visual cortex and manual ability,

434
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,771
<i>as you know.</i>

435
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,161
And right now, these magnets are taking
that part of his brain and lighting it up.

436
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,051
Well, it worked.
Now we have a new problem.

437
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,009
We have to figure out
who the hell this is.

438
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,647
Good evening, General.
Color and number of the day.

439
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,249
Purple 246.

440
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,200
Are you all right, sir?

441
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,010
Sick.

442
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,287
- Good.
- General.

443
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,690
- Great.
- HARRISON: <i>Yo, Rocky.</i>

444
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,569
- How you doing?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

445
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,085
No matter what I do to stop Grodd,
he just keeps finding new ways to attack,

446
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,810
new ways to destroy, and I...

447
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,330
Iris doesn't think I should, but
the only way this ends is if I kill him.

448
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,246
"Kill him"?

449
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,250
That might be the most idiotic thing
I've ever heard you say.

450
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,329
- Wait. What?
- <i>Iris is right.</i>

451
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,842
If you don't want to listen, go ahead,
keep being an idiot.

452
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,761
- I don't understand.
- Don't kill Grodd.

453
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,122
Harry, you of all people
should understand.

454
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,090
I mean, you would have killed to save
Jesse. You were gonna kill Zoom.

455
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,245
Barry, there's a thousand things
I've done that I'm not proud of,

456
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,085
some of them recently.

457
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,331
Every time I do one of those things,

458
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,487
it makes it easier to do it the next time.

459
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,366
I look at you,

460
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,648
out there battling the darkness
with honor and hope,

461
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,928
<i>and I'm reminded
there's always another way.</i>

462
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,361
<i>Always.</i>

463
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,090
Killing Grodd is not your answer.

464
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,807
Saving one life
doesn't justify taking another.

465
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,681
Find the other way.

466
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,842
CISCO: <i>Guys,
we need you in the cortex.</i>

467
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,010
- What's up, Cisco?
- <i>We've got a behemoth of a problem.</i>

468
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,245
Terrific.

469
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,565
So we ran our John Doe image
through every database.

470
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,449
And it was tough.
I mean, the guy's a ghost.

471
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,883
- We've been calling him "Jason Bourne."
- But then H.R. noticed something.

472
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,769
Well, at first,
it was a real brain-twister,

473
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,969
but then I remembered a quote
from a renowned poet from my Earth,

474
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,726
- Alfred Yankovic.
- Are you talking about Weird Al?

475
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,001
Why, 'cause of the hair?

476
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,162
Get to the point already, if you have one.

477
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,882
I can, Hard Hat. It's his hair.
Standard military cut.

478
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,131
So we ran the image through
the Department of Defense database,

479
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,567
and, as Cisco would say, "Yahtzee."

480
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,165
I would say that.

481
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,967
- Nice work, H.R.
- I know.

482
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,405
DoD has him listed as
Air Force General Matthew McNally.

483
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,610
General Matthew McNally,
and I'll give you one guess...

484
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,922
Just guess what he's in charge of.

485
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,605
I know you're gonna say military weapons,

486
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,081
but I really hope
you don't say "military weapons."

487
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,925
It's worse, Barr. Nuclear missiles.

488
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,445
CAITLIN:
<i>McNally has the highest clearance.</i>

489
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,170
He can have a rocket in the air
in less than 10 minutes.

490
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,130
So are the satellites back to functional?

491
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,767
We ran a full diagnostic. Any nuclear
weapon that's authorized to fire,

492
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,922
- an alarm will sound.
- Okay, good.

493
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,571
- Does it sound like that? That's an alarm.
- Yeah, it's that alarm, H.R.

494
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,200
Okay.

495
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,002
Short-range ballistic missile
authorized to fire from Fort Reynolds.

496
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,162
- How much time do we have?
- Minutes.

497
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,607
- Grodd, what have you done?
- Can we stop it from here?

498
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,043
Military weapons are basically analog.
I mean, they still use floppy disks.

499
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,890
I'm going after it.

500
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,967
Guys, no, look, I appreciate it,
but I need you to stay here, okay?

501
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,724
If I can't stop it,

502
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,922
I need you to get everybody
to safety, okay?

503
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,330
All right, I'm with the missile.

504
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,881
HARRISON: <i>Barry, to access the keypad,</i>

505
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,082
remove the panel
at the base of the missile vehicle.

506
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,721
All right.

507
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,330
All right, that's done. What's next?

508
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,324
Well, the good news is, this missile
has a built-in five-digit kill code.

509
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,051
- THE FLASH: <i>Great. What is it?</i>
- That's the bad <i>news. We don't know.</i>

510
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,851
For real? All right,
well, then what am I supposed to do?

511
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,411
You have to try every combination, Barry.

512
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,722
It's okay. With this type of launcher,
you won't set off the nuke.

513
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,007
IRIS WEST: <i>Barry,
simulators are projecting</i>

514
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,207
<i>that hundreds of thousands will die.</i>

515
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,684
Yeah, let's hope not.

516
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,128
Come on.

517
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,123
Five digits. How many combos is that?

518
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,762
- I'm guessing it's about...
- HARRISON: <i>Precisely 90,000,</i>

519
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,206
which you would know
if you weren't a moron,

520
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,771
and you were an actual genius.

521
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,447
CAITLIN:
<i>Two missiles are locked on target.</i>

522
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,682
Guys, we need something else.
This isn't working.

523
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,290
Plan B, anyone?

524
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,566
Work!

525
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,041
- CISCO: <i>How much time does he have?</i>
- Fifteen seconds.

526
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,890
Guys, I need something!
This isn't working! Something else!

527
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,570
You've just got to keep going, Barry.
You've just got to keep trying.

528
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,245
CAITLIN:
Six missiles are locked on target.

529
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,646
It worked.

530
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,040
It worked. We did it.

531
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,889
We did it!

532
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,050
Oh, thank God.

533
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,723
GRODD: <i>Flash stopped the weapon,
but he can't stop us all.</i>

534
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,405
<i>Attack!</i>

535
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,651
Found them.
They're right outside the city.

536
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,123
Heading for State and Oakhill, fast.

537
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,487
- Which leads right into downtown.
- All right, so what do we do?

538
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,370
Barry, I know we're speedsters
and everything,

539
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,727
- but we are way outnumbered here.
- Yeah, I mean, he's right.

540
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,729
How are the three of us
gonna take on all those gorillas?

541
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,126
We have to.

542
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,370
As much as I hate these gorillas,
especially Grodd,

543
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,443
if you kill him,
the other ones might stand down,

544
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,170
but you might not be able to come back
from this, Barry.

545
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,362
- You know that, right?
- I know.

546
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,841
But there's another way.
It's not gonna come to that.

547
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,285
Cisco, I'm gonna need your help.

548
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,406
GYPSY: Tracked her down on Earth-2.
Breach is taken care of.

549
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,681
Thank you.

550
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,891
Risky move coming to an Earth

551
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,560
where interdimensional travel
is punishable by death...

552
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,246
Especially when I'm the one
who's supposed to uphold that law.

553
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,561
- I need to talk to you.
- I don't do long-distance relationships.

554
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,851
Don't get me wrong. This is something
I'd love to talk about in more detail,

555
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,843
especially if distance
is your only hesitation.

556
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,240
But I'm here to talk about Grodd.

557
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,687
Okay, I see you don't take no
for an answer.

558
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,490
Gypsy, please.

559
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,203
He's gonna destroy my city,
and he's gonna hurt the people I love.

560
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,683
I told you before, that's not my problem.

561
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,160
Look, just go back to Earth-1
before someone sees you,

562
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,011
and I have to do something
that I don't want to.

563
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,210
You know, you told me I could do things
with my powers I'd never even imagine,

564
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,767
and you're right 'cause
I'm not just vibing people anymore.

565
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,365
I'm vibing what they feel.

566
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,364
And you know what I'm getting from you,
right here, right now?

567
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,126
That you're more than this.
You're like me.

568
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,050
You want to do something good.

569
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,124
Look, we need something to stop Grodd,
and I'm gonna need your help getting it.

570
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,206
Please, be the hero I know you want to be.

571
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,203
- Wells, how long do we have?
- Two minutes, Barry.

572
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,890
"Two minutes"? Ten seconds.
Can you not even tell time?

573
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,485
That's what I said. Ten seconds.

574
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,968
So got any pointers
on how the three of us

575
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,521
are gonna save everyone
and stop a few hundred gorillas?

576
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,285
Go for the legs?

577
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,164
Just try not to get caught.

578
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,206
'Cause, trust me, they won't let go.

579
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,047
Well, that was not the start
we're looking for.

580
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,364
- Because...
- How long do they have to last?

581
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,722
Hopefully, not much longer.

582
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,528
GRODD: <i>Your city will fall, Flash.</i>

583
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,881
<i>There's only one way to end this.</i>

584
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,125
<i>You kill me.</i>

585
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,490
<i>But you won't do that.</i>

586
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,361
<i>All you care about is mercy.</i>

587
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,091
Yeah, you're right,

588
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,007
except I'm not the only one
that wants to stop you.

589
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,685
GRODD: <i>Solovar.</i>

590
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,401
- <i>I challenge you, Grodd!
- And you will fall again!</i>

591
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,327
SOLOVAR: <i>Goodbye, Grodd.</i>

592
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,925
Stop!

593
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,240
Death isn't the way.

594
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,201
<i>He betrayed me.</i>

595
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,206
I know, so leave him here,
where he's from.

596
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,807
We won't let him go back
to Gorilla City ever again.

597
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,287
Just spare his life, like I spared yours.

598
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,251
<i>Send us home, all of us.</i>

599
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,847
How long is it gonna take to put
100 gorillas through a breach?

600
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,923
We're gonna be here all night.
You know what I ought to do?

601
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,491
Whip us up some cappuccino...

602
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,565
Whoa!

603
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,089
All the gorillas are back on Earth-2.

604
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,330
- And Grodd?
- I called Lyla. He's with A.R.G.U.S.

605
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,045
Good. I don't know about y'all,

606
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,325
but I don't ever need to see
a super-smart, telepathic gorilla again.

607
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,927
- H.R.: <i>I'm with you.</i>
- Not that Grodd didn't have

608
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,088
some justification for mistrusting humans.

609
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,368
Whatever good was in Grodd is gone.

610
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,609
As far as I'm concerned, they can
throw him in the same cage as King Shark.

611
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,888
Hmm. I'd pay money to see that fight.

612
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,642
All right, well, if this city doesn't need
my help anymore,

613
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,330
I'm gonna head back to Earth-19.

614
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,404
Oh, really?
So you did all this for the city, huh?

615
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,641
'Cause I'm pretty sure there's
a different reason you chose to help us.

616
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,161
That's right, I was the only one
who knew where Solovar was.

617
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,891
- Oh, right, yeah. How could I forget?
- Hmm.

618
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,047
Don't front. You're into me.

619
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,361
Look, Cisco, I mean, even if I was...

620
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,841
Oh!

621
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,164
You couldn't handle me.

622
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,531
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

623
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,681
BARRY: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

624
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,371
I'm marrying that woman. Yeah.

625
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,687
Okay, I better get this story in
before I lose my job.

626
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,046
Okay.

627
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,883
You sure you still don't want to look
into the future and see what's changed?

628
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,007
No. Think I'm done with that.

629
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,361
Good.

630
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,445
- I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

631
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,207
I'll walk out with you.
I've got a date with Cecile.

632
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,401
Ooh!

633
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,450
Come on, guys. Let's go find Harry.

634
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,088
To review, this is my daughter.

635
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,768
There's nothing more important to me,

636
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,446
so you do right by my daughter,

637
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,888
or there is nowhere in the multi-verse
I won't find you.

638
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,327
- Dad.
- They'd have to kill me.

639
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,168
Bye.

640
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,768
- Bye.
- Bye, Jesse Quick.

641
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,171
Always another way, Flash. Always.

642
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,646
Babe?

643
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,048
Is that Grandma Esther's noodles?

644
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,201
BARRY: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

645
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,051
And there's mint chocolate chip
in the freezer.

646
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,281
And these are for you.

647
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,171
What is all this?

648
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,807
I've been really busy recently
with trying to avoid the future,

649
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,849
and I forgot that
there's always another way.

650
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,646
What is that?

651
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,005
Making the future our future.

652
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,329
My great-grandfather gave this to
my great-grandmother after World War ll.

653
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,609
He wanted to propose
before he was shipped out,

654
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,569
but he didn't have the money.

655
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,485
And he bought this three years later
when he was stationed in London.

656
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,002
Fought his way across France,
all the way to Berlin,

657
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,529
and this ring around his neck
with his dog tags.

658
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,524
And when he got back,
she was waiting for him

659
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,648
on the dock of the Brooklyn Navy Yards.

660
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,170
He proposed on the spot.

661
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,683
After my mom passed away,

662
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,850
Joe held on to this for me until tonight.

663
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,481
Barry.

664
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,048
Iris West, will you marry me?

665
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,329
MAN: <i>Ilsa,
we both know you belong with Victor.</i>

666
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,723
<i>You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.</i>

667
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,204
- <i>If that plane leaves...</i>
- JESSE: Okay, I'm so confused.

668
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,967
Is it supposed to be about
the War of the Americas?

669
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,609
Do you not like it?
'Cause this is my favorite movie.

670
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,808
No, I didn't say that.

671
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,246
Um...

672
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,727
I guess we just have more wars
on my Earth.

673
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,411
Well, we can just watch something else.

674
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,441
Or we don't have to watch anything at all.

675
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,207
You know what I could go for?

676
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,210
Big Belly Burger.

677
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,209
Wow. Wow.

678
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,646
Ow. Um...

679
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,526
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.
