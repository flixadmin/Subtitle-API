we're gonna need to "borrow"
a magnetic keycard.

314
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:13,896
SNART: <i>Easy, Raymond.</i>

315
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,606
You're gonna spook her.

316
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,761
I think it's important to know
who's funding your research.

317
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,278
Don't you think?

318
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,615
For instance, Project Svarog?

319
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:31,705
Sorry. Is this man
bothering you?

320
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,542
Don't trouble yourself.
I'm not a damsel in distress.

321
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,709
Good.

322
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,419
Because I'm not a white knight.

323
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,588
(BELL RINGING)

324
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,715
It seems intermission is over.

325
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,801
We wouldn't want
to miss Queen Nisia

326
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,303
dancing naked with the nymphs.

327
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,472
My favorite part of the ballet.

328
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,226
But I've seen it so many times.

329
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,897
Perhaps you wouldn't mind
walking me home instead?

330
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,079
- I hate nature.
- (SHUSHING)

331
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,040
Thirty meters.

332
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,003
Chronos must be hiding out
in the trees.

333
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,508
DRUCE: Is that any way
to treat an old friend?

334
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,096
Time Master Druce?

335
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,514
How on earth did you find me?

336
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,224
You haven't exactly been subtle.

337
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,517
Can I waste this guy?

338
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:34,977
Could you give us a moment?

339
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:37,479
You said I'd get to use my gun.

340
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,692
Mmm.

341
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,988
What a colorful team
you've assembled for yourself.

342
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,282
- I thought that you were--
<i>- Chronos?</i>

343
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,327
He was killed in the crash,
I'm afraid.

344
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,621
I was sent
to scuttle his Timeship,

345
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,372
lest it be discovered
by the Soviets.

346
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,333
And you left
a temporal anomaly--

347
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,710
To lure you out of the cold,
as it were.

348
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,755
<i>You've turned your back
on the very institution</i>

349
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,923
you were meant to serve.

350
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,928
Our job is to protect time,
thereby protecting all life.

351
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:14,475
I am trying to save the world
from complete destruction.

352
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:15,726
You and your band of rogues

353
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,603
have run rampant
throughout history.

354
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,396
This is why we work alone, Rip.

355
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,982
A team is a liability,
you've proven that.

356
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,901
They keep you
from making the tough choices.

357
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,903
I am here
because the council refused

358
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,571
to make that tough choice.

359
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,783
Well, they can sometimes be slow
to realize the obvious,

360
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,578
but I've been authorized
to offer you a deal.

361
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,914
- (SCOFFS)
- End this foolish crusade,

362
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,874
return with me
to the Vanishing Point,

363
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,417
you'll be acquitted
of all charges.

364
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,337
And in a few hundred years,

365
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,340
we may even be able to fix
the damage you've caused.

366
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,008
And what about my team?

367
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,678
They will be returned
to their own timelines unharmed,

368
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,971
which is more than I can say
for Carter Hall.

369
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,892
You were one
of my brightest pupils

370
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,811
and, by far, my favorite.

371
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:02,231
Will you at least
consider my offer?

372
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,943
I'll consult with my comrades.

373
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,112
Please do, Rip.

374
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,239
Then meet me here in an hour.

375
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,244
And if I don't?

376
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,250
Then you are beyond my help.

377
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,762
That's a pretty sweet deal
Timecop offered you back there.

378
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,806
Well, I see,
we can add eavesdropping

379
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,307
to your criminal résumé.

380
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,227
Maybe you should start thinking
more like a crook.

381
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,730
Your friend is planning
on killing you.

382
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,942
Time Master Druce is one
of my most trusted friends.

383
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,986
Besides, if he wanted
to do me any harm,

384
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:50,922
why didn't he do it just now
when he had the chance?

385
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:54,450
Because he wants you to bring
the whole team with you.

386
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:58,036
And that's not gonna happen
'cause I'm taking a pass.

387
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,541
(BOTH GRUNTING)

388
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,718
Are we done here yet?

389
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,028
<i>If you wanna harness your power,</i>

390
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,572
you need to learn
to control your fear.

391
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,157
Yeah, well, you've been training
for half your life

392
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,461
to be some
cold-blooded assassin,

393
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,719
so I really don't think
you understand what it's like.

394
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,479
Before you can control it,

395
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,564
you have to accept
that it's a part of you.

396
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:27,316
(GRUNTS)

397
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,320
- Ease up, will you?
- You gotta channel your anger.

398
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,114
Sara, stop!

399
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,866
Push down your emotions.

400
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,243
Focus on your opponent.

401
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,166
Kendra?

402
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,341
Sara. Sara, I'm so sorry.

403
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:53,842
I'm so sorry.

404
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,889
Sara! What are you doing?
It's me!

405
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,974
(GRUNTING)

406
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:02,518
(CHOKING)

407
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,372
Are you sure
you don't want your coat back?

408
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,123
I can't believe
how you're not freezing.

409
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,417
Oh, I love the cold.

410
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,044
And ballet.

411
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:33,257
So what is it about the ballet
that you love, Valentina?

412
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,468
The combination
of grace and strength.

413
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,887
Pushing the body
to its breaking point.

414
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,848
It's a thing of beauty.

415
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,391
My apartment.

416
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,060
You know,

417
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,771
this time of night, it's colder
than a Siberian winter.

418
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,398
Sounds perfect.

419
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,525
Though I'm sure
we could heat it up.

420
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,361
Sadly, I have business
elsewhere this evening.

421
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,696
Well,

422
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,449
if this is good-bye...

423
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,137
You enjoy the show, Raymond?

424
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,974
I think I've got frostbite
in some not-so-fun places

425
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,726
from waiting out here.

426
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,437
Did she tell you what kind
of weapon Savage is building?

427
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,688
Didn't come up.

428
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,608
Such a romantic evening,
I didn't want to spoil the mood.

429
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,568
So, other than
a steamy goodnight kiss

430
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,862
and a possible case of
hypothermia, we've got nothing.

431
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,071
I wouldn't say that.

432
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,657
It's Valentina's security badge

433
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,659
for a place
called Luskavic Labs.

434
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:46,830
Whatever weapon she's building
for Savage, we'll find it there.

435
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,583
I guess I should just be happy
you didn't swipe her wallet.

436
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,884
So, uh, what happens?

437
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,218
You hand over the ship,

438
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,280
turn yourself in to the Time
Masters, and the rest of us--

439
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,641
Will be returned to your
former lives in January 2016.

440
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,744
It will be as if you never left.

441
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,519
Aside from the fact
that Starling City

442
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,481
might be a part of the USSR,
thanks to our efforts.

443
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,125
All the more reason
to consider the offer.

444
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,526
The Time Council will do
everything within their power

445
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,253
to correct the mistakes
that we've made.

446
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,589
But they still haven't
changed their mind

447
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,698
- about stopping Savage?
- Well, according to them,

448
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,545
he's part of
the natural course of history.

449
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,494
Terrible as that course may be.

450
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:29,331
Look, I'm not saying that this
offer is without its downsides.

451
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,749
If we abandon our plan now,

452
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,250
then I still lose
my wife and son.

453
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,710
So, why throw in the towel?

454
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,630
I thought you said this mission
was bigger than any one of us.

455
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,608
Yes, but if you remember,
when I first recruited you,

456
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,843
I wasn't entirely forthright
about my motivations,

457
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,303
or about how

458
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,598
(SIGHS) dangerous this mission would be.

459
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,937
Carter Hall knew the risks
before he signed on.

460
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,230
Mmm.

461
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,274
Well, for the rest of you,
it's now time to decide

462
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,527
whether the future
is worth fighting for.

463
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,415
I cannot tell you

464
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,585
how pleased I am
to see you, Hunter.

465
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,921
I finally came to my senses.

466
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,591
You were right, as always.

467
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,093
I've risked the lives
of my team.

468
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,929
I've endangered
the very fabric of time itself.

469
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,931
I only hope you can forgive me.

470
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,267
All will soon be
made right again.

CHRONOS: Hello, old friend.

472
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,605
I'm so sorry
it had to turn out this way,

473
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,067
but the council cannot risk
keeping you alive.

474
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:41,945
Such a shame.

475
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,115
I won't be able to tell Mick
he was right.

476
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,617
- Mick?
<i>- My colorful friend</i>

477
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,786
who was convinced
you were planning on killing me.

478
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:53,665
Your friends seem to have
abandoned you, but no matter.

479
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,167
Chronos will track them down.

480
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,693
Can't believe you brought this
stooge to do your dirty work.

481
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,213
I never had you pegged
as a coward, Druce.

482
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,465
DRUCE: <i>In that case,</i>

483
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,966
I promise to stay here

484
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,927
to ensure that your punishment
is carried out properly.

485
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,804
I wouldn't want you
to die alone.

486
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,306

PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>This is not the time
to show off.</i>

<i>It's best if we attack
from a covered position.</i>

491
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,076

492
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,328

<i>Jefferson?</i>

496
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,803
Chronos' blast forced us
to separate.

497
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,304
I didn't see where he landed.

498
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,472
Jax!

499
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,474
Jefferson!

500
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,185
All right, no need to shout.
I'm right here.

501
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,746
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>There you are.
Thank God, you're okay.</i>

502
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,330
<i>Why didn't you answer
when I called you?</i>

503
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,035
<i>Did it not occur to you
I might be worried?</i>

504
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,485
Look, I just got a little lost.

505
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,824
We need to get him
to the MedBay, now.

506
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,026
Oh, gentlemen, I trust everything

507
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,602
went according to plan
at the Bolshoi?

508
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,170
Piece of cake. Made contact with
Vostok and swiped her badge.

509
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,382
Thanks to me. Pretty boy
just froze his ass off.

(GROANS)

511
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,805
- What happened to him?
- Chronos.

512
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,890
- Jax here was--
- Almost got himself killed.

513
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,517
We need to get you
to the MedBay.

514
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,770
RORY: <i>Ah, the MedBay,
where a morphine drip awaits me.</i>

515
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,624
Now just try and take it slowly.

516
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:42,959
Don't bother telling him
what to do.

517
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,693
He'll just do the opposite.

518
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,654
Oh, yeah, it would be my fault
that I got hurt.

519
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,021
Because I didn't listen to you
and your infinite wisdom.

520
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,283
I am sorry, Professor.

521
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:52,534
Exactly.

522
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:56,413
It seems this partnership
of ours has become untenable.

523
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,832
Partnership?
No, this is a dictatorship.

524
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,792
One in which
you get to call all the shots,

525
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,252
and I get to take all the shots.

526
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,563
Do you think I like
seeing you hurt?

527
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,589
Don't act like you actually
care about me, man.

528
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,340
I'm just a life support system.

529
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,426
I didn't even want to come
on this stupid trip.

530
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,261
- You kidnapped me.
- Oh, this old tune.

531
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,762
Did you ever stop to think

532
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,015
that I actually had a life
back in 2016?

533
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,183
I almost forgot,

534
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,143
a promising career
as an auto mechanic.

535
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,769
I had a mom,

536
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,272
a widow.

537
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:26,484
What happens to her if something
happens to me in 1986, huh?

538
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,029
She's just going to think
that I left her,

539
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,447
without even saying good-bye.

540
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,425
Man, do you have any idea
what that does to her?

541
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,284
We've all made sacrifices!

542
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,494
But can't you see
that this mission,

543
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:37,829
stopping Savage,

544
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,372
is bigger than any one of us?

545
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,958
I am so sick of you
using that tone.

546
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,085
When are you going to learn
you are not my father?

547
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm sorry you lost him
at such a tender age,

548
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,801
but if your father
were here right now,

549
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,720
he'd be saying what I'm saying.

550
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,555
Just grow up, Jefferson!

551
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,308
The future of the world
is at stake!

552
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,235
And if you insist
on getting yourself killed,

553
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:03,688
as terrible as that might be
for your mother or me,

554
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:06,441
who incidentally would also die,

555
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:07,984
I am more concerned

556
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,945
with the billions of people
who will die

557
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:13,406
because of your arrogant,
adolescent ego!

558
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,702
Okay.

559
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,128
Please, don't say it.

560
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,175
I was cruel and unjustified,
and I said those things

561
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,762
just for the sake
of hurting him.

562
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,182
Why aren't you telling
that to Jax?

563
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,352
I had to hurt him, Raymond.

564
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,521
It's the only way
I can get through to him.

565
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,939
I've tried everything else.

566
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,482
Well, he's just a kid.

567
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,443
So was Ronald,
and look what happened to him.

568
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,448
Your former half of Firestorm.

569
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,616
Yes.

(STAMMERS)

571
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,161
I can't go through this again.

572
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,332
I can't lose another.

573
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,712
The reason I'm constantly
lecturing Jefferson

574
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,298
is because I'm the one
who brought him along,

575
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,675
and if something happens,

576
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:18,471
I'm the one
who has to go back to 2016

577
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:19,639
and tell his mother

578
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,434
that her little boy
is never coming home.

579
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,104
And I would rather die
than do that.

580
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,405
Ooh, that looks sore. What happened?

581
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,157
Maybe you should ask the lunatic

582
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,409
you put in charge
of training me.

583
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,330
Actually, I was hoping that the
arrangement between you and Sara

584
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,249
might be mutually beneficial.

585
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,170
You mean you knew
about this bloodlust thing?

586
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,697
Well, it's the captain's job

I was hoping
that you'd be able to

590
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,514
coax out her human side

591
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:03,600
from the darkness
of the Lazarus Pit.

592
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:04,809
Why me?

593

Well, after 4,000 years
of reincarnation,

surely you know a thing
or two about rebirth.

remember?

I'm not a warrior.

And I tried to kill you the last
time we did this, remember?

00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,963
"Tried" being
the operative word.

No.

603

I think your problem
is the opposite of mine.

604
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,602
I need to learn to embrace
my inner hawk goddess,

605
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:51,398
but you, you need to learn
to embrace your human side.

606
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,275
And what if that side
of me is gone?

607
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,736
What if she doesn't
exist anymore?

608

Well,

609
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,198
only one way to find out.

610
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,742
What, are you baiting me?

611

No,

612
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,745
I'm training you.

613
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,916
Come on.

618
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:27,892
So, what's the plan?

619
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,020
Simple. We use Vostok's
credentials to enter the lab

620
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,082
and find out what she's building
on behalf of Savage.

Finally, my kind of mission.

No, no, no, hang on a minute.

from his injuries.

625

00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,892
of the State Council of Science,

631
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,394
and I am here
to inspect the facility.

632
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,101
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>I'm in and heading
to the basement.</i>

633
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,740
Here's hoping the key
that Mr. Snart stole

634
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,533
off Valentina works.

635
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,717
Oh, my God.

636
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,729
I know what
Vostok is working on.

637
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,273
She's trying to build me.

638
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,608
Hang on. What do you mean?

639
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,527
<i>I mean, Savage has spent
the last decade</i>

640
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,533
<i>trying to level the arms race
against our team.</i>

641
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,822
"Operation Svarog,"

642
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,033
the Slavic god of fire.

643
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,285
Of course, he and Vostok

644
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,039
are building a Soviet Firestorm.

645
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,805
They've already built
a thermocore.

646
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,306
Professor, need I remind you

647
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,559
this is
a reconnaissance mission?

648
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,894
It's only a matter of time
before Vostok figures out

649
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,480
how to stabilize
a Soviet Firestorm.

650
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,653
I'm not leaving without it.

651
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,863
It's the key
to building others just like me.

652
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,008
Yes, but perhaps you should
wait for the rest of the team.

653
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,033
<i>They're on their way.</i>

654
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,203
Are you familiar with ultra-high
energy cosmic rays, Captain?

655
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,622
The radiation released
inside this chamber

656
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,541
will kill anyone other than me.

657
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,127
Look, despite your impermeability
to nuclear energy,

658
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,894
you're still quite vulnerable
to bullets!

659
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,839
I just need someone
to take the core offline,

660
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,008
so I can remove it safely
and shield it.

661
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,509
RAY: <i>I'm all over it, Professor.</i>

662
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:07,969

663
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:11,723
<i>We're</i> all over it.

664
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,033
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>Remember, Dr. Palmer,</i>

665
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,368
<i>that shutting down
the core incorrectly</i>

666
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:15,768
<i>can lead to the creation of--</i>

667
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,163
Strangelets, black holes
and uncontrolled fusion reactions

668
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,272
that consume the universe.

669
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,566
See, I was listening
during class, Professor.

670
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,328
How we doing, Boy Scout?

671
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,788
Uh, point of fact,
I completed all 21 merit badges,

672
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,791
including nuclear science,
so I'm an Eagle Scout.

673
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,046
Oh, we got a problem.

674
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,876
Valentina's headed towards
the core containment unit.

675
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,234
The radiation Stein's
about to unleash,

676
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:48,343
if she opens that door--

677
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:49,552
We're here to stop Savage

678
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,387
from building
a nuclear-powered superhero.

679
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:54,807
Saving some commie broad
ain't on the agenda.

680
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,827
Even if the radiation doesn't
kill her, Savage will

681
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,853
the second he finds out
the lab's been sabotaged.

682
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,205
Look, we got to get her
out of here.

683
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,273
Who's going to shut down
the core, Raymond?

684
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,983
I skipped that merit badge.

685
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,861
Raymond, why is the thermocore
still running at full power?

686
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,083
I'll handle the core,
you handle Valentina.

687
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,865
You're willing
to risk the mission

688
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,992
for a woman you barely know?

689
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,410
"Be helpful to others."

690
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:16,663
It's the Scout motto.

691
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,916
Thirty seconds. I'll get Vostok,
you kill the power for Stein.

692
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,835
And, Raymond, promise me.

693

What are you doing here?

697
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:39,060
Believe me, I've been asking
myself the same question.

698
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,437
That night at the Bolshoi,

699
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,231
it was you who stole my keys.

700
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,983
And your wallet,
but it was nothing personal.

<i>What the hell is that man doing?</i>

702
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,673
He has no idea
what the core is capable of.

703
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,616
Relax. He's the one
who invented it.

704
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,128
I'm the first person
to have ever seen

705
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,256
cosmic radiation
with his own eyes.

706
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:09,608
You know,
let's keep it that way.

707
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:10,859
Snart, you better keep Valentina

708
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,152
out of the core
containment unit.

709
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,594
You used me.

710
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,138
You work
for American government.

711
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,806
I'm wanted
by the American government.

712
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,015
Does that count?

713
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,728
Look, I may be your
white knight, just this once,

714

but that weapon
Savage has you building,

That may be true,

00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,606
If the Soviets get
that thermocore back,

789
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,548
your partner will not be
the only one who dies.

790
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:20,800
(GRUNTS)

791
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,818
You better kill me now.

792
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:40,611
If I ever get my hands on you,

793
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,613
I'm gonna get all <i>Rocky IV</i>
on your ass.

794
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:45,074
(GRUNTS)

795
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,829
I'm gonna remember that,
comrade.

796
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,418
We must leave now, Colonel.

797
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,904
There's still one more intruder,
and he has the thermocore.

798
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,463
We don't need it now.

799
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,132
We have something far better.

800
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,560
(PANTING)

801
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,520
Thank God
you managed to grab it!

802
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,273
Where was my backup, Captain?

803
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,150
Half the team is gone

804
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:21,652
because of you.

805
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,238
And if I'd have sent
the other half in to save them,

806
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,406
they'd be captured, too.

807
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,575
And where would we be, hmm?

808
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,339
Savage would have
both halves of Firestorm,

809
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,246
a dead Kendra
on top of a dead Carter.

810
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,789
Everything he wants.

811
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,751
It would be the end
to our little crusade

812
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,037
and, most likely, the world.

813
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:41,172
So, before you pull
that trigger,

814
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,466
ask yourself,

815
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,677
what would you have done?

816
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,304
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

817
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:52,641
That is a pretty cold
calculation, Rip.

818
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,311
Almost criminal.

819
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,647
Except we criminals have a code.

820
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:00,608
You never leave
one of your own behind.

821
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,860
We will get them back.

822
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:07,198
Now, if Savage even hopes
to create a Firestorm,

823
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:09,575
first, he's gonna need
a new one of these.

824
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:12,745
A thermocore?

825
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:13,913
Let me get this straight.

826
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,457
You had Kendra and I training
for the next mission,

827
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:18,501
when we should've
been out there helping them.

828
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,002
We will help them.

829
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,170
Now, our next mission

830
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:23,172
is to get our compatriots
back from Vostok.

831
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,007
Who's to say
they're not already dead?

832
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,717
Vostok needs the professor alive

833
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,236
in order to rebuild
the thermocore.

834
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,261
And Ray and Rory?

835
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,708
Savage will keep
them alive, too.

836
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:31,889
As leverage.

837
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,558
He'll torture them
if Stein tries to hold out.

838
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:36,085
Well, we have to pray
that he does.

839
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:38,938
If Savage's goal
is to create his own Firestorm,

840
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:42,358
then Stein himself is the key,
the missing piece of the puzzle.

841
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,984
And if Vostok figures out
how to turn

842
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,695
Stein's powers against us,
then...

843
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,451
I'm afraid the world
is beyond saving.

844
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,703
Stein is a lot tougher
than he looks.

845
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,580
I mean, it'll take a lot
to break him.

846
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:58,707
That's the good news.

847
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,753
RIP: <i>The bad news is that
our compatriots are being held</i>

848
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,465
<i>in an impenetrable Soviet gulag.</i>

849
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:14,098
Get a good night's sleep.

850
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:17,393
You and Dr. Vostok have much
work to do in the morning.

851
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,770
My companions from the lab,

852
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,064
what did you do with them?

853
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,401
Don't worry. They're alive.

854
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,654
Whether they remain that way

855
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:30,990
is entirely up to you,

856
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,075
Professor.

857
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:09,778
