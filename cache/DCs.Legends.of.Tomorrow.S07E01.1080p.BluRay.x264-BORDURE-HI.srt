1
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:14,349
I'm telling you, I know what I saw.

2
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:18,228
There was a dinosaur creature
running right through my backyard.

3
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:20,063
[creature growling]

4
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:21,981
You don't say.

5
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:25,401
And there were glowing lights
coming from tree tops.

6
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,696
You don't say.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,199
And these giant orbs fell from the sky.

8
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,410
[sheriff] <i>You don 't say.</i>

9
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:39,916
Then after I came out of hiding,
they'd all disappeared.

10
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,043
Something ain't right.

11
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,005
[Nate] Well, that's that.

12
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:47,799
Yeah, I'm kind of nervous.

13
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,051
Things rarely wrap up
in a neat little bow for us.

14
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,719
Oh, come on, babe. Don't be paranoid.

15
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:53,680
Life is gonna start going our way.

16
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:55,932
[whooshing]

17
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:00,520
[all] Whoa!

18
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,319
What the hell?

19
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,027
[Nate] What the hell happened?

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,123
[Gary] Did that look like
another <i>Wa verider</i> to you guys?

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,809
[Agent Sharpe] Why is someone
trying to kill us?

22
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,143
[Astra] There must be
hundreds of reasons

23
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,520
why someone would want to kill us.

24
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,647
[Behrad] Well, we're not gonna let him
get away with it, are we?

25
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,299
I say we portal back in time
and onto that rogue <i>Wa verider</i>

26
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:30,466
and make them pay!

27
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,344
That is a perfect plan!

28
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,805
Now, let's go gear up,

29
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,642
'cause we're gonna storm that ship,
and save our <i>Wa verider.</i>

30
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,480
Remember, when we get on that ship,
stealth is our friend.

31
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:46,274
Silent takedown. Got it.

32
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,443
Wake me when the fire fight starts.

33
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,861
You guys take out the crew

34
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,672
and Behrad and I'll take control
of the ship.

35
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,656
Nate, let's do this.

36
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,366
Here we go.

37
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,869
[sputters]

38
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:00,663
It's out of juice.

39
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:03,499
- What?
- Every time with those things.

40
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,460
No Time Courier is no <i>Wa verider.</i>

41
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,338
We're stuck in 1925.

42
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,466
[all clamoring]

43
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:12,550
Everybody just calm down.

44
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:14,445
We just need a little time.
We'll think of a plan.

45
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,554
Well, we definitely don't belong
in this time period.

46
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,838
We need to avoid any unwanted attention
from the locals.

47
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:20,475
[knocking at door]

48
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:29,359
Afternoon, ma'am. Name's Pastor Hanson.
Is Gloria home?

49
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,224
Yeah, she's not here right now.

50
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:34,739
I just heard this loud explosion
over yonder

51
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,783
and I wanted to make sure
everything's all right.

52
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:38,868
- Flash him.
- [others] What?

53
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:44,374
Well, you know, there's all sorts
of strange things happening in Odessa.

54
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:48,836
Everyone in town has seen
these bizarre lights in the sky,

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,631
and strange lizard creatures
in their backyard.

56
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,549
Well, that...
Nothing's strange around here.

57
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:54,925
[whispers] Flash him.

58
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,636
It's out of battery. How?

59
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,845
[device whines]

60
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:01,140
Say, are those claw marks?

61
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,059
Yeah, I'll tell Gloria you stopped by.

62
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:04,394
Goodbye now.

63
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:07,647
[exhales]
So much for laying low.

64
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:09,750
The town's already buzzing
with conspiracy theories

65
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:10,983
after the Zaguron invasion.

66
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,920
You guys, if we stay here,
it could get really bad.

67
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:13,902
It's gonna be okay.

68
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,279
And now that we have no time ship,

69
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,825
we're just a bunch of weirdos
with truly random superpowers.

70
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,453
John, the one person with
the useful ability is gone, so...

71
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:24,038
[Astra] Well, hey, I was his student.

72
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:27,208
I mean, I'm not a master sorcerer yet,
but maybe I could...

73
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,461
What, turn the townspeople
into household objects? Come on.

74
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,672
Too bad we don't have
the Time Bureau time ship,

75
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,424
or it would have that fail-safe.

76
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,467
Gary, you're a genius.

77
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:40,346
The last time the <i>Wa verider</i> was
impounded, I had a fail-safe installed.

78
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,681
And fail-safes are...

79
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,767
They're indestructible lockboxes
filled with emergency supplies.

80
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:48,104
Like a Time Courier, a mind flasher.
Breath mints, if we're lucky!

81
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,790
You realize the blast
could have sent that thing

82
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,534
flying anywhere
on Gloria's property, right?

83
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:55,903
So we will split up so we can find this
damn thing and get the hell out of here.

84
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,238
Now, let's go. Come on.

85
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,949
How're you holding up, Z?

86
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,552
If you wanna talk, I'm here to listen.

87
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,095
I know a thing or two
about getting dumped.

88
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,287
I was not dumped.

89
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,914
It was a mutual mucking up of things.

90
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,834
I am, however, annoyed that
John poofed his way out of 1925

91
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,854
without making sure
the rest of us were okay first.

92
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,422
To be fair, when he left,
we still had a working time machine.

93
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,924
- Defending him is not listening.
- Right. Sorry.

94
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,008
Continue.

95
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,845
I just can't believe after
everything we went through together,

96
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,139
all he left me with was this.

97
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,266
- Ooh, freaky old key.
- Yeah.

98
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,350
What's this for?

99
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:30,521
All he just said was, "You'll find out,"
with his trademark dramatic delivery.

100
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,334
In hindsight, I probably should've got
a little more clarification.

101
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,359
Probably.

102
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:38,070
Whatever. Just gonna do
what I always do in these situations.

103
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:39,614
I need a makeover.

104
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:40,782
No, no, no. Not a makeover.

105
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:43,951
I need a reinvention, like Madonna.
I think there's a headpiece.

106
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,888
[Agent Sharpe sighs]
Wandering through the woods.

107
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,122
Why am I not surprised
this is our honeymoon?

108
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:49,206
I know, babe,

109
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,310
but as soon as we find the safe,
then we can get out of here, all right?

110
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,978
Yeah. Well, I'm way out
of my comfort zone.

111
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,837
- Which is?
- The <i>Wa verider.</i>

112
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,839
- Lists. Rules.
- Lists. Rules.

113
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:02,720
Well, mine is improvising,
so, together, we are unstoppable.

114
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,306
Come on.

115
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,434
Based on the blast radius,

116
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:11,145
we're basically looking
for a needle in a haystack.

117
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,983
Look, I can track animals and people.
But random futuristic safes, not my bag.

118
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,236
All right, so what you got?

119
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,423
Any magical cheats to find this thing?

120
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,992
Yeah, I think I can remember
John's tracking spell.

121
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,748
[speaking other language]

122
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,086
Hey, not bad.

123
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,473
I think someone moved it.

124
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,149
[Astra] That's not good.

125
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,995
Where did you find it, anyway?

126
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:12,081
Amongst them bushes
at the edge of Gloria Cruz's property.

127
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,169
Okay, good news,
we found the <i>Wa verider's</i> safe.

128
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:20,089
Yeah, bad news,
it's at the Sheriff's station.

129
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,799
Pastor found it nearby and turned it in.

130
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,360
That guy will come poking around again

131
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,224
now that he's even more
suspicious of your mom.

132
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,903
Yeah, and other neighbors could get nosy

133
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,407
and discover
the remains of the <i>Wa verider,</i>

134
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,516
which would be disastrous
for the timeline.

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,145
We just need to buy ourselves some time
so we can come up with another plan.

136
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,355
We need to go on the defensive.

137
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,774
Right, and keep the heat off
of Gloria and this property.

138
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,335
Yeah. And how are we supposed to do that

139
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,278
if we don't have time travel
or Mind Flashers?

140
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,571
[gasps]

141
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,864
Rule 44.

142
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,657
- Rule 44.
- Yeah.

143
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,409
- I love Rule 44.
- Yeah.

144
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,619
What's Rule 44?

145
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,495
Oh, it's from our Time Bureau training.

146
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,623
The intent of Rule 44
is to create a diversion.

147
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,906
A... A cover story when things
go sideways on a mission.

148
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:00,087
Specifically, Rule 44 states that
our cover story must be a circus.

149
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,965
That is oddly specific.

150
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:06,135
Are we talking Cirque, Sideshow,
straight up Three Ring affair?

151
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,137
No, research shows that
the general public

152
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,682
is willing to accept the bizarreness
of any kind of circus without question.

153
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,142
So, we have to put on a circus?

154
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,477
- What? No. We...
- No.

155
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,913
Jeez, that's not what we're saying.

156
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,372
We just have to make them
think we're a circus

157
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,439
to allay their suspicions.

158
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,107
[gasps]

159
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:21,400
Group makeovers.

160
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:22,693
Yes, I love it.

161
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,364
I'm going to reinvent
each of you as performers.

162
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,157
Friends, you're in excellent hands.

163
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,576
You heard her. Let's circus up, huh?

164
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:31,994
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

165
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,580
Good. 'Cause I need your magic
to help fix my mom's porch.

166
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,706
Sure.

167
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,167
Hey, Nate, while we are playing
defense as a circus,

168
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,752
you will be playing offense.

169
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,587
Time to use your superpower.

170
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:44,757
So, you want me to turn to steel
and knock around some skulls?

171
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,134
No. Your other superpower.

172
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,179
You are a white man in 1925.

173
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,557
You go sweet talk that sheriff,
and get him to give you the safe.

174
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,977
- Ava will go with you.
- What? No, I'm...

175
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,269
All right. Come on, Gary.

176
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,433
Those period costumes
aren't going to sew themselves.

177
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,041
[coughs]

178
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:30,970
Yes.

179
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,765
Tie... Button, please.

180
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
<i>Voilà.</i>

181
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:39,937
[clangs]

182
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,104
My mom's not gonna be happy

183
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,625
when she sees
what we've done to her stuff.

184
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,066
Sorry. It's desperate times.

185
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,111
Oh, Nate borrowed your dead dad's suit.
Hope that's okay.

186
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,071
He better not ruin it.

187
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,867
Good afternoon, Odessa.
Come one, come all.

188
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,204
I know you have seen and heard
some peculiar things lately.

189
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:02,710
Well, I am here to assure you that it is
just business as usual for us.

190
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,295
Why, you ask?

191
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:11,177
Because my compatriots and I,
we are members of the Guggenheim Circus.

192
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,763
[applauding]

193
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,000
You know, it's actually a very good fit.

194
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,359
- Hey, do I look like a grandma?
- Yeah.

195
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,236
You the sheriff?

196
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:34,158
Yes, sir. I was just
finishing up some paperwork.

197
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,409
How can I help you?

198
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,869
My name's John Edgar Hoover,

199
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,914
I'm the newly appointed director
of the Bureau of Investigation

200
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,248
in Washington, DC.

201
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:44,001
This is my trusted secretary,
Miss Gandy.

202
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,879
You seem different in real life.

203
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,964
You probably saw an old photo.

204
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:51,928
I've been cocktailing my hair products,
but that's neither here or there.

205
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,469
Now listen up, Sheriff.

206
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,014
We're here to talk to you
about a very important matter.

207
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,476
There are so many exciting things
to see at our circus.

208
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,478
For example, exotic animals.

209
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:07,066
My cohort and I, we are animal handlers
from a land far, far, far away!

210
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:13,239
And, of course, what circus
would be complete without a little fire?

211
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,866
[crowd gasps]

212
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,803
Ow, ow, ow, ow! That's hot. That's hot.

213
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,287
- [sizzling]
- Ah!

214
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:21,913
[laughing nervously]

215
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,040
Now, don't be alarmed,

216
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:26,627
but several of our creatures
escaped their confinements last night!

217
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,171
You may have heard some explosions

218
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:31,549
or seen some
mysterious lights yesterday.

219
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:36,011
That was just me,
testing out some, uh... displays.

220
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,471
True story.

221
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:38,740
So, if you saw something yesterday

222
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,683
that looked like a dinosaur,
for example,

223
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,810
it was actually a Komodo dragon,

224
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:46,647
which is just a big, smelly lizard
despite its terrifying appellation.

225
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:52,570
Pastor Hanson found this strange box
over by Gloria Cruz's property.

226
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:55,948
I thought maybe it belonged to her,
since she's foreign and all.

227
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,826
Oh, well, we can tell you for sure
that it's not hers, sir,

228
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,119
but it is very dangerous.

229
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:05,916
Say, how did you boys in Washington
learn about the safe so quickly?

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,377
The pastor only found it this morning.

231
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:12,256
[scoffs] I mean, if I told you
all of our nation's secrets,

232
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,341
they wouldn't be secrets anymore,
would they?

233
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,070
- [Agent Sharpe chuckles] Yes.
- Right?

234
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,238
And who knows, there may even be
a commendation for you

235
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:21,307
from President Warren G. Harding
once the case is declassified, you know?

236
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,019
I believe she means Calvin Coolidge,
'cause Mr. Harding is dead.

237
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,814
People always get
their inter-war presidents mixed up.

238
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,024
I need you to focus.

239
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,611
Are you ready to do the right thing
by your country?

240
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:37,489
Mister, Mister,
tell us when the circus is.

241
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,741
I want to go.

242
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,117
When is it you ask?

243
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,204
Like, uh... exactly what time?

244
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:47,372
[Sara] <i>You told them what?</i>

245
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,002
I'm sorry, Sara. I just panicked.

246
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,063
I didn't mean to invite
the whole town over tonight.

247
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,107
Take a breath, Gary.
We'll figure something else out.

248
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:57,593
Okay, wait, you're saying people
are coming here for an actual circus?

249
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,677
[all clamoring]

250
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,361
- All right, all right, everyone!
- Gary?

251
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,931
Just calm down.

252
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,476
Everything's going to be fine
once we open the safe.

253
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,852
Ah!

254
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:07,937
That's right.

255
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,207
When the whole town comes over,
we'll flash the hell out of them,

256
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,150
then we Time Courier our butts
outta here.

257
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,986
Yes. All right. That's right.

258
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,239
Another successful Legends mission
in the books.

259
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,362
Oh, it feels so good
to be back on track. All right.

260
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:21,784
[beeping]

261
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,624
There's no Time Courier.

262
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,832
There's a note.

263
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,589
"Taking Courier. Beer run. Rory."

264
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:36,673
- Classic.
- What?

265
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,300
- Son of a...
- Okay.

266
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,803
There's no couriers.
There's no flashers. There's no...

267
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,993
At least there's a <i>Time Bureau Manual.</i>

268
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,477
And Gummy Bears.

269
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,730
That's where I stashed
my emergency supply.

270
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,234
So, that's it?
Just a book and some gummies.

271
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,696
- No couriers.
- No flashers? No mini Gideon?

272
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,905
No breath mints.

273
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:03,409
Hey, look, it's okay.
You guys, it's gonna be okay.

274
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,453
Look, as long as the town
keeps buying our cover story,

275
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,080
then we'll come up with Plan B.

276
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,872
It's gonna be great.

277
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,298
That fellow wasn't Mr. Hoover at all.

278
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,135
Hair products, my foot!

279
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:22,720
[phone rings]

280
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,596
Is this the Bureau of Investigation?

281
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,558
This is Sheriff Thomas Wood
of Odessa, Texas.

282
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,853
I've got a situation down here
you ought to know about.

283
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,194
Wow. So, we're really doing this?
We're living in 1925 for a spell?

284
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,613
[Zari] 1925 is a total hayseed year.

285
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,242
These people are covered in sun spots.
Microdermabrasion's still decades away.

286
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:48,704
Anything I know about the '20s is that
they invented a lot of dance moves.

287
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,433
Maybe we should just get out
of this small town and find the parties.

288
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:53,959
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That goes against Rule 23,

289
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,521
which states that in order to limit
potential damage to the timeline,

290
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,672
marooned time travelers
should stay in one...

291
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,215
One location.

292
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,134
Okay, then we will stay put.

293
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,677
All right? We'll figure it out.

294
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:04,928
First things first.

295
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,156
We got the whole town
coming over tonight,

296
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,349
and they are expecting a circus.

297
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,315
We have to put on a show
to protect our cover.

298
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,157
If there is no circus, they may
inadvertently see the <i>Wa verider...</i>

299
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,814
No. Which violates,
like, half of this manual.

300
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:16,899
That cannot happen.

301
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,486
Okay, well, I just hope
that we get this done before...

302
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,278
Mommy!

303
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,199
[all] Hi.

304
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,076
It looks like the humans
won the <i>War of the Worlds.</i>

305
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,159
We're all still here.

306
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,664
<i>Mija,</i> tell me why are people in town
asking about a circus on my property?

307
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,582
We need to talk.

308
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,543
Are those my curtains?

309
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,545
- Is that Celso's suit?
- Yes.

310
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,255
[speaking Spanish]

311
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,803
I don't see how the circus act gets us
any closer to getting out of here.

312
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,179
This is just triage, Astra,

313
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,698
dealing with the problem at hand.

314
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,450
Without the <i>Wa verider,</i>
we don't have a lot of options.

315
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:53,268
So, if we are to convince
these town people

316
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:57,022
that we are actually a circus,
we need to practice.

317
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,357
Let's go.

318
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,692
I want those juggling skills on point!

319
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,671
- [Zari] You juggle, right?
- [Behrad] Yeah, is it that obvious?

320
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,928
They need to distract everyone
from seeing the remains of a time ship,

321
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,036
which blew up.

322
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,871
After the aliens attacked the house,

323
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,040
and we were saved by space mushroom.

324
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,543
[exhales] Look, <i>mija...</i>

325
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,087
I'm already on thin ice here.

326
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,714
It's not easy for these people
to accept a magical hero

327
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,883
from another land living in their town.

328
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,179
But I trust you.

329
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,852
And if I am ostracized

330
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,478
or arrested,

331
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,940
then... so be it. I'll deal with it.

332
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,526
Because you're my daughter,

333
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,361
and I would do anything for you.

334
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,374
[brick clangs]

335
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,374
Looking good.

336
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,377
Looking good.

337
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,750
[Spooner] I'm sorry, guys.

338
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,629
I'm pulling the plug on the circus.

339
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,006
What? What's wrong?

340
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,676
Look, what's wrong is that
this circus is going to bring

341
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,679
a lot of unwanted attention to my mom,
and she already feels persecuted.

342
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,973
This isn't just about us anymore.

343
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,684
Every time we try to fix something,
we just dig a bigger hole

344
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,145
and my mom is going to be
the one stuck paying for it.

345
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,984
Look, we're sorry, Spooner.

346
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,403
You're right. This isn't just about us.

347
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:29,698
We'll get out of town
and we'll figure something else out.

348
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,782
No more circus.

349
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:31,867
No more commotion.

350
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,243
Thank you.

351
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,370
Where's Astra?

352
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,175
[speaking other language]

353
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,426
What are you doing?

354
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,345
What does it look like I'm doing?

355
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,847
Well, it looks like
you're trying to fix the ship

356
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,211
using John's resurrection spell.

357
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,352
But that would be stupid because
it's for humans, not for time ships.

358
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,854
If John were here,
this is exactly what he would do.

359
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,900
Now shut up and let me concentrate.

360
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,569
You might wanna stand back.

361
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,576
[door opens and closes]

362
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,329
- [man] Sheriff Thomas Wood?
- In the flesh.

363
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:18,956
You called the office in DC.

364
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,792
about someone impersonating
a federal agent, namely me.

365
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,711
J. Edgar Hoover.

366
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,814
Luckily, we were just
down the way in Midland,

367
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,632
so I thought I'd pay you a visit myself.

368
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,053
Welcome to Odessa.

369
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,058
I can't believe
the top lawman in the country

370
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,394
is standing in my very own station.

371
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,939
Again. The real one this time.

372
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,651
Now, tell me more about this scoundrel.

373
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,321
[speaking other language]

374
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,130
[speaking other language]

375
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,192
Is she doing what I think she's doing?

376
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,362
Whatever it is, it's pretty cool.

377
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,126
It's likely that this imposter
is a member of the Midland Robbery Gang,

378
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,337
an outfit we've been tracking
for some time.

379
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,172
- Bank robbers.
- That's right.

380
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,133
And you just handed that degenerate
a brand-new safe to crack.

381
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,760
Now,

382
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,135
which way did he go?

383
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,139
Hell's bells,
he could be anywhere by now.

384
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,814
[Gary] Astra,

385
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,232
maybe you should stop.

386
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,556
You know, because of the blood?

387
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,028
If John could do this, I can do this.

388
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,907
Damn it, Astra. Stop it!

389
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,534
[speaking other language]

390
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:23,913
Astra!

391

[loud clanging]

00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,755

[ship whooshing]

394
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:36,927
[Hoover] Well, Sheriff,

395
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:40,639
I reckon I know just where this imposter
is trying to blow open that safe.

396
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,524
[groans]

397
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,901
Ow...

398
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,117
I feel like I was run over by a bus.

399
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,787
Yeah, since this isn't the Med Bay,

400
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,289
I'm guessing my spell
didn't resurrect the <i>Wa verider.</i>

401
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,333
[Spooner] No. It didn't.

402
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,626
What were you thinking?

403
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,964
[sighs] Hey. A little sympathy?

404
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,299
I got injured trying to help you.

405
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,802
By creating another huge spectacle
at my mom's house.

406
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,595
Not what she needs right now.

407
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,933
I was the only one doing anything
to get this clown show out of Texas.

408
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,396
Think it through next time.

409
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,148
No offense,

410
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,483
but your mom lives in the boonies.

411
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,652
I doubt anyone noticed.

412
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,112
[vehicle approaching]

413
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:40,615
Someone did.

414
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,457
Guys,

415
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,959
it's J. Edgar Hoover. The real one.

416
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,146
He's gonna wanna know who we are.

417
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,589
So, we are doing the circus.

418
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,384
No, no. Esperanza and I,
we will talk to the men.

419
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,677
Astra has to stay in bed,

420
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,721
but the rest of you cannot be here.

421
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,431
Okay, um...

422
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,556
Go hide.

423
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,768
It's too open concept in here to hide.

424
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,227
Bedroom. Go, go, come on.

425
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:22,908
Evening, ladies.

426
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,993
J. Edgar Hoover,
Bureau of Investigation.

427
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,912
Which one of you is Gloria Cruz?

428
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,414
I am.

429
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:31,833
How can I help you, sir?

430
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,974
Heard about some
bank robbers in the area.

431
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:35,629
Unsavory fellas.

432
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,590
Just checking to make sure you're safe.

433
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,552
Well, no bank robbers.
Just enjoying a quiet afternoon.

434
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,973
If you don't mind, I was talking to
the owner of the property in question.

435
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,355
- I don't think it's working.
- Why not?

436
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,022
Try the closet.

437
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,901
It's locked.

438
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,444
Zari, the key.

439
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,089
John said we'd find out what it's for.

440
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,156
Maybe it's this.

441
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,159
Okay. Fine.

442
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,538
[gasping]

443
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:11,706
Yo.

444
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,086
[air whooshing]

445
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,745
I think we'll have a look around.

446
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,846
Just to be sure.

447
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,599
I have a patient in there.
She's recuperating.

448
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:33,687
[floorboard creaking]

449
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:35,689
Go. Just go.

450
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,491
Where are we?

451
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,168
The mansion?

452
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,631
Hey.

453
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,448
So, if we're in the mansion,
does that mean it's present day?

454
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,533
Did we make it out of 1925?

455
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:32,454
No and yes.
But we're not in any year at all.

456
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,538
Gary?

457
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,249
This isn't really the mansion. It's a...

458
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,793
A pocket dimension
that John made for himself.

459
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,963
John wanted a place
where he could be all alone, so he...

460
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,089
He conjured it.

461
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,884
So, if we go out the front door...

462
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,096
[screams]

463
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:57,187
Is this a pocket dimension
in hell, Gary?

464
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,691
I recommend only exiting
through the door we came in.

465
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,614
Why would John give me this place?

466
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,743
Is it possible that man is so conceited

467
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:15,205
he thinks I need an alternate dimension
to get over him?

468
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,709
I don't know everything about John,
but I know he loved you.

469
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,798
Maybe he just thought you could use
a nice, quiet place to be alone?

470
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,883
Out of the spotlight for once.

471
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,512
Out of the spotlight.

472
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:34,349
B, I thrive in the spotlight.
It's where I'm most me.

473
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:38,103
You're acting like
I need to find myself,

474
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:39,646
but I'm not hiding. It...

475
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:43,608
[clears throat]

476
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,552
There's an answer in here somewhere.

477
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,659
It's just a book of rules, babe.

478
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,202
Rules we should be following.

479
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,973
Okay, we almost ruined Gloria's life,
and we almost interacted with Hoover,

480
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,915
which means we almost changed history.

481
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,918
Yeah, but we didn't, huh?

482
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:05,714
Babe...

483
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,424
Hey, will you look at me?

484
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,476
I know it feels like
the walls are closing in,

485
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,804
but we will figure this out.

486
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,014
You keep saying that.

487
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,408
Okay, Sara? But we're getting sloppy.

488
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,891
And without memory flashers,

489
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,643
or Time Couriers, or Gideon to guide us,

490
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,186
we are lost. Okay?

491
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,647
And you really think
that manual will help?

492
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,399
Probably not, but I just...

493
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:25,649
[exhales]

494
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:26,735
I need to.

495
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,863
- Okay.
- Okay.

496
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:32,782
You keep reading.

497
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:36,536
[sighs]

498
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,250
I have reason to suspect
that the Midland Robbery Gang

499
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,376
are holed up around here.

500
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,763
Sheriff Wood said one of the gang
members got ahold of a peculiar safe

501
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,006
that was in his possession.

502
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,765
Do you mind
if we search your property, ma'am?

503
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,054
Does it really matter
if I say yes or no?

504
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:56,765
Smart woman.

505
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,437
[door closes]

506
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,025
Okay. I overheard Hoover leaving.

507
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:08,943
All right, guys. Let's go!

508
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:11,863
Hey.

509
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,239
You coming?

510
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,057
Actually, I think I'm gonna just...

511
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,870
stay for a little bit.

512
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,789
Oh. Good for you, sis.

513
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,911
And in case if you like
slowing things down a little.

514
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,585
What does that mean?

515
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,047
Oh, brother.

516
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,345
Come on.

517
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,352
Whoo.

518
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,270
You're back.

519
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,551
How did Hoover not see you guys?

520
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,192
We just hopped over
to another plane of existence

521
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,920
where space and time
don't function normally.

522
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,862
- No big whoop.
- [Gary] You know, we could just

523
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,405
hide out in the mansion.

524
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:56,074
We'd be out of Gloria's way.

525
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,159
Hiding isn't going to get us back
to our timeline,

526
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,994
or help us figure out
who blew up our ship.

527
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,162
So, where do we go?

528
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,247
New York City.

529
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:05,250
Guys, the manual mentions
an obscure scientist

530
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,627
who laid the foundation
for all of time travel,

531
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,462
a guy named Dr. Gwyn Davies.

532
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,757
He's alive right now in 1925,
and he lives in New York.

533
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,968
- That could work.
- Right?

534
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,511
And you're okay if we leave here?

535
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,471
I guess. As long as we have a plan.

536
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,974
- Good.
- Because y'all gotta go.

537
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,327
I mean, J. Edgar Hoover
is suspicious of my mom.

538
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,436
He thinks she's harboring
some bank robbers,

539
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,272
the Midland Gang or something.

540
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,691
[sighs] Hoover is indefatigable.

541
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,025
He's a bloodhound.

542
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,279
<i>He won 't let go of our scent
until he's won.</i>

543
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,664
Then let's give him what he wants.
Make him think he was right.

544
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,001
We will be the bank robbers.

545
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,503
We'll lead him out of Texas,
away from Gloria,

546
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,922
and all the while,
making our way to New York City.

547
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:56,259
Bank robbers were a big deal
in the 1920s.

548
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,969
And we'd certainly grab his attention.

549
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,847
Yeah, and all we have to do
is rob some banks.

550
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,640
I mean, yes, please.

551
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,185
Can I have just a word with you
for a minute?

552
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,396
What, you want to go on a crime spree?

553
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,166
I mean, I don't even like the idea
of leaving this house,

554
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,527
but since we have to... Listen to me,
we need to make very small footprints.

555
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,422
And remember,
we don't even have our equipment.

556
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,990
- What if somebody...
- Babe, look, you're right.

557
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,241
And I'm scared, too.

558
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,745
But I believe in us,
and I believe in our team.

559
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:28,583
We're more than time travel
and superpowers and gadgets and manuals.

560
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,919
We are the Legends,
and we can pull this off.

561
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,086
I know we can.

562
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,590
And as soon as we can time travel again,

563
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:38,176
we'll go and fix all the changes
that we made.

564
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:44,515
You can make a... You can make a list
of timeline IOUs. You love lists,

565
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,518
and then we will cross them off,
every single one.

566
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:48,937
Every single one?

567
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,480
Every single one.

568
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,648
Hmm?

569
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,108
[grumbles]

570
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:55,401
Fine.

571
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:00,531
All right. Crime spree it is.

572
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,742
But just until we can time travel again.

573
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,994
I'd like to stay here
with my mom for a bit.

574
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,372
Astra should stay too
until she's fully recovered.

575
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:11,042
Okay, we'll just pick you guys up
after we help invent time travel.

576
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,125
Guys?

577
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,420
Hoover's back.

578
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,679
Y'all are gonna get my mom arrested.

579
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:24,639
Gloria?

580
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,599
Do you have any rope?

581
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,103
Gloria Cruz?

582
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,688
You've been withholding information.

583
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,942
It's the Midland Gang. They just left.

584
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:39,070
They forced us to cooperate!
They said they were going to kill us.

585
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:41,406
[car starting]

586
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:43,074
Come on, babe, let's go!

587
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,158
Hurry, Sara!

588
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:46,911
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

589
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,956
Come on, Nate! Come on! Come on, get on!

590
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,170
Bye now! Thank you!

591
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,047
Whoo!

592
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,095
[exhales]

593
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,264
Should've peed before we left Gloria's.

594
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:31,622
Hmm.

595
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:35,751
Sorry.

596
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,524
- [fires gun]
- Hit the floor, boys, this is a robbery.

597
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,277
Hmm?

598
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,114
Not our first rodeo.

599
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,077
Whoa! Sorry, little lady. Bank's closed.

600
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:10,411
Little lady?

601
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,413
Who do you think you are?

602
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:14,040
Why are your teeth so pretty?

603
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,251
Fluoride. Now you heard me,
go on, get. Get!

604
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:20,296
This is a robbery. I know robberies.

605
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,881
You're running crowd control.

606
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,842
You heard the lady. Get on the ground.

607
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:29,097
And you? I want you to go to the safe
and get me 93 dollars and 65 cents.

608
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,640
Okay, okay.

609
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,476
- $93...
- Yeah, I did the calculation, babe.

610
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,745
It's all we need
to get to New York City.

611
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,312
Small footprints. You promised.

612
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,397
Give me the money!

613
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,234
I actually have enough here in the till.
No need to open the safe.

614
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,239
All right. Look, we weren't going to say
anything till after the robbery, but...

615
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,116
Come here.

616
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,119
- We're the Midland Gang.
- No way!

617
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:53,204
- Yeah.
- I love the Midland Gang!

618
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,705
Huge fan!

619
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:56,791
[fires gun]

620
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,876
I said get all the way down
on the ground, boys.

621
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,712
- Ava keeps shooting the ceiling.
- She hates ceilings.

622
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,798
Two women?

623
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,384
There's no women in the Midland Gang!

624
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,720
You can steal money from a bank, fine.

625
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,181
But you don't steal
somebody's gang name!

626
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:14,425
All right, lady.
Look, we don't have a gang name, okay?

627
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,186
You gotta have a gang name.
It's patriotic.

628
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,649
Oh, oh!
What about "The Legends of Tomorrow"?

629
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,068
- It's wordy.
- It is.

630
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:25,736
Ooh! Ooh!

631
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,780
"The Bullet Blondes."

632
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,242
Well, it's not just Sara and Ava.
We're in the gang, too.

633
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,035
They're doing all the heavy lifting.

634
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,329
"Bullet Blondes."

635
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:36,956
Damn it, B, it is catchy.

636
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:41,043
- Hmm. The Bullet Blondes.
- The Bullet Blondes.

637
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,920
The Bullet Blondes.

638
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:47,467
This robbery is the work
of The Bullet Blondes.

639
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:50,303
The Bullet Blondes.

640
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,322
[Behrad] You've got to be kidding me?

641
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,533
Now y'all are gonna put your heads down
and count to 100

642
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:56,357
- and pretend you never saw us.
- [Sara] Yeah.

643
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,621
Wait, wait, wait. And go about your
lives like none of this every happened.

644
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:03,566
Completing any historically significant
events you might otherwise have done.

645
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,859
Let's go!

646
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:07,904
Make way for The Bullet Blondes.

647
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,987
- The Bullet Blondes! Whoo hoo!
- [people cheering]

648
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,825
Thank you all for your cooperation.

649
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,827
Sorry about the guns.

650
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:17,205
The Bullet Blondes! The Bullet Blondes!

651
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,458
The Bullet Blondes. I like it.

652
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,728
I have to admit. You were right, babe.
That went off without a hitch.

653
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,629
I guess
we're The Bullet Blondes now!

654
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,422
[cheering and whooping]

655
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,427
Come on, Gary, let's go!

656
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:41,395
Whoo, 93 dollars and 65 cents
never felt so sweet!

657
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:42,706
I don't think that's
gonna change history,

658
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,646
but I am gonna write it down

659
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:46,108
in our to-do ledger
just to be sure that it doesn't.

660
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:48,754
Hopefully, Hoover's on our scent
and he's gonna follow us out of town

661
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:49,820
away from Gloria's house.

662
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:51,822
Next stop, New York City.

663
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:55,743
- Whoo!
- Uh-oh. Guys, something's up ahead.

664
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,414
[Sara] What, he already roadblocked us?

665
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,250
Damn, that Hoover works fast.

666
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,085
He's indefatigable.

667
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:06,921
It's over, Bullet Blondes.

668
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,715
Get out of the car
and put your hands on the ground.

669
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,596
- Gun it.
- What?

670
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,681
Are you sure?

671
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,808
I bet he has a pretty good aim
with that gun.

672
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,620
That's a good point. Nate, get behind
the wheel in case he opens fire.

673
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,729
- Come on, Gary. Let's go.
- Let's go, Gary.

674
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,064
[Gary yells]

675
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,734
[Nate] Get your feet out of my face!

676
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,028
[engine starts]

677
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,530
- Oh, God!
- All right, let's do it.

678
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:35,074
- Everyone else, get down.
- Get down!

679
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,202
I said small footprints, Sara!

680
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,646
Don't worry about it, babe.
We'll fix everything. I promise.

681
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:45,918
[gunfire]

682
00:34:58,431 --> 00:34:59,432
[both exclaim]

683
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,102
Whoo!

684
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:04,812
Yeah!

685
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,439
Oh! We made it!

686
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,941
[thumping]

687
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,359
Do you guys hear something?

688
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:12,403
Yeah.

689
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,154
[gasping]

690
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,157
- It's a fat...
- What?

691
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,909
- It's a fat bubble.
- What are you trying to say?

692
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,995
- Something about bubbles.
- Indefatigable!

693
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,204
What?

694
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,999
[all scream]

695
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,298
Oh, my...

696
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:34,842
What did you do?

697
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:35,926
I didn't kill him!

698
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,349
This is not happening.

699
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:42,475
This is not happening.

700
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:46,479
Hoover can't die! Hoover...
Hoover can't die!

701
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,067
- [grunts]
- Oh, my God, thank God, he's alive!

702
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,527
Indefatigable.

703
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,946
[hoarsely] I never miss twice.

704
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,115
- What? What did he say?
- I don't know.

705
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,241
What did you say?

706
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,325
I said...

707
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:01,744
[wheezes]

708
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:03,913
I never miss twice.

709
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,415
[gasps]

710
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:14,590
[Nate] I killed J. Edgar Hoover.

711
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,134
I killed J. Edgar Hoover!

712
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,642
[Nate] I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.

713
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,018
Hey, that... That was a...

714
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,520
- Sara, I am sorry.
- Oh, I know.

715
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:28,603
He's, uh...

716
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,440
very important to the timeline.

717
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,442
The timeline? The timeline is ruined!

718
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:35,403
History is ruined and...

719
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:38,046
we don't even have Gideon here
to tell us how badly we ruined it.

720
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,783
This is... I want to die. Goodbye.

721
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,285
I give up. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

722
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,412
Goodbye.

723
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:47,248
- [Sara] Babe?
- Did we break Ava?

724
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,959
- Hey, babe, you okay?
- No!

725
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,043
Yeah, you're okay.

726
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:55,381
Look, I know I talked you into this plan
and it has admittedly gone sideways,

727
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,633
but we are...
We're pretty committed, okay?

728
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,077
So we got to see this one through.

729
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,845
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

730
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:04,682
And then, when we get back to 2021,
we are gonna go on a real honeymoon.

731
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,309
We'll be on the beach.
We'll walk hand in hand.

732
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:12,064
We'll... We'll listen to one of your
STABcast podcasts and watch the sunset.

733
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,399
- It'll be like...
- STABcast!

734
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,401
[gasps]

735
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,527
That's it.

736
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,072
There are no witnesses.

737
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:21,532
We're lucky.

738
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:23,868
We gotta hit the road fast.

739
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:24,994
But first...

740
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,788
we gotta get rid of the body.

741
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,625
- Ava?
- Gary, that's your job.

742
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:33,126
Lose the glasses.

743
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:34,879
Aw!

744
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:38,758
You want me to eat one of the most
important figures of the 20th century?

745
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,111
We gotta get to New York
and we gotta get there fast.

746
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:43,739
We gotta find this Gwyn Davies
without messing up the timeline anymore.

747
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,599
And the first thing to do,
is to eat this body.

748
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:48,851
What has gotten into you?

749
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,146
I have been reading
true crime stories my entire life.

750
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:53,314
This is my time to shine.

751
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,065
Shut up and eat up, Gary.

752
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:57,985
You're in The Bullet Blondes now.

753
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,696
I'm a Bullet Blonde?

754
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,908
I swear I take no pleasure in this.

755
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:06,758
Beyond just the taste of human meat,
which, as you know, I find...

756
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,080
quite delicious.

757
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:11,540
Do it, Gary.

758
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,595
Astra, you're up?

759
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,847
Yeah, thought I'd make myself useful.

760
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,391
That's very sweet.

761
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:34,688
You're capable of so much more
than picking vegetables.

762
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,482
I have just recovered.

763
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,317
You have a terrible bedside manner.

764
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:44,198
Tell me, what did you do
to hurt yourself so much?

765
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,202
I tried to perform a spell
that I wasn't ready for,

766
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,787
and it nearly destroyed me.

767
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:55,751
God, my former mentor would be so
disappointed if he were here right now,

768
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:57,837
saying I have to be
willing to walk alone

769
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,400
and risk it all if I want to succeed.

770
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:10,182
You know, my mother was a great healer.

771
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,352
She taught me everything that she knew.

772
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,646
But I was terrible at it.

773
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,734
It wasn't until I was able
to cast off her training,

774
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:24,822
start fresh in a way
that reflected who I am,

775
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,199
that I truly became a healer myself.

776
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,826
Yeah, but...

777
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:32,663
Walk alone, sacrifice yourself,

778
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:34,790
that's what magic is about.

779
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,715
Your mentor taught you how he did magic.

780
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:43,799
Yeah?

781
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,051
But you're not him.

782
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:52,600
RIP.

783
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,853
So, you're just going to bury
the pieces of the <i>Wa verider?</i>

784
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,438
Well, it ain't gonna bury itself.

785
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,690
I'm gonna miss the old girl.

786
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,108
Really?

787
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,319
Astra Logue getting sentimental.

788
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:08,908
Look, I'm sorry I brought the cops
to your mom's place.

789
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,261
I don't blame you
for being pissed about it.

790
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:13,162
And I get it. You were trying to help.

791
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:15,915
I wasn't just trying
to help you, though.

792
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:20,336
I was trying to prove myself

I just wanted to show everyone
that I was worthy,

00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:25,674

John?

We don't need another John.

We need you.

Astra, I...

00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,393
I wasn't mad about the cops.

800
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:40,773
I mean, I wasn't happy about them,
but I was upset that you almost died.

801
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:42,733
I like having you around.

You're like my best friend.

No one's ever said that to me.

804
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,370
But you're mine, too.

Good.

00:40:57,081 --> 00:40:59,583
And if anything goes wrong,
we'll handle it.

I got your back.

00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,505
You know, it's too bad.

809
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,216
I almost finished that spell.

810
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,425
Hmm. You didn't finish it?

811
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:11,053
No, it was too much for me.

812
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,000
I bet John would've finished it.
