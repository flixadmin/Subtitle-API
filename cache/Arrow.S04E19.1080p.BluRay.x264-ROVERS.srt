1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,122
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,487
- These people. They're volunteers?
- True believers.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,884
Thank you for your service,
your mind and your belief in me.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,288
- What happened?
- Prisoners were out of their cells.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,327
<i>"DARHK". Ms. Lance.</i>

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,329
I want you to give your father a message.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,407
Help! Help in here, please!

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,365
Ollie, I know
that I am not the love of your life,

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,083
but you will always be the love of mine.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,611
Out of the Way!

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,161
- What happened?
- I don't know. She was fine.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,883
<i>Time Of death, 11:59.</i>

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,484
A life that hasn't had a chance
to fully grow

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,404
and live out its purpose in this world

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,241
is a life that has been
taken from this earth too soon.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,688
Oliver Queen,

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,561
whom I'm told is practically family,
will be delivering the eulogy.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,847
Mr. Queen?

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,044
Mr. Queen, are you ready?

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,688
I could probably say a few words.

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,687
Tommy Merlyn was one of the
greatest people that I've ever known.

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,803
He was... He was so much more than just

23
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,524
a billionaire playboy.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,085
I loved him.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,284
I loved him in every way
you could possibly love someone.

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,041
So did Oliver.

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,569
And I'm sure if Oliver could be here today
he would say so.

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,404
But clearly it's too painful.

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,004
I don't understand.

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,931
I'm sorry. I...

31
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,648
Where is she?

32
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,048
- Excuse me, are you a relative...
- Doctor.

33
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,001
It's her father.

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,331
<i>I'm, um, terribly sorry
for your loss.</i>

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,768
Uh, these are her belongings.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,126
I can take care of those.

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,127
Laurel.

38
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,441
Baby-

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,963
We should get you out of here.

40
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,085
I love you, too.

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,766
Give that baby girl a kiss for me.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,164
Didn't expect to see you standing there.

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,966
Where else would I go?

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,206
How's Lyla?

45
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,847
She and baby Sara
are at a A.R.G.U.S. safe house.

46
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,451
I have an army buddy
looking after Carly and Andy Jr.

47
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,006
You worried about your brother?

48
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,681
I don't think he would do anything
that hurt my family,

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,326
but I don't know.

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,085
Clearly I never knew him.

51
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,247
All right, John.

52
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,724
As the world's leading expert
in blaming yourself,

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,081
please don't do it.

54
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,810
You warned me, Oliver.

55
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,486
Straight up. You warned me.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,722
If I had listened to you
instead of trusting my brother,

57
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,450
Laurel would be alive right now.

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,724
You can't know that.

You called for the team.

What's going on, Oliver?

Well, Darhk is out there
and he has his magic back.

75
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,890
As much as I'm sure all of us want to
climb up inside of our own grief...

76
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,246
We have to get that son of a bitch.

77
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,646
<i>"THEA". Definitely. But...</i>

78

We haven't even put her in the ground yet.

- Uh, Captain?
- Page three.

80
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,208
This was last night, after Iron Heights.

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,844
This article says that she used her
sonic weapon against a dealer and a buyer.

82
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,246
Guys,
CCTV footage from last night's attack.

83
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,362
So Sara came back...
All the crazy things that we've seen,

84
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,562
maybe my baby, my baby girl,
maybe she's not gone.

85
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,729
I mean, we... We saw her.

86
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,165
Yeah, but you know, I mean.

87
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,442
Everyone thought Oliver
was dead when the Gambit went down.

88
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,166
Everybody thought Ray Palmer was dead.
Your brother?

89
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,409
Captain, I know, I know,
but this is different.

90
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,524
John's right. This bag from the hospital

91
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,649
was supposed to contain
all of Laurel's belongings.

92
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,881
<i>Supposed to.</i>

93
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,366
Her sonic device is missing.

94
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,766
You know, that explains it.

95
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,008
There were people
in and out of Laurel's room.

96
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,929
Doctors, nurses, orderlies...

97
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,527
You think someone took it?

98
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,881
Yeah.

99
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,201
Laurel.

100
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,485
Captain, let's not go there just yet.

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,444
Now, you don't think that
with everything that we have seen,

102
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,928
that we have all seen, that there is
a chance that Laurel is back?

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,169
<i>Cisco keyed the sonic device
to Laurel's vocal chords.</i>

104
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,930
No one else
is supposed to be able to use that.

105
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,889
Right, right.

106
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,009
What are you thinking?

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,969
Quentin?

108
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,680
Yeah.

109
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,007
Dr. Schwartz...

110
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,644
I'd like to thank you for your discretion
throughout all of this.

111
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,930
Doctor/patient privilege.

112
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,329
And in any case,
she, um, helped this city.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,243
The least I can do is help her and you.

114
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,209
At least 12 staffers saw me
bring her into the hospital last night.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,731
And they saw the Black Canary.

116
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,129
But we operated on Laurel Lance,

117
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,450
who, I believe, was injured
during an Iron Heights prison riot.

118
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,171
There was a Black Canary sighting
last night.

119
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,686
This person was wearing a sonic device.

120
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,289
The same sonic device that was taken
from Laurel's belongings in her room.

121
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,607
Are you saying..-

122
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,129
I have reason to believe that someone
walked into her room and took it.

123
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,524
Now can you put me on a path?

124
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,200
There's a frequent flyer...

125
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,806
Frequent flyer? What does that mean?

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,482
A patient who pays repeated visits
to the ER.

127
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,685
Now I've treated her a few times
and there's something...

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,803
- There's something off about her?
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,563
Would you give me her name?

130
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,091
Doctor/patient privilege
applies to all my patients, Mr. Queen.

131
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,005
Yeah.

132
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,329
Oliver.

133
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,605
I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go.

134
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,365
Do you want to come inside?

135
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,004
I don't think that it's the best idea.

136
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,842
I'm sorry they didn't let your mom
attend the funeral.

137
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,364
It was a nice service.

138
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,364
Tommy would've liked it.

139
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,166
He would've liked it more
if you would have said a few words.

140
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,809
Stayed up all night.
I was working on the eulogy.

141
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,729
I just filled page after page
with stories of us.

142
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,522
But then I realized that I just didn't
have the right to say any of those things.

143
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,681
What are you talking about?

144
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,690
Oliver, Tommy loved you.

145
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,489
Laurel, I failed him.

146
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,688
I came back from that island
with another chance.

147
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,848
It was a chance to help people.

148
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,051
It was a chance to make this city better

149
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,930
and I couldn't.

150
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,005
And now Tommy's dead.

151
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,605
Oliver,

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,684
you can't blame yourself.

153
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,206
You'd blame me, too,
if you knew the truth.

154
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,284
What truth?

155
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,684
That was Oliver.
Laurel's still, you know, there.

156
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,249
But he thinks he has a lead on some woman

157
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,046
who recently visits
the emergency room a lot.

158
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,130
I'm gonna try and cross-reference
facial recog from last night's attack

159
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,442
with the hospital's security footage.

160
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,721
Hey-

161
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,283
At the hospital, you said that you'd
never forgive yourself for what happened.

162
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,487
Andy's working with Darhk.
Has been the entire time.

163
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,327
He helped him find the idol,
helped him out ofjail.

164
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,891
Oliver warned me
but I pretty much told him to go to hell.

165
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,964
Laurel's dead because of me.

166
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,004
<i>I don't know what happened.
I wasn't there.</i>

167
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,926
I don't know what to say.

168
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,730
There's nothing to say.

169
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,090
Thank you for everything at the hospital.

170
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,404
I don't think any of us
were ready to talk to the media.

171
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,969
One of the few advantages
of dating a political operative, I guess.

172
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,441
Sorry, I didn't mean to joke.

173
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,603
Please, I could... I could use some jokes.

174
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,363
Anything to keep my mind off of

175
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,167
everything.

176
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,286
Speaking of, actually, you've...

177
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,160
You never told me why you became
a political operative anyway.

178
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,286
<i>Alex Davis.</i>

179
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,689
You work for them!

180
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,282
What are you talking about?

181
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,845
<i>- Ollie.
- What's going on?</i>

182
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,601
Alex just got attacked by some girl
wearing Laurel's sonic device.

183
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,001
<i>Do you know where she went?</i>

184
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,368
You're dressed like a friend of mine. Why?

185
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,691
Why did you abandon us?

186
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,130
We needed your help
and all you cared about were your friends.

187
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,410
You didn't care about any of us.

188
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,641
What are you talking about...

189
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,362
You left us. You left us at Reddington!

190
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,605
You left us there to die!

191
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,649
You failed this city.

192
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,650
It wasn't Laurel,
but it was sure like seeing a ghost.

193
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,326
And hearing one.
That sonic device has been modified.

194
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,448
My earplugs did not do a thing.

195
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,768
The sonic device is what
shouldn't have done the damn thing.

196
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,247
But you said Cisco keyed it
specifically to Laurel.

197
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,442
It should have only worked with Laurel.

198
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,170
The crazy part is that
this girl is using it

199
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,243
at much higher decibels
than Laurel ever did.

200
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,851
Okay, so who is this girl?

201
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,924
Well, when she attacked Alex,
she accused him of working for someone.

202
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,690
Ruvé Darhk?

203
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,841
HIVE.

204
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,480
<i>She said the Green Arrow
left them at Reddington to die.</i>

205
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,484
- What's Reddington?
- Reddington Industrial

206
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,967
is where Darhk held you all hostage
over the holidays.

207
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,924
You think this girl was one of
HIVE's prisoners?

208
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,685
They weren't prisoners, remember?
They were volunteers.

209
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,446
Right, but still,
let's check missing persons

210
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,361
for a family with at least one teenage
daughter who went missing over Christmas.

211
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,043
The Sharp family.

212
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,681
Mom and Dad's bodies
were found two days after Christmas.

213
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,211
Cause of death, hypoxia.

214
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,329
Could be HIVE's gas chamber...

215
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,045
What about the daughter?

216
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,004
Class president. Academic decathlete.
Gymnast.

217
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,282
Basically, a 16-year-old badass
in the making.

218
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,681
She never even missed a day of school.

219
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,042
Until her parents met Damien Darhk,
I'm guessing.

220
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,403
She said we left them there to die.
And we did.

221
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,563
- What do you mean?
- All those people at Reddington...

222
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,881
Were there of their own choosing, Oliver.

223
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,408
And we know that HIVE drugs people
to make them susceptible to suggestion.

224
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,564
She told me that we've failed this city

225
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,564
and she's not wrong.

226
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,402
Thanks for coming.

227
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,480
I fear I lack the words
to convey the true depths of my sympathy.

228
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,200
To lose a child once is unimaginable.

229
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,323
But for it to be both children...

230
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,604
Listen, I know you and I haven't always
been on the same side of things,

231
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,525
but, uh, Laurel, you know,
she thought of you as a friend...

232
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,728
Just as I thought of her.

233
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,606
She brought me comfort
during a difficult time period.

234
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,729
The world will be a darker place
without her.

235
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,571
Yeah. Well, not for long.

236
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,603
Okay, I got all her things.
What else do I need?

237
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,126
I'm afraid I don't understand.

238
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,282
What else do I have to bring for her

239
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,251
when she comes out of this, you know,
Lazarus Pit thing.

240
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,968
I would do anything for your daughter.

241
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,202
But I destroyed the Pit months ago.

242
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,601
Um...

243
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,726
Okay, well,
there's got to be something else.

244
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,405
I am so very sorry.

245
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,370
So you don't wanna help me?

246
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,566
Fine.

247
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,803
I'll find some other way
to bring her back.

248
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,651
Just scouring traffic cameras for Evelyn,
but I keep striking out.

249
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,405
What are you doing here?

250
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,090
Thinking.

251
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,489
Which is Oliver-speak
for beating yourself up.

252
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,891
I thought you were reformed from that.

253
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,522
Feels like as good a time as any
to bring it back.

254
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,723
Because of Laurel
or because of what that girl said?

255
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,166
Bit of both.

256
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,170
I tried to do the right thing
and I came up short.

257
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,209
I came up short for that girl

258
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,811
and for Laurel.

259
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,531
I mean, maybe I shouldn't
feel responsible, but I do.

260
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,527
Yeah. It's going around.

261
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,165
You mean John?

262
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,326
No, I mean me.

263
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,721
John was looking for someone
to absolve him,

264
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,163
reassure him that what happened
wasn't his fault and I couldn't do it.

265
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,203
I think for a second,
I let him blame himself because

266
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,488
for a minute it saved me from blaming me.

267
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,845
I should have been there.

268
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,762
I wasn't there,
with the team in the bunker.

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,844
I know I would have just been behind a
keyboard and I know it seems like hubris,

270
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,326
but I've made a difference before

271
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,245
and I can't help but think
that if I was there...

272
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,443
You know,
maybe she'd still be here.

273
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,522
Do you know why

274
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,611
I always blame myself
in situations like this?

275
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,928
Because at least it's an answer.

276
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,123
Sometimes we just need a reason

277
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,367
when a situation
is completely unreasonable.

278
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,122
<i>- Hello?
- Lyla called asking for John.</i>

279
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,091
Except he's supposed to be
checking in on her.

280
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,810
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

281
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,725
I have trackers on all of you.
I'll check and I'll get back to you.

282
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,162
<i>Well, tell those curious</i>

283
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,086
that the city has undertaken to do
a massive upgrade of the sewage system.

284
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,409
I mean, what happens below ground
is simply not their concern.

285
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,160
Why are we stopping?

286
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,561
Get down.

287
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,801
Get out!

288
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,123
What do you think you're doing?
I am the mayor of this city.

289
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,287
I don't care who you are.

290
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,082
You're gonna be a lot less if you don't
get out of that limo right now. Move.

291
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,808
Can I help you with something?

292
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,083
I mean, I always enjoy spending time
with my constituents.

293
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,526
Shut up!

294
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,807
You know who I am.

295
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,368
You know exactly who I am
and you know who my brother is.

296
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,681
I don't know what you're talking about...

297
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,166
Stop lying!

298
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,170
Fine, we'll do this your way.

299
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,842
Maybe you can give your husband
a message for me.

300
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,203
Let him know I'm not playing games
with him anymore.

301
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,880
Argh!

302
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,363
Get away from her, John.

303
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,280
Stay out of my way.

304
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,209
What the hell do you think you're doing?

305
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,362
Trying to find Andy.

306
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,369
By attacking the mayor of the city?

307
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,165
By going after Damien Darhk's wife.

308
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,131
It doesn't matter if she's Darhk's wife.
She is the mayor.

309
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,203
She has the media. She has the police!

310
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,006
I don't give a damn!

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,684
I'm so angry, I can hardly breathe.

312
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,167
Every minute he's out there is a...

313
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,081
ls another minute
he can hurt someone I love.

314
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,560
John,

315
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,687
I know.

316
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,891
But this isn't who you are.

317
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,086
I don't know.
I don't know who I am anymore.

318
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,685
Oliver,

319
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,889
all I know is...
All I can hold on to is that...

320
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,526
I have to find my brother.

321
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,723
And do what?

322
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,762
Laurel's gone, and finding Andy
and whatever you're gonna do to him,

323
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,446
it's not gonna bring her back.

324
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,682
But, if she were here,

325
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,560
she'd tell you the same thing
that I'm going to tell you.

326
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,250
You cannot forget who you are.

327
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,249
And we,

328
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,927
we can never become them.

329
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,445
Where have you guys been?

330
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,601
Doesn't matter.

331
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,121
Have we had any luck
tracking down Evelyn Sharp?

332
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,768
No, I keep hitting dead ends.
Not the best choice of words.

333
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,727
News alert.

334
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,362
<i>Tonight, my security detail and I
were attacked</i>

335
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,291
<i>by one of these lawless vigilantes
who claim to protect this city.</i>

336
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,529
<i>This attack came less than 24 hours
after another vigilante,</i>

337
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,607
<i>named the Black Canary,
assaulted my Chief of Staff, Alex Davis.</i>

338
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,807
<i>Now these same masked criminals
were confirmed to be at Iron Heights</i>

339
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,362
<i>when one of this city's</i>

340
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,966
<i>beloved civil servants,</i>

341
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,403
<i>Laurel Lance, was fatally injured.</i>

342
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,251
<i>Well, tonight, I say, no more.</i>

343
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,762
<i>Tonight I asked District Attorney Wallace</i>

344
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,164
<i>to issue arrest warrants
for these so-called vigilantes.</i>

345
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,689
<i>Beginning with Mr. Davis' attacker,
the Black Canary.</i>

346
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,327
<i>We will dedicate
the arrest and prosecution</i>

347
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,285
<i>of this so-called "Black Canary"</i>

348
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,770
<i>to A.D.A. Laurel Lance,
one of this city's brightest lights...</i>

349
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,126
Turn it off.

350
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,321
<i>"RLNE". Thank you.</i>

351
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,606
She knows Laurel was the Black Canary.

352
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,211
And now she has the whole police force

353
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,011
gunning for a scared,
frightened teenage girl.

354
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,043
I'll call Alex.

355
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,130
Okay.

356
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,527
We need to find Evelyn
before the SCPD does.

357
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,961
Yes.

358
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,567
Yeah.

359
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,691
Mr. Lance's agony is understandable,

360
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,963
but its pain is sharpened by denial.

361
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,561
I fear that...
That refusal to accept reality

362
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,563
will lead Mr. Lance
to take desperate action.

363
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,405
Thank you for letting me know.
I will keep an eye on him.

364
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,846
Oliver,

365
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,489
are you all right?

366
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,406
Our friend was killed at the hands of a
man that I am currently powerless to stop

367
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,006
and his wife is dragging her legacy
through the mud.

368
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,842
And after everything she's done,
everything she's stood for,

369
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,525
it just doesn't seem right.

370
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,451
I'm glad you finally decided to come over.

371
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,409
Oh, it's been a week.

372
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,445
I feel like Tommy would be pissed at me

373
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,286
if I didn't eventually
come out of my self-pity.

374
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,522
Yeah.

375
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,521
You know, he loved you so much.

376
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,965
This was right after you won
student body president our senior year.

377
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,442
Do you remember how I won?

378
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,524
Of course. You were
the most deserving candidate by far.

379
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,967
Well, the gift baskets encouraging people
to vote for me, that didn't hurt either.

380
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,925
That was Tommy's idea.

381
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,971
No, but,

382
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,049
seriously, it's easy to buy people off
with money that you didn't even earn.

383
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,722
- You did all the hard work.
- Hmm.

384
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,282
We always did make a great team.

385
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,004
You know, I was thinking about what you
said in the hallway after Tommy's funeral

386
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,847
and wanting to help
make the city a better place.

387
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,920
We still can.

388
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,163
Laurel Lance.

389
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,243
Always trying to save the world.

390
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,640
Yeah, but it doesn't have to be just me.

391
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,081
You can, too.

392
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,851
We can do it together.

393
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,764
I'm really excited
about the future, Ollie.

394
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,961
What do you...

395
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,326
There's no one in there.

396
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,443
It's where the League of Assassins
hang their black hoods.

397
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,524
No, that's right, but there is no
Lazarus Pit and no League in there.

398
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,564
No, but it might be something, just some
clue, all right? Next step on the trail.

399
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,962
There's no trail! Quentin,

400
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,208
Laurel is gone
and there is no bringing her back.

401
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,641
No, no. To hell with that.

402
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,888
And if you don't wanna help me,
to hell with you, too!

403
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,566
- I am helping you.
- No, you're not. Because, you know why?

404
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,042
'Cause you do not know what it is like
to lose a child. No idea.

405
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,890
But I have lost a father.

406
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,370
I have lost a mother
and I have lost Laurel! We have lost her!

407
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,008
We have.

408
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,084
If there was a way, if there was any way

409
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,007
to bring her back,
I would find it and I would do it.

410
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,602
But there isn't, for either of us.

411
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,401
You don't understand.

412
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,602
Right when we lost Sara,
when I became a drunk,

413
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,091
when no one else believed in me, she did.

414
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,601
She's always been there. She's my rock!

415
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,445
All right.

416
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,603
She was my rock.

417
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,770
<i>I can't do this.</i>

418
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,571
Oh, God! Oh, no.

419
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,284
I can't do this.

420
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,450
- John?
- You got something?

421
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,365
Yeah. An apology.

422
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,646
I never should have let you think

423
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,563
that you could have prevented
what happened to Laurel.

424
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,287
Not even for a second. I was just dealing
with my own guilt for not being there.

425
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,324
You have nothing
to be sorry about, Felicity.

426
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,162
If I had listened to Oliver and not
trusted my brother, Laurel would be alive.

427
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,004
No, you don't know that.

428
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,400
Oliver keeps saying the same thing.

429
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,843
Except I keep going through this
over and over again in my head and it...

430
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,005
It's true.

431
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,323
Only thing I don't quite get
is how I could have been so blind.

432
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,451
Well, Andy's your brother, you know?
We make exceptions for family.

433
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,681
Yeah.

434
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,362
And I'm the one constantly telling Oliver
not to have a blind spot for family.

435
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,285
And here you are, taking the blame
for something that's not your fault.

436
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,082
You're just one illegitimate child away

437
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,971
from a really awesome
Oliver Queen impersonation.

438
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,970
Butjust like we tell Oliver,
what happened was not your fault

439
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,082
and Laurel would have wanted you
to know that.

440
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,567
What's that?

441
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,287
Evelyn Sharp. Facial recognition picked
her up outside of Star City Plaza Hotel.

442
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,201
What's she doing there?

443
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,411
That's where Ruvé Darhk is.
She's getting revenge for her family.

444
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,483
Well, if she's gonna kill Ruvé Darhk,
my vote is yes.

445
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,923
It's not just killing Ruvé Darhk.
In that mask, in that costume,

446
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,565
she'd be killing Laurel's legacy.

447
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,805
Hello, pleasure to meet you.

448
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,803
- Excuse me.
- Not right now.

449
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,922
Keep your eyes peeled.
She's out there somewhere.

450
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,610
I'm on site.

451
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,081
Yeah, so is the Anti-Vigilante Task Force
and they've come ready to play.

452
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,645
We need to find that girl before they do.

453
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,371
Hey!

454
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,886
Heading in.

455
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,889
Ma'am. You shouldn't be in here.

456
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,209
Funny,
I was going to tell you the same thing.

457
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,131
The Black Canary is in the building.
I need to get you to a secure location.

458
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,166
Oh, you'll do no such thing. Let her come.

459
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,124
Let her try.

460
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,647
I found her. Second floor. Two hundred
feet from the Liberty Ballroom,

461
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,484
Ruvé Darhk and a lot of innocent people.

462
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,281
On it.

463
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,045
Don't.

464
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,411
Don't go in there.

465
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,846
Get away.

466
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,890
I can't do that.

467
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,561
And you can't do this.

468
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,809
Now, I know you want revenge on HIVE
for what they did to your parents.

469
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,161
But this isn't the way.

470
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,203
It's the only way I have left.

471
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,531
Evelyn, don't.

472
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,121
Argh!

473
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,605
You've failed this city...

474
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,767
I understand that you're trying
to make things right.

475
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,762
<i>That is not how you get justice done.</i>

476
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,321
What did you know
about the real Black Canary?

477
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,807
What did you know
about what she stood for?

478
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,084
She was there that night.

479
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,481
I saw her.

480
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,808
<i>Then you saw what kind of person she was.</i>

481
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,480
She was a hero.

482
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,524
<i>Now, maybe you were wearing that mask
for a reason.</i>

483
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,326
<i>But right now I need you to ask yourself,</i>

484
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,371
what would the Black Canary
want you to do?

485
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,081
<i>Come on.</i>

486
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,847
Arrest him.

487
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,162
I've seen this movie before.

488
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,125
No sign of Evelyn.
Kid must've found out I was tracking her.

489
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,322
I really missed her out there tonight.

490
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,770
In a way, she was out there. In spirit,
I mean. Not in a Lazarus Pit kind of way.

491
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,248
And ultimately, she made the right choice.

492
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,529
I think Laurel would've liked
that she inspired someone.

493
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,006
How can you say that?

494
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,445
Evelyn Sharp just destroyed
Laurel's memory out there tonight.

495
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,803
Now the Black Canary is only gonna be
remembered for whatever Evelyn's done.

496
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,082
Evelyn's not the Black Canary.

497
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,362
Oh, well, to every reporter and person

498
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,449
with a camera in that room tonight,
she was.

499
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,729
Ruvé Darhk's gonna make sure
everybody sees that footage.

500
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,169
As far as
the rest of the world is concerned,

501
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,285
the Black Canary is now a gun-toting,
would-be murderer.

502
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,564
I'm not going to let that happen.

503
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,810
Oh, Quentin,

504
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,128
I never thought we'd be here again.

505
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,206
Me neither.

506
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,410
I figured we were punished enough
first time around.

507
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,043
We were, oh,

508
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,803
at least for a while,
and then Sara came back to us.

509
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,207
I don't think
that's going to happen this time.

510
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,642
How can you say that?

511
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,971
Our girls always come back to us, Quentin.

512
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,249
Yeah, maybe before, but not this time.

513
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,047
I'm sorry, Di, but she's gone.

514
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,608
She's never coming back.

515
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,043
She's...

516
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,563
Mr. Queen has requested
to say a few words.

517
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,041
This, uh...
This doesn't seem right. Uh...

518
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,325
I knew Laurel Lance for

519
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,085
almost her entire life.

520
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,721
She was my friend and I loved her.

521
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,483
Before she died, I was...

522
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,766
I was lucky enough to hear her tell me
that she loved me, too.

523
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,962
Laurel Lance became a lawyer to help
people who may have appeared helpless.

524
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,601
She wanted to give a voice to the silent.

525
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,290
Butjust being a lawyer wasn't enough.

526
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,886
She wanted to do more,

527
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,970
for those people and for this city,

528
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,883
because she loved this city so much.

529
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,288
By now, everyone knows that Laurel was
killed in the Iron Heights prison riot.

530
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,444
And while it's true that she was
an Assistant District Attorney,

531
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,763
that's not what she was doing there
that night.

532
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,289
Before she died, Laurel told me the truth.

533
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,968
Laurel Lance was the Black Canary.

534
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,523
<i>And for the past few days,</i>

535
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,607
I have had to sit and listen to people try
and paint the Black Canary as a criminal.

536
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,121
She was not a criminal. She was a hero.

537
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,725
She was a hero in every way
that a person can be.

538
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,929
<i>And if Laurel were here,</i>

539
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,922
I know that she would expect all of us
to live up to the example that she set.

540
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,923
She'd want us to save our city.

541
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,322
<i>Dear Laurel, I wrote this letter</i>

542
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,683
<i>because I don't have the courage
to see the disappointment on your face.</i>

543
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,362
<i>I know you're going to go on
to do amazing things,</i>

544
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,767
<i>to help people and to raise this city up.</i>

545
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,321
<i>Because that's who you are,
it's who you've always been.</i>

546
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,649
<i>And that's why I have to go</i> away.

547
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,405
<i>I would only hold you back.</i>

548
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,045
<i>You're the hero, Laurel.</i>

549
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,765
<i>Maybe I'll come back eventually,</i>

550
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,645
<i>but for now I have to spend
some time alone.</i>

551
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,161
<i>I hope someday
you'll understand my decision.</i>

552
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,170
<i>Never doubt my love for you.</i>

553
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,203
<i>You've always seen the best in me</i>

554
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,568
<i>because you've always been the best of me.</i>

555
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,565
<i>All my love, Oliver.</i>

556
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,250
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.

557
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,411
- Zoom?
- Yeah.

558
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,603
There was a time,
I would have thought this was my fault.

559
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,208
That I brought this darkness upon us.

560
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,609
<i>Now I know it's not my fault.</i>

561
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,291
It's my responsibility.

562
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,761
Responsibility to do what?

563
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,201
To end it.

564
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,731
I'm gonna kill him.

565
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,365
Is there anything I can do?

566
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,930
I want to be left alone.

567
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,485
Are you okay?

568
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,001
Are you?

569
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,441
No.

570
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,608
You know what you have to do, right?

571
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,444
You have to kill
this son of a bitch.

572
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,850
I know.

573
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,450
I don't know how.

574
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,046
Because of his magic.

575
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,926
His... It's too strong.

576
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,045
I've seen it before,

577
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,920
back on Lian Yu, and it is not just magic.

578
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,681
It's darkness.

579
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,524
And whenever I have come up against it,
I have gone nowhere.

580
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,724
He feels unstoppable.

581
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,610
I refuse to believe that.

582
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,531
And I refuse to let you believe that.

583
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,927
If Darhk wins, Laurel died for nothing.

584
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,051
I fell in love with you for many reasons
and one of those reasons is,

585
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,241
is that you always find a way,
and you have to find a way now.

586
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,364
<i>For Laurel. For the city.</i>

587
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,801
For all of us.

588
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,561
