1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,637
PROFESSOR STEIN:
<i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,093
<i>and all of history
is vulnerable to attack,</i>

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,055
<i>which is why we must travel
through time to stop the spread of</i>

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,560
<i>these so-called time Aberrations
and to erase their damage to history.</i>

5
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,358
<i>We are a team of outcasts and misfits,</i>

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,110
<i>so please don't call us heroes.</i>

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,986
<i>We're legends.</i>

8
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,944
AMAYA: <i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

9
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,107
I think I can save him.

10
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,696
RAY: <i>It's a bio-molecular enhancer.</i>

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,951
JAX: <i>You've got superpowers now, dude.</i>

12
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,120
Name's Steel.

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,123
I'm not going back
until Rex's killer is brought to justice.

14
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,831
You let the Shogun steal
a 21 st century super-suit?

15
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,463
I have to teach you to destroy
the only thing that makes me a hero.

16
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:39,665
Do it!

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,631
I am so sorry.

18
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,132
It's okay.

19
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,321
MAN: Dontaar.

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,152
Dontaar, are you reading this?

21
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,326
They're dead. They're all dead.

22
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,200
The heist went off easy.

23
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:18,166
We got the TX-90
out of 2235 as contracted, but...

24
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,414
But Alec got infected.

25
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,878
And then he...

26
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,590
God, you wouldn't imagine
what he did to everyone...

27
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:43,191
<i>I don't know when I am...
I'm activating the temporal beacon.</i>

28
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:47,779
You get in the <i>Dauntless</i>
and you get out here and rescue my ass.

29
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,292
MAN 1: <i>Don't move.</i>

30
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,295
MAN 2: <i>What the hell is this thing?</i>

31
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,559
FUTURE BARRY: <i>I can't risk
putting any more lives in danger.</i>

32
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,474
<i>And neither can you.</i>

33
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,103
<i>Which is why you'll keep
what I'm about to tell you a secret.</i>

34
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,238
<i>Even from the rest of your team.</i>

35
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,778
<i>A war is coming, Captain Hunter.</i>

36
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,827
How many times are we gonna listen
to this message from future Barry?

37
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,112
Until it makes sense.

38
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,074
So, "Forever" is
basically what you're saying.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,242
You haven't spoken
to anyone else about this?

40
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,628
No. We agreed that we wouldn't.

41
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,255
And yet I find myself asking.

42
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,748
SARA: <i>Martin?</i>

43
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,465
Um, Sara! What can I do for you?

44
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,927
<i>You never call me "Sara."
Everything with you is "Ms. Lance".</i>

45
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,763
I'm turning over a new leaf.

46
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,269
<i>Well, turn it over in the library.
We've got something.</i>

47
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,855
<i>I don't know when I am...</i>

48
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,149
<i>I'm activating the temporal beacon.</i>

49
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,939
<i>You get in the</i> Dauntless

50
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,446
<i>and you get out here and rescue my ass.</i>

51
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,107
A bit vulgar for a Time Master...

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,448
Time pirate, we're thinking.

53
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,905
He activated a beacon.
We have to go after him.

54
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,911
He's a time pirate.
Why would we rescue him?

55
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,746
Because if he ends up
somewhere he shouldn't...

56
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,160
And does something he shouldn't...

57
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,795
It's Aberration-palooza.

58
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,128
So where do we think he's going to end up?

59
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,472
Looks like Mississippi, 1863.

60
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,765
Height of the American Civil War.

61
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,801
RAY: <i>It's also the bloodiest year
in American history.</i>

62
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,845
We got to watch each other's backs
out there.

63
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,141
Yes, which is why you'll be watching ours
from right here.

64
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,809
Huh?

65
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,526
If you don't mind.

66
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,859
Someone has to stay behind as backup.

67
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,865
JAX: <i>Can't believe Ray got pined.</i>

68
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,322
No suit, no powers, no tech.

69
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,113
I mean, I guess Sara had no choice
but to bench him.

70
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,954
Well, I'm sure
she was just trying to keep him safe.

71
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,792
This time period
is replete with various perils.

72
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,540
Perhaps, it might be easier

73
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:13,338
if you were to remain behind
and keep Dr. Palmer company.

74
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,385
Perhaps you should remain behind.

75
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,722
No? Because you're not black?

76
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,721
Because you think that
me going back to 1863,

77
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,889
I can't handle it?

78
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,813
That doesn't mean there's a need for you
to subject yourself

79
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,819
to the horrors that await you in that era.

80
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,897
Okay.

81
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,193
Now I get, it might be
difficult for you to understand this.

82
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,571
But I've been black my entire life, Grey.

83
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,408
And honestly, I can't think of a
time period we could go to

84
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,372
where I wouldn't face some sort of racism.

85
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,500
So don't worry, okay?

86
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,221
Along with comms devices,
I've also packed sack lunches.

87
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,057
I figure the food in 1863 is pretty lousy.

88
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,180
All right. The operation is simple.

89
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,896
We isolate the target,
we eliminate the time ship

90
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,105
and we get out of there.

91
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,065
And all while wearing this dress...

92
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,854
RAY: <i>Come back safe.</i>

93
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,788
RAY:
<i>It's Mississippi, 1863.</i>

94
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,325
The weather is a temperate 58 degrees.

95
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,244
Ooh! A little trivia.
You guys are in Hinds County,

96
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,412
<i>- which was named after General Thomas...</i>
{TURNS COMMS OFF)

97
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,705
Did you just...

98
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,167
Shut off his comms? Yup.

99
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,586
Guys. Guys.

100
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,508
I can't believe it.

101
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,011
It looks to be some kind of escape pod.

102
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,804
No doubt,
it fell out of the temporal zone.

103
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,768
No sign of anyone.

104
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,933
Power core looks exposed.

105
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,101
AMAYA: Does that mean
what I think it means?

106
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,103
Only one way to find out.

107
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,947
- Ah. Thought you'd never ask.
- Back up, everyone.

108
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,364
What's next?

109
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,246
Don't you think that's enough
incineration for one day, Mr. Rory?

110
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,751
No, I do not, Professor.

111
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,288
This has turned out to be
one of our easiest missions yet.

112
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,047
HENRY SCOTT: <i>Help me! Somebody, please!</i>

113
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,207
You had to say that, didn't you?

114
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,375
It's over there.

115
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,759
Help me! Help!

116
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,131
Whoa, wait. We're not supposed
to interfere with historical events.

117
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,641
Try and stop me.

118
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,510
Women.

119
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,475
She certainly has a fiery spirit.

120
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,607
Which is either gonna get her killed
or completely screw up history.

121
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,766
Just end it fast.

122
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,907
Help! Help!

123
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,831
Let's get those Confederates off his back.

124
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,208
Whoa, whoa. Relax.
All right, you're safe now.

125
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,718
What in tarnation was that?
What did I just see?

126
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,006
What was what? I, uh...
I didn't see anything.

127
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,431
Who are you guys?

128
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,716
What's goin' on here?

129
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,351
Look, we're just passing through.

130
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,178
Okay, guys, let's get the hell outta here.

131
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,688
We can't just leave him here.

132
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,938
Unfortunately, we have to.

133
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,725
If we rescue one man,
we could alter history in the wrong way.

134
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:14,984
You're a dispatch, aren't you?

135
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,895
AMAYA: <i>Wait. What's a dispatch?</i>

136
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,482
A former slave providing
information to the Union Army.

137
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,359
My name is Henry Scott.

138
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,653
I'm a free man from Trenton, New Jersey.

139
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,405
Well, you're a long way from home.

140
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,536
And we need to be getting out of here.

141
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,417
Uh, guys.

142
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,749
Oh, my God.

143
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,135
Those Confederates look a lot like...

144
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,636
Don't say it!

145
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,474
<i>Just merge!</i>

146
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,927
Is everybody okay?

147
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,763
What the hell was that?

148
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,067
- You ask me, they looked like...
- Don't... Don't say it.

149
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,604
I know they're essentially a myth,
but I have this irrational fear of...

150
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,443
Zombies?
- Please don't say it.

151
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,940
Oh, god.

152
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,117
Hey, hey, hey.

153
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,954
- Hang on.
- Satch...

154
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,160
What?

155
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,494
My satchel.

156
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,913
Are you... Union?

157
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,880
Kind of.

158
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,464
My orders. Collins Plantation.

159
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,297
Confederate troop movements.

160
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,674
Without them...

161
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,808
Hey. Hey.

162
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,241
RAY: <i>Nice job blowing up
the time pirates' escape pod!</i>

163
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,030
Put in another win
in the "mission" column!

164
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,949
Did you not see what happened next?

165
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,875
No, I took a break,
had to go to the bathroom.

166
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,203
You okay?

167
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,042
We were attacked by zombies.

168
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,049
And somebody put sprouts on my sandwich.

169
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,133
The Time Pirate's distress call referenced
something called a "TX-90."

170
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,592
It's a futuristic bioweapon.

171
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,135
The infected's condition
represents strongly those things...

172
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,095
The... I can't say...

173
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,644
And if that infected time pirate
is out there spreading this virus,

174
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,605
then our work is not done here.

175
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,437
No kidding. Having
zombies or whatever they are

176
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,697
running around the Civil War
is not a good thing.

177
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,904
Speaking of not good...

178
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,110
Get him to the MedBay.

179
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,490
What's goin' on?

180
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,253
Apparently, you were wounded during
our encounter with the infected.

181
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,412
Impossible.

182
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,209
Those creepy bastards
didn't lay a finger on me.

183
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,799
But they might've gotten in a tooth.
Or 30.

184
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,261
Oh, my God, he's already starting to turn.

185
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,269
Ray, you gotta fix me.
I don't want to be turned into a...

186
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,263
Fricking zombie.

187
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,851
SARA: <i>Oh, my God.<i>
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Yeah.<i>

188
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,485
<i>It's pretty disastrous.</i>

189
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,479
I'm guessing thanks to the zombies,

190
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,990
the Confederacy won its
independence from the Union.

191
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,191
It wasn't just them.

192
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,619
That guy. The dispatch?

193
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,241
These are his mission orders.

194
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,832
From General Ulysses S. Grant.

195
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,285
My God.

196
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,545
He was supposed to
infiltrate the Collins Plantation

197
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,422
and steal
Confederate troop movement orders.

198
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,457
SARA: <i>They named a high school after him?</i>

199
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,173
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>That's because,
in the original version of history,</i>

200
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,511
the plans Scott stole helped Grant win
the Battle of Champion Hill.

201
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,591
And I'm guessing none of that happened

202
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,850
because Scott was bayonetted

203
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,184
by a Confederate turned into
a zombie by a future virus.

204
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,856
Okay, so...

205
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:23,975
How do we fix it?

206
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,611
We don't. I do.

207
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,770
Jax.

208
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,486
There's a reason
black people were used as spies.

209
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,609
Because we were invisible.

210
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,489
That's why I'm going in there.

211
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,323
Don't worry. If anything happens,
it's on me.

212
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,240
No, Jax, it's on me.

213
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,118
Look, Mick's already hurt.

214
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,412
And I don't like the idea
of putting anyone else in harm's way.

215
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,798
And I don't like the idea of
having a flag that has 20 stars on it.

216
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,428
I'm definitely not letting you
go in there alone.

217
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,305
Fine. I'll take Amaya.

218
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,014
All right.

219
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,178
Nate and I will go warn the Union Army
about the infected soldiers.

220
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,595
Okay.

221
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,064
When we get to wherever we're going,

222
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,853
maybe I should be the one that
breaks the zombie news to General Grant.

223
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,979
I'm someone he'll listen to.

224
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,109
Because you're a man.

225
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,617
We're a couple hundred years
away from gender equality.

226
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,993
Only a couple hundred?

227
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,745
Look, all I'm saying is, maybe,
just maybe,

228
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,498
when we get to the Union Army,
you let me do the talking.

229
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,783
Stay where you are!

230
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,951
Right there.

231
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,791
Okay, you do the talking.

232
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,000
So what's our plan?

233
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,801
Well, if things go easy,

234
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,179
we sneak in while everybody's asleep,

235
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,840
find the Confederate plans and grab 'em.

236
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,434
Are things ever easy
with your group?

237
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,593
Good point.

238
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,761
WOMAN: <i>Please don't!</i>

239
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,930
<i>I'm sorry! I didn't mean
to burn the table cloth.</i>

240
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,981
<i>It was an accident, I swear.</i>

241
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,271
An accident?

242
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,435
You just let yourself get distracted,
that's all.

243
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,855
While you should've been
thinking about the ironing,

244
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,022
you were probably daydreaming

245
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,942
about Ulysses S. Grant marching
down here to free all the slaves.

246
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,365
No, sir. I wasn't...

247
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,077
Which is why I need
to focus your attention.

248
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,416
- No, no, wait.
- He's going to hurt her.

249
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,502
I know. And it's awful.

250
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,835
But if we blow our cover now,
we won't be able to fix the Aberration,

251
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,420
and we might lose the Civil War.

252
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,546
No matter how much you cry,

253
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,680
I'm still gonna hurt you.

254
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,735
Raymond, please hurry.
I don't like the way this is going.

255
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,691
You don't like the way this is going?

256
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,073
How close are you to
formulating a workable vaccine?

257
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,030
Very. I think.

258
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,364
Raymond.

259
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,288
I'm counting on you.

260
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,254
Don't worry, Mick. I got you.

261
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,333
Here we go.

262
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,047
What's happening?

263
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,847
His heart rate's spiking!

264
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,719
<i>Gideon, administer a sedative now!</i>

265
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,233
Zombie! Zombie!

266
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,768
- Zombie!
- The screaming isn't helping!

267
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,276
Gideon, put the ship on lockdown!

268
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,148
GIDEON: <i>Lockdown mode activated.</i>

269
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,408
This is incredible.

270
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,830
I did my sophomore thesis
on the Civil War.

271
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,665
I smell a history lesson coming.

272
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Fun fact.</i>

273
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,715
Did you know that out of the three million
people who fought on both sides,

274
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,922
300 were women in drag?

275
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,634
How is that not a fun fact for you?

276
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,383
General.

277
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,551
We caught these two
outside the northeast perimeter.

278
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,103
This here's a war zone.

279
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,310
So either you two are Confederate spies
or you...

280
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,143
Are very lost.

281
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,820
Actually, we're neither, General Grant.

282
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,401
How do you know my name?

283
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,778
I'm a fan. Actually,
I'm, like, a really big fan.

284
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,986
And you are surprisingly taller
than I thought in real life.

285
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,571
<i>Ahem. Um...</i>

286
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,498
I'm a colonel in the Union Army.

287
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,913
Colonel Sanders. I'm Colonel Sanders
with the 31st Pennsylvania Infantry.

288
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,419
Then why are you
not in proper uniform, son?

289
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,425
My uniform is in the wash, sir.

290
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,300
Or you're a Confederate spy.

291
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,090
- Okay.
- Look, we're not Confederates.

292
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,143
And truth be told, we're not
a part of the Union either.

293
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,226
But we are here to tell you
that your company is in danger.

294
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,018
In danger?

295
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,521
Of what?

296
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,484
Well, believe it or not,
a horde of zombies is headed your way.

297
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,781
What is a zombie?

298
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,659
They're not familiar with that word
for another 70 years.

299
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,819
I've had enough nonsense.

300
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,112
SARA: <i>Look, it's not nonsense.</i>

301
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,243
It's just really hard to explain.

302
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,460
And it'd be a lot easier
if I just showed you.

303
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,207
And if I'm not back for any reason,
feel free to shoot him.

304
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,128
Just don't listen to her.

305
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,016
They're having some kind of party.

306
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,310
"Cotillion," actually.

307
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,520
According to Scott's mission papers.

308
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,483
He was going to get in disguised
as the help.

309
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,281
You mean, "Slave."

310
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,574
We could've helped her.

311
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,738
We should have.

312
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,205
Look, I've been doing this time travel
thing for a little while now.

313
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,039
And if I've learned one thing,

314
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,999
it's you never know what's gonna change
history and have massive consequences.

315
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,172
Do you think
this doesn't make me angry as well?

316
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,297
But we have a job to do.

317
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,215
And if we don't do it,

318
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,475
we can make things a lot worse.

319
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,060
Just stay on comms, okay?

320
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,030
- He was... He was...
- Calm down. Calm down.

321
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,982
We're going to die.

322
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,150
You just need to calm down.

323
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,944
I will not "calm down."

324
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,909
He was threatening enough before
he was one of the walking dead!

325
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,616
Why didn't your vaccine work?

326
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:13,950
I... I don't know.

327
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,289
It could be that subcutaneous delivery
needs more than one dose.

328
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,462
Oh, and that didn't occur to you
while formulating your serum?

329
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,840
At least I'm not the one with
an irrational fear of zombies.

330
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,966
There's nothing irrational about
my fear of zombies.

331
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,126
He's a zombie!

332
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,466
- Look. I'm pretty sure that I stunned him.
- Oh, you're pretty sure?

333
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,093
And if he's knocked out cold
in the MedBay,

334
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,470
all we have to do is
go back in there and inject him again.

335
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,727
And if he's not,
I'm "pretty sure" he'll kill us.

336
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,477
So me and my "irrational fear"
are staying right here.

337
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,016
Listen to me, Marty.

338
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,479
- Can I call you "Marty"?
- No.

339
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:40,977
You have to help me.

340
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,148
If you don't and I get bitten, then
you will have two zombies to deal with.

341
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,318
My God.

342
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,022
Amaya, it's Jax.

343
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,029
<i>Study is a bust. I'm gonna check out
the rest of the plantation house.</i>

344
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:31,736
Oh!

345
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,618
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

346
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,872
Boy.

347
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,701
<i>What did you just do?</i>

348
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,702
I, uh... I'm sorry.

349
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,372
You took that woman's hand
and addressed her directly.

350
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,958
No, sir, I did not.

351
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,884
Are you calling me a liar, boy?

352
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,381
I'm not calling you anything, sir.

353
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,558
Who the hell are you?

354
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,261
I'm with the additional staff.

355
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,563
- For tonight's festivities.
- Oh.

356
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,479
So you're ignorant about the house rules.

357
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,895
You see, my staff know better
than to talk back to me.

358
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,611
I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again, sir.

359
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,400
Hey!

360
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,571
Don't you turn your back on me, boy.

361
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,955
There a problem, Mr. Collins?

362
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,622
Just a house boy
who don't know his place.

363
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,962
And needs to be taught some manners.

364
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,129
These zombies.
They're going to kill all of you.

365
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,421
And I keep asking.

366
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,475
What in perdition's flames is a "zombie"?

367
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,726
This.

368
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,432
I found him and 50 others just like him

369
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,271
<i>less than a mile outside your camp.</i>

370
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,273
And, yeah, I said less than a mile.

371
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,735
Which means we don't have a lot of time.

372
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,573
Okay. You ready?

373
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,612
Mmm-mmm.

374
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,748
Just relax. He's unconscious, remember?

375
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,006
- Raymond...
- Yeah?

376
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,878
If he's unconscious,

377
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,181
wouldn't he be here?

378
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,143
This isn't working.
We need more sharpshooters.

379
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,356
Can't spare the men.

380
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,567
Did you see what's out there?

381
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,108
We have to think
about the battle that lies ahead.

382
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,027
If we don't take Vicksburg,
we won't control the Mississippi.

383
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,992
And we need command of the river
to win the war.

384
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,876
At this rate, I'm afraid we will be
out of ammunition before dawn.

385
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,412
We need some backup.

386
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,588
Damn, it's dark.

387
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,388
Even if Mr. Rory
wasn't in a zombified state,

388
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,301
I doubt he possesses the intelligence
to operate a light switch.

389
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,890
He probably destroyed a conduit
or something.

390
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,349
That's hardly comforting, Raymond.

391
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,445
Martin, come on.

392
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,482
He's got me! He's got my foot. Oh, my God.

393
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,400
- Run, run!
- Come on.

394
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,617
PROFESSOR STEIN: This is a nightmare.

395
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,869
If Mr. Rory's intention
is to eat our brains,

396
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,707
can you imagine the feast we'll provide
him given our combined intellect?

397
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,212
Wait, wait.

398
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,872
You get comfortable now.

399
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,722
You got a long night ahead of you.

400
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,304
Wait.

401
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,902
Hey.

402
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,315
Damn it.

403
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,421
- What is it?
- It's...

404
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,341
It's Jefferson.

405
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,961
- What's happening to him?
- I'm not sure.

406
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:21,678
I've never felt him
so frightened or angry before.

407
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,769
I know I should've gone with him.

408
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,231
Sara and Nate are still out there.
Maybe they can get to him.

409
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,142
Ray? Martin?

410
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,151
I've lost contact with Jax and Amaya.

411
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,653
I really could use some help out here.

412
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,522
I suppose there's your answer.

413
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,275
Here's the thing, Sara.

414
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,442
We'd love to come help,

415
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,455
<i>but my vaccine didn't work and
Mick got turned into one of those things.</i>

416
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,832
And he's confined us to the galley.

417
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,915
Until we can cure him,

418
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,838
<i>you guys are on your own.</i>

419
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,920
Yeah. Looks like we all are.

420
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,463
Yeah.

421
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,923
Who are you?

422
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,348
My name is Jackson.

423
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,768
Jefferson Jackson.

424
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,686
Those're some pretty famous slave
owners you're named for, Jefferson.

425
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,438
Look at his hands.

426
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,649
Have you ever worked a day in your life?

427
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,865
It's a long story.

428
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,322
What are you doing here?

429
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,329
Also a long story.

430
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,744
Actually...

431
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,504
Maybe... Maybe you could help me.

432
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,887
I'm here for General Grant.

433
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,631
The Union general?

434
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,389
He sent me here to steal details
of Confederate troop movements.

435
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,516
MAN: <i>Even if you got your hands on 'em,</i>

436
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,731
there ain't no way off this plantation,
Mr. Jackson.

437
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,896
There's always a way.

438
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,356
WOMAN: <i>No.</i>

439
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,486
Master Collins got guard dogs.

440
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,030
Cuban bloodhounds.

441
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,528
MAN: <i>Yeah, we had some friends,</i>

442
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,488
they got caught less than a mile out.

443
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,194
But they didn't kill 'em.

444
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,534
No, they didn't want to lose the labor.

445
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,999
So they cut off their manhood
and then they hobbled them

446
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,035
so they could never think
of trying to run again.

447
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,253
How do you endure this?

448
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,217
- How does it not...
- Drive us all mad?

449
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,387
<i>Because that's what they want it to do.</i>

450
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,555
They think they can break us.

451
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,894

Jax, are you there?

458
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,540
Damn.

459
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,071
Well, well, well.

460
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,326
Who invited you to the party?

461
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,955
Actually, my invitation
must have gotten lost in the mail.

462
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,250
You sure have a smart mouth on you.

463
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,536
Hmm.

464
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,626
A pretty one, though.

465
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,635
We'll have to teach you a lesson
on how to talk to your betters.

466
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,091
We told Mick that we would save him.

467
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,268
Plus, I still have the vaccine.

468
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,933
We just have to figure out a way
to get it to work.

469
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,814
Vaccine wasn't effective
when we injected Mick.

470
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,487
But if we can aerosolize the serum,

471
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,994
and deploy it using something
like a fire extinguisher

472
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,655
we can deliver the cure as a spray.

473
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,491
"We" are not doing anything.

474
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,000
But you, on the other hand...

475
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,332
Look, Martin, I know that you're scared.

476
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,505
I've been nothing but scared
since my suit was destroyed.

477
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,668
I've been terrified that
I have nothing to offer the team.

478
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,180
But you have to get over your fears
if we're gonna survive this.

479
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,685
We've only seen these things
downwind from here.

480
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,355
We can pick them off in this valley
until they're all gone.

481
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,271
I got my best men
on the ridge to the west

482
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,606
but reports are
they are running out of ammunition.

483
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,446
What? Helps me think.

484
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,529
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Well,</i>

485
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,575
<i>without ammo, we can't take all these
zombies out even with perfect shots.</i>

486
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,714
Can I talk to you for a minute?

487
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,541
Yeah.

488
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,557
Mr. Collins is going to love spending
the midnight hour with you, girlie.

489
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,058
I'm looking forward to it.

490
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,765
I hope he enjoys
getting punched in the face.

491
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,111
And thank you ever so much
for showing me where to find my friend.

492
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,064
What the hell was that?

493
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,612
Don't you know a breakout
when you see one?

494
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,993
Okay.

495
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,906
Good. Now let's free them.

496
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,462
I thought you said if we didn't do our job
we could end up doing more harm than good.

497
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,791
Yeah, that's still a risk.

498
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,467
So what's changed?

499
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,969
The way these people are being treated,

500
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,298
that's the real Aberration.

501
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,758
I can see that now.

502
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,933
This is the history
that needs to be fixed.

503
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,816
Nah, nah. I'm obliged, ma'am. But I told
you what happens if they catch us...

504
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,821
Don't worry, we're gonna protect you.

505
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,033
<i>I know you're scared. I get it.</i>

506
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,615
Don't ask me how I know this, but...

507
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,780
It gets better.

508
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,117
Not perfect. Nowhere near close, but...

509
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,961
Better than this.

510
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,373
<i>But it starts right now</i>

511
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,799
with us not giving up.

512
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,506
Zambesi. Your amulet.

513
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,345
You are a warrior of the Zambesi.

514
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,679
You're familiar with it?

515
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,056
That's where my mother was born.

516
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,180
<i>We must follow her.</i>

517
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,020
I believe in her.

518
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,650
<i>I believe in them.</i>

519
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,312
Then I do, too.

520
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,825
What is it?

521
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,539
We've got company.

522
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,420
We've got to get out of here.

523
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,883
Not without the Confederate plans.

524
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,089
I think I know where they are.

525
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,054
Okay. You get everyone to safety.

526
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,347
- Come on.
- Wait, Jax.

527
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,891
Good luck.

528
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,938
You ready?

529
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:31,895
Come on.

530
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,566
This way.

531
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,423
Mr. Jackson.

532
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,543
What are you doing, man?

533
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,215
For when things to get better,
like you said.

534
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,726
Okay, come on.

535
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,482
What in Sam Hill are these things?

536
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,147
They're infected with something.

537
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,814
We've got to work together or
we'll never make it out of here alive.

538
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,072
What are you saying?

539
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,983
I'm saying, "Give us weapons."

540
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,572
Without us, you'll never
be able to fight them off.

541
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,071
You think I'm dumb enough
to arm my own slaves?

542
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,243
<i>- Help!</i>
- Come on.

543
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,627
Help!

544
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,835
For God sakes, help me!

545
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,090
Come on, move!

546
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,765
We're down to our last rounds with no hope
of stopping those abominations.

547
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,180
Whatever you have up your sleeve, I
suggest you play that card now, Ms. Lance.

548
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,599
We're working on it.

549
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,188
- Good?
- Am I good?

550
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,103
Well, considering my survival hinges

551
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,112
on me accessing the superpower
I'm not familiar with,

552
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,318
I'm a little, ugh...

553
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,943
Run fast. Run hard.

554
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,532
Don't die.

555
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,622
I can promise you two of those things.

556
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,541
- I'm in the MedBay.
- PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Be careful, Raymond.</i>

557
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,460
<i>It won't take long for Mr. Rory
to figure out where you are.</i>

558
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,800
Tell me something I don't know.

559
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,898
Party's over.

560
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,369
Those things are
right outside the perimeter.

561
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,201
Kill the lights and hold your fire!

562
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,261
Hey! Over here!

563
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,018
Come and get it, you ugly freaks!

564
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,517
<i>Follow me, you big dummies!</i>

565
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,391
Come on! Follow the light!

566
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:22,524
Raymond?

567
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,368
Raymond, where are you?

568
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,034
What happened?

569
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,882
Oh, no. Don't be dead, Raymond.

570
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,681
On the other hand,
if you are dead, please stay dead.

571
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,598
Oh.

572
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,517
Just unconscious. Well done.

573
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,059
Now.

574
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,526
Where is that fire extinguisher?

575
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,570
Okay, Martin.

576
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:13,542
Just do what they did
in those zombie movies.

577
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,795
That you never had the courage to watch.

578
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,798
Come on!

579
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,133
That gentleman is either

580
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,266
the bravest man I've ever had
in my ranks...

581
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,976
Or the dumbest.

582
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,345
If you... If you just cooperate,

583
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,594
things will go much easier for us.

584
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,104
You may be stronger

585
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,817
but I assure you
you will not eat me today!

586
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,035
Professor, what's going on?

587
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,615
Was I just trying to kiss you?

588
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,123
I can only hope, Mr. Rory.

589
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,539
I can only hope.

590
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,752
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

591
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,171
Jax, we got to go.

592
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,140
This fire is gonna attract
a lot of unwanted attention.

593
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,425
I know.

594
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,303
But I want to enjoy this for a moment.

595
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,069
Okay.

596
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,078
Do you see your man anywhere?

597
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,836
Wait, hold your fire!

598
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,265
Nate?

599
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,520
I'm covered in zombie guts!

600
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:48,981
But you're alive.

601
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,325
I think I'm gonna be sick.

602
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,080
This is a godsend.

603
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,872
We know how the rebels
are planning to take Champion Hill.

604
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,708
And when they do,
we'll be there to give 'em hell.

605
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,622
Set our cannon battery
up on the western ridge.

606
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,790
Yes, sir.

607
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,381
We'll light 'em up like the Fourth of July
when they roll over that hill.

608
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,425
- What's your name, son?
- Uh, it's...

609
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,424
Henry Scott.

610
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,227
Mr. Scott, thank you
for your incredible bravery

611
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,263
and your service to the United States.

612
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,766
You may have just won this war for us.

613
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,111
And are these men and women
from the Collins Plantation?

614
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,396
Yes, they are, sir.

615
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,284
We will care for anyone seeking refuge
in our camp from the Confederate states.

616
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,912
We have plenty of food and water
for everyone.

617
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,614
Thank you.

618
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,163
We've spread the vaccine
our friends worked up.

619
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,499
The only Confederates
you'll have to worry about now

620
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,634
are the living ones.

621
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:52,965
I'm obliged.

622
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,808
Your man, Colonel Sanders,
he, uh, tells me you're his captain?

623
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,809
In any case, he mentioned
something about you having regrets

624
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,517
about putting men in harm's way.

625
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,312
I don't think that's something
I can ever get used to.

626
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,030
You know,

627
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,446
by the time
I had taken over this division,

628
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,329
there had already been
three other generals in place before me.

629
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,491
They'd all stepped down and given up.

630
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,206
But I believe in my men.

631
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,506
And I believe
in the good that we're doing.

632
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,665
Do you?

633
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,632
Do you believe in your mission,
Captain Lance?

634
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,509
I do.

635
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,142
Then don't regret
making those tough decisions.

636
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:43,553
Ma'am.

637
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,362
- Hey.
- Hey.

638
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,160
Just checking up on you.

639
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,831
I don't feel like eating anyone's brains,
so...

640
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,703
Thank you.

641
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,414
Well, maybe you feel like eating a burger.

642
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:13,750
No sprouts.

643
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,721
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

644
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,765
Well, there's a little something.

645
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,056
- I had to ask, didn't I?
<i>- It's just...</i>

646
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,725
I don't think it's any secret
that without my suit,

647
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,768
I've been wondering
what my place on the team is.

648
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,813
If I even have a place, you know?

649
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,074
Being an outsider is a good thing.
It's a great thing.

650
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,281
I've been an outsider my whole life.

651
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,998
You get to tell people to go shove it.

652
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,259
What are you doing?

653
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,303
Something I hope I don't regret.

654
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,935
This belonged to the greatest outsider
I ever knew.

655
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,695
I'm looking for a partner.

656
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,283
Cool.

657
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,337
What on earth are you doing?

658
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,422
Oh, uh...

659
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,055
Scrimshaw. It was my mom's thing.

660
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,639
She taught me a little.

661
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,263
Makes me think of her.

662
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:50,847
Oh.

663
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,974
I had no idea.

664
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,561
Are you homesick?

665
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,445
You checking up on me, Grey?

666
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,200
Given what you've witnessed,
what you've endured...

667
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,160
Would that really be so bad?

668
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:10,992
No.

669
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:16,632
You've just witnessed
the very worst of humanity.

670
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,046
<i>We share a psychic connection</i>

671
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,303
but I still can't even begin to fathom
what you must be feeling.

672
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:28,969
It must be like your heart is broken.

673
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,095
Yeah.

674
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,397
It is.

675
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,186
But I saw something
in those people's eyes...

676
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,526
I didn't expect to see.

677
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,574
I saw hope.

678
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,864
I saw dignity.

679
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,866
These men and women...

680
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,707
<i>They were treated worse than animals.</i>

681
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,954
But they never let anybody
stop them from being people.

682
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,371
You know?

683
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:03,095
I suppose there will always be
those who seek to dehumanize us,

684
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,139
but I believe there are more

685
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:11,394
that cling to hope despite the darkness.

686
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,938
Yeah, that's exactly how they were.

687
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,193
I was actually thinking of you, Jefferson.
