1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,720
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,120
Shall we begin?

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,040
I'm not Bruce

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,480
- and I won't let you tell Alfred.
- How you gonna stop me?

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,280
I'd like to introduce
our newest member

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,400
James Gordon.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,760
Welcome to The Court of Owls.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,320
- Are you okay?
- I just remembered.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,760
There's someone I need to kill.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,440
This virus isn't a disease

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,040
it's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,320
I don't need a cure.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,840
I will purge Gotham
and the innocents will thank me!

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,560
Their savior, their executioner!

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,920
Guilty. Guilty.

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,920
What's this I see?

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,760
Captain Barnes being escorted
away by the orderlies.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,240
Who is this new player
that enters the fray?

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,680
And with that, it was over.

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,720
Leaving me to wonder what
mysterious forces are

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
at play in the middle
of the night.

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,360
Captain Barnes, at last we meet.

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,200
- Who are you?
- Let's just say I'm a fan.

24
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,680
- What do you want?
- The same thing you do.

25
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,760
For Gotham to be judged
and the guilty punished.

26
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,080
Well, then release me,
and I'll do just that.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,720
Unfortunately...

28
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,360
we're looking to pass sentence
on a much larger scale.

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,520
And to do that,
we need what's inside of you.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
- The virus.
- Precisely.

31
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,720
But don't worry, I'll make sure
he doesn't drain you completely.

32
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,800
Hello, Captain.

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,520
- Strange.
- I'm sorry, Captain.

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,440
This might sting.

35
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Hey, Lee?

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,640
{\an5}- What's this?
- My final report on Frank Gordon.

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,840
{\an5}Cause of death...

38
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,680
Homicide.

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,280
{\an5}I thought Jim's uncle killed
himself.

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
{\an5}Did you?

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,840
{\an5}Look, I know you're upset.

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
{\an5}After everything
you've been through...

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,240
{\an5}Don't. Don't you do dare do that.

44
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,400
{\an5}- This is not about Mario.
- Then what's it about?

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,600
{\an5}Why are you... why are you here?

46
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,240
{\an5}- What do you want me to do?
- Harvey, you are acting captain.

47
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,040
{\an5}I want you to open
an investigation

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,680
{\an5}into the murder of Frank Gordon.

49
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,320
{\an5}And I think
Jim should be questioned.

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,320
{\an5}You're accusing Jim
of killing his own uncle?

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,520
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,880
{\an5}But I know that he is involved
somehow.

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,720
{\an5}Maybe not in his death
but maybe in covering it up

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,360
{\an5}making it look like a suicide.

55
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,480
{\an5}And I wanna know who else
is involved?

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,720
{\an5}Are you implying
I'm involved as well?

57
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,000
{\an5}Tell me I'm wrong, Harvey.

58
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,160
{\an5}Tell me there's nothing else
going on.

59
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,320
{\an5}Look me in the eyes,
and tell me I'm crazy.

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,560
{\an5}You're not crazy, Lee.

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
{\an5}You're hurt.

62
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,680
{\an5}And there's nothing going on.

63
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,920
{\an5}We used to be friends, Harvey.

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,760
{\an5}I know you're covering for him.

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,880
{\an5}I don't know what he's involved in
but I'm gonna find out.

66
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,120
The ruling council has decided
to suspend all Court activity

67
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,640
in order to focus our attention
on the preparations at hand.

68
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,080
Gotham's judgment is imminent.

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,600
To that end, any members
who have not submitted their list

70
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,440
for review and approval
should do so today.

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
We are adjourned.

72
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Excuse me?

73
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Yeah?

74
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

75
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Knock yourself out.

76
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,920
Her name's Selina. Selina Kyle.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
She knew Barbara Kean?

78
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,040
She used to hang out here, I think.

79
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,880
You think?
You don't sound real close.

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
Oh, no, we were.

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,640
Kind of, but she was always
really bossy, you know?

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,200
And then we got into this fight,
I was gone for a while...

83
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,520
Yeah, I don't care.

84
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,000
Try Gotham General.

85
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,520
Did something happen to her?

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,640
I heard she fell out a window
and is in pretty bad shape.

87
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,760
What are you doing in here?

88
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,880
I'm supposed to put down
my list of names

89
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,720
but nobody told me what for.

90
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,880
Loved ones are to be spared
from the coming judgment.

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,280
Thank you.

92
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,600
No.

93
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,240
It can't be.

94
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm sorry, this ward is restricted.

95
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
What happened to her?

96
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,720
No idea.

97
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,640
Police found her on the street.
Looks like she fell.

98
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,400
Fell? That's impossible.

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,640
Is she gonna be all right?

100
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
No.

101
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,840
What do you mean no?

102
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,360
Tell me she's gonna be all right.

103
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,760
- She's gonna be all right.
- No.

104
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,800
You're just saying that because I...

105
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,800
Just tell me the truth.

106
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,280
We've tried everything.

107
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,920
All we can do now
is make her comfortable.

108
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,440
Leave us, and don't come back.

109
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
Don't listen to them, Selina.

110
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,840
They don't know what I know.

111
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
They can't do what I can do.

112
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,800
I will heal you.

113
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,000
I promise.

114
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,640
Isn't it enough?
You holding me against my will?

115
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,120
Must you also hover while I work?

116
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,240
I'd think you would prefer this
to playing nurse maid

117
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,640
to Fish Mooney.

118
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,520
I was able to save Fish Mooney

119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,880
despite the fact that she had
one foot in the grave.

120
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,000
I took it
as a personal challenge.

121
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,560
Grandstanding doesn't suit you.

122
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,120
Were you able to accomplish
what we asked?

123
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,360
See for yourself.

124
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Hello?

125
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,360
What do you want from me?

126
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,120
Someone tell me what's going on.

127
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,040
Previously, the Alice Tetch Virus
could only be transmitted

128
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,880
through direct contact
with her blood.

129
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
What is that?

130
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,160
Someone, please, help!

131
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,840
You've done it.

132
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,160
You've weaponized the virus.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,280
Pick it up.

134
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
No.

135
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,880
You win, and you go free.

136
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,360
Pick up the stick
and defeat this man.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
You're lying.

138
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,280
This is just another way
of manipulating me.

139
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,040
Pick it up. Prove me wrong.

140
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,760
All that pain and anger.

141
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,400
You think it's strength.

142
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,000
It's not.

143
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,800
You think you can harness it.
You can't.

144
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,680
You think it's a part of you,
but it doesn't have to be.

145
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,240
Do you know why
you were so easily defeated?

146
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
No.

147
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,440
Your rage, Bruce. It blinds you.

148
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,040
You seek to control it, and yet,
it controls you

149
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,560
and has ever since that night.

150
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Rage and pain are two sides
of the same coin.

151
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,240
I can release you from the pain
of that night.

152
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,720
And when I do,
nothing will be able stop you.

153
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,000
Listen, Jim, we got a hit on the
prints you lifted off the mask.

154
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,360
Kathryn's last name is Monroe.

155
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,680
She's from one of Gotham's
oldest families.

156
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,000
Her address is 450 Clinton Ave.

157
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,560
Nice work, Harvey.

158
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,080
Kathryn seems to be the only one
who knows what the weapon is.

159
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,280
<i>So, what's the plan?</i>

160
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,760
Break-in, see what I can find out.

161
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,000
What do you think? She's keeping
it on her fireplace mantel?

162
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,480
<i>I've searched the court chambers.</i>

163
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,680
She isn't taking any chances
with the rank and file

164
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,320
knowing what the weapon is.

165
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,880
If there is something to find,
it'll be at her house.

166
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,040
<i>That's a big risk.</i>

167
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,280
You get caught, ballgame over.

168
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,640
<i>I don't have a choice.</i>

169
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,880
Listen, Jim, about your uncle.

170
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,600
Lee came into my office wanting to

171
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,600
<i>open an investigation
into his death.</i>

172
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,640
<i>She asked me point-blank
what you were doing.</i>

173
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
- What'd you say?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

174
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
I lied.

175
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,920
Jim, she seemed like
she was in a pretty dark place.

176
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Anything else?

177
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,440
Yeah, not to add on

178
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,240
but I got a call from a buddy
of mine at Arkham last night.

179
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,720
<i>Barnes was transferred.</i>

180
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,080
- Transferred? To where?
<i>- We don't know.</i>

181
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,240
I got Alvarez looking into it.

182
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,720
But don't worry,
we will find him.

183
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,760
- Thanks, Harvey.
<i>- Jim, be careful.</i>

184
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Oswald?

185
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,080
Hello, Jim.

186
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,800
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
you're still alive.

187
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,680
Yes, I am quite hard to kill.

188
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,840
I take it this isn't
a social call.

189
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,400
I'm looking for Ed.

190
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,720
We have some unfinished business.

191
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,800
And it turns out, you were
the last one who saw him.

192
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,880
Yeah, before he escaped police
custody.

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,960
Escaped from the great
Detective Gordon?

194
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,120
I think not.

195
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,320
Ed went on television

196
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,000
demanding information
about a group that runs Gotham.

197
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,320
A group called The Court.

198
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,040
And you called-in and said
you had that information.

199
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,680
- A ruse to get him to the G.C.P.D.
- Perhaps.

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,200
But then you arrest him
and voila, he disappears.

201
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,280
Sorry, escapes custody.

202
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,120
Can you see how I might think
you may have handed Ed off

203
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,240
to this all-powerful group
for some reason?

204
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,240
For your own sake, Oswald,
drop it.

205
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,240
I knew it.

206
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,600
You don't know anything.

207
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,120
Trust me. Let it go.

208
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,440
Sorry. No can do.

209
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,400
I assume the Court
doesn't like publicity

210
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,160
hence, Ed's sudden disappearance
after his television debut

211
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,520
but that is exactly
what they're going to get.

212
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,560
Unless they deal with me

213
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,400
in a civilized and professional
manner.

214
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
facilitating something

215
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
on my behalf?

216
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,280
My number is the only one
in here.

217
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,320
I'll expect a call
by the end of the day.

218
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,880
Why do I get the sense
I'm being threatened?

219
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,200
This is a favor, Jim.

220
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,080
After all, we're old friends.

221
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Right?

222
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Carlos?

223
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Yes, ma'am?

224
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Kathryn.

225
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
Detective Gordon?
What's the meaning of this?

226
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,680
Who let you in here?

227
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,280
Oswald Cobblepot is alive
and back in Gotham.

228
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,800
He paid me a visit this morning.

229
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,800
He knows Nygma's disappearance

230
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,680
has something to do
with The Court.

231
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Is that all?

232
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,800
I'm tired of being kept
in the dark.

233
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,520
I want a seat at the table.

234
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,120
How ambitious.

235
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,200
You asked me to be on the court.

236
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,440
Now, I have done everything
you've asked.

237
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,440
I think I've proved
my commitment.

238
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,800
I want to know what's going on.

239
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,640
I want to know
what the judgment entails.

240
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,760
And if you don't like
what you hear?

241
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Try me.

242
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,560
Gotham is sick.

243
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,080
Crime and violence is so common

244
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
the people have become numb
to it.

245
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,440
To heal the city, we have to
force them to take notice.

246
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,000
Force them how?

247
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,920
By showing the people of Gotham
their darkest selves.

248
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,720
I'll consider your request.

249
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,840
Now, leave my house at once.

250
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,480
<i>- It's Harvey. Leave a message.</i>
- Harvey,

251
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,720
I know what the weapon is.

252
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,960
I know how they're gonna pass
judgment on Gotham.

253
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,200
The weapon
is the Alice Tetch virus?

254
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,040
Kathryn said the weapon would
show Gotham its darkest self.

255
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,280
Alice Tetch was at Indian Hill
for years.

256
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,520
They would have known about her.

257
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,880
It's the virus. I'm sure of it.

258
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,240
Is that even possible?

259
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,960
Well, that's why you're here,
Lucius.

260
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,440
I'm sorry to throw you into the
deep end of the pool like this,

261
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,280
but I need to know
what we're up against.

262
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,800
You mean, beyond a secret society
that controls all of Gotham?

263
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,600
Well, if they could
isolate the virus,

264
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,840
they could transform it
into any number of compounds

265
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,600
that could be released
on a large scale into the city.

266
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,960
All they need is a sample
of her blood.

267
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,480
Well, they ain't getting it
from the source.

268
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,440
After Mario broke
into the hematology lab,

269
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,000
they destroyed the rest
of Alice's blood.

270
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,520
I mean, where do they get
a sample?

271
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,920
They don't need a sample
of Alice's blood,

272
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,160
just a sample of the virus.

273
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,320
The virus that she passed along
to the people she infected.

274
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,440
- Barnes.
- Exactly.

275
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,600
Barnes wasn't transferred
out of Arkham.

276
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480
Kathryn kidnapped him.

277
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,720
So if we can find out where he
was taken, we can stop this.

278
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,520
How do we go about doing that?

279
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,240
I found this in Kathryn's study.

280
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,360
- Any idea what lab it belongs to?
- No.

281
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,520
But when I was running the Wayne
Enterprises R and D division,

282
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,720
we only had a half dozen off-site
labs.

283
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,200
Barnes isn't exactly the kind of
guy who's gonna blend in.

284
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,920
It have to be somewhere isolated

285
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,640
and small enough
for them to control.

286
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,440
I think I know
where they took him.

287
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,920
Just put them down
wherever there's space,

288
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,240
and then go back
to where I found you.

289
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,480
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,400
Selina, I would like to introduce
you to

291
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,920
Nepeta Cataria,

292
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,960
or rather a very specialized
strain of a plant

293
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,080
that I've been cultivating.

294
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,200
This guy is a break in case
of emergence type of deal.

295
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,840
You've always been there for me.

296
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,240
Even when I screwed things up.

297
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,640
Which was most of the time.

298
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,720
Just breathe deep

299
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,200
and I'll be
here when you wake up.

300
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,040
Just wake up, okay?

301
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,560
Are we going back to the alley
where my parents were murdered?

302
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,640
No, there's another memory
I wanna start with.

303
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,000
The first time you felt the rage
after your parents' death.

304
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

305
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,800
The rage from that day continues
to burn inside of you,

306
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,160
feeding on your pain, blinding
you from everything else

307
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,440
and if left unchecked,
will one day consume you.

308
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,160
We need to remove it
before that happens.

309
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,440
You want me to give up my memory
of that day?

310
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
No.

311
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,080
The events themselves
will remain.

312
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,400
I'm only talking about releasing
you from the destructive emotions

313
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,680
connected with them.

314
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,000
And if I don't wanna be released?

315
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,920
You have chosen your prison,
Bruce.

316
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,280
- I'm offering you a way out.
- Why?

317
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,280
You said I was to become
the protector of Gotham.

318
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,560
- Why me?
- Because you need each other.

319
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,080
Gotham needs a protector
and you need a purpose.

320
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm only trying to show you
the way.

321
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,720
But it has to be...

322
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,240
Your choice.

323
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,880
You know, where you are?

324
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,560
- My parents' wake.
- Yes.

325
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,120
You were surrounded by friends
and family, and yet...

326
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,080
I felt alone.

327
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,280
This was the first time
I truly processed

328
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,800
that my parents were gone.

329
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,360
The first time I thought
of myself as an orphan.

330
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,520
Is that why you left?

331
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,880
- No.
- Then why did you?

332
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,840
I heard what they were saying.

333
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,080
He witnessed the whole thing.

334
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,880
He must have been terrified.

335
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,200
- Devastated.
- Traumatized.

336
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,080
My parents were dead but all anybody
was talking about was me.

337
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,080
How concerned they were about me.

338
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,520
My parents had been murdered.

339
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,360
Gunned down, left for dead,
nobody seemed...

340
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,760
Angry?

341
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,600
- Yes.
- And so you left.

342
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,840
I hid in my parents' room.

343
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,720
My father was supposed to be
buried in a pair of cufflinks

344
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,320
that I bought him for his
birthday the year before.

345
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,800
He always said
they were his favorite.

346
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,040
But when it came time
to give them up...

347
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,280
I couldn't let them go.

348
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,240
It's time to let them go.

349
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,600
Here, you can lock it away,

350
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,680
and once you do you'll be free
of the power it holds over you.

351
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,400
I've been waiting a long time
for this, Bruce.

352
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,320
Together we will make Gotham pay.

353
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,640
No guards.

354
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,160
No security.

355
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,480
I don't like it either.

356
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,280
I guess we know
where the guards went.

357
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Hello?

358
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,160
G.C.P.D. freeze.

359
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,480
The police. Thank god.

360
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,240
Keep your hands
where we can see them!

361
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,280
I didn't wanna kill these people.

362
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,960
I just lost control.

363
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,320
On the
ground, now. Now!

364
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,360
I'm the good guy here.

365
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,080
You're just like them.
You're out to get me.

366
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,960
What have you done
with the virus?

367
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,560
Who has it?

368
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
A woman named Kathryn.

369
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,400
Where is she?
Where she taking it?

370
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't know. As I told you, I
was brought here against my will.

371
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,480
I know nothing
of their other plans.

372
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,040
Hugo Strange, you're under arrest

373
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,440
for attempts to weaponize
a viral...

374
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,320
- Hell, you know why.
- Oh, you don't want to do that.

375
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,920
The delivery mechanism that they
plan to use to release the virus.

376
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,040
It just recently arrived.

377
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,200
The shipment that came
into dock 9C.

378
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,480
Yes, it still needs to be tested

379
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,440
which means you still have
enough time

380
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,520
to keep them from unleashing it
citywide.

381
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,320
But, of course, if they discover
that their lab

382
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,680
has been compromised...

383
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,360
He's right.
They might unleash it right away.

384
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,480
We can't take him in,

385
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,320
or The Court will know
we're onto them.

386
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,560
Are you crazy?
What if he's yanking our chain?

387
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,480
What stops him from picking up
the phone

388
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,040
and calling the owl brigade
the second we walk out the door?

389
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,280
My research...

390
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,080
And a vial of my virus compound,

391
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,480
which I secreted away
unbeknownst to my captors.

392
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,920
A token of good will
which I hope will be remembered

393
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,920
when the time comes.

394
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
Good will?

395
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
You're playing both sides.

396
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,480
You help us take down The Court
and, what, we cut you a deal?

397
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,040
But we fail and you appear to be
loyal to The Court, is that it?

398
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,840
You logical bastard.

399
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,680
Don't worry about the mess.

400
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,560
We have our poor test subject
to blame for that.

401
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,400
Good luck, detectives.

402
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,880
Give Lucius the virus compound
and the research.

403
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,800
See if he can find anyone we can
trust to start working on a cure.

404
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,640
Where are you going?

405
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,960
I gotta find out where Kathryn
is testing the bomb.

406
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,480
- Kathryn.
<i>- I've thought about what you said.</i>

407
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
<i>You have done what we've asked.</i>

408
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,920
Maybe it is time
to take the next step.

409
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,240
<i>Meet me at 331 Smith Place.</i>

410
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,720
You can't give me more than that?

411
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,600
<i>You said you didn't want
to be kept in the dark.</i>

412
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,360
Let's see if you're worthy
of the light.

413
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,920
Is that all you have?

414
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,720
I thought you wanted to leave
this place?

415
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,640
That's it. That's it.

416
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,920
Yes.

417
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,480
See what you can accomplish once
you remove destructive emotions?

418
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,360
Tell me, how did you feel
when you were fighting this time?

419
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
I felt...

420
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Nothing.

421
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,880
I beat him.
Does that mean I can leave?

422
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,520
Is that what you want?
The pain to go away.

423
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,800
I can take it away, Bruce.

424
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,600
I can take it away
and you can return to Gotham

425
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,480
with a power you never thought
possible.

426
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,400
It's your choice.

427
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,480
Get up.

428
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,160
We're not done.

429
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,400
James.

430
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,880
Glad you could make it.

431
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,160
I'm not sure I had a choice.

432
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you

433
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,440
for your gun
and your phone.

434
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,280
- Nice party.
- The daughters of Gotham.

435
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,320
Socialites who believe
they hold the power in this city.

436
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,880
When what they really are
is window dressing.

437
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,400
My family was one of the first
in Gotham.

438
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,840
We've been on The Court
since its founding,

439
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,400
making the difficult decisions
to ensure its long-term survival.

440
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,840
Which is why I've brought you
here.

441
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,480
Interesting centerpiece.

442
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,440
It's an aerosol dispersal bomb.

443
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,680
Dispersal bomb for what?

444
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,960
For the Alice Tetch Virus.

445
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,080
So that's what you meant by
showing Gotham its darkest self.

446
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,240
- Precisely.
- Infecting 200 people

447
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,120
- won't change anything.
- True,

448
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,080
but the virus compound
only lives in aerated form

449
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,280
for a matter of minutes, so,

450
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,400
in a closed space
like the room below,

451
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,200
it will be contained
to our guests.

452
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,560
But in an open space,

453
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,360
the radius
of infection is a half mile.

454
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
This is merely a test.

455
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,400
Place it
in the middle of the room.

456
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,800
Don't worry,
you'll be safe up here.

457
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,560
I need to trust that you're ready
to make the difficult decisions

458
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,200
when the time comes.

459
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,040
- That's why I'm here.
- Good.

460
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,560
Because if it's not,

461
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,240
if you try to stop the bomb

462
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,200
or interfere in any way,

463
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,720
Talon has instructions
to execute you on the spot.

464
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,280
Talon, right?

465
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,680
I'm assuming that's a nickname.

466
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,160
Right.

467
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,400
Wouldn't want to miss out
on the sounds of 200 people

468
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,680
tearing each other's throats out.

469
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,600
The device is in place.

470
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,800
Hello, Jim?

471
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,120
I was beginning to think
I wasn't going to hear from you.

472
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,960
<i>I met you the other night,
didn't I?</i>

473
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,480
<i>- When you took Nygma?</i>
- Jim?

474
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,800
I keep wondering, what it is
The Court is planning

475
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,160
- to do with him?
- Stop talking.

476
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,000
This used to be a bank, right?

477
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,640
<i>First Bank of Gotham.</i>

478
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,280
<i>I just hope it can withstand</i>

479
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,400
<i>whatever that bomb's
going to do to it.</i>

480
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,000
Sounds like we don't have
much time.

481
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,280
Shut up.

482
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Sure.

483
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,480
Where's Jim?

484
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,280
He's not responding to my calls.

485
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,880
I'm heading to the bullpen,
see if anyone's heard from him.

486
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,800
- What's going on?
- Hey, Lee.

487
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,400
Are you helping Jim?

488
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,240
Bullock, I get.

489
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,520
But has Jim also pulled you
into his madness?

490
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,560
- It's not madness, Lee.
- Then what is it?

491
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,840
How many people
does he have to kill

492
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,480
- before you all see what I see?
- You've got it wrong.

493
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,160
Jim's trying to make sure
that what happened to Mario

494
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,920
- never happens to anyone again.
- What are you talking about?

495
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,400
Lucius, please,
just tell me what's going on.

496
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,240
I can't.

497
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,240
I'm sorry, Lee.

498
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,320
You're just like everybody else
here.

499
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,120
Screw it.

500
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,600
Everyone out. Now!

501
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
Took you long enough.

502
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,560
I need to get these people
out of here.

503
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,560
And I need to talk to The Court.
Have them turn over Ed, remember?

504
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,160
There's a bomb down there

505
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,200
with a weaponized version
of the Alice Tetch Virus.

506
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,680
If you want to be here
when it goes off, be my guest.

507
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,920
What about our deal?

508
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,640
You just torched their assassin.
My guess is, they'll be in touch.

509
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,040
- Yes, sir?
- Hello, Kathryn.

510
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,840
My apologies for the time.

511
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,000
<i>Not at all.</i>

512
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
How are things progressing
with Bruce Wayne?

513
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,240
<i>Excellent.</i>

514
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,920
He believes in the destiny
I have promised.

515
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,720
In a life free from the pain
of his past.

516
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,280
The boy and I will be leaving
tonight.

517
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,480
<i>I trust everything will be
in place by the time we arrive?</i>

518
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,840
Of course.

519
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,680
Why haven't they made contact?

520
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,520
And where the hell is Ivy
and the human popsicle?

521
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,000
Hello? Are you listening to me?

522
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,160
You're awake. Selina?

523
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Are you okay?

524
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,480
Say something
so I know you're okay.

525
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,760
Why does my room smell
like a giant bag of potpourri?

526
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,600
You're back.

527
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,600
Oh, I can't believe it.

528
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,440
Oh, wait.

529
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,080
What are you doing?

530
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,200
You just got out of a coma.
You need to rest!

531
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,560
This can't wait.

532
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,080
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

533
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,840
To Wayne Manor.

534
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,720
To kill someone.

535
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
What are you doing?

536
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,680
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm leaving.

537
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,960
Well, actually, I'm resigning,
and then I'm leaving.

538
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,880
Don't. You belong here.

539
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,080
I thought I did.

540
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,680
But then you infected this place
and everyone around you.

541
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,600
I'm done.

542
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,440
I am done with you,
with the G.C.P.D...

543
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,040
With Gotham.

544
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,080
What are you talking about?

545
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,880
You've taken everything
away from me.

546
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,000
Everything. There's nothing left.

547
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,240
And for what?

548
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,000
I would ask you for the truth

549
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,120
but I honestly don't even think
you know what that is anymore.

550
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,920
You want the truth?

551
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Fine.

552
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,480
I killed Mario.

553
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,640
I'm done apologizing for it.

554
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
He was gonna kill you.

555
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,200
- No.
- I saw the knife.

556
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,320
I saw the knife and pulled the
trigger, and I would do it again.

557
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,840
- He was infected.
- Yes.

558
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,120
Because Jervis Tetch
wanted to punish you.

559
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
You, not Mario.

560
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,600
Mario didn't deserve what happened.

561
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,520
You wanna blame me
for Mario's death, fine.

562
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,480
You wanna walk out that door
and never come back,

563
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,680
I can't stop you.

564
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,680
But it will not help.

565
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,000
Believe me.

566
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,440
The other day, you asked me
at Mario's grave

567
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,800
how I could walk away...

568
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,320
Move on.

569
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,120
I guess you know how.

570
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,040
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.
You cannot do this to me.

571
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,840
I demand to speak to the person
in charge!

572
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,400
Oswald?

573
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,560
You're alive?

574
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,680
I want to apologize
for my curt behavior earlier.

575
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,480
We both want the same thing
for Gotham.

576
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,240
Judgment.

577
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,520
But I have just discovered
someone I thought was loyal

578
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,440
has been deceiving me
from the start.

579
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,360
Detective James Gordon
now threatens to undo

580
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,400
what we both seek.

581
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,840
I need you to kill him
before he can do that.

582
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,080
Jim Gordon is guilty.

583
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,840
And I will be his executioner.
