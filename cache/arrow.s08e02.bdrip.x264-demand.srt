1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,111
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,191
For 7 years, I have
fought with only one goal--

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,720
to save my city,

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,314
but now a new
threat has emerged,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,153
a danger so severe
it has forced me

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,033
to leave my family
in order to face it,

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,710
and it won't be enough for
me to just be the Green Arrow.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,393
To prevent the
crisis that's coming,

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,392
I'am going to have to
become someone else,

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,234
I'am going to have to
become...something else.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,709
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,632
We see the wall coming
down as an opportunity.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,154
For the criminals
of Star City to

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,231
-rob the Glades blind.
-To reunite the city.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,198
Ever since we brought
down the wall, your bro--

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,637
the Deathstroke gang--
has really upped their game.

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,195
They've amassed more territory
and power than ever before.

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,317
Your brother hates you. That
makes things unpredictable.

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,391
Vasquez is one of the
Glades' wealthiest citizens.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,797
Maybe the Deathstrokes
plan to extort him.

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,234
A crisis is coming, John.

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,919
- What are you doing here?
- Reminding you

23
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,991
what you are doing here,
which does not include

24
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,753
interfering in the
events of this Earth.

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,036
-The city's under attack.
-By who?

26
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,232
A crisis is imminent.

27
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,879
Someone is coming,

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,795
someone far, far more
powerful than myself.

29
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,389
We have to get
the hell out of here.

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,040
I missed you, buddy.

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,032
‘Cause we found
ourselves in each other.

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,110
You're never without me.

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,429
Beautiful boy.

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,910
What's happening?

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,070
Oliver!

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,830
Survive.

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,389
I warned you not to interfere.

38
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,234
You didn't bring us here?

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,552
No. I discovered what
had transpired on Earth-2,

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,712
that you intervened
to save Laurel Lance.

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,075
I redirected you.

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,676
What...the hell
happened back there?

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,518
A herald of what is to come,

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,035
an entire world
erased from existence.

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,635
Where's my mother?

46
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,317
Where's--where's Tommy?

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,836
Where's--where's
Rene, where's Dinah?

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,354
They are no more.

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,673
Did you hurt John and Laurel?

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,195
They are alive and nearby,

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,630
but now you know
that if we fail to stop

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,790
the coming crisis,

53
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,553
what you witnessed will occur

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,996
on infinite Earths across
the expanse of time.

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,352
How did I fail? Your dwarf
star particles are right there.

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,999
You disobeyed my instructions

57
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,595
to avoid entanglements
on a parallel Earth.

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,159
You confronted Tommy Merlyn.

59
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,278
You altered the
fate of Laurel Lance.

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,953
I watched her die once.

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,598
Ok. I wasn't prepared
to do it again.

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,553
You are not a man
accustomed to following orders,

63
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,751
but the survival of
the multiverse requires

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,514
that you obey mine.

65
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,589
Where are we?

66
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,875
Your home Earth,

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,917
where you will
complete your next task.

68
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,595
There's a man named
Dr. Robert Wong.

69
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,310
Bring him to me.

70
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,870
Why? Now, that
is not your concern.

71
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,919
Do not fail me again.

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,953
Oliver, we have to
get out of here...now.

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,551
“Who are they? -Local gang.

74
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,114
I think we busted up a deal.

75
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,189
Nice of you to show up.

76
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,149
Where the hell are we?

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,235
We're in Hong Kong.

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,319
It's--it's not possible.

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,073
There's no way
that my entire Earth

80
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,594
is just-- is just gone.

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,797
You saw what happened
to the SCPD, right,

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,752
that energy wave,
people just disappearing?

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,234
That doesn't mean it
happened everywhere.

84
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,674
The Monitor told me that it did.

85
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,996
-The what?
-His real name is Mar Novu--

86
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,434
Oh. You call that a real name?

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,352
He's the one that
has asked me to be

88
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,510
on this mission.

89
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,472
He is trying to
prevent a crisis--

90
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,670
Oliver, just stop.

91
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,995
Hand me the breach device.

92
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,114
Give it to me. I'm going back.

93
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,590
Laurel, back where?

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,830
To my Earth

95
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,354
to look for any survivors.

96
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,677
-It's not working.
Probably damaged

97
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,910
on our jump through the portal.

98
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,469
We don't have time to go
all the way to S.T.AR. Labs.

99
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,594
I--I have to find
somebody local.

100
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,478
I'm sorry, but we need
to focus on the mission.

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,914
First of all, there
is no we here,

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,952
and the only mission
that I care about

103
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,034
is saving what's
left of my Earth.

104
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,111
Laurel. Laurel!

105
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,117
There's no one left to save.

106
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,998
The only thing that
we can do right now

107
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,071
is prevent this from
happening again

108
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,151
by doing what the
Monitor tells us--

109
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,515
screw the Monitor, Oliver,

110
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
and screw you, too.

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,998
None of this would have happened

112
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,754
if you hadn't shown up on
my Earth in the first place.

113
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,999
All of those people
that you saw die,

114
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,919
they weren't real to you.

115
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,469
They were just copies of
the people that you love...

116
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,674
but that is my home,

117
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,840
and those people,
those are real people

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,229
who are counting on me--

119
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,029
Adrian, my sister.

120
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,634
I just got my life back,

121
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,598
and I am not giving
it up without a fight.

122
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,915
Let her go, man.

123
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,479
She's wasting her time, John.

124
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,039
She's processing her grief,

125
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,118
and if we have a new mission

126
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,634
and the multiverse
depends on it, Oliver,

127
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,473
we have to get going right now.

128
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,675
Anyone want to fill me in
on what happened out there?

129
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,478
I almost got my throat slit.

130
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,676
Turns out Connor doesn't know
his brother as well as he thinks.

131
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,353
Hey, we're all still
alive, aren't we?

132
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,079
Which means what exactly,

133
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,714
that your brother's
not such a bad guy?

134
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,599
All I'm saying is JJ could
have killed you, and he didn't.

135
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,149
Wow! That is
some serious denial.

136
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,673
To answer your
question, nothing good.

137
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,035
What about Alberto Vasquez?

138
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,158
He's safe, but he'd already
given JJ what he was after.

139
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,799
- Which was?
- Access codes

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,037
to the private vault in
Vasquez's penthouse.

141
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,395
Yeah. Well, we
went to the vault,

142
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,870
but by the time we got there, it had
already been trashed and emptied.

143
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,720
This is all that was left.

144
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,472
Flash storage from the
vault's security mainframe.

145
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah. Don't get too excited.

146
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,833
It's totally fried. Not to brag,

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,196
but totally fried is
kind of my wheelhouse.

148
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,677
If I can fix it, I'll
be able to extract

149
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,069
the vault's security log.

150
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,594
Finding out what the
Deathstrokes stole

151
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,080
could help us figure out
what they're planning next.

152
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,793
We already know
what they're planning.

153
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,155
♪ wants to take over the city.

154
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,395
He needs the cash to do it.

155
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,437
Well, Vasquez did say the
vault was full of valuables--

156
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,194
jewelry, cash.

157
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,510
So we figure out where
JJ's gonna sell, take him out.

158
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,717
I know exactly where you'd
go to move that kind of product.

159
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,277
You're not the only one
around here with street smarts.

160
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,359
Ok. We'll find JJ,
take him out of play.

161
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,593
Stay here. Fix that
useless piece of junk,

162
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,269
and, you, next time
I see your brother,

163
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,799
don't get in my way.

164
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,999
Harbinger sends her regards.

165
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,273
Oh. This would have
come in handy 10 years ago.

166
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,033
Well, it helps to be
married to Lyla Michaels,

167
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,793
who is en route
even as we speak.

168
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,520
John, I didn't even want
to get you involved in this.

169
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,711
I know, but if what
you told me is true,

170
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,713
which is that we're
facing the destruction of...

171
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,832
well, hell, man, pretty
much everything,

172
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,470
then to me that's the very
definition of all hands on deck.

173
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,630
Check this out.

174
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,595
Now this machine is hooked
up to AR.G.U.S.'s intranet,

175
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,639
$0 we can access all the
information it has on Dr. Wong.

176
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,840
You want to tell me
what that face is all about,

177
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,030
or are you gonna make me guess?

178
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,351
Laurel. She was right.

179
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,757
The Monitor warned
me not to get involved,

180
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,271
and, I don't know,
if I'd just found

181
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,475
a way to get the
dwarf star particles

182
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,472
without trying to stop
Tommy's Undertaking, then--

183
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,432
Oliver, what were you supposed
to do, just sit back and let it happen?

184
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,758
l ignored the orders
of a cosmic being,

185
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,078
and as a result, I watched
an entire world just

186
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,434
disappear, so...

187
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,036
I'm just trying not to make
the same mistake twice.

188
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,191
Well, if this cosmic
being wanted

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,313
someone willing to watch the
mass murder of innocent people,

190
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,598
then...he picked the wrong hero.

191
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,915
Shouldn't blame yourself, man.

192
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,918
Well, what about my
behavior over the past 7 years

193
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,031
has given you the
impression that I would?

194
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,793
Got him. Good.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,230
Dr. Robert Wong,
renowned biophysicist.

196
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,913
Won the Nobel
Prize in the specialty

197
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,390
of complex proteins
and antibodies.

198
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,439
First the dwarf star particles,
now a mysterious scientist.

199
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,557
Can't the Monitor just snap
his fingers and get both?

200
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
Well, he's not the biggest
fan of sharing information.

201
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,279
Ok. Looks like Dr. Wong
might not be that easy to find.

202
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,909
He's been missing a week.
This is the last-known photo.

203
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,037
Wan Chai University.
He's a professor.

204
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,235
That's where we start.

205
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,751
We need to do things
quietly, stay under the radar.

206
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,473
Too late.

207
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,115
Agh!

208
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,870
Tatsu?

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,229
You will be safe here.

210
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,910
So who were those men, Triad?

211
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,878
Shu gang, their rivals.

212
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,553
Why are you in Hong Kong?

213
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,519
I thought you were
with the Crescent Order.

214
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,194
I was until I gave
Nyssa the Lotus cure

215
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,509
to save your sister,

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,195
and they called for my head.

217
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,913
So you decided to
become a vigilante?

218
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,798
My son died in this city.

219
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,033
No more Akios will die here

220
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,311
as long as I'm here
to protect them.

221
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,551
That explains
what I'm doing here.

222
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,837
It's all you, man.

223
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,078
Right. We're looking for a
scientist named Dr. Robert Wong.

224
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,675
Why? -There's a crisis coming

225
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,953
that...quite literally
threatens the entire universe.

226
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,678
A man--something like a man

227
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,116
has asked me to
help him stop it.

228
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,274
-You mean Mar Novu?
You've heard of him?

229
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,078
When I was with
the Crescent Order.

230
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,550
A being who
transcends universes,

231
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,360
a crisis brewing.

232
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,113
He believes Dr. Wong
can help him stop it.

233
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,310
And you believe him?

234
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,515
I have to.

235
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,595
Then how can I help?

236
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,353
Tatsu, what we're
doing is very dangerous.

237
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,239
I--I can't ask you
to be involved.

238
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,550
You're not asking. I'm offering.

239
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,592
Dr. Wong was seen
last leaving his classroom

240
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,949
at Wan Chai University.

241
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,714
That was a week ago.

242
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,916
We're trying to figure out
why he would have left town.

243
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,673
I don't think he has.

244
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,433
Those pins, they're only worn

245
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,755
by the Security Wing,

246
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,638
Hong Kong version
of the secret police.

247
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,029
With a very healthy
reputation for

248
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,759
silencing political
enemies of the state.

249
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,116
Yeah, but why would they
be going after Dr. Wong?

250
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,315
We need to find out.

251
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,750
Johnny told me you were
about to do something stupid.

252
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,319
He called you all the way
to Hong Kong to follow me?

253
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,437
How nice. He thought
you could use some help.

254
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,635
Clearly, he was right.

255
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,956
Clearly, he needs to
mind his own business.

256
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,679
He said you're
looking for an old friend.

257
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,158
Doesn't seem like the
kind who's too friendly.

258
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,395
His name is David Chin.
I met him a few years ago

259
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,670
through Cayden James.

260
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,638
He said he could help
me get back to Earth-2

261
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,632
so maybe he still can.

262
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,471
Do you have any idea what
you're about to walk into?

263
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,957
Nothing that I
can't handle myself.

264
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,750
You'll need backup.

265
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,229
What the hell?

266
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,989
I wouldn't.

267
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,720
Hello, David. It's been a while.

268
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,950
Black Siren?

269
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,679
David, I'm gonna need your help,

270
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,114
and if you don't help me,

271
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,874
then I am gonna hurt
you very, very badly.

272
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,150
What do you want?

273
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,239
Whoa? Is that an
interdimensional extrapolator?

274
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,391
If that's nerd talk for
breach device, then yes,

275
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,959
and I need you to fix it.

276
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,549
That's not really
my area of expertise.

277
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,993
Okay, okay.

278
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,355
I'l do it.

279
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,433
Good. I'm so glad
you reconsidered.

280
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,797
So this is, what,
like a black market?

281
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,280
More or less.

Yeah. Well, they spent all

Fine.

314
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,519
You want to talk, we'll talk.

315

That looked like that hurt.

316

Knowing you has changed my life.

As soon as I mentioned
Dr. Wong's name, he stopped talking.

320
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,558
-He seemed afraid.
+I think we know why.

321
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,949
It seems that Dr. Wong
has been working

322
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,958
on a top secret project for
the Chinese government.

323
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,231
Exactly, which means
the Security Wing

324
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,550
wasn't kidnapping him.
It was trying to help him.

325
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,239
He must be in
protective custody.

326
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,720
Safe house in the
Wan Chai district,

327
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,598
but they're planning on moving
him out of the city tonight.

328
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,319
Then we better get moving.

329
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,110
Don't hurt me.

330
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,115
Triad.

331
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,039
We can't let them get
away with Dr. Wong.

332
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,953
We won't, Go, go, go, go!

333
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,079
Out of the way! Out of the way!

334
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,118
Welcome back to Hong Kong.

335
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,993
Hyah! Hyah!

336
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,033
Agh! Ugh!

337
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,349
-Hyah!
-Unh!

338
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,590
Gah!

339
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,916
It's gas. Got to get
these people out of here.

340
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,634
We can't lose the doctor.

341
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,760
No sign of Dr. Wong.

342
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,311
Triad must have taken
him deep underground.

343
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,270
I thought China White
was in AR.G.US. custody.

344
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,080
Yeah, Well, so did I, and
as far as I know, Lyla did, too.

345
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,033
Well, our situation just got a
whole lot more complicated.

346
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,390
You seemed ready to let
those people die back there.

347
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,914
I knew you had it handled,

348
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,796
and you knew that
Dr. Wong was the priority.

349
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,116
You sound like
someone l used to know--

350
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,637
you nine years ago,

351
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,274
single-minded
about your mission.

352
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,919
Tatsu, with due
respect, if you had seen

353
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,071
what I have seen,
you would understand.

354
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,119
The Monitor is our best
chance at preventing it

355
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,350
from happening again.

356
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,909
I've seen that blind faith
in you before, as well,

357
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,390
with Amanda Waller.

358
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,193
That wasn't blind faith.

359
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,440
She threatened my family, Tatsu.

360
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,437
Right now, the stakes are
every family in existence.

361
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,796
Guys, I really hate
to interrupt this,

362
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,633
but none of this
matters if we don't find

363
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,154
this missing scientist, right?

364
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,878
Why does the Triad want him?

365
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,549
His work does not seem harmful.

366
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,994
Yeah? Well, innocent
men don't work

367
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,275
on secret government projects.

368
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,919
We need to know
what this project is.

369
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,753
Then we'll know why
the Triad is after him.

370
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,474
I don't like this.

371
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,914
He's stalling.

372
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,111
Hey. Hey!

373
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,910
What's taking so long?

374
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,558
-It's done. <Great.

375
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,156
So you won't mind
if we test it out.

376
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,229
Itisn't working.

377
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,150
Well, it should be.

378
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,754
Then where's the portal?

379
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,073
You want to go to
Earth-37, Earth-14?

380
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,477
I want to go to Earth-2.

381
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,153
Earth-2...

382
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,553
is gone.

383
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,512
It registered at first, but now
I see that it's like a shadow.

384
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,438
There's no sign of life.

385
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,358
That doesn't make any sense.

386
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,159
You're lying. Fix it! Fix it!

387
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,714
I'm telling you I did.

388
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,234
1 can fix tech. I
can't bring back

389
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,720
awhole friggin' universe!

390
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,879
I'm so sorry, Laurel...

391
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,039
but they're gone.

392
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,149
Let's get out of here.

393
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,150
Laurel!

394
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,790
Now!

395
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,432
There's nothing in any
governmental databases

396
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,790
of the project Dr. Wong
was working on.

397
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,917
-So we're back to square
one? No, not exactly.

398
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,236
An AR.G.U.S. mole
led me to a paper trail,

399
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,953
some equipment that
Dr. Wong purchased.

400
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,155
He shipped it to this address.

401
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,556
Well, it's his lab. It has to
be. We need to get in there.

402
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,040
That may not be $0 easy.

403
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,999
I know this place.
It's a PLA garrison.

404
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,759
Oh. Those garrisons
have a reputation

405
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,240
for being almost impenetrable.

406
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,834
Almost but not quite.

407
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,110
There are certain
vulnerabilities.

408
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,759
Yeah. Well, even if we
could get in that place,

409
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,189
it's gonna be heavily fortified.

410
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,198
That's never stopped us before.

411
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,474
Ow.

412
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,598
I'm almost at the sublevel.

413
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,831
The elevator will take
you straight to the lab.

414
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,474
Most likely will be guarded.

415
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,829
All right. I've
definitely been made.

416
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,229
You only have a few minutes.

417
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,190
I'm starting the upload.

418
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,996
What? What is it?

419
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,071
I know what the Triad is after.

420
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,119
Dr. Wong has been
trying to re-create

421
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,310
the Alpha-Omega virus.

422
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,198
He's not trying.
He's already done it.

423
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,433
After what happened
last time, you'd think

424
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,999
the Chinese government
would have learned its lesson.

425
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,037
The Alpha-Omega
is a powerful weapon.

426
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,634
Yeah, and the Triad
could already have it.

427
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,791
If they had it, they wouldn't
have any need for Dr. Wong.

428
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,516
It's just a matter of time before
they make him re-create it.

429
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,990
Which means, Oliver,
that we have a ticking clock

430
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,993
and absolutely no plan.

431
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,316
-We have this.
-You stole the virus?

432
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,675
This is what China White wants,

433
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,830
this is what I'm gonna give her.

434
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,116
Oliver, you more than anyone
else knows how dangerous this is.

435
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,072
Which is why I'm not actually
gonna give her the virus.

436
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,918
We're using this as
bait to draw her out.

437
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,191
My husband tried this
gambit once already,

438
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,000
and you're the one who
told him he made a mistake.

439
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,389
This is different.

440
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,114
Maseo had every intention

441
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,078
of actually giving the
virus to China White.

442
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,119
-l don't. t's too risky.

443
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,679
It's riskier to do nothing.

444
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,278
If anyone has a better idea,

445
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,709
I'm all ears.

446
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,632
I'll start making arrangements.

447
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,399
Here. It'll help
with the swelling.

448
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,996
I don't have anyone here who cares
if I come home with bruised knuckles.

449
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,993
I'm here. I care.

450
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,593
You barely even know me.

451
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,358
I know what it's
like to lose people.

452
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,839
Do you know what it's like
to lose an entire universe?

453
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,030
No.

454
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,637
Then you don't know how I feel.

455
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,073
You didn't know them.

456
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,031
My sister, Adrian,
they're my family,

457
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,709
they're--they're good people.

458
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,237
They don't deserve to be gone.

459
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,560
To think that I'm the one
who's done such awful things.

460
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,631
But you're trying to be better.

461
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,071
Everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

462
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,511
Well, then maybe this
is where I deserve to be.

463
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,832
When I was in Afghanistan,

464
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,074
my unit got sent out on patrol

465
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,833
on a day I drew base duty.

466
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,920
It was a routine op.

467
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,196
We'd done it a
hundred times before.

468
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,273
Only this time, there
was an IED in the road.

469
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,513
None of them made it back.

470
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,751
I used to lie in bed at night

471
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,394
asking myself,

472
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,160
"Why them?

473
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,674
Why not me?"

474
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,796
And I made every
deal I could think of

475
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,315
with any god I
thought might listen.

476
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,880
And did it work?

477
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,115
Not exactly.

478
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,113
So you're right.

479
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,119
I don't know what
you're going through,

480
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,200
but I do know something
about survivor's guilt.

481
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,760
Does it get any easier?

482
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,030
No.

483
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,553
All we can do is try
and move forward.

484
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,750
How am I supposed
to move forward

485
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,556
when everyone I've
ever loved is gone?

486
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,953
By not giving up.

487
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,714
By doing the right thing.

488
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,799
We honor the dead
by fighting for the living.

489
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,477
This world needs you, too.

490
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,989
You're not talking
me out of this.

491
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,157
4 know. -Trust me, Tatsu.

492
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,358
1 will not let China
White get the virus.

493
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,511
-And what if you fail?
-I'm not gonna fail.

494
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,755
Nine years ago, you
failed to stop the virus,

495
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,149
and my son died.

496
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,640
And I regret it every day.

497
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,949
You must remember it

498
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,954
because of what happened after.

499
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,639
I tortured General Shrieve.

500
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,111
Your grief, your anger,
your guilt over the failure,

501
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,549
it stole your humanity.

502
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,631
This is different.
I'm not angry.

503
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,434
I'm simply doing
what has to be done.

504
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,590
How do you know that?

505
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,669
It is said that Mar Novu believes
order comes through chaos.

506
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,239
So he's bringing us order?

507
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,073
But first may be chaos.

508
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,198
He's asking you
to bring him a man

509
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,954
who re-created a
deadly virus. Why?

510
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,510
How do you know he won't use it
for something worse than the Triad?

511
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,670
I don't know,

512
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,951
but I have to believe him.

513
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,599
I have no other choice.

514
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,353
Even if that is true,

515
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,913
he does not seem to care
who he hurts along the way.

516
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,271
Sometimes, the mission
is not worth the cost.

517
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,029
You know that,

518
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,753
so why are you still
doing what he asks?

519
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,113
Because if I'm wrong--

520
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,312
if 'm wrong, then all
of this is for nothing.

521
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,234
Do you understand, Tatsu?

522
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,038
1 left Felicity.

523
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,113
I left my children,

524
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,792
§0 if--if--if the-- if the
Monitor can't fix this

525
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,320
and if he is not here to help,

526
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,676
then all of these things
that I've sacrificed

527
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,315
and all the things that
so many other people

528
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,154
have already sacrificed
will have been for nothing.

529
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,640
I need my family to live,

530
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,549
which means that
I need this to work.

531
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,595
You're risking too much.

532
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,830
There's no other choice.

533
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,718
There's always another choice.

534
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,154
You seem stressed. Relax.

535
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,993
You said you wanted to talk,

536
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,509
so talk.

537
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,275
Still can't believe that you
decided to become a vigilante.

538
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,075
You know you always
have a place here with us.

539
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,515
You do have the mark.

540
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,755
You know why I got it.

541
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,196
That's right. You and
Dad's brilliant plan

542
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,919
to save me from the dark side.

543
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,151
I got it because I
wanted my brother back.

544
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,279
You remember when I
was in middle school?

545
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,797
Remember when those guys
tried to get me to run their drugs?

546
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,395
Not really in the mood for a
trip down memory lane, Con.

547
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,551
When you found
out, you were the one

548
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,040
that told me that I
was better than that.

549
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,594
Yeah. My favorite
part of that story

550
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,592
is when you didn't listen

551
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,509
and I got grounded.

552
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,998
Dad held me responsible.

553
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,794
You want to hate me?

554
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,116
You want to hate Dad? Fine. Ok.

555
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,759
That--that's fair.

556
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,991
Don't throw your life
away because of it.

557
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,437
When I look at you, I still see

558
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,359
the kid who'd take on
somebody twice his size

559
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,039
just because he
was messing with me.

560
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,520
Yeah. I'm not that
kid anymore, Con.

561
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,795
Yes, you are,

562
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,839
and you can try-- you can try

563
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,957
to snuff it out, to
cover it up with a mask,

564
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,157
but I know who you are,

565
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,194
and it's not too late.

566
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,600
And we can fix this...together.

567
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,196
You're late. I thought perhaps
you changed your mind.

568
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,475
Deal's a deal.

569
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,720
Thank you for meeting me.

570
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,269
Anything for a friend.

571
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,309
Now I have the virus.

572
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,476
“Where's Dr. Wong? -He's nearby.

573
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,678
I was surprised
when I got your call.

574
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,956
Well, I'm surprised that you're
not in an AR.G.U.S. prison.

575
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,633
Well, apparently the
government doesn't like

576
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,155
when agents put
bombs in people's necks.

577
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,995
You know what else
they don't like? Bad press.

578
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,395
So they bought your silence.

579
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,994
It's a shame your
friend Mr. Diggle

580
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,759
had to lose his job over it.

581
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,440
I assume he's here, too.

582
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,555
Perimeter's clean.

583
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,399
Tatsu, any sign of Dr. Wong?

584
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,510
Not yet.

585
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,069
I don't think he's here.

586
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,514
Wait. Someone's coming.

587
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,074
Oliver, keep her talking.

588
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,274
You and I...

589
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,950
we have been enemies
since the very beginning,

590
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,919
but there's something coming.

591
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,593
It's bigger than us.

592
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,355
It is something that threatens

593
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,999
our entire Earth.

594
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,398
-Let me see him.
-Give me the case.

595
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,035
Tatsu, we have to move now.

596
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,918
I see him. I'm going in.

597
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,200
Wait. He's wearing
some kind of vest.

598
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,033
It looks like explosives.

599
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,634
China White must
have a detonator.

600
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,677
It's real.

601
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,520
That vest is not part
of the agreement.

602
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,876
I had to be sure you weren't
gonna do anything stupid.

603
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,759
I'l deactivate it once
I'm safe in the car.

604
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,553
Until next time, Mr. Queen.

605
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,399
There's not gonna
be a next time.

606
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,070
Now.

607
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,556
Hyah!

608
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,956
Damn it! I'm going
after the virus!

609
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,275
Chien Na Wei.

610
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,714
Tatsu Yamashiro.

611
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,756
You really think this will
go better than the last time?

612
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,309
Ihave Dr. Wong.

613
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,390
Hi, honey.

614
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,119
Virus is secure.

615
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,793
I can't remove the
vest without triggering it.

616
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,718
We need that detonator.

617
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,035
Unh!

618
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,514
The detonator.

619
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,879
You better kill me now.

620
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,195
I have the detonator.

621
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,709
Tatsu?

622
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,435
Unh.

623
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,076
Looks like I'm not the only
one who needed backup.

624
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,477
Tatsu's resting
in the infirmary.

625
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,789
She'll be in pain for a
few days, but she'll be fine.

626
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,110
She would have been dead

627
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,796
if you hadn't have come
back and fought with us.

628
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,317
1 don't know if I'll ever
get over what happened

629
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,835
on Earth-2, but...

630
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,798
I'l help you make sure
it never happens again.

631
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,078
Well, at least we
accomplished our objective.

632
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,753
“How's Dr. Wong? He's fine.

633
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,394
In a secure location.

634
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,030
The virus is, too.

635
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,993
And so what-- what, do we text

636
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,276
the Monitor or whatever, letting
him know we have his guy?

637
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,475
Don't think he texts.

638
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,310
I don't want to hand
over Dr. Wong just yet.

639
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,758
I want answers, and if he is
not gonna give them to me,

640
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,149
I'm gonna find them
somewhere else.

641
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,310
Oliver, what are
you talking about?

642
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,515
Tatsu...

643
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,038
she told me that I had to be

644
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,431
absolutely sure that I was
making the right choice.

645
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,394
She almost died, John.

646
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,557
Alot of people have died already

647
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,518
for the sake of this mission.

648
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,279
1 owe it to all of
them to find out

649
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,238
who the Monitor really is.

650
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,994
And, Oliver, what if we don't like
the answers to those questions?

651
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,315
What do we do then?

652
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,959
We find another way to stop it.

653
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,755
There's always another way.

654
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,117
Oliver, so what's the plan?

655
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,277
I need to apologize
to a friend of mine first.

656
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,634
So...what do you say?

657
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,791
How about you and
me leave together?

658
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,719
It was a nice speech,
but once again,

659
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,919
you have managed to
make everything about you.

660
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,240
This isn't about you or Dad.

661
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,040
Yeah, you both have
this misguided idea

662
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,556
about duty and
family, civic pride.

663
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,157
You fail to see
the bigger picture.

664
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,354
I have vision.

665
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,919
What are you talking about?

666
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,550
Did you really not think that
I knew you'd show up here?

667
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,998
Yes. Worthless
piece of junk, my ass.

668
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,796
What the hell did the
Deathstrokes want with this?

669
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,030
What did you do?

670
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,035
What did you do?!

671
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,799
Oh. Hey, hey. I
knew that you thought

672
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,600
that I'd be after the
valuables in Vasquez's safe

673
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,320
and that Zoe
would lead you here,

674
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,199
the one shady trading post
that she knows about, right?

675
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,794
You were never after the money.

676
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,674
Why cripple the system
when you can rip its heart out?

677
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,635
Oh, my God.

678
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,195
Once the unification
movement is gone,

679
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,397
the power vacuum
is ours to fill.

680
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,679
- think we're done
here. Not even close.

681
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,830
You are not gonna touch me.

682
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,990
Oh, yeah? And why is that?

683
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,434
Because if you do,

684
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,037
the men who are storming
your bunker right now

685
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,429
will kill your brother.

686
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,075
William?

687
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,274
William, do you copy?

688
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,432
Like I said, I think
we're done here.

689
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,920
If you hurt my brother,
I swear I will kill you.

690
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,076
JJ...please.

691
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,153
You were wrong
about me, brother.

692
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,750
It was never a mask.

693
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,560
Think the doctors would have
preferred you stay in the hospital.

694
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,232
I have survived worse.

695
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,834
Brought you something.

696
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,753
Herbs.
-There's a rumor going around

697
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,240
they help with healing.

698
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,512
I have seen many battles.

699
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,639
For a moment, I
believed this was my last.

700
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,111
I saw Akio and Maseo,

701
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,358
but...this was not my time.

702
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,877
Tatsu, you almost
died because of me.

703
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,154
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,917
Well, you were right
when you said that

705
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,432
some missions
aren't worth the cost,

706
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,231
s0 I'm gonna make
sure that this one is.

707
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,593
So where will you go?

708
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,714
You heard a rumor about the
Monitor and a coming crisis?

709
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,029
I doubt the Crescent Order

710
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,713
will have the answers you seek.

711
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,714
Thankfully, there are
organizations on this Earth

712
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,555
far, far older than
the Crescent Order.

713
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,234
I'm going to Nanda Parbat.

714
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,914
You should have told me what
was going to happen on Earth-2.

715
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,832
John was there. He
could have been killed.

716
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,958
The destruction of that Earth
was a necessary sacrifice.

717
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,633
And what about Laurel Lance?

718
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,078
Her friends, her family--

719
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,311
Countless more
like them will perish

720
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,716
if we do not ensure that
Oliver Queen is prepared

721
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,154
for what is coming.

722
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,189
Were you successful?

723
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,112
Yes. I have Dr. Wong.

724
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,874
Then let us proceed.

725
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,039
Greg, move your head!
