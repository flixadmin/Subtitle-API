1
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,750
MADRID
FIVE DAYS SINCE D-DAY

2
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,916
Oh, Alicia…

3
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,541
Now the only way out is to take the blame.

4
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,875
And who's going to do that?

5
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,750
For the CNI, Prieto.

6
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,083
For the police, you.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,333
Package delivered, Professor.
I'll be out in two minutes.

8
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,250
You’re going to take the rap anyway.

9
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,166
Be strong. We’re with you.

10
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,416
Lisbon!

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,041
Welcome to the Bank of Spain.

12
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,333
The government gave the orders.

13
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,291
The National Center of Intelligence,
police commanders,

14
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,916
and the Ministry of the Interior.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,166
Absolutely everyone knew about it.

16
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,833
Where's the helicopter going?

17
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,458
Court proceedings

18
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,375
have been initiated against Alicia Sierra…

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,333
and a warrant issued for her arrest.

20
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,791
-Yes!
-Come on!

21
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,250
Professor. Lisbon is with us.

22
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,291
Listen to me.

23
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,833
This war…

24
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,416
we're going to win.

25
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,625
For Nairobi.

26
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,166
For Nairobi.

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,541
For Nairobi.

28
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,041
For Nairobi.

29
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,666
For Nairobi!

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,666
For Nairobi!

31
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,958
For Nairobi!

32
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,583
For Nairobi!

33
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,083
For Nairobi!

34
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,916
For Nairobi!

35
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,000
Checkmate, son of a bitch.

36
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,416
Don't make me shoot you
because I'm dying to kill you.

37
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,625
I'm the wife of a dead man.

38
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,208
I'm a disgraced police officer.

39
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,791
I'm a torturer for those who love me. 
All thanks to you.

40
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,291
I'm not putting a bullet in your brain

41
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,833
because there's someone who 
needs me for the next 18 years.

42
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,791
But it's a fine line.

43
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,500
If you make me cross it, I'll do it

44
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,000
with a smile on my face.

45
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,041
You live here.

46
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,083
This is your hideout.

47
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,333
In the most disgusting hole
in Madrid, of course.

48
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,125
You're living where
a rat like you is supposed to live.

49
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,958
What are you going to do to me?

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,750
I'm going to get your plan out of you…

51
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,625
and turn you in.

52
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,750
I'll make sure
you're charged with terrorism,

53
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,666
sentenced to life in prison,

54
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,833
and don't ever get to see
the light of day again.

55
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,208
Listen to me closely.

56
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,083
Your condemnation

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,291
is our salvation.

58
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,541
-Look at how civic-minded they are.
-Yes.

59
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,416
They're such beautiful people.

60
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,458
And you and me, here, father and son.
How nice.

61
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,208
Our father-son relationship
hasn't exactly been ideal, Dad.

62
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,708
But I've forgiven you.

63
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,625
Forgiven me for what?

64
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,916
For being born.

65
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,791
I had an excellent… and exquisite
relationship with your mother.

66
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,583
And you stood
in the way of our happiness.

67
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,833
All I wanted was
to take her out to dinner, travel…

68
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,750
make love
in beautiful places around the world,

69
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,875
and then you arrived and took it all away.

70
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,083
You were like a nuclear warhead

71
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,666
that blasted away that dream.

72
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't know, Dad.
Everyone has kids and they adapt.

73
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,458
Look at those lobsters!

74
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,666
Let's eat here. Waiter!

75
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,500
Two aquavits and the menu please.

76
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,166
Rafael.

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,250
Rafael…

78
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,916
We're here to start over again.

79
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,541
Not to get wrapped up in our resentment.

80
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,458
No, you're right, Dad.

81
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,250
The past is the past
and there's no point in giving it…

82
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,125
too much thought. That's it.

83
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:45,916
Come on.

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm happy

85
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,416
that we're here and together again.

86
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,375
Really.

87
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,375
Tatiana.

88
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,958
You brought your girlfriend?

89
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,375
It's a family honeymoon
for the three of us.

90
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,041
I'm going to the restroom.

91
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,416
Is he okay?

92
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,708
He's slightly annoyed.
He didn't know you were coming.

93
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,791
Have you told him he's here for a heist?

94
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:43,625
My love,

95
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,500
the really important things in life 
are always unexpected.

96
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,208
What's next?

97
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,583
After the Paris Plan?

98
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,666
The Rome Plan will begin immediately.

99
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,166
No.

100
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,958
-Rome? Seriously?
-Yes.

101
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,000
That's great!

102
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,083
That's grea…?

103
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,125
Hey, what's up with you?

104
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,833
Huh? Iceman?

105
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,125
Are you letting romance take the wheel?

106
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,458
Of course not.

107
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,375
And what's after Rome? The Venice Plan?

108
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,583
I mean burnt-to-a-crisp Rome,
the Rome destroyed by Nero.

109
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,791
Nero?

110
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,958
I don't like the sound of that. Continue.

111
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,375
If we release
the only person they've arrested

112
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,833
and put them inside the bank,
right under their noses,

113
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:46,125
it'll be so humiliating they'll want
to destroy us as quickly as possible.

114
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,833
They'll use their best weapon.

115
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:51,666
The army.

116
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,083
Let's intervene immediately.

117
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,333
We need to talk.

118
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,375
-We can brainstorm later.
-I need backup.

119
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,208
I need officers
from Catalonia and the Basque Country.

120
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,833
-I need them here!
-Good idea.

121
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:06,625
Sure, take them to Puerta del Sol.
Rumor has it, Pikachu is picking pockets!

122
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,041
Only the army can fix this.

123
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,916
This is a civil matter
that concerns the police.

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,250
It's a matter of national security.

125
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:17,083
I'm bringing soldiers in,
ones that either conquer or die.

126
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,083
Martínez, get me Major Sagasta.

127
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,458
A battalion, maybe two. I don't know.

128
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,250
They'll break in at full force,

129
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,208
because killing hostages
will become a lesser evil.

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,541
And then what?

131
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,958
-How's it going downstairs?
-We have melted 59.

132
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,666
Plug the pump in. Let's start to extract.

133
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,458
There are 31 tons left.
The plan is to melt them.

134
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,541
My presence changes everything. 
Extraction is the priority now.

135
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,875
Our only chance is to take the gold
we've managed to melt up until then.

136
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,208
Fuck…

137
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,916
The whole Rome thing turned me on.

138
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,375
-How much time do we have?
-Three, four hours.

139
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,750
Many lines of investigation are open
and there's a helicopter in the air.

140
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,125
Where's that helicopter?

141
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,458
It's heading southwest from Guadalajara.
We're 11 minutes behind it.

142
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,708
I can order an F18 from the base
in Torrejón to shoot it down.

143
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,875
No. We need the pilot alive.

144
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,708
That helicopter will eventually land
and we'll be there.

145
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,625
Yes, Colonel.

146
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,125
Bear 21, this is Bravo Three.

147
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,708
You must land immediately.
I repeat, land immediately.

148
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,291
Don't touch me!
The wound is next to the femoral artery.

149
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,666
Stitch him up and make him zip it.

150
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,583
Come on, hero.

151
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll only allow a surgeon
in a hospital to touch me.

152
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,291
What the fuck did you do?
You came here under one condition:

153
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,750
never reveal your identity.
You were to be a hostage among hostages.

154
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,541
There was a guy holding an M16.

155
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,875
Arturo with an M16 is useless.
Arturo with a bazooka is useless!

156
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,375
We have a protocol.

157
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,166
I may have saved your life.

158
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,875
You should be
at least a tiny bit thankful.

159
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,291
You said you'd keep Cincinnati
if they catch us.

160
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,083
That was the deal.

161
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,750
You had your alibi.

162
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,250
You blew it.

163
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,375
And now my son has no plan B anymore.

164
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,333
-Manila did what she had to do.
-No.

165
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:20,208
We trusted her to raise our child
and she doesn't give a shit.

166
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,458
Arturo can do no wrong.

167
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,916
It doesn't matter what he does.
Whether he has an M16,

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,458
rubs up on you with a hard-on
or assaults a hostage,

169
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,625
it's always someone else's fault!

170
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,375
Look…

171
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,333
if we lose Cincinnati,

172
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,375
it's our fault.

173
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,291
We came here because we wanted to.

174
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,666
So stop talking shit.

175
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,750
This isn't over yet.

176
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,416
Attention!

177
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,625
We're changing stages.
I repeat, changing stages!

178
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,291
Get the remaining ingots
and plug in the extractor pump.

179
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,125
Now! Let's go!

180
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,916
Come on!
What are you looking at? Let's go!

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,500
Another eight hours
at full blast and it'll all melt.

182
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,416
Melting comes second now.
I want to prioritize extraction.

183
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,208
We needed to melt 90 tons
to get out alive and now 60 is enough?

184
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,000
Lisbon is inside the bank.

185
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,291
That will speed up an intervention
we can't counteract.

186
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,208
Either we take the gold out now
or we have no chance. Do you understand?

187
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,750
Did you know that rescuing Lisbon
would jeopardize our meticulous plan?

188
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,041
I didn't know shit!

189
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,916
Of course you didn't, damn it!

190
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,625
We never would've agreed.

191
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,208
If getting someone out of jail
puts the plan at risk,

192
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,125
they stay in jail, period.

193
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,708
That goes for everyone.

194
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,583
I'm not giving the orders.

195
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,166
You were before, damn it.

196
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,583
What are you now? The errand boy?

197
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,916
Man,

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,166
we're starting to improvise,

199
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,916
and that's how people
in heists get killed.

200
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,000
Lisbon to Professor. Do you copy?

201
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,791
Lisbon to Professor. Do you copy?

202
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,291
Lisbon to Professor. Do you copy?

203
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,583
How long did they
interrogate you in the tent?

204
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,708
Thirty hours.

205
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,041
Why? Is that too long
to keep my mouth shut?

206
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,208
Not for me.

207
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,583
For you, I don't know.

208
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,708
Maybe you saw a badge and felt nostalgic.

209
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,666
And then confessed
how we're going to get the gold out…

210
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,541
At least I didn't shake my ass
at all the clubs in Panama.

211
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,416
Professor, this is Lisbon. Answer.

212
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,500
What is Raquel doing there?

213
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,000
He must be covering Marseille outside.

214
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,750
We have a check-up call in 20 minutes.

215
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,375
If we have 20 minutes, I need a shower.

216
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,166
And a red jumpsuit.

217
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,000
At your service, Ms. Professor.

218
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,041
How did Raquel get in the bank?

219
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,250
How are your pals getting out?

220
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,416
And the gold?

221
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,750
Okay, speak now…

222
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,166
or I'll shoot you.

223
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,000
I've been threatened
at gunpoint many times.

224
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,083
I won't threaten you then.

225
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,375
Fuck, you have great self-control.

226
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,875
Let's talk now…

227
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,375
to prevent any further deep wounds, okay?

228
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,875
You're melting the gold.

229
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,291
What for?

230
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,125
We're turning it to grit…

231
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,458
into…

232
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,875
two-millimeter nuggets to get it out.

233
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,458
I knew it.

234
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,666
How will you get it out?

235
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,208
The only possible way.

236
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,416
The sewage system.

237
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,541
It'll come out all mushed up,
mixed into the water.

238
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,166
You think I'm stupid, right?

239
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,125
The sewers are brimming
with underground police.

240
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,208
Tell me the truth.

241
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,708
The grit will go right past them,
covered in mud. They won't see it.

242
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,458
So…

243
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,916
if you're getting it out
through the sewers…

244
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:34,916
why are you here?

245
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,541
What the fuck are you doing here?

246
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,333
Let's go!

247
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,625
Major Sagasta, Colonel Tamayo speaking,
from the Bank of Spain operation.

248
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,916
-This is Sagasta. Is something wrong?
-I want you to lead an attack on the bank.

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,791
Negative. I'm on leave.

250
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:54,083
Sagasta, this is not the time
to break my balls with your cold hands.

251
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,458
-You're familiar with my background.
-Every inch. That's why I'm calling.

252
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,416
Afghanistan, Yemen,

253
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,666
the pirates in the Horn of Africa,
Boko Haram…

254
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,125
Do you know
what all those missions have in common?

255
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,291
What? Mosquitoes?

256
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,000
They're undercover operations abroad.

257
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,083
No witnesses.

258
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,208
Why would I meddle in a civil matter,

259
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,250
with Spanish civilians 
and the attorney general as spectators?

260
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,666
First, because it's an order.
Second, for your country.

261
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,625
Isn't that enough?

262
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,708
They're attacking us
and you pledged allegiance to the flag!

263
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,500
Let me tell you
a couple of things, Colonel.

264
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,791
Well, three things.

265
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,375
First, I couldn't find the right time

266
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,750
during this conversation
to tell you that I'm pooing.

267
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,833
And I guess it's too late now.

268
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,375
Second, I'll be there in 40 minutes.

269
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,833
And third,
I'll go in with my trusted team.

270
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,916
The ones from Afghanistan, Yemen and Mali.

271
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,458
I want them all.

272
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,750
What does this look like?

273
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,416
This.

274
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,416
Turn me in to the police.

275
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,000
Nope.

276
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,916
If I take you to the police
or to prison, you'll escape.

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,083
No matter where I take you,
you've got a plan and you'll escape.

278
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,583
Answer my question.
How are you getting the gold out?

279
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,666
If you push me,
you'll never clear your name.

280
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,833
How will you do it?

281
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,958
What will you give them?
A smashed up corpse full of bullets?

282
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,041
-The gold.
-You'll look crazy.

283
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,041
Okay. Let's fly then.

284
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,166
Do you understand
the situation better now?

285
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,083
You don't understand.

286
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,291
I'll never…

287
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,666
turn my gang in. Do you get it? Never!

288
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:21,041
Listen to me. The plan is devised
to survive against any setback,

289
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,500
even my death.

290
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,208
So, let's do this…

291
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,625
Throw me into the void!

292
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,833
Even better, shoot me!

293
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,333
Empty the chamber!
Come on, I can't wait! Do it!

294
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,583
Do it!

295
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,291
I wish.

296
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,166
When they find out about Murillo,
and they will,

297
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,541
the shit's going to hit the fan
and someone will have to take the rap.

298
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,083
We can share it
and each of us can take part of the blame.

299
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,125
-Or we can make someone else take it.
-Who? A fellow officer?

300
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,291
No, Pope Francis. Get out of here.

301
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,708
Yes, a fellow officer. A former officer.

302
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,083
A traitor, Alicia Sierra. It's obvious
she's working for the Professor.

303
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,625
-How do we know that?
-I don't know, nor do I need to.

304
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,166
There was probably a mole
and it had to be her.

305
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,791
But there's no evidence.

306
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,666
Evidence? What evidence?

307
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,500
Evidence can be fabricated if needed.

308
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,791
What are we, newbies?

309
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,166
Martínez, get Sierra's emails.

310
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,875
We need to prove
she leaked Prieto's conversations

311
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,791
with Osman and everything about Algeria.

312
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,375
Track her phone.
I want her near the National Court.

313
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,208
Irrefutable evidence
she was working with Murillo.

314
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,333
I'll need the operators to cooperate.

315
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,958
The operators will do
whatever the CNI tells them to.

316
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,916
Antoñanzas, go to forensics
and stop Nairobi's autopsy.

317
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,583
Put an army doctor on the report instead.
Only one bullet hole should be listed…

318
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,041
Gandía's.

319
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,541
We'll say that,
when Sierra ordered to shoot,

320
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,958
Nairobi was wearing a vest.
That it was all a farce, in short.

321
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,375
With all this, I think we're covered.

322
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,708
Colonel, we're breaking the law.

323
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,416
More than they are.
And I believe in the law.

324
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,750
So I'm leaving.

325
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,833
Where do you think you're going,
Pooh Bear?

326
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,791
If I stay,
I'll report anyone participating in this.

327
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,833
Who are you going to report?
You're the only fraud here!

328
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,750
You found the Professor's hangar.

329
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,708
You could have stopped him from escaping.

330
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,416
So don't play Mahatma Gandhi now!

331
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,166
Don't mess with me, Tamayo!
I was coming out of a coma!

332
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,291
I have recordings from your phone.

333
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,583
You're totally drunk…

334
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,416
Your phone calls to Murillo.

335
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,958
After 15 years with you,
at your side, like a fucking fool.

336
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,875
She was arrested in front of you
and you wouldn't cooperate with Prieto

337
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,833
because you were drooling
like a lovesick puppy, weren't you?

338
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,250
Answer me, Angelito.

339
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,458
I'm not answering any of that.

340
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,750
Then start negotiating

341
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,375
or you'll go to prison before Rio,
Tokyo and Albuquirky.

342
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,166
Fine, you're getting promoted
to inspector negotiator. How's that?

343
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,083
You may even become commissioner later.

344
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,000
If I'm the negotiator, we'll do it my way.
I won't do anything illegal, Tamayo.

345
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,375
"I won't do anything illegal, Tamayo."

346
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,041
Your job is to negotiate.

347
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,875
We'll do the dirty work.

348
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,041
Colonel.

349
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The helicopter is slowing down.

350
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,375
The ground tracing units
are seven minutes away.

351
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,750
Tell them to hurry.
I want a full road blockade.

352
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,833
The air deployment continues.

353
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,958
What's up, Maserati?

354
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,541
Your jumpsuit,

355
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,625
a towel and…

356
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,125
a pair of Helsinki's panties.

357
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,208
I'm just kidding. Fuck.

358
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,416
Thank you.

359
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Sorry I was so out of line before.

360
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,125
I needed to see your reaction.

361
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:27,833
And?

362
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,291
Did I react well?

363
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,875
You don't seem stressed.

364
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,000
I know they'll crush us.

365
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,250
And I can't help but think
this situation is somewhat romantic.

366
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,166
Really?

367
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,125
How so?

368
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:54,083
He dug a 12-meter tunnel
to get me out of the National Court.

369
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,125
He took me for a ride
all around Madrid in an attack helicopter.

370
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Then, he got me
into the Bank of Spain reserve

371
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,666
in front of 3,000 police officers.

372
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,166
That's beautiful.

373
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:11,750
It is.

374
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,583
Love grows exponentially during a heist.

375
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:17,708
Does it?

376
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,333
How so?

377
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:22,750
Because…

378
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,291
every second could be your last.

379
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,875
The adrenaline makes you
live life to the fullest.

380
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,791
You don't want to leave
anything for later.

381
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,791
It's definitely more romantic
than going grocery shopping on Fridays.

382
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:45,541
I've known this since the first time
I kissed someone before a hold-up.

383
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,666
Your heart's pounding.

384
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,000
-Ready?
-Ready.

385
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,875
You walk in…

386
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,375
Nobody move, motherfuckers!

387
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,125
Hands up! This is a hold-up!

388
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,041
-Do it! Come on!
-Your wallets!

389
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,000
Hands up!

390
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,166
Let's go!

391
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,708
…and wreak havoc.

392
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,625
You're a goddess!

393
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:11,125
Open the fucking cash register!
Come on, open it! Now!

394
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,875
Get out of here! Now!

395
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,666
And in the middle of the turmoil…

396
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,875
Come on! Move!

397
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:22,708
…you look him in the eye
and realize you're so fucking happy.

398
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:23,625
Wallets out!

399
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:26,708
Come on! Faster!

400
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,166
Come on!

401
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,041
You leave with a backpack full of dough,
scream on the motorcycle…

402
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:39,666
You feel…

403
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,416
indestructible, powerful.

404
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,250
You cling tightly to him
at 110 miles per hour.

405
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,541
You cross the border into Portugal.

406
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,833
And you stop somewhere random…

407
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:08,791
because you can't resist
your desire for him any longer.

408
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,791
You want to devour time
before it slips away.

409
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,500
And that…

410
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:35,500
makes every moment so magical…

411
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,791
You're not talking about Rio, are you?

412
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,250
It was before him.

413
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,875
He was killed during a hold-up.

414
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:18,750
I was there.

415
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,583
I knew I'd never find
a love like that again.

416
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,166
He was the love of my life.

417
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,041
Mozart is your favorite composer?

418
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,541
Well, I'd actually choose,
because I'm a huge fan of his,

419
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,833
Robert Schumann.

420
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,625
Wait until you hear me play Schubert.

421
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,041
I'll have to see it… I mean, listen to it.

422
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,375
Why didn't you tell me
your son loves Schumann?

423
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,875
He's so charming.

424
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:17,041
I'm going to the restroom.
Can you order more champagne?

425
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,291
Of course, my love.

426
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,333
Are you making eyes at my wife?

427
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:27,791
Seriously, Dad?

428
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,958
You've been making passes
at her all afternoon.

429
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,500
I'm just being polite.

430
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:33,875
You're flirting!

431
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,458
Maybe you misinterpreted
something I did or--

432
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:37,750
Look me in the eye.

433
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:39,416
Is she attractive?

434
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,500
-That's irrelevant.
-Yes or no, Rafael?

435
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,750
Well, I think she's… pretty.

436
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,458
Would you make love to my wife?

437
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,875
I'm your father.
I'll know if you're lying.

438
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,916
If the situation were… different

439
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,125
and you didn't have
a formal relationship with her…

440
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:05,916
It's flattering that a young man like you
wants to butter my wife's bun.

441
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:07,833
You realize that, right?

442
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,583
See how confusing life can be sometimes?

443
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,541
Paradoxical.

444
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:14,458
For example,

445
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,958
I'd look like a good dad
if I wanted to work with my son, but…

446
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:23,250
if that job were a robbery,
some prude would probably be against it.

447
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,333
I'll never steal with you, Dad!

448
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,666
-I'm an engineer.
-I know.

449
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,125
An electronic engineer.

450
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:36,000
With a graduate degree in cybersecurity.

451
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,125
From MIT in Massachusetts.

452
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:41,833
I paid for it.

453
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,416
Why do you think I did that?

454
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,708
You…

455
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,125
You are…

456
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,250
despicable…

457
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,250
and selfish.

458
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,500
Do you want a dull life
defined by schedules, meetings, emails?

459
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:08,250
An endless rat race
that uses up all your energy?

460
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:11,750
Where one month of vacation a year
gives you only a glimpse of freedom?

461
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,708
You'll get your glimpse of freedom
when you go to jail!

462
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,208
At my job,
you don't go to prison or get killed.

463
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:24,166
Death is a word that, a priori,
refers to everything that doesn't exist.

464
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:29,125
And, once you're dead,
you won't remember you were alive.

465
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,875
So that's why you wanted to meet, is it?

466
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,166
That's why? And you say you love me?

467
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,958
You don't love me.
You don't care if I die.

468
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:40,291
I don't want you to die
before you've lived!

469
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,666
I'm giving you…

470
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:49,500
a path to freedom.

471
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,000
We thieves are the real liberators.

472
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,916
And if we ever have to pay
for what we've done…

473
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:01,541
then so be it.

474
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,041
Madrid isn't the Bermuda Triangle.

475
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:20,000
We can't make
an 11-ton helicopter disappear.

476
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:23,833
They'll be watching Marseille
with their radars, satellites,

477
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,750
even NATO's ballistic missile defense.

478
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,291
So, as soon as Marseille drops Lisbon…

479
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:31,875
he won't stand a chance.

480
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,666
The helicopter is descending!

481
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,750
-In what area?
-In the countryside.

482
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,791
In Guadalajara.
It looks like a cattle farm.

483
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,833
-It's landing!
-Launching.

484
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,666
The coordinates, fast.

485
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,541
Forty degrees,
33 minutes, 47 seconds, north.

486
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:52,333
Three degrees,
12 minutes, 34 seconds, west.

487
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:35,250
To get your lady out of trouble,
you put Marseille in a tight spot.

488
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:39,875
That'd be the case, Benjamín, except…

489
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,125
our magic trick continues.

490
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:43,333
Police!

491
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:44,750
Hold your positions!

492
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,208
Two to the helicopter, quick!

493
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,875
On the ground!

494
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:52,083
I'm the farm owner!

495
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,833
Get down! I said get down!
Hands on your head!

496
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,666
On the ground, now!

497
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,250
Clear!

498
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:07,375
-Clear!
-Clear!

499
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:13,541
No guilty party would ever claim damages

500
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,916
in such an angry, obsessive…

501
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,958
They killed my lambs.

502
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:19,333
Shut up!

503
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,250
…and annoying way.

504
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,208
Stand up!

505
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,541
Who will pay for the lambs
your colleague killed? Who?

506
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,583
He's not one of us. Shut up!

507
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:30,250
-Who the fuck is that?
-He sounds like a victim.

508
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,291
He landed on my flock
at insane speeds. He's nuts!

509
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:37,500
-Was there just one man?
-In the helicopter? Yes, just one.

510
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,958
In the car…

511
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:42,625
Boris, how many people were in the car?
Two, right?

512
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:46,625
No, just one. They both left,
but there was only one man waiting.

513
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,791
Vehicle model?

514
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,375
It was like… a funeral car.

515
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:54,083
At that point,
they'll only have one clue. The red Volvo.

516
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:59,375
The cameras at the National Court
will record it when we get Lisbon out.

517
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,416
And that is precisely
what you'll tell them.

518
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,000
Ask him if it was
a red Volvo from the '90s.

519
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:09,916
Was it a Volvo?

520
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,625
A red station wagon.
I don't know the make.

521
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,416
Volvo, yes.
They drove in the direction of Albolleque.

522
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,208
This will be the peak of our magic trick,

523
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,916
because from then on…

524
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,250
everything will change.

525
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,208
We've got them. It's them!

526
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:29,708
Calling all units,

527
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:34,250
the suspects are in a Volvo Polar 240,
plate number 15318 Victor, Charlie, Mike.

528
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,666
Captain.

529
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,958
Yes, Colonel?

530
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,416
-Take the same route. And hurry.
-Copy.

531
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,166
Miranda, you stay here.
Everyone, we're leaving now!

532
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,250
Open communication.

533
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,833
Squad, situation report.

534
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,166
The vehicle is 1.2 miles away.

535
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,625
We have to stop that car.

536
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,708
Attention, suspect vehicle
approaching at one mile.

537
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,125
Come on!

538
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,416
Suspect vehicle approaching at 0.6 miles.

539
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,458
Listen up. It's the Professor.

540
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:43,541
He might come out with a smoke bomb.
He's Houdini.

541
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:51,083
Vehicle approaching
very quickly at 0.3 miles.

542
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:55,916
We have visual. Ready to fire.

543
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:01,458
Stop the car! Stop the fucking car!

544
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,000
Shoot the fucking wheels!

545
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,416
Fire!

546
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,083
Get out of the car!

547
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,250
Get out of the car!

548
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,500
Get out of the fucking car!

549
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,125
Get out of the car!

550
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,166
There's a bomb!

551
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,500
On the ground!

552
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,000
What's going on?

553
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,125
They've got my wife!

554
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,125
-Is it the Professor?
-We were kidnapped

555
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,166
when we left the hairdresser.

556
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,875
A woman was kidnapped
as she left the hairdresser.

557
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:42,208
We should file a report
or the lambs won't be covered.

558
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:45,416
Shut the fuck up. And get back to work.

559
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,041
And then, pretending we're going back
to work on the farm…

560
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,583
Come on, let's feed the cattle.

561
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:55,625
…we'll flee.

562
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,083
We've been duped, Colonel.

563
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,708
MUSEUM OF GOLD

564
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,750
Why aren't we melting all this gold?

565
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,583
This gold was already stolen once.
It can't be stolen twice.

566
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:00,750
This gold belongs to the Quimbayas,
the Incas, the Quechuas…

567
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,875
If anything,
we should give it back to them.

568
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:05,125
It's a treasure.

569
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,958
I wouldn't call it a treasure.

570
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,833
My two-year-old son
could make this statue if he wanted to.

571
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,333
-Just saying.
-Let's go.

572
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:24,833
Lisbon to Professor.

573
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:25,750
Hurry up…

574
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,000
or they'll stress out.

575
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,833
Check-up call for the Professor.

576
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,458
Professor speaking.

577
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:47,791
Hello, Sergio.

578
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,833
The Paris Plan was a success.

579
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:52,791
We're launching the Rome Plan.

580
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,625
We'll start extraction in one hour.

581
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,208
There will be no extraction.

582
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,750
This may be the last time
I speak to any of you.

583
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,208
They know about the stormwater tank.

584
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:15,875
What if someone finds out
about the stormwater tank?

585
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,083
That'd be the end.

586
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,458
Hi, Lisbon.

587
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,791
Hi, Tokyo, Helsinki…

588
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,916
Well, hi,

589
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,166
to all the cities you'll remember
but never be able to visit again.

590
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,291
Who's that?

591
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,500
Inspector Sierra.

592
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,458
-She's leading the investigation.
-Something like that.

593
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:39,750
How are you, Raquel?

594
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:42,458
You're on an emotional roller coaster,
aren't you?

595
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:46,041
First… you were detained in the tent.

596
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:49,208
Then, you flew around
like a little, free bird.

597
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,125
And suddenly, boom!

598
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:53,875
Everything's over.

599
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,666
But we both knew
this came with a price tag.

600
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,208
Okay then.

601
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,458
Now it's time to pay.

602
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:04,208
The price could be really high, Dad.

603
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,958
Because when it's time to pay,
you won't be here,

604
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,916
in a luxury restaurant, eating lobster.

605
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:15,000
You'll be in a police van. And your life,
everything you've built, will just…

606
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,750
disappear.

607
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,750
Or worse, you'll be in the middle
of a puddle of blood, dead…

608
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,791
like my grandfather.

609
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:33,125
The things that matter most
in life are expensive.

610
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,708
Rebellion.

611
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,125
Freedom.

612
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,166
Ideals.

613
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,708
Any last words, Professor?

614
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,666
I'm sorry, Raquel.

615
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,083
I'm so sorry, Rio.

616
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,666
I'm sorry, Palermo.

617
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:23,666
I'm so sorry, Helsinki.

618
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:29,916
I'm sorry, Manila.

619
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,791
I'm sorry, Bogotá.

620
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,958
I'm so sorry, Stockholm.

621
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,750
I'm sorry, Denver.

622
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,666
I'm so sorry, Tokyo.

623
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,791
-I'm so sorry.
-That's enough.

624
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,541
That's enough.

625
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,208
Professor…

626
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,458
don't cry on me.

627
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,958
There are no big battles
without big opponents.

628
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:16,625
And well, guys,
I'd love to do therapy with you for hours

629
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:22,041
and comment on your best plays,
like the ferret in the sewer.

630
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:26,583
Hilarious. But we have
a lot to talk about here.

631
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:29,041
Okay? Over and out, sweeties.

632
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:52,666
There's got to be a plan B…
The Professor always has a plan B.

633
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,000
Not this time.

634
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,666
There's no plan B.

635
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,625
Is he that self-centered? He has a plan
for everything except if he fails?

636
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,500
-I can't believe it.
-What would you suggest?

637
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,666
There's only one way to get the gold out.

638
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,125
There's no plan B
because only plan A is viable.

639
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:19,791
We may be trapped…

640
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,833
but we aren't dead yet.

641
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,458
The army!

642
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,458
Soldiers.

643
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,083
A lot of soldiers.

644
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:44,791
This is when you hit a wall

645
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,166
at 90 miles per hour.

646
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,750
It's the end of the road.

647
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:03,250
It happens to us all
at some point in our lives.

648
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:09,708
One day your brother
is diagnosed with a terminal illness.

649
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:20,208
One day you realize
that you won't ever see your child again.

650
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,250
That you won't ever
see your friends again.

651
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,125
Or the lover you never had.

652
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:37,583
Dad.

653
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,541
And that all you have left
is your father's last embrace.

654
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:52,166
Another day,
you leave a bank with your boyfriend

655
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,500
and a shot ends it all
in a matter of seconds.

656
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:57,708
That your family…

657
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:01,791
won't ever get together again.

658
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:05,416
That everything we lived through,
dressed in red,

659
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,750
ended here.

660
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,541
This was the end of our journey together.

661
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,291
