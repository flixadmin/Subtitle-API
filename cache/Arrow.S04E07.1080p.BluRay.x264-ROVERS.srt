1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,446
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,887
<i>Doctor Palmer
got miniaturization to work.</i>

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,246
FELICITYI Do it!

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,086
I'm not dead.

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,562
This is Delta two-three-seven
en route to Star City Bank.

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,728
We are under attack
and need immediate assistance.

7
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,767
The Ghosts. They're back to
knocking over armored cars.

8
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,763
Yeah, it's just like old times.

9
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,844
- There are guards in the back.
- All right, we'll get them.

10
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,121
Go!

11
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,324
They burnt all the money.

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,967
They didn't need it.

13
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,964
The federal government sent this
to prop up Star City Bank.

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,648
HIVE just wanted to make sure
that didn't happen.

15
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,167
I've heard of having money to burn,

16
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,442
but stealing money to burn, that's new.

17
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,841
Darhk's not kidding.
He really wants this city to die.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,402
Yeah, but why? I mean, what does
HIVE have to gain from any of this?

19
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,811
A base of operations.

20
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,324
They have to be able to
operate out of somewhere.

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,130
What better spot than a dead city?

22
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,805
With almost a dead police department.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,047
Any luck from that tooth

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,565
we got off the HIVE member
that we took down?

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,643
Only that the deterioration
of the DNA markers

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,968
was most definitely not natural.

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,122
Which means it was caused by what?

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,442
Curtis and I have been trying to
figure that out for the past month.

29
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,687
Maybe Ray will have better luck.

30
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,126
I will ask.

31
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,726
Hey, you got a sec?

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,207
Yeah.

33
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,528
- Where'd you get this?
- I got that from Lance.

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,484
Who got it from Damien Darhk.

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,041
- John, this...
- Ls pretty definitive evidence

36
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,210
that HIVE had Andy killed

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,204
because his criminal operations
conflicted with theirs.

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,364
That doesn't track at all
with what you've told me about Andy.

39
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,444
Oliver, that doesn't track
with what I knew about Andy.

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,002
But I guess I really
never knew him at all.

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,525
- There's got to be some explanation.
- Oliver...

42
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,801
- Maybe he was undercover.
- No, man.

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,088
Listen, it's all right there.
The facts are the facts.

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,607
All I'm saying, Andy was your brother,

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,603
and he deserves the benefit of the doubt.

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,411
Trust me, things aren't always
what they seem.

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,721
Yeah. Yeah.

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,444
Reiter's not gonna like this.

49
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,046
Not one bit.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,127
Vlad was a good worker.
And they listened to him.

51
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,806
I didn't have a choice.
He was gonna kill me.

52
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,645
Doesn't sound like something he'd do.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,929
Maybe... Maybe he didn't
have a choice either.

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,722
Maybe someone put him up to it.

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,331
Maybe it was revenge.

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,246
Revenge for what?

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,686
For Taiana.

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,168
That drug-stealing bitch you choked out?

59
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,805
Vlad was her brother.

60
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,607
Ah!

61
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,569
Thank you for coming by
on such short notice.

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,609
Oh. Happy to have something to do.

63
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,129
To be honest,
I'm feeling at a bit of a loss

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,685
of what to do with my newfound freedom.

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,887
And height.

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,326
Is everything always this big?

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,323
If you're looking for something to do,
why not try,

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,768
I don't know, declare yourself undead,
try getting your company back?

69
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,602
You said you had something
that you needed help on?

70
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,001
- Don't change the subject.
- I'm not.

71
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,481
I'm a recently undead billionaire CEO.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,801
My time is at a premium.

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,406
What can I do for you?

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,241
Thanks. I was wondering
where my tooth went.

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,164
John pulled this off of a Ghost.

76
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,288
It's their cyanide retirement plan.

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,606
We tried pulling DNA off it, but...

78
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,286
But half of the genetic markers
are missing. That's impossible.

79
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,804
You mean like a guy who can shrink to
the size of a French fry impossible?

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,967
Do you have any equipment?
I'm fresh out of chromatographs.

81
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,327
Take that.

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,805
Can we circle back to why
you won't come back to Palmer Tech?

83
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,803
Your return is exactly
what our stock price needs, and...

84
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,200
That's incredible.

85
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,370
The genetic code has been
selectively degraded.

86
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,329
We know. We think it's to
scramble their DNA markers

87
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,323
so they can't be lD'd. But how?

88
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,807
Looks like it was done
with a synthetic compound.

89
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,610
Like a chemical CRISPR/Cas9.

90
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,010
Lastrapium trioxide.

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,003
Wolfman Biologics has a patent on it.

92
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,401
Thank you.

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,683
Okay, tomorrow night,
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association Gala.

94
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,205
It's black tie, so you need a tux.

95
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,811
Which one? He's got, like, 50.

96
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,166
Uh...

97
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,408
Maybe back in the day. I don't have a tux.

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,369
Get a rental. it doesn't really matter.

99
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,205
Every mayor in the history of Star City
has attended the PBA.

100
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,362
I secured a spot for you
on the dais with the brass.

101
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,249
We need to make sure
that your keynote is on point.

102
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,882
Which means we need to find a way to say
that the police need our help without...

103
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,048
- Throwing them under the bus.
- Right.

104
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,525
I thought you failed civics class?

105
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,365
A D-minus, thank you.

106
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,727
Alex has a way of making this interesting.

107
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,404
Sorry, wrong number. What were we saying?

108
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,881
Uh... Moving on to Oliver's platform.

109
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,841
I got your e-mail about
cleaning up Star City Bay.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,570
- Yes.
- Yeah, it's, you know,

111
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,404
with everything
this city's facing right now,

112
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,971
a hippie-crunchy program...

113
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,602
A hippie-crunchy program
that will add hundreds ofjobs,

114
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,171
help gentrify
the surrounding neighborhoods,

115
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,651
and encourage outside investment.

116
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,882
And put voters to sleep.

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,684
We need to focus on crime and jobs.

118
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,729
Which this program will address.

119
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,246
Hey, I will put out
a press release tomorrow.

120
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,925
- I got to take this.
- Okay.

121
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,005
I think your brother is onto us.

122
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,285
No. No, and even if he was,
it's not like he's the boss of me.

123
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,248
- No, he's the boss of me.
- I know.

124
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,004
I'm really glad
your brother's not a killer.

125
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,003
- Oh.
- Speedy. Speedy.

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,207
Uh...

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,287
Thea. Sorry, it's a nickname.
We have to go.

128
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,606
Felicity called about the thing.
The dental problem.

129
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,410
Uh, yes, yeah.

130
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,327
Sorry, um, our friend has
this tooth issue. Yeah.

131
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,720
Good work.

132
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,006
On site.

133
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,806
We're clear for entry.

134
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,451
All right, Felicity, what's next?

135
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,090
We need a sample of the chemical.

136
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,607
<i>With it, Ray can unscramble
the DNA markers</i>

137
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,286
<i>and we can have a shot at
lD'ing some of our Ghosts.</i>

138
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,851
Where do we find this thing?

139
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,800
According to their
recently hacked computers,

140
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,281
second floor, northwest corner.
It's a yellow liquid.

141
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,609
Incoming. Four Ghosts. North entrance.

142
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,691
I'm on it.

143
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,731
Felicity, we're in.

144
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,366
<i>Looking for the compound.</i>

145
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,560
Got it.

146
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,130
<i>Green Arrow
and Speedy need assistance.</i>

147
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,521
- Thanks.
- You should go. Get out of here.

148
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,526
- What about you?
- I've got this. Go.

149
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,921
Felicity, I'm going for an ID
on the Ghost that shot at us.

150
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,206
<i>Stand by.</i>

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,047
Andy?

152
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,525
Well, even death's not permanent anymore.
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,081
No, no, it's okay.
Nothing seems to make sense anymore.

154
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,047
Andy... I can't believe this.

155
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,049
It's obvious that HIVE faked his death.

156
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,969
- Maybe it was part of his recruitment.
- You saw the file.

157
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,561
You saw what kind of man my brother was,
what kind of man he is.

158
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,769
We don't know anything.
Not until we hear it directly from Andy.

159
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,331
And how are we supposed to do that?

160
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,641
We get him out of HIVE.

161
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,082
Oliver, how can you still be giving him
the benefit of the doubt?

162
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,685
Because he's your family.

163
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,087
You said he was a good man,
maybe a part of him still is.

164
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,366
- I don't know.
- I do.

165
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,490
Last month, at the lumber yard, a Ghost
had a chance to kill you, but didn't.

166
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,206
I remember thinking how weird that was.
Unless that Ghost was Andy.

167
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,691
So, what, he had a chance to kill me
and he didn't,

168
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,001
so I'm just supposed to
forget he's a killer?

169
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,811
No, but you should still remember
he's your brother.

170
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,850
I can't square that circle, Thea.

171
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,481
That HIVE member was
nothing like my brother.

172
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,610
The man who was my brother's dead.
He's dead.

173
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,804
- What brother?
- The brother of the prisoner

174
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,121
that stole the drugs.

175
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,408
But only because he put him up to it.

176
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,166
You're crazy. That prisoner attacked you
'cause what you did to his sister.

177
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,367
That's a lie.

178
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,205
It's a hell of a lot more believable
than me putting him up to attacking you.

179
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,407
You know what? You have had it in for me

180
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,403
- ever since you found that knapsack.
- Enough.

181
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,922
I have a means of divining the truth.

182
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,769
Why did you kill that prisoner?

183
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,801
Because he attacked me.

184
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,647
Oh, come on, man.

185
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,962
This isn't the place for
your hocus-pocus crap.

186
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,722
Did you have that prisoner
attack Mr. Queen?

187
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,006
Hell no.

188
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,847
You're lying.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,525
According to what? A bunch of twigs?

190
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,128
No, Reiter, don't do this.
You got to hear me out.

191
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,682
It's him. He's the problem.
He's the problem! Hey!

192
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,171
What are you gonna do to him?

193
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,560
Nothing.

194
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,326
I believe the wronged
should make things right.

195
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,365
So, you wanted to see me?

196
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,251
So polite. That's a bit atypical.

197
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,165
Well, a guy gets slapped down
enough times, he learns who's boss.

198
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,200
Apparently not.

199
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,971
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

200
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,410
After our meeting last week,
I had an unpleasant encounter

201
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,688
with the Green Arrow and his compatriots.

202
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,605
My security personnel
are under the opinion

203
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,845
that you called that meeting so as to
create an opportunity to have me followed.

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,890
So your security guys don't trust me,
but what about you?

205
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,606
Trust is an orchid.

206
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,683
Beautiful but delicate.

207
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,443
Requiring ideal conditions
in order to thrive.

208
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,525
Without those conditions, it dies.

209
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,086
Tread carefully, Quentin.

210
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,410
Believe it or not,
the death of your daughter

211
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,365
is not the most terrible thing
that I can threaten you with.

212
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,969
I don't want to talk to you.

213
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,970
<i>Then why are
you answering the phone?</i>

214
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,610
Because I...

215
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,005
I would have told you I was stopping by,
but you weren't taking my calls.

216
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,241
What do you want?

217
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,447
To help you.

218
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,203
Those men you killed in Nanda Parbat,

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,321
the effects of those deaths
must be wearing off by now.

220
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,567
I'm fine.

221
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,290
The bloodlust has returned, hasn't it?

222
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,966
I have it under control.

223
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,770
You can't control it, Thea.

224
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,330
Who's Lawrence Tanner?

225
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,961
A pedophile.

226
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,401
Multiple accusations, no convictions.

227
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,091
<i>Lives three blocks down.</i>

228
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,890
The world needs one less pedophile,

229
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,321
and you need at least a month of peace.

230
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,967
Look, I'm gonna go out. Okay?

231
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,281
And when I come home,

232
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,001
you better not still be here,
or I am calling the police.

233
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,886
Hey-

234
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,924
Alex hired a security detail,
if you want to sit this one out.

235
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,411
Yeah, I'm gonna be at the bar.

236
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,008
Well, this has to be a better way
than how you usually spend your evenings.

237
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,288
Dressing in leather and tying people up.

238
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,850
There he is.

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,650
They're waiting for you on the dais.

240
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,281
Ready for this?

241
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,371
About to find out.

242
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,801
<i>Evening.</i>

243
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,887
<i>It is our great privilege</i>

244
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,931
<i>to be here tonight
to honor the Star City Police Department.</i>

245
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,970
<i>These are a group of men and women</i>

246
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,010
<i>who risk their lives for us
on a daily basis.</i>

247
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,685
<i>Never been an easy job.</i>

248
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,649
<i>And it has certainly
never been more difficult</i>

249
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,689
<i>than it is right now in our city.</i>

250
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,202
<i>These are the people
that keep our streets safe,</i>

251
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,086
<i>who watch over us.</i>

252
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,766
<i>They protect us.</i>

253
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,609
<i>For that, I'm grateful,
and so is the rest of Star City.</i>

254
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,041
Not bad.

255
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,521
Not quite as powerful
as the Green Arrow's, but not bad.

256
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,160
Yeah? Maybe I should get him
to endorse me.

257
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,208
I need a favor from you.

258
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,568
Relocation of
one of Darhk's foot soldiers.

259
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,841
Could be a little difficult.

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,047
Darhk called me
into his office this morning

261
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,804
for a little chat about
how he doesn't trust me anymore.

262
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,962
Wait, wait, wait. Are you in danger?

263
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,606
I hope not.

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,685
But listen, when I was there,
I saw something on his desk.

265
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,366
Something about Slip 52 down at the docks.

266
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,324
Now, if the Ghosts are there,

267
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,045
maybe the one you're looking for
will be there too.

268
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,884
- Okay. Thank you.
- All right.

269
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,483
Hey, honey. How are you?

270
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,044
- Here you go, miss.
- Thank you.

271
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,560
Club soda?

272
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,761
Yeah, it has to be.

273
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,446
Can't have the candidate's bodyguard
getting hammered.

274
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,361
Do you want to talk about it?

275
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,328
Resurrected siblings are
kind of in my wheelhouse.

276
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,924
This ain't quite the same thing, Laurel.

277
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,247
Sara wasn't really a...

278
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,483
A member of an organization of killers?

279
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,925
I'm sure there are a million things
going through your head right now.

280
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,401
All I'm saying is, make one of them

281
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,922
an appreciation for the fact
that your brother is actually alive.

282
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,286
Well, why?

283
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,527
Why, so I can hold out some kind of
false hope that he might be decent?

284
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,920
He doesn't deserve that.

285
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,764
No, he probably doesn't, but you do.

286
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,647
<i>After Andy died, a part of you died, too.</i>

287
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,929
And now, now is your chance to heal.

288
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,690
How am I supposed to do that?

289
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,251
I had to look my nephew in the eye

290
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,645
and tell him that

291
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,168
he was never gonna see his daddy again.

292
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,284
And the months after Andy died
were the darkest times in my life.

293
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,407
I would've given anything,
anything to get Andy back.

294
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,885
I would've sacrificed my life

295
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,127
to have him back
with his wife and his son.

296
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,482
I would've traded my life for a stranger.

297
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,800
- Mr. Queen, it's so nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

298
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,480
Do you think you can get
more funding for the SCPD?

299
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,165
Well, that's certainly a top priority.

300
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,685
- That's great news. Thank you.
- Sure.

301
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,008
Mr. Queen. Huge fan.

302
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,484
Thank you, Mr...

303
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,005
Darhk.

304
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,686
I have some ideas on
how I might contribute to your campaign.

305
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,330
- Do you have a minute?
- Of course.

306
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,680
Well, it's not just about
financial support.

307
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,170
I have strong relations
in the business circles.

308
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,401
Media outlets as well.

309
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,927
This is all well and good,
but I am running unopposed.

310
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,488
So I don't totally understand
how you could help me win.

311
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,846
Oh, it's not about winning.

312
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,970
It's about how much we could accomplish
if we worked together.

313
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,201
Right.

314
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,885
And not to be indelicate, but

315
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,805
a lot has changed in Star City
since your parents held sway here.

316
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,405
The levers of power have changed.

317
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,689
And not understanding that is
what doomed Jessica Danforth's bid.

318
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,327
Hmm.

319
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,601
What do you want, Mr. Darhk?

320
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,808
I read the press release
about your new project.

321
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,088
"The restoration of Starling Bay."

322
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,891
Reconsider your plans.
Leave the Bay as it is.

323
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,767
What if I refuse?

324
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,844
Well, then you'll no longer be unopposed.

325
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,411
Mr. Queen.

326
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,041
Mr. Darhk.

327
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,330
Leaving to fight Ra's on a mountaintop,

328
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,209
going undercover
with the League of Assassins,

329
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,646
dating the Huntress...

330
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,131
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

331
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,170
I'm just listing all of the terrible ideas
you've had over the past three years,

332
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,085
of which throwing in with Damien Darhk
has got to be the worst.

333
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,447
I'm not throwing in with Damien Darhk.

334
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,602
I am using him to get at HIVE.

335
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,205
Isn't Lance already our man on the inside?

336
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,569
Lance has lost Darhk's trust,
making this the only way...

337
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,966
To get yourself killed.

338
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,805
You remember the last time

339
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,281
you tried to take down
an evil organization from the inside?

340
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,566
- This is different.
- Why?

341
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,085
Because you'd be doing it as Oliver Queen?

342
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,287
Yep.

343
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,005
What about your mayoral campaign?

344
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,970
You cannot be an effective candidate
for mayor and Darhk's undercover stooge.

345
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,043
Taking
down Darhk is more important.

346
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,363
Especially now that we know
that he has Andy under his thumb.

347
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,967
First, there's a whole long list of things
that we don't know about Andy.

348
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,164
Second, you didn't decide
to run for mayor to take down Darhk.

349
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,608
You did it to give this city something
that the Green Arrow can't give them.

350
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,123
Hope. Inspiration.

351
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,281
Don't lose sight of that.

352
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,081
Not even for John.

353
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,769
This man betrayed us.

354
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,641
He sent an innocent man,
a useful man, to his grave.

355
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,964
He conspired against me, you,
all of his brothers.

356
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,451
Baron, please.

357
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,489
His punishment won't come from me,

358
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,642
but from the one he sought to hurt.

359
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,051
<i>Oliver, please.</i>

360
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,326
Don't do this.

361
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,526
I'm begging you.

362
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,891
Come on, Queen.

363
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,171
Please! Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

364
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,005
Please, don't do this.

365
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,320
Harder.

366
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,727
So, I'm sorry.

367
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,202
Your friend was reunited
with his brother after eight years?

368
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,169
It's crazy, right?

369
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,481
Yeah, crazy.

370
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,487
So have you given him your crown yet?

371
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,920
I mean, you held the record with
five years thinking Oliver was dead, so...

372
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,127
Ah.

373
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,010
I can't imagine how tough
it must have been for you, Thea.

374
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,208
I'm sorry.

375
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,411
- You know, I should probably take this.
- Okay.

376
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,971
This is Alex. Sorry.

377
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,681
Yeah, what's up?

378
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,288
Hi, there. What're you drinking?

379
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,207
Maybe I can buy you another.

380
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,727
I don't think my date
would like that very much.

381
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,405
Well, I don't see him here.

382
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,444
You look like the kind of girl
where "no" means "yes."

383
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,761
Come on, baby.

384
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,326
Thea! Stop! What the hell are you doing?

385
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,046
Can't do it?

386
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,329
I can't believe that Andy's back.

387
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,444
How am I supposed to tell Carly?

388
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,250
She has a right to know, Johnnie.

389
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,805
She's better off thinking he's dead.

390
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,650
I'm not sure that's your call to make.

391
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,370
I'm not sure about anything.

392
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,608
You know, when I first found out
about the Flash,

393
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,727
and Lazarus Pit, and what it did for Thea,

394
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,962
I began to daydream about Andy being back.

395
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,651
I would just play with that idea,

396
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,125
"My brother's back."

397
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,805
I never thought it would actually happen.

398
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,567
I know.

399
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,846
I'll get it.

400
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,207
Hi, Lyla.

401
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,527
Hi, Oliver.

402
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,444
- May I come in?
- Sure.

403
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,651
- I'll give you two a minute.
- Okay.

404
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,846
How are you holding up?

405
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,609
Uh, I guess as good
as can be expected, right?

406
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,205
Nothing really to compare this to.

407
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,286
At least not this week.

408
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,288
- Lance has some intel for us.
- Mmm.

409
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,646
Slip 52 at the docks.

410
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,847
Felicity checked it out,

411
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,048
and that whole area has been
shut down for the entire night.

412
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,611
You think the Ghosts have
something planned there?

413
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,165
And maybe your brother.

414
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,524
Every time we face the Ghosts,
it's Russian roulette.

415
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,250
I'm not risking any of you for Andy.

416
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,845
You're not. We're offering.

417
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,482
Okay. But just us.

418
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,604
Thea and Laurel sit this one out.

419
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,770
_OkaY-_OkaY-

420
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,570
Gentlemen, you've all
come here from different walks.

421
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,086
Different paths.

422
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,047
But all burdened with the same knowledge,

423
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,007
that this world is diseased.

424
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,729
Fortunately, there is a cure
for this pestilence.

425
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,891
That cure, gentlemen, is HIVE.

426
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,323
Those little yellow pills you swallowed,

427
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,448
they do a few interesting things,

428
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,604
including making you cooperative.

429
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,323
Now I understand you all volunteered,
and that's just swell,

430
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,571
but I think we can all agree
that in any chain of command,

431
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,889
there can never be too much compliance.

432
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,770
Perhaps a demonstration.

433
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,081
KneeL

434
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,487
The people of this city,
well, what's left of them, at any rate,

435
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,644
they call you "Ghosts."

436
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,690
They have no idea how right they are.

437
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,481
<i>Up</i> there!

438
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,121
Kill the green one.

439
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,323
This isn't on you, John. It was my call.

440
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,330
And I never should have let you make it.

441
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,321
Felicity, can you give us a second?

442
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,686
No, I think I should stay.

443
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,049
But I just remembered I got that thing
in the whatever with the what's it.

444
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,530
Oliver, let this go, man.

445
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,126
I have.

446
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,209
And you almost got yourself killed.

447
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,204
I've been a lot closer to "almost killed."

448
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,521
Andy made his choice.

449
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,131
You don't know that.

450
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,171
John, you saw what was going on tonight.

451
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,800
Those men were under
the influence of something.

452
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,928
Whatever pill is scrambling their DNA

453
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,606
is also making them susceptible
to Darhk's suggestion.

454
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,649
<i>All right. Just because you have
a blind spot for your family,</i>

455
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,961
don't expect me to as well.

456
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,043
- That's not what this is about.
- The hell it's not.

457
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,927
Family is exactly what this is about.

458
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,962
Criminal or not,
under the influence or not,

459
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,970
Andy let his son and his wife
believe he was dead,

460
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,241
for eight years, Oliver.

461
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,890
Eight years!

462
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,203
And there's no excuse for that!

463
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,481
- None.
- John, I'm... You don't know.

464
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,721
Oliver, you don't know.

465
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,081
You have this inexplicable way of

466
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,605
excusing everything
just because it's family.

467
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,926
Oh, it's not "inexplicable."

468
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,242
I'm asking you...

469
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,485
I'm asking you to hold out hope for Andy
because I need that hope.

470
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,610
I need to believe that
no matter what happens in our lives,

471
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,411
no matter how much darkness infects us,

472
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,450
I need to believe
that we can come back from that!

473
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,604
<i>And it was exactly that thinking
that led you to the League last year.</i>

474
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,283
Doesn't seem like
you learned much from that.

475
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,727
Felicity told you.

476
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,370
Getting in bed with Darhk, Oliver,

477
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,363
I don't see how you can even consider it.

478
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,723
We are gonna take this guy down.

479
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,763
And no idea is off the table.

480
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,088
Look, you're doing things
differently, Oliver.

481
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,730
Fighting Darhk from the inside
is just fighting Darhk in the shadows.

482
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,366
You want to do things differently?

483
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,443
You want ideas? Fine.

484
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,371
Let's take this son of a bitch down
in the light of day.

485
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,487
Hey-

486
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,121
Just in time.

487
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,206
For what?

488
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,600
Roasted lizard with a little bit of
coriander and sea salt.

489
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,007
I've gotten better at removing the skin
with a sharp rock.

490
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,805
I ate already.

491
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,240
Thank you.

492
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,166
<i>Are you all right?</i>

493
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,880
Had a hard day.

494
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,282
Taiana, I have to...

495
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,202
I have to tell you something
about your brother.

496
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,327
Vlad?

497
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,205
Is he all right?

498
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,521
No.

499
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,486
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,971
What do you mean?

501
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,604
- Is he...
- Taiana, I'm very sorry.

502
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,720
_H€Y-_H€Y-

503
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,643
Sorry, I had Curtis grab some more toys
so I could keep working on your tooth.

504
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,930
That's okay. I don't think
we're gonna be using that

505
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,686
table for eating tonight, anyway.

506
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,642
Oliver and John are busy fighting over
John's not-so-dead-after-all brother.

507
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,246
Do I even want to ask?

508
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,331
Let's just say you no longer
corner the market

509
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,806
on not being as dead as people think.

510
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,725
Though in John's brother's case,
he does have a pretty good excuse.

511
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,566
Unlike some people. Have you seen anyone?

512
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,449
Of course not, I've been busy here
working on your tooth.

513
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,647
<i>You're stalling.</i>

514
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,531
Ray, when you come back from the dead,
you're supposed to start living again.

515
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,881
What's going on?

516
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,483
I've been catching up
on the past six months.

517
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,041
My company, my city, my life.

518
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,926
And I feel like Tom Sawyer
watching his own funeral.

519
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,809
Except in my case, nobody really cares.

520
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,405
That is not true, Ray.

521
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,881
Renaming Starling "Star City" is nice.

522
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,725
But then, take a look
at what's happened to the place.

523
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,720
And my company, this thing I built
that was supposed to outlast me,

524
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,325
is now on life support.

525
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,602
Because it needs you.

526
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,001
To do what?

527
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,442
The same thing I was doing
before I "died"?

528
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,284
Obviously, that didn't amount to anything.

529
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,965
Self-pity is not a good look on you.

530
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,690
Yeah. I don't think it's self-pity.

531
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,683
I think it's self-reflection.

532
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,763
If I'm gonna come back to life,

533
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,762
I have to figure out
what it is that I'm living for.

534
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,601
Okay.

535
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,771
I played around with your bicuspid a bit.

536
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,965
The compound definitely broke down
the residual DNA on the tooth.

537
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,891
It's pretty inventive, actually.

538
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,205
Is there any way to reconstitute the DNA,
so we have a shot at lD'ing these guys?

539
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,921
No. Once the alleles are decomposed,
they're gone for good.

540
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,684
- Yeah.
- So, since that was a dead end,

541
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,366
I took another look at the polymer
the fake tooth was made of.

542
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,531
Uh... I found
faint traces of sodium fluoride.

543
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,727
Like, from water?

544
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,564
There's no way that the
concentration could be high enough

545
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,722
to leave behind any sort of residue.

546
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,086
It would if there was an unusually high

547
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,408
sodium fluoride count
in the drinking water.

548
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,282
Like, say, at a facility that was
closed down for that very reason.

549
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,088
Muller Psychiatric Center.

550
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,926
You gotta admire the irony.

551
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,529
Damien Darhk keeping his army of bad guys
in a defunct loony bin?

552
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,321
Not bad for a guy who thinks
his life didn't add up to anything.

553
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,449
Yeah. Never gonna outlive that one.

554
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,286
Everyone clear on the plan?

555
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,171
You know, I wasn't the first 80 times
we went over it,

556
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,651
but now I think I got it.

557
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,086
What's going on, GUYS?

558
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,044
Felicity found a probable location
for the Ghosts' base of operations.

559
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,249
These guys are not
gonna be easy to take out.

560
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,561
How are you feeling?

561
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,611
We're not trying to take down the Ghosts.
We don't have the manpower.

562
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,840
We're going after Andy.

563
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,530
Guys, Oliver nearly got himself killed
trying to help Andy.

564
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,841
I'm not letting you do the same.

565
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,283
I'm sorry,
but it's not really just up to you.

566
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,882
I did everything that I could
to bring my sister back,

567
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,610
and I think your brother
deserves the same.

568
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,883
No, no. That's just it.
I don't think he does.

569
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,801
I don't know what Oliver told you...

570
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,122
<i>He told them
the only two things that matter.</i>

571
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,965
Andy's under Darhk's influence,
and we need to get him out.

572
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,646
I can't let you risk your lives for
someone who does not deserve it.

573
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,280
That's your call. But we've made ours.

574
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,326
Let's move.

575
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,766
- We're on <i>site.</i>
- Uh...

576
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,247
Satellite's reading a hell of a lot
of activity for 3:00 in the morning.

577
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,721
<i>I'm guessing 50 or so Ghosts,
plus who-knows-how-many recruits.</i>

578
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,651
Wait. If the Ghosts are wearing
their usual Halloween costumes,

579
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,161
then how are we supposed to tell
which one's Andy?

580
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,084
That's what your fancy
new cameras are for.

581
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,844
A little gift from Curtis.

582
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,810
<i>The infrared lenses should
virtually unmask our Ghosty friends.</i>

583
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,007
Sick.

584
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,605
Okay. Ready?

585
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,286
I'm in position.

586
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,606
In position.

587
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,209
This isn't just a base of operations.
It looks like a staging area.

588
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,441
<i>- For what'?
- Equipment.</i>

589
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,809
Military crates marked "G-six-five."

590
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,365
<i>Does that mean anything?</i>

591
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,886
Maybe they're playing Bingo.

592
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,280
Let's assume that's not it.

593
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,204
- Deadly Bingo.
- No.

594
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,725
We need to get an ID on Andy.

595
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,326
When you do,
you wait for my signal before engaging.

596
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,964
Yeah, I might not have that option.

597
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,561
<i>Speedy?</i>

598
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,484
She's been spotted.
Third floor. Southwest building.

599
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,880
I've been spotted too.

600
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,244
Be able to get a visual on our target.

601
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,890
Waiting on confirmation.

602
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,491
That's him. You got him.
The one on your right.

603
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,409
Yeah, actually, he's got me.

604
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,604
<i>I've got him.
He looks pretty heavy, though,</i>

605
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,569
- so <i>I could</i> use a <i>hand.</i>
- I'm on <i>my</i> way.

606
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,641
It's Merida.

607
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,240
Aren't you out
a little bit past your bedtime?

608
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,402
I've seen something
of your fighting style.

609
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,842
You were trained by Ra's al Ghul.

610
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,244
Tell me, how is Malcolm doing these days?

611
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,245
It usually works.

612
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,160
Black Canary's got Andy,
but she needs help reaching the exfil.

613
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,049
- I got this!
- You sure?

614
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,361
Go!

615
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,526
It's, uh, nice of you to show up.

616
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,171
My brother needed me.

617
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,167
The green one.

618
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,725
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, all of you.

619
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,003
- Palmer, even you, thank you.
- My pleasure.

620
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,646
It feels good to do something useful.
It's been a while.

621
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,882
Does that mean
I can expect to see you at work tomorrow?

622
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,082
Ah... No.

623
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,323
I can't keep doing the same useless,
ineffective things, you know?

624
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,005
I gotta do something different.

625
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,642
I'm gonna take some time
and figure out what that is.

626
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,689
But it'll still include the occasional
super-heroics, whenever you need me.

627
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,400
Where are you going?

628
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,047
Well, I have a long overdue chat
with my brother.

629
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,690
I hope you were right.

630
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,442
Me too. You were right.

631
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,090
- About what?
- Darhk.

632
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,410
I thought about what you said,
and how to fight him.

633
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,925
- I'm gonna do it in the light of day.
- Good.

634
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,525
What did you have in mind?

635
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,206
You'll see.

636
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,209
We never should have
gotten on that damn boat.

637
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,922
Reiter's men hijacked a yacht
that we were working on.

638
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,284
I was a dive instructor.

639
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,522
<i>Vlad was a deckhand.</i>

640
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,123
They killed everyone on our charter,
and they brought us here.

641
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,450
What happened? With Vlad.

642
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,561
Conklin.

643
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,804
Taiana, wait. Wait. Listen to me.

644
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,201
- I'm going to kill him for what he did.
- Listen to me.

645
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,122
Conklin is terrible,
but he's not the problem.

646
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,482
- He's just a pawn.
- A pawn for what?

647
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,560
For Reiter's plan.

648
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,446
What is this?

649
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,161
This is a map of Lian Yu.

650
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,563
And I think that it leads to
whatever Reiter is looking for.

651
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,491
Can you follow it?

652
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,170
Not without a detailed
survey map of the island.

653
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,490
Where will we get something like that?

654
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,402
Oh. I had an idea.

655
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,523
It's a long shot, but it's worth a try.

656
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,170
To get there, I'll need your help.

657
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,525
Thank you for coming.

658
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,808
Are you sure you don't have the SCPD
waiting for me in the kitchen?

659
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,690
Don't be so paranoid.

660
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,809
You did threaten me with arrest
the last time I popped by.

661
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,043
So, did you reconsider my advice?

662
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,361
Yes.

663
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,850
But I'm still not gonna take it.

664
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,680
Look, I think I might have found

665
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,650
a different way for me
to control my bloodlust.

666
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,485
One that does not include killing people.

667
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,885
What does it include?

668
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,201
Damien Darhk.

669
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,487
Last night, we went after HIVE,
and I ran into Damien.

670
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,008
I've seen what he can do with his powers.

671
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,323
But when he tried to use them on me,

672
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,084
it completely backfired.

673
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,208
And my bloodlust was gone.

674
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,323
I mean, at least for a little while.

675
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,323
So what I want is for you

676
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,723
to help me figure out a way
to make that permanent.

677
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,764
Andy, I don't even know where to begin.

678
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,851
Andy, I need to understand.

679
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,525
Can you help me understand?

680
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,608
Is what's in this file true?

681
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,291
Andy, answer me.

682
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,927
It's true. All of it.

683
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,928
Boy, this is quite a lot of media for a...
What'd you call it?

684
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,164
- "Hippie-crunchy program."
- That's right.

685
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,925
Always happy to admit when I'm wrong.

686
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,844
- Good luck up there.
- Thank you.

687
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,165
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

688
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,366
You're fine. We're just getting started.

689
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,606
So I haven't been arrested
for battery, yet.

690
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,290
I keep thinking, you would have
killed him if I hadn't stopped you.

691
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,966
I just had a really bad night.

692
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,846
I guess I'm just asking if maybe

693
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,203
you could be a little patient with me?

694
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,120
Thank you all for coming.

695
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,206
My campaign adviser

696
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,011
doesn't think that saving the Bay
is the right fight

697
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,005
given the state the city is in.

698
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,962
But I'd like everyone to know that I'm not
blind to Star City's problems.

699
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,041
And I wouldn't be here today

700
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,891
if I wasn't confident that this program
could help solve them.

701
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,961
And the reason I chose the Bay
is because it's in the center of the city.

702
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,366
It's out in the open, for everyone to see.

703
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,803
The fight to save Star City isn't gonna be
fought in the shadows.

704
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,724
It's gonna be fought in the light of day.

705
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,730
<i>And I promise you,</i>

706
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,400
all of you,

707
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,044
that I will never stop fighting
to save this city.

708
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,441
