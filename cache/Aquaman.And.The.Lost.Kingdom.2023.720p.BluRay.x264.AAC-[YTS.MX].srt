00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,557
Please tell me
you found something.

161
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,459
Seismic array is going crazy.

162
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:30,993
Where's the epicenter?

163
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:32,962
We're standing on it.

164
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:38,671
[metal clanking]

165
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:47,405
[resounding thuds]

00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,343
- [heavy thudding]

00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,254
[rumbling continues]

168
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,822
- Run!
- [yelps]

169
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:04,191
[both panting heavily]

[yelps in pain]

175
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,138
[man] What just happened?
An earthquake?

176
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,711
No. I think it was a piece
of ice sheet breaking off.

177
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,077
[man groaning]

178

[pounding thud]

00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,915
Come on. Get up.

185
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,852
[groans]

186
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:34,887
- I think I broke my ankle!
- Come on. Let's go!

187
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:37,383
Come on, get up.
Go, we gotta go! We gotta go!

188
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:41,519
Come on, we gotta move!
Come on!

189
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,167
[steady beeping]

[screaming]

192
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:05,411
Please, please. No, no!
Help, please! Don't let go!

193
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,987
[screaming]

00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:17,159
[scream echoes, fades]

195
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,847
[Dr. Shin panting]

196
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:38,147
What the hell happened to you?

197
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:41,579
[whispering]
There's something back there.

198
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:58,165
[Dr. Shin] Astounding.

199
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:00,302
My readings show
something's down here.

200
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:03,102
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

201
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:07,439
If it is, we might be able to scavenge
the tech you need to fix your suit.

202
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:10,475
[David] How is this place
even possible?

203
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:12,093
[Dr. Shin]
This was all probably solid ice

204
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:15,218
until we started
heating the planet.

205
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:18,421
[David] Well, thank God
for global warming, am I right?

206
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:21,960
[Dr. Shin] Uh, yeah,
that's not exactly a good thing.

207
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,375
[David]
The tracks lead down there.

208
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,577
Suit up.

209
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:48,718
Wait. The tracks lead
down there, which means...

210
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:50,890
the monster's down there.

211
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:56,091
[sighs]

212
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,491
Okay. I guess
we're going down there.

213
00:13:59,962 --> 00:14:02,165
[heavy splash]

214
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:25,353
[laughs] I don't believe this.

215
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:29,795
It's a structure of some kind.

216
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:32,427
And there's more buried
in the ice.

217
00:14:32,562 --> 00:14:35,631
Here I thought we were
just going to find a ship.

218
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:39,301
- [David] Everyone, fan out and search.
- [man] Yes, sir.

219
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:42,502
We've stumbled upon
something big here, doc.

220
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:48,446
This has to be
a few thousand years old.

221
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,180
Astounding.

222
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:56,420
[camera shutter clicks]

223
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:58,023
Whoa.

224
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:00,058
Uh...

Ow...

230
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,149
What is this place?

231
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:07,285
[ghostly voice]
<i>At last, you are here.</i>

[screaming]

234
00:16:36,713 --> 00:16:39,023
Free me from my prison

235
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,161
and I will grant you
the strength

236
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:45,995
<i>to kill the man
who murdered your father.</i>

237
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,798
You can't leave him like this!

238
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:49,725
You ask the sea for mercy.

239
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,530
Get out of here!
You need to live

240
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,000
so you can kill
that son of a bitch!

The Council's called
for an emergency gathering.

There's been

[Aquaman]
Where did it hit this time?

273
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:44,611
[councilwoman]
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

274
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,446
and there are now reports
of outbreaks

275
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:48,716
in the Fishermen Kingdom
as well.

276
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:51,753
There haven't been outbreaks
like this in centuries.

277
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:53,582
Why now?

278
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,024
Increased ocean acidity,
decreased oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

279
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,862
Take your pick.

280
00:18:58,997 --> 00:19:04,392
The surface has been poisoning
our atmosphere for over a century.

281
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:06,512
You can't expect them to care
about what happens to us

282
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:09,131
if they don't even know
we exist.

283
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,781
If you want to be a part
of the conversation,

284
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,410
we have to take our seat
at the table.

285
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:21,315
It's time for Atlantis
to reveal itself to the surface.

286
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,250
[council members grumbling]

287
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:28,491
Your majesty is well aware
of the Council's position on this.

288
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,589
Listen, we can talk
to their scientists

289
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:34,760
and combine our technologies to reverse
the damage that they've already done.

290
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:37,562
And I know this is
against our traditions,

291
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:39,096
but the world is shrinking,

292
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,669
and the old ways aren't gonna
protect us anymore.

293
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,342
Times have changed.

294
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:46,640
Atlantis wants this.

295
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,175
There's a whole generation
out there

296
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:49,610
that don't want
to hide anymore.

297
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:53,084
Have you already forgotten
that this plague

298
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:56,078
killed your own beloved mentor,

299
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:59,319
and you want to negotiate
with them?

300
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:04,388
We gave your brother war powers
and made him Ocean Master for a reason.

301
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:08,697
If we ever decide to make ourselves known
to the surface-dwellers,

302
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:12,964
it will be to eradicate them,
not to co-exist.

[Aquaman] I don't know
how you did it, Pops.

Mera and I have
the whole kingdom helping us,

310

Yeah, well,
I just plain suck at my job.

00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:28,645
The problem is half of Atlantis still

And he can fight me

And where the hell did he get

Orichalcum is a power source

the oceans ourselves

479
00:35:32,886 --> 00:35:35,525
before we realized
what we were doing.

480
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:39,024
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

481
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:42,730
has been buried
in 12 storage vaults deep underground.

482
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:44,741
We should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

483
00:35:44,765 --> 00:35:47,436
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

484
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:49,400
We think he's been
launching secret raids

485
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:51,306
for at least five months.

486
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:52,842
This is just the time
he got caught.

487
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,441
Well, this spike
in global temperatures

488
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:56,273
that's causing disasters
on the surface

489
00:35:56,409 --> 00:36:01,145
and making the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

490
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:04,783
He's using the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

491
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:08,358
Why would he do that?

492
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:10,356
[Aquaman] I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

493
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:13,791
If he is using the orichalcum to heat the planet,
we don't have much time.

494
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:15,897
He is pushing this
past the tipping point.

495
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:20,432
He must be stopped or a global climate
meltdown is imminent.

496
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:21,866
[Nereus] We need to find him,

497
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:23,681
but he's completely
vanished off the radar.

498
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:26,310
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

499
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:28,873
But you're not gonna like it.

Your brother?

501
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:34,528
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

502
00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:36,279
but he's dealt with Manta
in the past,

503
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:38,698
and he's the only one who might
know how to find him in time.

504

The Fishermen will never
allow you to speak to Orm.

505
00:36:42,522 --> 00:36:44,526
He killed their king.

506
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,893
I wasn't exactly
gonna ask for permission.

507
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:51,462
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract
Orm from an allied nation.

508
00:36:51,598 --> 00:36:53,964
It would be an act of war.

509
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,000
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

510
00:36:58,144 --> 00:36:59,875
I'm gonna break him out myself.

511
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:03,570
Arthur, Karshon is looking
for a reason to seize war powers.

518
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:21,365
it will tear
the kingdoms apart.

519
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:25,568

01:06:34,415 --> 01:06:35,935
and challenged my claim
for the throne.

961
01:06:36,047 --> 01:06:37,891
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

962
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:40,984
If you weren't such an asshole,
you'd still be king.

963
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,591
Unbelievable.

964
01:06:42,726 --> 01:06:43,885
Wait, wait! Wait!

965
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,028
You took my throne
and you don't even want it?

966
01:06:46,163 --> 01:06:48,587
Are you kidding me?
I hate this job.

967
01:06:48,723 --> 01:06:51,563
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep Atlantis
from destroying the surface.

968
01:06:51,697 --> 01:06:53,331
And I might even be
screwing that up.

969
01:06:53,466 --> 01:06:54,786
You really
had no ambition for it?

970
01:06:54,902 --> 01:06:56,338
Absolutely not.

971
01:06:56,473 --> 01:06:58,405
From the day
my father found out you existed,

972
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:00,317
he prepared me for the moment
that you would come

973
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:01,643
and challenge me
for the throne.

974
01:07:01,779 --> 01:07:03,169
Wow, that's really sad.

975
01:07:03,305 --> 01:07:04,653
Especially when you think
how easily I kicked your ass

976
01:07:04,677 --> 01:07:07,078
with basically no prep time
whatsoever.

977
01:07:07,213 --> 01:07:09,246
[smacks lips] Roasted.

978
01:07:09,381 --> 01:07:10,814
That is not how it happened.

979
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:12,761
- That's exactly how it happened.
- Mera saved you.

980
01:07:12,785 --> 01:07:14,623
[Aquaman] No, she didn't.
I kicked your ass.

981
01:07:14,758 --> 01:07:16,698
[Orm] Nope. She made
the little water tornado. I fell in it.

982
01:07:16,722 --> 01:07:18,442
[Aquaman] Okay, shut up.
I think we're here.

983

Sleep, <i>aloha.</i>

986
01:07:28,533 --> 01:07:29,895
[Orm] Come on, let's do this.

987
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:31,310
[Aquaman]
Once this is over with,

988
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:32,780
we should go get some
burgers and beers.

989
01:07:32,804 --> 01:07:34,484
- [Orm] Don't push it.
- Tacos and tequila.

990
01:07:34,574 --> 01:07:36,442
[Orm] I don't even
know those words.

01:08:38,743 --> 01:08:40,176
Whoa, brother.

1001
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:44,378
<i>Sasa!</i>

1002
01:08:50,482 --> 01:08:52,320
It's an orichalcum furnace.

1003
01:08:53,386 --> 01:08:54,923
All that stolen orichalcum.

1004
01:08:55,058 --> 01:08:56,523
They're just burning it up.

1005
01:08:56,658 --> 01:08:58,960
[Aquaman] He's heating
the atmosphere on purpose.

1006
01:08:59,095 --> 01:09:00,561
[Orm] This is catastrophic.

1007
01:09:00,696 --> 01:09:03,088
This whole place must
be heat-shielded to protect it

1008
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:05,397
from the surface's
thermal satellites.

1009
01:09:05,533 --> 01:09:07,033
Question is,
how do we stop 'em?

1010
01:09:07,169 --> 01:09:08,434
To take out this reactor,

1011
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:10,210
we would have to crater
the entire island.

1012
01:09:10,304 --> 01:09:13,841
Get away from there! Now!

1013
01:09:13,976 --> 01:09:18,544
This blaster may be ancient,
but it was built for killing Atlanteans.

1014
01:09:24,685 --> 01:09:26,755
Okay, I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

1015
01:09:26,891 --> 01:09:29,720
I just didn't want you to break me in half
before I could surrender.

1016
01:09:31,225 --> 01:09:32,591
Please take me with you.

1017
01:09:33,926 --> 01:09:36,491
Knock him out and then
help me hide these bodies.

1018
01:09:36,626 --> 01:09:38,790
No, no. Wait, please.

1019
01:09:38,926 --> 01:09:40,393
I didn't want any of this.

1020
01:09:40,528 --> 01:09:43,504
All I wanted was to see Atlantis
with my own eyes.

1021
01:09:43,639 --> 01:09:45,640
I thought I could share
its wonders with the world.

1022
01:09:45,776 --> 01:09:49,771
I'm a scientist, and I just wanted
to be taken seriously.

1023
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:51,342
David Kane said
he could help me,

1024
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:53,010
but now he won't let me leave.

1025
01:09:53,145 --> 01:09:56,483
You expect us to believe you
have nothing to do with this?

1026
01:09:57,314 --> 01:09:58,681
I know.

1027
01:09:58,817 --> 01:10:00,816
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

1028
01:10:00,952 --> 01:10:03,451
But he would've killed me
if I hadn't.

1029
01:10:03,587 --> 01:10:05,822
[scoffs] Knock him out.

1030
01:10:07,093 --> 01:10:08,262
No.

1031
01:10:08,397 --> 01:10:10,398
- Then I'll knock him out.
- No!

1032
01:10:11,363 --> 01:10:12,998
- What?
- No.

1033
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:15,700
[grunting] Fine!

1034
01:10:16,501 --> 01:10:17,805
You can come with us.

1035
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,567
Oh... thank you.

1036
01:10:19,702 --> 01:10:22,711
But you better start talking.
Or I'm gonna give you one <i>sasa!</i>

1037
01:10:22,846 --> 01:10:24,010
Okay, okay.

1038
01:10:24,146 --> 01:10:25,380
It's the black trident.

1039
01:10:25,515 --> 01:10:27,546
It's a direct link
to some ancient evil.

1040
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,362
It gives Kane great powers
and in return...

command the armies of Xebel. I do.

1121
01:19:37,461 --> 01:19:38,832
[Brine King]
And the Brine Kingdom

1122
01:19:38,968 --> 01:19:40,931
has not forgotten
its debt to you.

1123
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:43,394
You may count on us always.

1124
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:45,333
Something happened to me.

1125
01:19:45,468 --> 01:19:48,299
When I touched
that black trident.

1126
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:50,306
Why is he even here?

1127
01:19:50,442 --> 01:19:52,109
He should be
on his way back to prison.

1128
01:19:52,244 --> 01:19:53,910
We should hear
what he has to say.

1129
01:19:54,046 --> 01:19:55,817
I made that mistake once.

1130
01:19:55,953 --> 01:19:58,045
That's why I know
he can't be trusted.

1131
01:19:58,181 --> 01:20:01,318
And he cut off my claw.

1132
01:20:01,453 --> 01:20:03,991
This thing took a whole year
to grow back.

1133
01:20:04,126 --> 01:20:06,592
Look, he wants to stop Manta
same as we do.

1134
01:20:06,728 --> 01:20:08,195
And just for the record,

1135
01:20:08,331 --> 01:20:10,624
the only reason we made it
this far is because of him.

1136
01:20:12,866 --> 01:20:14,364
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

1137
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:18,003
[waves crashing]

1138
01:20:18,139 --> 01:20:20,739
Mom, I don't know enough
about this.

1139
01:20:20,874 --> 01:20:22,575
Is that even possible?

1140
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:25,738
All anyone knows for sure is there once
was a seventh kingdom

1141
01:20:25,873 --> 01:20:28,612
and then one day,
just before the fall,

1142
01:20:28,747 --> 01:20:31,712
every record of it was stricken
from the chronicles.

1143
01:20:31,848 --> 01:20:34,484
How do you know what you saw
was the Lost Kingdom?

1144
01:20:34,619 --> 01:20:37,722
No one even knows
what it was called anymore.

1145
01:20:37,858 --> 01:20:39,422
It's called Necrus.

1146
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:42,128
And I didn't just see it.

1147
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:44,433
I knew it.

1148
01:20:45,662 --> 01:20:49,366
It's almost like I was...
remembering it.

1149
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,239
Flashes
of someone else's memories.

1150
01:20:55,008 --> 01:20:56,540
During King Atlan's time,

1151
01:20:56,675 --> 01:21:01,015
there were
seven united kingdoms of Atlantis.

1152
01:21:01,151 --> 01:21:05,217
And the Black City
was a curse upon them all.

1153
01:21:11,894 --> 01:21:13,491
<i>By exploiting orichalcum,</i>

1154
01:21:13,626 --> 01:21:16,930
<i>Necrus rapidly became
a superpower unlike any other.</i>

1155
01:21:17,066 --> 01:21:18,832
But it came
at a terrible price.

1156

- [yelling]

1162
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:39,287
<i>However,
Kordax resented Atlan,</i>

1163
01:21:39,422 --> 01:21:41,986
<i>thinking his own brother
was trying to steal his power.</i>

1164
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:47,694
<i>So, he resorted to dark magic
and crafted an instrument of evil.</i>

1165
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,254
<i>That black trident.</i>

[hoarse screaming]

1182

This evil was supposed to
remain frozen for eternity.

1183
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:57,164
But David Kane has found it.

1184

<i>And it's slowly possessing him.</i>

1185

[Mera] But even
with the ice cap melting,

1186
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,338
Kordax still can't be freed.

1187
01:23:05,473 --> 01:23:08,042
Atlan used blood magic
to seal Kordax in his prison.

1188
01:23:08,177 --> 01:23:10,010
Only Atlan himself
could release him.

1189
01:23:10,146 --> 01:23:11,712
Manta doesn't need
Atlan himself.

1190
01:23:11,848 --> 01:23:15,016
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

1191
01:23:15,152 --> 01:23:16,878
Blood magic isn't really magic,
it's DNA.

1192
01:23:17,014 --> 01:23:22,279
The key to Kordax's prison
is the royal bloodline itself.

1193
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:26,094
That means he needs blood
from either you, me or Arthur.
