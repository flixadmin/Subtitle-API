1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,640
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,880
An unknown number
of other dangerous magical beings

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,400
got spat out across the timeline
and now must be sent to hell.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,360
Your shape-shifting days
are over, sweetheart.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,480
- No!
- Is that a Kaupe?

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,560
This is a prison, Mona.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,720
And they are our prisoners.
Not our friends.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,800
People around me get hurt,
killed or far far worse.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,920
But you can't mess with your past.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Dez.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Order up.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
Next one.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,040
<i>I want a little more</i>

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
<i>Hey</i>

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
<i>Hey</i>

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,640
Oi, oi! Wake up, John-O.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,840
Piss off, will you?

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,360
Oh, not today, you lying geezer!

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,160
- What the...
- Now, you said that

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,800
my shape-shifting days were over.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,600
You call that abomination
shape-shifting, do you?

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,760
Well, if I can shift at all,

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,600
that means that your spell
is reversible.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
You see, that's where
you're wrong, sweetheart.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,960
There's no taking it back.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,440
Smart man like you, John-O,
you can figure it out.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,960
Yeah, well...

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,440
mortal life is full
of disappointments.

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,400
Best get used to it, love.

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
It's all right.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,440
That's all right.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,480
You know how I survived
in the prison dimension?

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,440
Trading favors.

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,000
Now, sooner or later,
you're gonna need something from me.

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,720
Then we'll talk, chum.

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,600
Thanks for staying
at my place this time.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
Oh, I love sleeping next to you.

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,600
I just wish that your place
didn't mean

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,000
sharing a bathroom with...

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,760
Beer.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,640
Yes, Garima. Beer.

42
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,160
It's the only word Rory taught her.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,640
Wait, Rory's still using
Brigid's diary?

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,440
That thing is an ancient
magical artifact.

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,800
Yeah, but it keeps him happy.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
Sara, be reasonable.

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
You can't let Rory keep the diary.

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,480
I see you've met Garima.

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,760
What she lacks in vocabulary
she makes up for in personality.

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,360
And everyone knows that a happy Mick
is better for the entire ship.

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,560
Killer 'stache.

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,680
- Interesting.
- You think?

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,800
I had Gideon stimulate my hair
follicles to grow it overnight.

54
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
I read in one of Nora's letters

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,520
that she had a thing
for mustaches, so I...

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,720
Sorry, but how are we all being
so blase about the diary?

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,440
What if Rory goes from writing
sci-fi to horror?

58
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,080
Do you want killer clowns
running around the ship?

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,200
The only killer on this ship

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,760
is the amount of sugar
in this cereal.

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,240
"Big Easy-O's"?

62
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,800
They taste like beignets.

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,800
So sweet it makes your lips pucker.

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,160
There's a quiz on the back.

65
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,440
Who is the most prolific
serial killer

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
in the United States?

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Ted Bundy.

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,520
Although in my opinion,
John Wayne Gacy

69
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
had way more victims
than he confessed.

70
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,920
What? Everyone has their hobbies.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,120
Well, sorry, Ava, but according
to this not-so-kid-friendly cereal,

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,640
is answer is New Orleans'
own Marie Laveau.

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
What?

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,560
A high-profile female serial killer?

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,960
No, I would have heard of her.

76
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
The box is wrong.

77
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,240
Unless...

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,760
- Gideon?
<i>- You are correct, Captain.</i>

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,000
<i>It appears a Fugitive is on the loose
in New Orleans in 1856.</i>

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,160
<i>According to local lore,</i>

81
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,480
<i>there were a series of murders
perpetrated by a criminal</i>

82
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
<i>who could walk through walls.</i>

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,120
Sounds like we're going mindhunting
in the Big Easy.

84
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,600
Gideon, plot a course.

85
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,360
Unbelievable.

86
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,200
You just ran into my car, earmuffs.

87
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,800
But your car...

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,560
This scratch will easily cost
you a couple hundos.

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,960
{\an5}- You want me to pay for it?
- Yes.

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,280
No worries, sir.

91
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,040
I can have the money tomorrow.

92
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,400
{\an5}They really need to stop
giving delivery girls drive-ons.

93
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,240
{\an5}I'm actually Assistant Coordinator
of Creature Upkeep.

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,760
Ahoy, matey.

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,080
{\an5}It seem to be pirate day once again,
you scurvy wench.

96
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,800
Don't be late again
or Ava will give you another peg leg.

97
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,360
Okay.

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,200
Hey, Catch-a-Predator, what was that?

100
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,920
{\an5}Well, that, my fellow rebound artist,
was flirting.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,560
Oh, Gary. That was not flirting.

102
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,680
- No.
- What do you mean?

103
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
I mean, I made extended eye contact,

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,360
{\an5}picked up on some personal
information,

105
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,920
and then I negged her.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,240
All right, don't tell me
you're falling for this, like,

107
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,760
{\an5}Neanderthal misogynistic
dating advice.

108
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,440
{\an5}You're a modern man
surfing the sexual spectrum.

109
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,480
Just be cool and ask her out.

110
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,600
{\an5}Or, and I'm just spitballing here,
you can ask her out for me.

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
This isn't high school.

112
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,080
Oh, sorry.

113
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
{\an5}High school's a bit
of a trigger word for me.

114
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Wow. You are really broken.

115
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,960
Okay, look, I will...

116
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,120
{\an5}I'm not gonna ask her out.
But I will do some recon.

117
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,360
You'll be my time-bro wingman?

118
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,520
See, you do things like that,

119
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,240
and it makes it very hard
to help you, Gary.

120
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,920
All right, Legends.
Next stop, "N'awlins."

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,160
We have a Fugitive serial killer,
and it's a weird one.

122
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,880
Yeah, it says here
that all of the victims

123
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,440
were wealthy blonde ladies

124
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,080
stabbed to death
inside their locked bedrooms.

125
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,640
- Spooky.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

126
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,480
Blondes killed in locked rooms.

127
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,880
That's the M.O. of Mike the Spike.

128
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Am I gonna find a murder board
in your closet?

129
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,320
New Orleans is a crap town.

130
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Although anything's
better than that tush tickler.

131
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,400
This?

132
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,160
Well, the cops pinned it
on voodoo priestess Marie Laveau,

133
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,240
{\an5}one of the only women of color
with power living in 1856.

134
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Surprise, surprise.

135
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
You stole my diary, weasel.

136
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,200
Oh, you mean the one
that you nicked from my trunk?

137
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,840
- That one, eh?
- Gentlemen.

138
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,680
I "mustache" you both to calm down.

140
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,120
Get out of my way, otherwise I'll
knock that fur ball off your lip.

141
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,320
I confiscated the diary.

142
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,840
It's Time Bureau property now.

143
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Don't worry, Rory.

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,640
Garima will always be
right where she belongs.

145
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,800
In your imagination.

146
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Garima...

147
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
Rory, look. I'm sorry.

148
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,680
Ava was just doing her job,

149
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,120
which is exactly
what the rest of us need to do.

150
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,720
{\an5}Ray, Mick, we're gonna protect
the Fugitive's first victim,

151
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,280
Miss Didi Charbonnet.

152
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,000
She's hosting a party this afternoon.

153
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,480
John, I need you to talk to Laveau.

154
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,920
Find out how she's mixed up
in all this.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
I'll go with him. Yeah.

156
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
I love me some voodoo.

157
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,240
Great. Zari, you're on their mission.

158
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,800
You can just say the B-team.

159
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,680
No, there's no...

160
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,800
There's no such thing as B-team.

161
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,440
But there is such thing as an A-team.

162
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,960
Let the good times roll.

163
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,960
Beautiful Calas! Very hot!

164
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,880
{\an5}Wow, this doesn't even
look like America.

165
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, it's not.

166
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,760
This is New Orleans, baby.

167
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,760
You've been here before?

168
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,240
After London, best city in the world.

169
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,960
{\an5}I mean, just look at this
hodgepodge of humanity.

170
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,560
It's the perfect place to pick a face
and just have some fun.

171
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
John?

172
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,960
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just...

173
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,160
This city just brings
back memories, is all.

174
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,080
Monsieur Constantine.

175
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,320
Would you come with me, please?

176
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,640
Yeah, I'm not really in the habit
of going home with strangers, mate.

177
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,920
At least, not recently.

178
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,600
Not again.

179
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Oh, what...

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, no.

181
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,680
This is not good.

182
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,720
Bloody New Orleans!

183
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,640
Priestess Laveau.
Oh, cheers, love.

184
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,680
You saved me the trouble
of finding you.

185
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,240
That was a little bit theatrical,

186
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,040
to be honest with you,
but then again,

187
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,240
I do appreciate a flair
for the dramatic.

188
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Stop.

189
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,280
You have something of mine.

190
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,320
Oh, I have no idea
what you're on about.

191
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,520
I felt its presence as soon
as you arrived in New Orleans.

192
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,920
This medallion honors Saint Marron,
the patron saint of runaway slaves.

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,960
Now, what do you know
about bondage, mon cher?

194
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,680
Buy me a pint at the local pub,
and I'll tell you all about it, love.

195
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,840
You don't have to say a thing.

196
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,600
I am back, and it is time
for me to cook you breakfast.

197
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,760
One full English coming up.

198
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,960
Hey, Johnny.

199
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,640
<i>I hope that I'm forgiven</i>

200
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Dez, you...

201
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,280
you have to leave town.

202
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,360
This thing that's after me,
it's no ordinary demon.

203
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,120
This medallion has been
in my family for generations.

204
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,280
It's imbued with a protection spell.

205
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Take it, Johnny.

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,080
As long as you promise to leave town.

207
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,560
It's just until I get this mess
sorted out, all right?

208
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,040
- All right.
- All right.

209
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,680
My great-great-grandson.

210
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,400
He must have loved you
to give you my medallion.

211
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,240
Did you love him?

212
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,160
Does anyone have eyes
on the Fugitive's first victim?

213
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
<i>Annoying blonde in the middle.</i>

214
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,640
<i>That's Didi Charbonnet.</i>

215
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,520
Good. Stay with her.

216
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
<i>According to Gideon, the murder
is going to happen within the hour.</i>

217
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,880
What kind of Fugitive stabs a woman?

218
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,000
<i>I know a woman I could stab.</i>

219
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,720
<i>Rhymes with Shava.</i>

220
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
Rory, play nice.

221
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,760
<i>Don't worry, I can handle myself
against the cretin.</i>

222
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,000
<i>Whatever, man-pants.</i>

223
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
Hey.

224
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,840
Look, I know you're mad
at Ava right now, but she's right.

225
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,960
The diary is not a toy.

226
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,560
Garima helped me write.

227
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,000
Would you just try to be
nice to her, please?

228
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
For me?

229
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,760
Guys, keep an eye
on the creepy ginger by the door.

230
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,160
<i>Copy that.
We have a possible Fugitive alert.</i>

231
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
Gideon, we can't find John,
and he's not on comms.

232
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,760
<i>Mr. Constantine has refused
to wear his communications device.</i>

233
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,880
Stupid blighter.

234
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,520
<i>However, Captain Lance requested
I fabricate a tracker</i>

235
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,240
<i>in every pair of his undershorts.</i>

236
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
That cheeky little minx.

237
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Okay, great.

238
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,280
As soon as you trace him,
send us his location.

239
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,440
Tell me what happened to my Desmond.

240
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
A demon.

241
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Neron.

242
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,400
Dez was collateral damage.

243
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,240
Just go ahead and curse me,
all right?

244
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,960
'Cause I bloody deserve it.

245
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480
Why would I curse the man
who could save the last of my line?

246
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,880
You don't understand.

247
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,280
Dez is gone.

248
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
No amount of magic
can bring him back.

249
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,920
Save my kin.

250
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Let him go!

251
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,040
Hey, hey, that's a nice rescue,
loves, but, Priestess Laveau

252
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,160
and I were just, just having
a little chat, weren't we?

253
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,640
Now, to our business...

254
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,360
Have you sensed any other magic
in your city

255
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,840
besides my own and theirs?

256
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,760
I've sensed a spirit.

257
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,280
A Dybbuk.

258
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,400
And, like you, from another time.

259
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,640
What's a Dybbuk?

260
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,680
It's the dislocated soul
of a dead person.

261
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,520
Someone so wicked that their
spirit never crossed over.

262
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,680
<i>Sara? I don't think he's a Fugitive.</i>

263
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,520
I think this guy's just looking
for the bathroom.

264
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
What's going on?

265
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,560
This doll...

266
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,520
is going to kill my mama.

267
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
This doll?

268
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,160
Sara, is it possible

269
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,400
<i>that our Fugitive killer
is a possessed doll?</i>

270
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,960
Horror movie 101.

271
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Well, hello, dolly.

272
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,920
Wrong doll, you dick!

273
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,640
Well, we'd best be going, then.

274
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,160
If we don't catch this Dybbuk
then the good people of New Orleans

275
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,000
will blame you for its mayhem.

276
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
I believe...

277
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,680
this belongs to you,
Monsieur Constantine.

278
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,560
Guys, this Fugitive
we're looking for is an evil spirit.

279
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,760
Crap.

280
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,520
Damn it, Ray, where the hell are you?

281
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Ray?

282
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
What happened?

283
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,320
Sara, any sign of the Fugitive?

284
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,720
I think we may have
a Chucky situation here.

285
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,440
- What does that mean?
- I reckon the Dybbuk is in a doll.

286
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,480
<i>Rory, Ava, Sara needs backup.</i>

287
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,840
A word.

288
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,280
I'm all ears.

289
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,680
You, still want
your powers back, yeah?

290
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Come on then.

291
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,480
All right. Come on, big guy.

292
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,840
Sara. Oh, I had the weirdest dream.

293
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,320
I dreamed that
I was attacked by a doll!

294
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,360
I'm gonna kill you, Goldilocks!

295
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
You're late.

296
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,400
Still moving. Kill it!

297
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,520
No, no, no, no, no.

298
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,760
We need to question it and find out
if it's really Mike the Spike.

299
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Who are you?

300
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,920
Your worst nightmare.

301
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Aloha.

302
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,680
I brought you some meat.

303
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
Oh, my cut.

304
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,840
I stupidly ran my bike
straight into this guy's car door.

305
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,120
No. No, he didn't look
before he opened the car door.

306
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,360
I know, I know.

307
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,680
I shouldn't have to pay,

308
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,520
but I don't want to lose
the world's best job.

309
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,560
You're a really good listener,
you know that?

310
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
What happened?

311
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,120
Did someone hurt you?

312
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,960
So, how does helping you
make me a shape-shifter again?

313
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Well, it's simple, really.

314
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
If I never meet Desmond,

315
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,160
then this demon scum that's
after me doesn't hurt him,

316
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
which means that my guilt-ridden ass
never joins the Legends

317
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,680
and doesn't turn up to London
to give you a magical lobotomy.

318
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
- Now...
- Simple.

319
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,080
Now, the me from five months ago
is having a drink in there.

320
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,200
Now, I'll recognize you as Amaya.

321
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,800
All you have to do
is play the part, all right?

322
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,360
American accent, stick up my bum,
and in love with Nate.

323
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,760
Do me a favor, just,
make sure I get out of there

324
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,960
before I meet Dez, all right?

325
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
- All right.
- Okay.

326
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,520
I'll meet you back on the jumpship,
John-O.

327
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,560
All right, Charlie-O.

328
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Good luck.

329
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,600
John?

330
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,400
- As I live and breathe.
- Amaya.

331
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,600
- Nice bonnet, love.
- Thank you.

332
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,640
Last I heard you were in, Zambesi.

333
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,400
So, where's Nate
and the rest of the crew, then?

334
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,080
Oh, Nate, my boyfriend.

335
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
And my crazy gang of best friends.

336
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, it is such a long story.

337
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,280
- Right.
- But a really good one.

338
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,560
How about I tell you all about it
over a glass of chardonnay?

339
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,840
Chardonnay, eh?

340
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,120
- All right, barkeep!
- No, no, not here.

341
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,800
I... I know a better place.

342
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,480
All right, well, you owe me dinner.

343
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,400
- That is a fair price.
- All right, go on.

344
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Order up!

345
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Hey, Mona.

346
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,200
How's life? Liking the Time Bureau?

347
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,400
Settling in? Dating anyone?

348
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,040
Good, great, yes.

349
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,840
I mean, there is someone.

350
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,000
Lay it on Nate.

351
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,800
I think it might be inappropriate.

352
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
'Cause I work here.

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,080
- And he's here too?
- Wow.

354
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,520
Exactly.

355
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Yeah, I think I know
who you're talking about,

356
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,560
and trust me,
he has a crush on you too.

357
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,680
He does?

358
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,280
I swore I was just imagining it.

359
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,120
We don't even, like,
speak the same language.

360
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,520
Well, he does have a unique way
of expressing himself.

361
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,440
I'm afraid people
would think it was weird.

362
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,040
I mean, that hair.

363
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,280
Well, he just needs
the right product.

364
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,960
What about the man meat?

365
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,040
Well, what... what about it?

366
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,840
I think he's, you know...

367
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,240
Had some.

368
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,640
It wouldn't surprise me.
I mean, it's 2018. I don't judge.

369
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,400
I should probably forget about it.

370
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,280
No. Carpe datum.

371
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
- What do you got to lose?
- My job.

372
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,040
I will make sure you're not fired
for following your heart.

373
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,200
Okay. I'll do it.

374
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
I'm gonna let him know how I feel.

375
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,520
One thing I learned
from the Chucky movies

376
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,640
is the doll always comes back.

377
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,840
Gideon, how's the timeline?

378
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,200
<i>History is on track, and Marie Laveau
lived a long and celebrated life,</i>

379
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,880
<i>inspiring an Emmy-nominated portrayal
by Angela Bassett.</i>

380
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,720
See? Rory killed the Dybbuk.

381
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,440
Which is unfortunate because now I
have to explain to Mr. Heywood

382
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,680
why I'm bringing him a seared doll
instead of a magical creature.

383
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,520
Well, at least we get to find out
why they call it the Big Easy.

384
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,040
Did you happen to notice
that Rory robbed that party blind?

385
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,440
- I believe it.
- I don't understand

386
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,160
why you enable his bad behavior.

387
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,040
At the Bureau, we would fire people
for lesser offenses.

388
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,280
Well, at the Bureau,

389
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
you don't have to eat, drink,
and sleep with your team.

390
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Point taken.

391
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,080
It's just, this is supposed to be
a professional operation, babe.

392
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,120
Look, deep down, Rory's a good guy.

393
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,480
And, honestly, a friend.

394
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,600
I get it.

395
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,880
- You run your team, I'll run mine.
- Thank you.

396
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,840
Speaking of,
I should get back to the Bureau.

397
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,200
How about you stay for dinner?

398
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,000
I could use a shower.

399
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
It's not like that thing's
going anywhere.

400
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,960
So? When are these changes
to history gonna set in?

401
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,600
'Cause you know
I've got some big plans.

402
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,080
I'm actually thinking of Vegas first.

403
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,560
Well, time takes a moment to cement,
or so I'm told enough by Sara.

404
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,960
But don't worry, love,

405
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,400
we'll have you shape-shifting
again in no time.

406
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,040
John-O? You all good?

407
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,920
We stopped me
from meeting Dez tonight,

408
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,840
but now I meet him
a few days later instead.

409
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,320
We have to go back.

410
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,160
<i>I'm afraid returning to New Orleans
is impossible, Mr. Constantine.</i>

411
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,680
And why is that?

412
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
<i>Because I know you two
are up to something.</i>

413
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,400
<i>And as much as I hate babysitting,
I hate being played even more.</i>

414
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,200
<i>Gideon, bring them back
to the Waverider.</i>

415
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
<i>They have some serious
explaining to do.</i>

416
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,800
Here's one thing you need
to understand,

417
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,320
is that I don't go in
for all that love crap.

418
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,800
Romance is for little girls
crying into their pillows,

419
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,160
not for a devious tosser like me
who knows the score.

420
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
But then...

421
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,280
six months ago, I met him.

422
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Desmond.

423
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,120
And that first night was like

424
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,680
a second line had marched
into my useless heart

425
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,440
and breathed some life into it again.

426
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,840
Desmond knew who I was,
exactly what I'd done, and...

427
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,720
he didn't care.

428
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,040
So, I was all in.

429
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,520
Rented an apartment.

430
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,200
And then this demon shows up.

431
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Neron.

432
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,880
Wanted me to help him usurp
the triumvirate ruling hell.

433
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, he must have had
something on you to expect that.

434
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,000
The deed to my soul.

435
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,680
When I die, the bastard owns me.

436
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,560
And he's already worked out
lots of...

437
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,440
excruciating torments
for yours truly in the inferno.

438
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,600
So, naturally,
I told Neron to piss off.

439
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Naturally.

440
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,640
I begged Dez to run.

441
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,280
I knew that Neron
would use him against me.

442
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Johnny?

443
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,200
The bloody fool didn't listen.

444
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
So Neron...

445
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,440
dragged Dez to hell because of me.

446
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,400
I didn't think there was a way
I could save him.

447
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,560
That's the thing
about time travel, right?

448
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,760
There's always a way.

449
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,960
I joined the Legends thinking
I could outrun my guilt,

450
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
but being back in New Orleans,
I realize...

451
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,400
I was just taking
the coward's way out.

452
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,200
So, I had to save him.

453
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,600
So, now that you
know what we was up to,

454
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,520
do you mind explaining
why it didn't work?

455
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,080
Some points in history are fixed.

456
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,680
Maybe John and Desmond
were supposed to meet.

457
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,920
Look, I'm sorry.

458
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,720
I'm gonna do everything I can
to find a loophole to save Desmond

459
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,200
and keep history intact.

460
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,640
You do that, love.

461
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,120
I know.

462
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,600
An unscheduled visit.

463
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,760
It's good to see you too.

464
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,560
I brought you something.

465
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,720
"O Mona ko'u inoa."

466
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Mona.

467
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,040
O wai kou inoa?

468
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Konane.

469
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,760
Konane.

470
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,200
"Shining like the moon."

471
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,800
That's a really pretty name.

472
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
Mona.

473
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,040
Yep. Yep.

474
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,280
That's me.

475
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,640
E holo a huna!

476
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,480
- A huna!
- Well, "a huna"...

477
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
"Run and hide."

478
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,360
Is someone coming?

479
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,800
Mona.

480
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Hello?

481
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Is someone there?

482
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,600
Compelling story back there.

483
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,000
Still, you're hardly
the kind of guy to open up,

484
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,080
unless, of course, you were stalling.

485
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,080
Well, you see, magic has rules,
just like time travel,

486
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560
and I just so happen
to write the book

487
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,800
on breaking them.

488
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,360
So, if meeting Desmond
is a fixed point in time,

489
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,600
then I need to go back
to after I met him.

490
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,080
Stop him from falling for me.

491
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,920
That's how I save Desmond's life.

492
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
History be bloody damned.

493
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,960
Well, you went all-out.

494
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,200
What the hell is he doing here?

495
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
Leaving.

496
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,680
Wait. Wait. Both of you.

497
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,360
Please look.

498
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,360
I roasted a roast.

499
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,160
<i>Technically, Captain, I fabricated...</i>

500
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,520
Shut up, Gideon.

501
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,400
Ava, you are my love,

502
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,360
and Mick, you are my family,
and it would mean the world to me

503
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,640
if both of you
would try to get along.

504
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Please.

505
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,160
So, I was thinking...

506
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,200
maybe you two could find
some common ground.

507
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,920
For example,...

508
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Ava, you love to read.

509
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,320
Mick here is an author.

510
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,440
Oh. Well, that's something.

511
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,720
Though I would be shocked if his
novel wasn't sexist and derivative.

512
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,840
It is.

513
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,120
Okay, well, Mick, you love to eat.

514
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,960
Ava is a fantastic baker.

515
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,960
She makes one mean snickerdoodle.

516
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,840
Fancy sugar cookies.

517
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,520
Snickerdoodles are actually
completely different.

518
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,960
It's a cream of tartar base, but...

519
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,120
Garbage cookies.

520
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,880
That's rich, coming from a man
who's so lacking in personal hygiene

521
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,880
that he had to resort to sleeping
with a three-breasted alien sex toy.

522
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,240
Well, at least Garima isn't a clone.

523
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,760
Only I get to use the C word.

524
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,720
Too far, Mick. Too far.

525
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,920
Why do you get to have
a fake girlfriend, and I don't?

526
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,120
- Clone.
- Dick.

527
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Hey.

528
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,600
- Any luck?
- I'm sorry, John.

529
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Sometimes with history,

530
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,040
if you change one thing,
it creates a whole domino effect.

531
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
It's all right.

532
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Listen, I...

533
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,440
I get being tempted
to save someone you love.

534
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,640
The anger and frustration.

535
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
It's...

536
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
John?

537
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,280
Yep.

538
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,400
- Turn around.
- I... I'd rather not.

539
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,440
That is the last time
that I try that.

540
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,760
I thought you couldn't...

541
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,120
You know what, it doesn't matter.

542
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,640
Where is John?

543
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,920
The last time
we did something like this,

544
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
we almost destroyed the entire world.

545
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,400
All right, all right. Okay, enough.

546
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,640
How are you planning to find John?

547
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,280
Well, his tracker...

548
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,360
- Which you told him about.
- Yep.

549
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,520
Old John-O's changing
history commando.

550
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,840
You know, I understand
why John's being

551
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,560
so colossally stupid,
but what's your excuse?

552
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
I'm dying.

553
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,680
What?

554
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,160
Look, every time that I shape-shift,
it's like I'm born all over again.

555
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,720
But stuck in this body
for the first time in centuries,

556
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,120
I'm getting older.

557
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,840
But if John saves Desmond,
then he never joins the Legends,

558
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,960
and I'm immortal again.

559
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,360
Let me get this straight.

560
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,560
You helped John risk
a catastrophic rupture to history

561
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,880
because you're afraid of aging?

562
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,400
Okay. Maybe John succeeds and you go
on your immortal, merry way.

563
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,480
But if he fails,
I will personally make sure

564
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,920
you spend the rest of your short,
dreary, human life

565
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,680
in the deepest, darkest prison cell
the Bureau has to offer.

566
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Let's move.

567
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,960
Look, I'm, I'm sorry.
This is my fault.

568
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,520
I shouldn't have forced it
on you and Mick.

569
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,520
No. He was just stating
a fact, you know.

570
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,000
I am a clone.

571
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Hey.

572
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,440
No, it's okay.

573
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,560
Sometimes I just wish
I could be more like you

574
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,760
and the Legends, you know.

575
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Loosen up. I...

576
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,040
When did that happen?

577
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
What?

578
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,160
Oh, no. I'll get a broom.

579
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Ava, wait.

580
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,560
Are those tiny little footprints?

581
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,040
The Dybbuk is alive.

582
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
What?

583
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Okay, we shouldn't split up.

584
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,280
Classic horror-movie mistake.

585
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,560
Well, we're not exactly helpless.

586
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,120
Fine. I'll go fix Gideon.

587
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,040
And I'm gonna go catch
a serial killer!

588
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,360
You are way too excited about this.

589
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,840
<i>I want to do a lot of things</i>

590
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
What the hell?

591
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
<i>John.</i>

592
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,880
How the bloody hell did you find me?

593
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,520
John, you have to stop this.

594
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
If Desmond isn't dragged to hell
and you don't join the Legends,

595
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,360
the effects could be cataclysmic.

596
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,960
Neron didn't drag Dez to hell.

597
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
<i>I did.</i>

598
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,000
- What do you mean?
- When I told Dez to run,

599
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,400
he went behind my back.

600
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,640
<i>Made a deal to protect me.</i>

601
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,120
In exchange for sparing my life,
Dez had to bind his soul to Neron's.

602
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,840
I couldn't send Neron to hell
without sending Dez down with him.

603
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Johnny?

604
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Johnny.

605
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,560
Johnny!

606
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,600
No!

607
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,160
I killed the man I loved,
and for what?

608
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,000
To buy New Orleans
a little more time?

609
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,560
Neron needs souls to take over hell,

610
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,400
and mark my words, he is coming
back to Earth to get them.

611
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,400
John, we can help you.

612
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,760
Yeah, spare the team bit, all right?

613
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,040
I work alone.

614
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,720
- You back already?
- Yeah.

615
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,960
Dez, I'm, back already.

616
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Hey, Johnny.

617
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,280
<i>And I hope that I'm forgiven</i>

618
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Hey, Dez.

619
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,440
I'm gonna get some clothes on.

620
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,240
<i>It will take a lot of prayers</i>

621
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,600
<i>To save my soul</i>

622
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
It's dead.

623
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,360
The Dybbuk must have
found another vessel.

624
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,520
Is there another doll
on the ship somewhere, Rory?

625
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,480
What the hell was that?

626
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Block the exit.

627
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,840
Okay, so whatever it is,
it has tiny little feet,

628
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
so it's not that big.

629
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,160
Ya dumb blonde!

630
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,120
It's not size that matters,
it's how you use it!

631
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,360
Professor Stein?

632
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,520
No! It's Mikey, you dick!

633
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Here.

634
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,640
Thank you.

635
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Where is he?

636
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,560
It really is Mike the Spike.

637
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Stop!

638
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,840
- Where are you taking him?
- You.

639
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,760
I am the Assistant Coordinator
of Creature Upkeep.

640
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,480
It's my job to take care
of magical beings.

641
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,760
- Not for long.
- Let him go!

642
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
I'm warning you.

643
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,280
Konane, no!

644
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,280
You have to go.

645
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,440
They'll kill you...

646
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,400
You okay?

647
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
- Mike's up there.
- Mike the Spike?

648
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,720
Yeah, and he's found a new vessel.

649
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,080
Much much worse.

650
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
Hold on.

651
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,000
What could be worse
than a creepy antebellum doll?

652
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,880
Where are the eggs?

653
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,320
Thought you said you were gonna cook.

654
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,800
Yeah, I changed my mind.

655
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,960
I'll finish getting dressed,
and we can go out to eat.

656
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,640
You know, it's...

657
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,200
it's not about the breakfast, Dez.

658
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
Okay.

659
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,120
I see what you're doing.

660
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,880
You know what
your problem is, Johnny?

661
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,280
You don't think
you deserve to be happy.

662
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,000
Dez, your feelings for me
are a bloody lie, all right?

663
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,320
See, I just wanted
to get you into my bed,

664
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,480
but I couldn't be bothered
to put the work in, so...

665
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,000
I used a love spell on you.

666
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,240
- This a joke?
- Afraid not, mate.

667
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
Hey...

668
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,000
I really care about you.

669
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,160
If there's something going on
in your life,

670
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,600
just be honest with me.

671
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,440
Yeah, do you know what?
This thing between us?

672
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,960
It isn't real. It never was.
It doesn't exist.

673
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,360
I put myself out there like this,
and you're playing games?

674
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
You should go.

675
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,120
Yeah, you're right. I should.

676
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
But this...

677
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,760
this thing between us?

678
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,560
This was real, Johnny.

679
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,320
Sara, do you read me?

680
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,520
John's done something awful.

681
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,760
Well, he hasn't done anything yet.

682
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,320
I'm still stuck in this form.

683
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,680
What's that?

684
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,160
Guys! Guys, guys, guys!

685
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,400
I have a real emergency here.

686
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Marty!

687
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,920
Die, you putz!

688
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,160
I hate puppets!

689
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Suck my...

690
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Blast...

691
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,040
Oi, Z! Check this out!

692
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,520
I got my powers back!

693
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,320
Don't be mad, I'm myself again.

694
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Where's Zari?

695
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
Zari?

696
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,400
Oh, blimey.
