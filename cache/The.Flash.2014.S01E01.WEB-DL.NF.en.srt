like a ball of lightning.

Something I've been playing with.

It's designed to replace the turnouts
firefighters traditionally wear.

...maybe people wouldn't be so angry
at Dr. Wells.

How is it going to help me?

494

It's made of a reinforced tri-polymer.

495

It's heat and abrasive resistant to withstand
your moving at high-velocity speeds.

496
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,849
The aerodynamic design
should help you maintain control.

Plus, it has built-in sensors
so we can track your vitals...

How do we find Mardon?

500

I retasked S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite
to track meteorological abnormalities.

in a matter of seconds.

I've tracked it to a farm just west of the city.
