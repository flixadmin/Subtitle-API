1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,103
Professor:
And mad king Ludwig

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:06,271
would invite guests into
the castle linderhof,

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,873
where they would
fall victim

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,342
to any of his dozens
of deadly traps.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,610
Rude.

6
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,613
Huh. That's why his name
was not "lovable Ludwig"

7
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,449
or "good neighbor king
of Bavaria."

8
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,585
Ohh! Stand back.

9
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,359
Ah, come on.

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,895
What are the odds
that these traps
still--

11
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,300
yeeh.

12
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,357
Ludwig's lost treasure.

13
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,326
I'm sure the Booty
is booby-trapped,
so don't--

14
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,494
(rumbling)

15
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,096
Touch anything.

16
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,236
Go! Go! Go!

17
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,743
Ohh!

18
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,078
Bad day.

19
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,715
Ha! Bad day! Bad day!

20
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,017
Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day!

21
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,418
(Grunting)

22
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,496
(Screaming)

23
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,801
(Jackie screaming)

24
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,777
Snowboarding works
much better with snow.

25
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,148
Follow him.

26
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,551
Follow him.

27
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,185
(Bell rings)

28
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,159
What is it, uncle?

29
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,862
Come,
give uncle a hug.

30
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,035
Ow!

31
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,737
You did not
make coffee this morning.

32
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,139
Coffee is the only thing

33
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,341
keeping uncle's
ancient heart beating.

34
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,876
You want dead uncle?

35
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,812
No? Then you make coffee.

36
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,147
Ok.

37
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,216
One more thing.

38
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:40,185
You received phone call
from the university.

39
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,654
They want you
to translate parchments.

40
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,722
Ok.

41
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,657
One more thing.

42
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,060
I cannot read
these inscriptions.

43
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,996
Very old writing.

44
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,932
I must go in back,
look at my journals.

45
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,167
Ok.

46
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,169
One more thing.

47
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,338
This is Jade, your niece.

48
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,207
She will live with you
for a year. Ok?

49
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,742
Ok.

50
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,344
I have a niece?!

51
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,180
Your cousin shin's girl
from Hong Kong.

52
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,015
Jade is not
behaving well there--

53
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,516
doing poorly in school.

54
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:15,087
Your cousin thinks
she will do better
in America with you.

55
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,955
Uh, nobody asked me!

56
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,724
Did not want
to bother you.

57
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:22,361
Now, you both get acquainted
while I go do work.

58
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:25,163
But I don't know
anything about children.

59
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,200
(Nervous laugh)

60
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,701
Hello.

61
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,136
I am Jackie.

62
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,108
Hmm. No English.

63
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,409
<i>Ne ho ma?</i>

64
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,378
(Bell rings)

65
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,480
Welcome to
uncle's rare finds.

66
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,581
How can I help you?

67
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,317
You're Jackie chan,
the archeologist?

68
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,254
Oh, I dabble
in the study
of past civilizations.

69
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,056
Well, we are aware
that you recently

70
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,092
dabbled a shield
from a bavarian castle.

71
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,827
Our extremely
wealthy employer

72
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,630
is interested
in purchasing that shield.

73
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,600
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,670
I already
donated that piece
to the university.

75
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,006
Really?

76
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,042
Aah!

77
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,589
It would be
in your family's
best interests

78
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,992
to undonate the shield,
Mr. chan,

79
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,528
by this time tomorrow.

80
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,100
Did they buy anything?

81
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,168
No.

82
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,203
You terrible salesman.

83
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,006
Watch the girl
and hide the shield.

84
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,675
Where am I going
to hide a big shield?

85
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,945
Where did I put it?

86
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,679
Whoa!

87
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:21,980
Hey!
- Aah!

88
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,316
Ow!

89
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:26,551
Heh. That will buff
right out.

90
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,835
Nya nya!

91
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,642
Electric swords?!

92
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,760
Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!

93
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,529
Ow!

94
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,704
No more playtime!
Go! Go! Go!

95
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,873
Kid: Let's
get out of here!

96
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,008
Aah!

97
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,521
Hey! What the--

98
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,791
wow.

99
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,628
Let's get out of here.

100
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,137
Jade?

101
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,417
Now he's coming to.

102
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,420
Aah!

103
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,021
Augustus black!

104
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,091
What are you doing here?

105
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,861
Oh, what am I doing here?

106
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,497
I'm afraid
it's official business,
my friend.

107
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,333
I didn't think these
were your backup singers.

108
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,536
Where have you been?
I don't hear from you
for 6 years.

109
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,272
Boom! You're
in San Francisco
saving my butt.

110
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,876
Whoa. Those thugs
must have knocked me out.

111
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,044
Actually,
I knocked you out.

112
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,816
Why did you do that?

113
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,184
Jackie.

114
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,019
I thought we were friends.

115
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,354
We are, Jackie.

116
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,290
I'm sorry,
but this location
must remain secret.

117
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,860
Oh, yes.
I can see this is
some very special garbage.

118
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,961
Jackie--

119
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,531
maybe I'll see you
in another 6 years.

120
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,466
Excuse me
while I call a cab.

121
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,534
Uh, Jackie--

122
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,068
(dials phone)

123
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,639
(Screaming)

124
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,810
(Sighs)

125
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,212
(Screaming)

126
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,417
(Elevator dings)

127
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,552
Unh.

128
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,321
Tried to warn you.

129
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,856
How did you
get down here?

130
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,324
The stairs.

131
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,725
Follow me.

132
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,264
Black: Jackie,
welcome to section 13.

133
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,937
I thought you were
with interpol.

134
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,505
Even when
you knew me then,

135
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,007
I was shepherding
this agency in secret.

136
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,042
You're a spy?

137
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,243
They're spies?

138
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,312
Law enforcement,
Jackie...

139
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,614
Elite special forces.

140
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,249
So why give me
the big tour?

141
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,084
We are aware that you've
recently acquired

142
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,852
an artifact in Bavaria.

143
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,721
Why does everyone
know this?

144
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,789
Jackie?

145
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,791
You are the second one

146
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,193
to ask me
about the shield today.

147
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,595
As I feared.

148
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,197
Want to fill me in?

149
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,032
Black: Section 13
was founded

150
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,969
to investigate large-scale
international crimes--

151
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,271
crimes which it seems
can often be traced

152
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,873
to a syndicate
called the dark hand.

153
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,275
The dark hand
has connections

154
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,044
to nearly every
criminal activity
in existence.

155
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,046
Their leader is this man--

156
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,348
valmont.

157
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,286
You are telling me
one man stopped you?

158
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,823
Uh, yes, but--

159
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,725
3 of my enforcers

160
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,226
armed with
high-tech weapons

161
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:32,330
were defeated
by an archeologist?

162
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,300
Did we mention
he had windshield wipers?

163
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,369
Tohru.

164
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,139
Uh-oh.
- Whoa!

165
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,307
Whoa.

166
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,482
Tohru,
can't breathe.

167
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,351
Enough.

168
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,686
(Gasping)

169
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,491
Tohru,
bring me the shield.

170
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,696
While your tohru impresses,
valmont,

171
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,065
perhaps he
should be aided by...

172
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,203
The shadowkahn.

173
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,674
As you wish, shendu.

174
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,477
Black:
We recently learned
that the dark hand

175
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,514
has a sudden interest
in collecting certain
historical artifacts.

176
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,615
Why?

177
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:24,883
Unknown,

178
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,718
but with this
new development,

179
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,888
section 13 could use
an archeology expert
such as yourself.

180
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,190
Oh, I'm really
just an amateur.

181
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,993
A wise
and talented amateur

182
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,661
whom I know and trust.

183
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,630
But my university work--

184
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,532
it wouldn't be
full-time, Jackie.

185
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,968
Research only,
- to help us stay one step
ahead of valmont.

186
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,203
I will consider it.

187
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,337
Whoa!
- Watch it!

188
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,605
Jackie!

189
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,975
Who is that?!

190
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,010
No relation.

191
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,411
Whoa!
- Whoa!

192
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,147
Stand back.

193
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,550
Jade:
Jackie, grab on!

194
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,251
I'm busting you
outta here.

195
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,053
You speak English?!

196
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,924
Jackie: Sorry!

197
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,159
Jackie: Look out!

198
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,794
Sorry! Heads up!

199
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,067
Jackie: Look out!

200
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,270
Jackie: Sorry!

201
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,606
Aah!

202
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,280
Jackie, how many fingers
do you see?

203
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,483
Look. Fishies.

204
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,519
Let go of me!

205
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,421
Young lady,
how did you get in here?

206
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,591
The stairs.

207
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,226
Where did you
get the bike?

208
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,761
You could
have been hurt.

209
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,596
I snuck it
out of their garage.

210
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,798
Knew we'd need it
to blow this taco stand.

211
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,367
So, we outta here?

212
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,137
Jade, these people
are my friends.

213
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,205
Your friends
knocked you out

214
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,808
and took you
to a supersecret
underground base?!

215
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,710
Uh, yes.

216
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,280
America is so cool!

217
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,550
Care to explain
how our security
was penetrated by a child?

218
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,751
I'm not a child.

219
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,586
I'm Jackie's niece.

220
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,388
Didn't know
- you had a niece, Jackie.

221
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,656
Join the club.

222
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,725
Jackie: Jade--
- come on,

223
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,894
just admit,
wasn't I brave?

224
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,763
Yes, but you also
need wisdom

225
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,166
to know when challenges
are too big.

226
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,969
Courage without wisdom
is foolishness.
Understand?

227
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,972
Uh, my English
must not be too good.

228
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,707
(Cell phone rings)

229
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,409
Hello?

230
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,410
Uncle, on phone:
Jackie.

231
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,646
Uncle.
- Where are you?

232
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,815
Uh, can't say.

233
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,517
Oh, one more thing.
Have you seen Jade?

234
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,087
Yes, she's with me.

235
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,657
See? I knew you two
would get along.

236
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,793
One more thing.

237
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,429
I have been
doing research
on the shield.

238
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,566
Jackie,
I have found what
the inscriptions mean.

239
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,168
They are incantations.

240
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,437
Incantations?

241
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,339
Magic. Very powerful,

242
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,275
but the shield
not important.

243
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,612
Of course the shield
is important, uncle.

244
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,715
Everybody I meet today
wants the shield.

245
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,784
No, shield not important.

246
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,888
The shield.

247
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,125
Uncle?

248
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,393
Uncle?!

249
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,195
Uncle!

250
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,134
Uncle? Uncle?!

251
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,571
Your uncle is fine
for now, Mr. chan,

252
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,808
but every hour
I do not possess
the shield...

253
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,810
Yes, yes, I understand.

254
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,145
I will bring it.
I will tell no one.

255
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,749
A favor, between friends.
Watch my niece.

256
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,817
Jackie,
where are you--

257
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,986
please,
don't ask questions.

258
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,923
All right, young lady--

259
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,298
ok, where would uncle
hide the shield?

260
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,002
Hmm.

261
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,169
Hi!
- Aah!

262
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,171
How did you--

263
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,040
the stairs.

264
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,343
Well, take these stairs
to your room.

265
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,745
Oh, let me help.

266
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,214
Uncle is my uncle, too--
I think.

267
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,316
Fine.
Help find the shield.

268
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,188
Yeeah!

269
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,323
Yeow!

270
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,760
This it?

271
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,928
Yes!

272
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,863
I must be getting
that wisdom

273
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,197
you were talking about.

274
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,966
Thank you.

275
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,801
Now go to your room.

276
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,378
Jade:
Uncle's up there, huh?

277
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,713
You speak English?

278
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,281
You know I do.

279
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,250
So what part of
"go to your room"

280
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,718
do you not understand?

281
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,819
Aww.

282
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,054
Stay here,

283
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,655
or I'll put you
on the first flight

284
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,957
back to Hong Kong.

285
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,525
Scout's honor.

286
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,729
Tch, like I'm a scout.

287
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,364
(Elevator dings)

288
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,171
The shield.

289
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,974
Why does your employer
want it?

290
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,042
That is not your concern.

291
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,752
Okey-dokey,
you want the shield,

292
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,420
catch!

293
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,161
Fool. Say sayonara
to your uncle!

294
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,998
Huh?

295
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,433
Arrgh!

296
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,569
I bet I run
faster than you.

297
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,021
Come and get it?

298
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,152
Aah!

299
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,596
Hurry, uncle!

300
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,831
Ai-ah.

301
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,502
(Elevator music playing)

302
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,246
Yaah!

303
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,432
Jackie!

304
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,341
Mine!

305
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,844
Oof!
- Oof!

306
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,448
The shield.

307
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,817
Yaah!

308
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,124
(Groans)

309
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,458
Heh heh.

310
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,128
(Groans)

311
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,534
(Helicopter)

312
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,806
(Over loudspeaker) Honest!
It's a research position.

313
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,512
Jackie, I never meant
for your family

314
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,779
to get involved in this.

315
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,081
It's not your fault.

316
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,083
The dark hand
was after the shield.

317
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,251
Ow!

318
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,919
I told you!

319
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,255
Shield not important.

320
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,525
The talisman
in the center
of the shield is.

321
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,828
That is where
the magic lies.

322
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,431
Uh, don't you worry.
We'll be sure to
look into that

323
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,434
once we
- reclaim the talisman
from the dark hand.

324
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,003
Don't need to.

325
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,139
Admit it.

326
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,841
I'm getting wise.

327
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,945
Master.

328
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,717
Shendu and valmont:
Tohru.

329
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,419
What?

330
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,524
One more thing.

331
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,394
See the markings?

332
00:19:56,396 --> 00:20:00,398
Sign of the rooster,
from the Chinese zodiac.

333
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,634
There are 11 more talismans
where that came from.

334
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:08,072
And my gut tells me
the dark hand's
after them, too.

335
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,574
You onboard,
Jackie?

336
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,542
Uh...
Jade: Absolutely.

337
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,818
Child: Hey, Jackie,
what inspired you to make
this TV show?

338
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,853
When I was young,
I always like cartoon.

339
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,157
I really hoped
someday I want to be
a cartoon character.

340
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,528
Cartoon can do all kind
things I cannot do
in my real life.

341
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,831
After so many, so many,
so many years later,

342
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,401
the people,
the children
still can remember me.

343
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,903
Today my dream
come true.

344
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:39,937
I love cartoon.
