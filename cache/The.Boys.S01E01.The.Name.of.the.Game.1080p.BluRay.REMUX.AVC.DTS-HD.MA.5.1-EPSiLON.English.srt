00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:20,077
Caucasians love him, too,
with a 59 percent approval rate.

632
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,082
I am willing to give you
a three-year exclusive contract

633
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,583
with full PR support,

634
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:31,130
and I'm gonna give you nine and a half points
of the merchandising.

635
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,965
I thought he was in Detroit.

636
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,134
Well, we're thinking about making a move.

637
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,927
How much?

638
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:39,471
- $300 million a year.
- [laughs]

639
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:43,225
[both laughing]

640
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,602
I know, I know, it's a tough swallow.

641
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:49,356
But we both know that your city needs a hero.

642
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,485
$200 million for Nubian Prince.

643
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,113
- I can sell that.
- Mm.

644
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,615
I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

645
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,035
We've got Atlanta waiting in the wings.

646
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:03,620
- I think maybe you can.
- [chuckles]

647
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:05,289
And why is that?

648
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,754
I happen to know about Compound V.

649
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,550
What is Compound V?

650
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,429
It's the type of rumour that could
really tarnish those heroes of yours.

651
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,805
Nobody wants that.

652
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,223
People need heroes.

653
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:26,018
Now, I can make sure
that that stays a rumour,

654
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,020
because I'm a friend.

655
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,774
But friendship does cut both ways.

656
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:35,611
I'm sorry, Steve,
I don't know what you're talking about.

657
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,655
$300 million is the price...

658
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:41,158
or we go to Atlanta.

659
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,536
DONNA:
So, how amazing is it?

660
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,080
What's Homelander like?

661
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,165
Uh... he's busy.

662
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,627
I haven't really met him yet, but...

663
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,340
- Mom, I got to tell you what happened.
<i>- Oh, I forgot.</i>

664
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,384
I was playing mah-jongg with Patty and Trish,

665
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,887
and Patty is going on and on
about how her daughter got into med school,

666
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,639
and I'm thinking, so what?

667
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,100
My daughter got into the seven!

668
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,144
<i>Anyway, so, what did you want to tell me?</i>

669
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,524
Everything's great.

670
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,526
Just how we dreamed.

671
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:16,944
Um...

672
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,571
Mom, actually, you know what? I have to go.

673
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,573
<i>All right. Bye, honey.</i>

674
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,876
[sniffles]

675
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,841
[sobs, then sighs]

676
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,471
- Um...
- [sighs]

677
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:45,889
Excuse me.

678
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:47,641
I'm sorry, are you okay?

679
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,227
Just seemed like a...

680
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,645
tough call.

681
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,898
- Sorry. I don't mean to bother you.
- No, no, it's okay.

682
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,483
Uh...

683
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,027
I'm fine. I'm just...

684
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,155
I'm just having a bad day.

685
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:04,158
[chuckles] Yeah, me too.

686
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:08,036
Uh... is it, like, a work thing, or...

687
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,997
a life thing?

688
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,417
It's a work thing.

689
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,836
You?

690
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,631
Uh... life thing.

691
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:25,637
You know how you have this...

692
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,182
image of yourself?

693
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,727
Like, I thought I was strong.

694
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,104
You know? Like, made of steel.

695
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:35,105
A fighter.

696
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,356
And...

697
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,361
then I was faced with this horrible situation
with this asshole...

698
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:44,156
and...

699
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:48,702
I just heard my mom's voice in my head,

700
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:52,915
"Keep smiling, the show must go on,"

701
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,084
and... I didn't fight.

702
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:59,838
And now I just feel sick.

703
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,966
Partly because I did it, but...

704
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,677
mostly because...

705
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:11,183
turns out I'm not who I thought I was.

706
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,312
[sighs]

707
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:18,190
- Oh. Oh, I'm, um, sorry.
- Uh...

708
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:24,738
- I... I didn't mean to just dump all of that onto you.
- No, no, it's totally fine that you dumped. Um...

709
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,953
Listen, do you like your job?

710
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:31,912
Oh.

711
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,456
It's the only thing I've ever wanted.

712
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,375
And it's a good job?

713
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,211
Like, you're not selling kids smack?

714
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,713
No, it's a great job.

715
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,258
I could help a lot of people.

716
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,094
Thing is, I, um...

717
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,347
used to know this girl...

718
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,393
and we used to go skating at Rockefeller,

719
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:58,021
and I'd be on the side
with this death grip on the rails.

720
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:01,608
She would just charge headfirst
into the middle of the rink.

721
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:04,319
And she wasn't... good.

722
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,613
Like, she fell...

723
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:08,574
a lot...

724
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,201
but she was never scared.

725
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,166
And she always used to say:

726
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,379
"Just because you fall on your ass
doesn't mean you have to stay there."

727
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,382
So you fell on your ass, you know?

728
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,510
That's not who you are.

729
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,347
So who are you?

730
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,147
I'm a fighter.

731
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,567
I'm gonna fight.

732
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,403
Yeah.

733
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:51,116
I'm gonna take that son of a bitch's head
clean off his body.

734
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,285
Okay. Wow, that was...

735
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,995
Okay.

736
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,039
- Cool.
- [exhales]

737
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,332
Little scary, but...

738
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,417
but cool.

739
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,796
I'm... I'm Hughie, by the way.

740
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,590
Annie.

741
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,598
[door opens]

742
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,224
[door closes]

743
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:20,771
[rock playing over speakers]

744
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,775
Okay, man. I'm in.

745
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:32,199
- [line ringing]
- Okay, it's ringing.

746
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,076
<i>DOUG:
Yeah, hello?</i>

747
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,995
Hi. Hi. Yes, hello. Hello, Mr. Friedman.

748
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,997
<i>It's Hughie Campbell. I got your message,</i>

749
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:44,002
and $45K, it's just...
it's just... it's bingo, like, life-changing.

750
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:48,048
Um, but I just need one thing
before I sign anything.

751
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:52,094
- I need an apology from A-Train.
- Uh, he already apologised.

752
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,762
<i>Well, no, no, no.</i>

753
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,389
No, he hasn't. Yes, he sent his...

754
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:58,725
He sent his regrets and his sympathies on...

755
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,811
[voice breaks] on TV, but I...

756
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:06,149
if I could just get an apology face-to-face,
that would be fantastic.

757
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:07,859
Just to... Just for closure,

758
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:09,945
just to put... Just to put a b-button on it.

759
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,947
<i>Okay, yeah. But, uh...</i>

760
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,074
Hugh, I'm telling you, the answer's gonna be no.

761
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:17,285
All right, in that case,
can you just give me... Uh, hello?

762
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,039
I think... They hung up.
I don't think they're gonna go for it.

763
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:25,001
Hmm. Oh, yes, they will.

764
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,880
[door opens]

765
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:33,468
[inhales, then exhales]

766
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,353
HOMELANDER:
Starlight.

767
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:46,732
Don't want to be late to your first official meeting.

768
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,277
I had a whole welcome speech planned.

769
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,778
Sorry, sir.

770
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:53,572
Please, Homelander's fine.

771
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,533
Beginning to wonder if you'd even show up.

772
00:42:56,616 --> 00:43:00,370
I mean, all that pressure,
it's a lot for anyone to swallow.

773
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:03,498
Yeah. Don't worry, I'll be fine.

774
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:05,167
I'm here...

775
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,003
and I'm not going anywhere.

776
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:14,259
TRANSLUCENT: Can we get back to this, please?
This is a serious crime.

777
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,971
These assholes pirated my movie
three weeks before release,

778
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,556
and you can't walk down 5th Avenue

779
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,601
without bumping into a table
of unlicensed Homelander shirts.

780
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:26,813
Copyright infringement is costing Vought
$1.2 billion per year.

781
00:43:26,897 --> 00:43:28,523
That's money out of our pockets.

782
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,358
We've all got, what, four points each?

783
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,068
What the fuck?

784
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,571
You got four points?

785
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,490
And clearly better lawyers.

786
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,242
Hey, hey, hey, guys, come on.

787
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,619
Stop.

788
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,454
What's Starlight gonna think?

789
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,457
Listening to us haggling over nickels.

790
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,585
We're the seven, for God's sake.
