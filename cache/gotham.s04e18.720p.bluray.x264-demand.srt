1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,117
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,955
Where is Xander Wilde?

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,958
My God.

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,384
<i>There's two of them.</i>

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,303
I'm gonna drive you mad, brother.

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,631
All of Gotham
will be joining you, too.

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,843
You shall become the Demon's Head.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,767
She's got the mark
of the Demon's Head.

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,600
No woman has ever been allowed
to lead the League of Shadows.

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,650
The sisters of the League
are yours to command.

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,815
Tell me what I need to know.

12
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,570
<i>I could have killed Jerome,
and I didn't.</i>

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,703
Don't take so much responsibility
that you get yourself killed.

14
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,793
<i>I came up with a plan
to turn this city into a madhouse.</i>

15
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,589
Oh, we're gonna need
a lot more of this!

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,966
Thank you all
for coming this evening.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,767
As your interim mayor,

18
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,096
I know my recent appointment
was sudden,

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,649
and perhaps a bit
of a shock to some.

20
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,192
Quite frankly, I was shocked.

21
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,488
What is important now
is the future of this great city.

22
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,566
That is why I'm meeting
with all of you.

23
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,077
Well, Mayor, as chairperson of
Gotham's Moral Authority Society,

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:26,284
our members have been,
quite frankly, unnerved

25
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:30,463
by the recent going-ons
in our great city.

26
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,041
We have seen criminals take office,

27
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,798
gunfights in our streets,
corruption...

28
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,628
Mrs. Haverstock.

29
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:41,558
The Commissioner and I have worked
tirelessly these past few weeks

30
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,727
to improve the way this city
conducts itself.

31
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,432
Wyatt, everything all right?

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,934
We're looking into it now, sir.

33
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,691
Did a window blow open?

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,692
It's gotten so cold.

35
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,328
- What's happened?
- Don't come any closer.

36
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,539
No!

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,472
Good evening, everyone.

38
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,765
What do you want with us?

39
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,268
Sorry, no time for questions,
Mr. Mayor.

40
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,230
You see, your presence
is urgently needed elsewhere.

41
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,693
Whatever you expect as ransom,
I will double it.

42
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,070
I have access
to the police pension fund.

43
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,824
Wow, that could be a lot of money.

44
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:52,037
Tempting, but no thanks.

45
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,042
Bridgit, isn't it?

46
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,840
I can get you safe passage
from the city,

47
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,543
money, a new home...

48
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:02,005
It was people like you that
locked me up in Strange's lab,

49
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,308
and thanks to that,
there is no Bridgit anymore.

50
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,226
I can get you a pardon, son.

51
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,100
All will be forgiven.
Just stop this lunatic.

52
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,728
Lunatic's a little harsh.

53
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,105
I prefer "visionary."

54
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,321
Oswald, can't you do something?

55
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,024
Afraid not.

56
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,033
I am with Mr. Valeska 100%.

57
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,082
Every cop in this city
will be looking for us,

58
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,453
and when they find you,

59
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,412
expect no mercy,
just a hail of bullets.

60
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,871
So serious.

61
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,125
That's why your approval ratings
are so low.

62
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,834
Hey, tell you what.

63
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,592
Try threatening me again,
but this time, try it with a smile.

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,092
Oh! See, this is what's wrong.

65
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,303
Nobody knows how
to have fun anymore, right?

66
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,356
But see our friend down there,
bag head?

67
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,896
He's figured out a way to solve that.

68
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,334
It's time to give this city
the boost it needs.

69
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,455
Time to stop taking ourselves
so seriously.

70
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,383
I mean, come on, Gotham,
what do you have to lose?

71
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,171
Except your sanity.

72
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,776
You gonna tell me why we needed
to come to the garage, Alfred?

73
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,733
Happy birthday, Master Wayne.

74
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,072
You remembered.

75
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,991
Of course I remembered.

76
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,277
I bloody love your birthdays.

77
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,034
Your seventh was an absolute blinder.

78
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,036
Yeah, I remember you had about 50 kids
come up here,

79
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,743
but you were off outside on your own.

80
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,001
You were obsessed by this one gift
that your dad gave you,

81
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,456
this bright red wagon.

82
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,917
You were in the garden all day,
collecting all these rocks.

83
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,798
When I asked you, "What are you
gonna do with these rocks?"

84
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:10,384
You said, "I'm gonna build a home
for my wagon.

85
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,887
"A secret place
that only I know about."

86
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,692
What's this?

87
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,450
Well, it's the reason why I brought you
down to the garage, Master Bruce.

88
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,172
Alfred, I don't know what to say.

89
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,966
V8, five-liter,
460-horsepower engine.

90
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,552
Painted matte black,
anti-reflective,

91
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,133
very difficult to see at night.

92
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,593
Oh, and of course this...

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,267
100% bulletproof.

94
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,855
Best be prepared, eh?

95
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,403
Oh, mate.

96
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,745
Jim, hey, what gives?

97
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,589
The mayor and the police commissioner
have been kidnapped by Jerome.

98
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,550
Got every cop in the city out there
searching all the spots

99
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,172
Jerome has been seen the last week.

100
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,674
You got something for me?

101
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,758
I was gonna say I just won 100 bucks
in the scratch-off lotto

102
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,093
at the liquor store,
and we could go to the track with it,

103
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,428
but you can do your thing first.

104
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,639
- Gordon.
<i>- We need to talk.</i>

105
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,522
- Oswald?
- I'm out back. Come alone.

106
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,236
All right.

108
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,533
Well, this is a first.

109
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,536
Are you doing anything about Jerome?

110
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,912
We're looking for him.

111
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,375
Do you know where he is?

112
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,670
And if I did, do you really think
I would just tell you?

113
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,880
Have you march in there,
guns blazing?

114
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,332
He needs to be stopped.

115
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,759
He has everyone under his thumb.

116
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,837
Freeze, Firefly, Hatter.

117
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,174
They are all part of his plan.
A dark, terrible plan.

118
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,303
Which is?

119
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,682
Scarecrow has made a gas for him.

120
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,764
- Like the fear toxin?
- Worse.

121
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,063
Much worse.

122
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,227
I saw it turn someone into
a maniacal, cackling, violent animal.

123
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,653
What does he plan to do with it?

124
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,365
He's smart. He hasn't shared
the details of his plans with anyone.

125
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,784
Instead, we all have a separate task
to perform.

126
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,195
Such as?

127
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,329
He has yet to give me my role.

128
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,616
Why did you come here
if you're not gonna help me?

129
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,701
He scares the living hell
out of me, okay?

130
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,005
I mean, I was willing to play along
with him for a while.

131
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,004
Perhaps he had a way
to make us all rich,

132
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,211
or return to the good old days,
you know.

133
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,421
But nothing good will come of this.

134
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,468
Or maybe you just don't like
the competition.

135
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,141
Jerome casts quite the shadow.

136
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,060
Oh, please.

137
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,014
He's a maniac. An anarchist.

138
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,397
He is not interested
in money or power.

139
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,354
And I am an honest criminal, Jim.

140
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,780
Where is he? Where is the gas?

141
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,949
He only tells you what he needs to,

142
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,276
when he needs to.

143
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,403
I just know he has to be stopped.

144
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,121
Jim, hey!

145
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,615
You down here?

146
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,617
- Jim?
- Yup.

147
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,746
Hey, a uni just spotted Jerome
near Paisley Square.

148
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,004
All right, let's go.

149
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,688
Hey, what's happening to my mic?

150
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,312
Hey, buddy, beat it, will you?
I'm trying to work here.

151
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,439
Whoo!

152
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,452
Where's everyone going?

153
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are the Arkham Asylum Lunatics,

154
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,794
and we came here to blow some minds!

155
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,466
Sorry to interrupt your little show.

156
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,176
But you are gonna love this next one.

157
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,551
Introducing Mayor Pritchard,

158
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,389
Commissioner Reynolds,

159
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,724
Archbishop McGregor,
and this lady.

160
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,437
Whoever she is.

161
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,019
This is everybody.

162
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,104
Everybody, say hi.

163
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,149
Now, as you can see,

164
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,359
we're still waiting
for two guests of honor.

165
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,986
But in the meantime,

166
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,406
let's go over the rules
of tonight's entertainment, shall we?

167
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,407
Dynamite.

168
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,830
Trigger.

169
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,204
I don't get what I want,

170
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,417
boom.

171
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,919
Headless people.

172
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,051
And if any of you are thinking
of going anywhere,

173
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,548
you'll die, too.

174
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,553
Now, the one man
who can get me what I want.

175
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,722
Calling Gordon.

176
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,019
Calling Captain James Gordon.

177
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,149
I speak on behalf of myself

178
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,281
and all other gang leaders
in this city

179
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,868
when I say your arrogance
and disrespect

180
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,992
will no longer be tolerated.

181
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,997
You beat and then dragged
my brother from here

182
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,673
like a dog.

183
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,591
Your brother's an ass.

184
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,513
He abuses our staff and refuses
to pay his exorbitant tab.

185
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,464
He is my brother,

186
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,801
and he demands your respect.

187
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,099
And I suppose an apology
would be out of the question.

188
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,772
Your blood will be his apology.

189
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,436
Thought so.

190
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,333
I could have handled them.

191
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,880
That's the advantage of having
your own personal army, Tabs.

192
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,176
You don't have to.

193
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,424
Isn't that right?

194
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,847
What's wrong?

195
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,183
Ra's al Ghul chose you,

196
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,269
no one else, to pass on his spirit.

197
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,226
We will serve you, protect you,
of course,

198
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,357
but surely you intend to
continue his legacy,

199
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,689
and not just remain here
in this place.

200
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,073
What does that mean?

201
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,951
"Continue his legacy."

202
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,321
I like the sound of that.

203
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,574
As I told you,

204
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,535
we have much more to show you.

205
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,246
Are you ready?

206
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,754
Yes.

207
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,222
What the hell was that?

208
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,078
Gentlemen, ladies,

209
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,828
your assistance is urgently required.

210
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,501
Be careful,
these are very dangerous materials.

211
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,828
We're counting on it.

212
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,418
More laughing gas,
we need to make.

213
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,214
There's no time to waste.

214
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,766
We need it in bulk, you see.

215
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,639
Well...
Well, how much of it do you need?

216
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,514
Oh!

217
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,065
This much.

218
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,288
Ladies and gentlemen,
as I live and breathe,

219
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,543
James Gordon is in the house.

220
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,084
I'm not talking to you
until I can get up there

221
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,294
and check on the well-being
of your hostages.

222
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,967
First of all, Jim, you're late.

223
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:32,556
Secondly, I think I'm the one
who should be making demands.

224
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,635
Don't you?

225
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,730
What you're doing is an act
of terror, Valeska.

226
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,310
Ask our mayor
what this city's policy is

227
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,110
on negotiating with terrorists.

228
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,403
"Terrorists"?

229
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,989
Frankly, I'm offended.
No, no, no.

230
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,025
That's close enough, Gordon.

231
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,575
And none of you go anywhere, either.

232
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,672
Dead man's trigger.

233
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,383
This falls out of my hand

234
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,053
for any reason, and... Bang!

235
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,384
I got two empty chairs here.

236
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,095
You haven't even asked me
who they're for yet.

237
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,309
All right. I'll bite.
Who are they for?

238
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,890
Come on, James.

239
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,100
You're a detective.

240
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,151
Do some detecting.

241
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,897
Jeremiah, your brother.

242
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,779
Bingo. That's one.

243
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,451
And the other?

244
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,403
Well, the only other
irksome do-gooder

245
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,535
who's ever spoiled
my fun in this town.

246
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,451
Bruce Wayne.

247
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,413
No.

248
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,293
No?

249
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,916
You can take me.

250
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,844
I'll sit up there with one
of those things around my neck,

251
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,341
but I won't let you have him.

252
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,515
Oh, I don't want you, Jim.

253
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,934
I want my brother,

254
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,803
and I want Bruce.

255
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,313
I want them now.

256
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,437
All right, let me get these people
out of here, I'll come up there...

257
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,063
You are not listening to me.

258
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,195
And that is forcing my hand.

259
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:12,902
Jerome.

260
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,787
No!

261
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,251
Bring me my brother.

262
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,459
Bring me Wayne.

263
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,757
Bring them now.

264
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,440
I'll get some plates.

265
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,824
You know, for a billionaire,
your security system is lame.

266
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,998
Miss Kyle.

267
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,085
Thank you, Alfred.

268
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,332
Enjoy.

269
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,463
Thank you.

270
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,089
For what?

271
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,675
Visiting me on my birthday.

272
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,922
Oh!

273
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,391
I actually didn't know
it was your birthday,

274
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,312
I just happened to be strolling
in the neighborhood.

275
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,523
Either way, it's good to see you.

276
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,443
I knew it was an act.

277
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,492
What?

278
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,368
The brat,

279
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,293
and the drinking, the friends.

280
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,828
It was an act.

281
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,956
I think you're more sure
about that than me.

282
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,301
Master Bruce,

283
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,673
we have visitors.

284
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,258
Bruce, we need your help.

285
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,219
What happened?

286
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,099
<i>Don't you know it's rude
to keep a guy waiting?</i>

287
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,851
<i>Bring me my hostages, James.</i>

288
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,435
<i>My trigger finger is getting itchy.</i>

289
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,231
The hostages he wants
are his brother and you.

290
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,858
What, you're having a laugh.
No bloody way.

291
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,694
I don't like it any more
than you do,

292
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,120
but, Bruce, you have to trust me.

293
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,663
Lucius and I have a plan.

294
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,910
<i>You know what?</i>

295
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,746
<i>I don't think
you're taking me seriously enough.</i>

296
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,332
<i>Well, all right.</i>

297
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,047
<i>Let's see.</i>

298
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,125
<i>Eenie, meeny, miny, mo.</i>

299
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,802
<i>One of these people got to... Go.</i>

300
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,471
<i>Oh, it's that guy.</i>

301
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,847
<i>Oh, well.</i>

302
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,683
Did you see what just happened?

303
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,140
That man's a raving bloody lunatic.
He can't be trusted.

304
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,475
For once, I agree with Alfred.

305
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,776
Bruce, listen to me.

306
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,232
With your help,
we can prevent more deaths.

307
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,529
What's the plan?

308
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,488
Jerome is using
a short-wave radio trigger

309
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,663
with a dead man's switch.

310
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,785
If we can cut the signal,

311
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,457
he won't be able to activate
the explosives.

312
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,876
This emits a powerful signal

313
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,874
that disables all radio waves
close to it.

314
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,956
Once within a few feet
of Jerome's device,

315
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,210
his trigger will be useless.

316
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,883
It will give us the time
for the snipers

317
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,131
to get a clean shot on Jerome,
Firefly, and the others.

318
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,757
If I wear this, then that gives you
time to take them out?

319
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,929
Correct.

320
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,257
Are you sure it's gonna work?

321
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,225
I'm positive.

322
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,931
99% positive.

323
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,851
What are we waiting for?

324
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,057
Those people need our help.

325
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,483
Good man.

326
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,783
Ra's owned this house
for as long as the city has existed.

327
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,949
He said he kept his secrets in here.

328
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,655
Ancient secrets.

329
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,291
None of us have ever seen
what's behind this door.

330
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,039
It remains locked.

331
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,166
And there is no key.

332
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,172
Tried dynamite?

333
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,968
No need.

334
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,684
Our master chose you for a reason.

335
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,454
All my life,

336
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,633
I have known
that I was meant for more,

337
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,509
that there was something deep
inside of me that I couldn't explain.

338
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,611
I'm home.

339
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,793
Sir, we got target in sight.

340
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,829
<i>No way in from below the stage.</i>

341
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,253
<i>Four of my men have found positions.</i>

342
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,550
Good. Stay low, hang tight.

343
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,797
No hair triggers.

344
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,133
One missed shot means <i>adio's</i> Mayor.

345
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,889
<i>Copy that.</i>

346
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,599
Standing by.

347
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,558
I watched the news.
I know why you're here, Mr. Gordon.

348
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,104
And you must be out of your mind

349
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,774
if you think I'm gonna be led
like a lamb to slaughter.

350
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,819
I understand your concern,
but your brother doesn't bluff.

351
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,985
If we ignore his demands,
there's no telling what he might do.

352
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,157
We can block his remote signal
with this.

353
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,822
If you and Bruce can get
within a few feet of him,

354
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,246
it will disable his remote.
He'll be a siting duck.

355
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,789
Our snipers can take it from there.

356
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,207
For God's sake, Gordon.

357
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,704
You have to know what he wants.

358
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,462
To murder us both on live television.

359
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,211
Mr. Valeska.

360
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,462
I'm Bruce Wayne.

361
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,385
It's a pleasure to meet you.

362
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,887
Likewise.

363
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,760
I wish the circumstances were better.

364
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,682
May I ask what it is
you've been working on?

365
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:57,519
Yeah, it's a compact electrical
engine. It generates power.

366
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,267
Fascinating.
How much power?

367
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,978
Just two could light up every
building south of Westford Bridge.

368
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,731
You have a brilliant mind.

369
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,943
And we all hope we can soon
be rid of your brother,

370
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,073
so that you can carry out your work
free from fear.

371
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,662
I understand if you choose
not to help us today,

372
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,246
but I trust that Captain Gordon
and Mr. Fox

373
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,872
will see that no harm comes to me.

374
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,462
But, even if it does,

375
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,132
maybe by facing Jerome

376
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,763
I can show the people of Gotham
that standing up to terror

377
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,806
is the only way
to take its power away.

378
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,568
Well said.

379
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,900
- Harvey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

380
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,781
Just got word
that Freeze and Scarecrow

381
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,033
broke into Wayne Industries'
chemical lab.

382
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,330
Jerome's playing the long game here,

383
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,578
<i>but we're not gonna be sure what
it is unless we get ahead of him.</i>

384
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,704
The gas.

385
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,081
Penguin told me about
a new Scarecrow toxin.

386
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,379
Head over to the lab.
We're on our way to the square.

387
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,417
They've got a weapon.

388
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,835
Poison gas.

389
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,420
Okay, let's go.

390
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,679
Thank you.

391
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,555
You two.

392
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,487
Hey. Hey, buddy.

393
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,482
What happened?

394
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,775
What's so funny?

395
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,318
No, no, no, don't.

396
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,664
Ma'am, let me help you.

397
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,659
What happened?

398
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,040
They made us make it. Tons of it.

399
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,291
Where is it?

400
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,589
It's gone. They took it.

401
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:00,016
Well, look who decided to show up.

402
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,396
We were starting to get nervous,

403
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,353
especially the mayor here.

404
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,229
My guest of honor.

405
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,696
Please, take your seats on stage.

406
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,453
Come on.

407
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,292
Don't be shy.

408
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,370
It's all right.

409
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,218
We don't have all day.

410
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,762
It's activated.
Just let them get a little closer.

411
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,517
On my command.

412
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,149
<i>My men have all targets in view.</i>

413
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,186
Standing by.

414
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,985
Hi, brother.

415
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,414
Now.

416
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,925
Fire. All targets, fire.

417
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,219
I had my guys take up the best
vantage points last night.

418
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:26,898
So they've been watching
your little SWAT team all day.

419
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,063
Now, Bruce, brother dear.

420
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,364
Get up on stage.

421
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,445
Time to get this party
really started, huh?

422
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,088
What are you doing here?

423
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,836
This is a restricted area.

424
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,884
Our cargo is too precious to waste.

425
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,424
Let me give you something
I like to keep up my sleeves

426
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,099
for times just like these.

427
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,564
Oh, my God!

428
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,101
You can pilot
this contraption alone, sir?

429
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,311
Yes.

430
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,275
Then look into my eyes.

431
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,779
The kidnappings.

432
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,993
The concert in the square.

433
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,874
All to draw the biggest crowd,

434
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,576
so we can drop the laughing gas
on them.

435
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,170
This is madness.

436
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,338
I thought you'd appreciate
the beauty of it all.

437
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,335
But Jerome was right.

438
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,176
You know he anticipated
your betrayal?

439
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,219
That's right.

440
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,141
You went to Gordon.

441
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:46,682
Judas.

442
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,060
Tie him up.

443
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,436
Put him on the blimp.

444
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,234
Jerome wants him
to have a bird's-eye view.

445
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,362
This book tracks Ra's' legacy
dating back nine centuries.

446
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,948
Did you know he not only
overthrew governments,

447
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,704
but infiltrated royal families?

448
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,160
Ra's influenced history.

449
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,996
He was a cult leader.

450
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,256
And he still has them brainwashed.

451
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,041
And what about me, am I brainwashed?

452
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,506
There are things written here

453
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,088
that could change the way
we view the past forever.

454
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,475
Perhaps I'm the one
to bring that change to light.

455
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,937
Look.

456
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,358
This book was compiled
by shamans and mystics

457
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,605
from all over Eastern Asia
and the Middle East.

458
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,232
"Shamans and mystics."
Give me a break.

459
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,440
It contains formulas
for potions and incantations

460
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:41,820
set to raise demons.

461
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,867
To curse our enemies
and contact the dead.

462
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,195
This isn't you.

463
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,121
The Barbara I know would have
already sold all of this junk

464
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,823
- to the highest bidder.
- "Junk"?

465
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,205
This is my destiny.

466
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,787
And being with me and Selina
at the club, that isn't?

467
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,998
You begged me to partner with you.

468
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,966
Can't you see who that is up there?

469
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,510
That is me and Ra's 400 years ago.

470
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:02,758
Oh, please.

471
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,431
- That doesn't even look like you.
- It looks exactly like me.

472
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,598
It is me.

473
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,011
I have finally found my true purpose.

474
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,855
I'm not gonna let your jealousy
distract me.

475
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,184
Ladies, escort Ms. Galavan
to the street.

476
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,353
I'll show myself out.

477
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,940
Actually, I think it's time
my loyal servants

478
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,366
taught you some manners.

479
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,613
Why don't you do it?

480
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,990
Because I am the one true heir

481
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,493
of an immortal god's ancient dynasty.

482
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,244
And I don't dirty my fingers
with the likes of you anymore.

483
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,260
No parent will admit it.

484
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,010
But everyone's got their favorites.

485
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,766
Right, brother?

486
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,691
The one who cleans their room,

487
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,274
does their homework,
doesn't try to kill everybody.

488
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,904
Little Mr. Perfect here.

489
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,495
Yeah, he was that guy.

490
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,785
He got adopted by rich folks.

491
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,039
He went to the top schools,
then a top college.

492
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,836
Meanwhile, I got dragged
to the circus

493
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,835
by my depressed, alcoholic mother.

494
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,375
Forced to clean up
elephant dung every day.

495
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,676
Who cares?

496
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,093
Do you know how big
those things are, folks?

497
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,222
But I know something
that Mommy and Daddy,

498
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,936
they never knew.

499
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,771
You're as crazy as I am.

500
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,776
No.

501
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,401
It's in your DNA.

502
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:52,826
See,

503
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,497
we got the same blood
running through us.

504
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,955
We are practically identical.

505
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,586
You are a killer.

506
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,543
It's your nature.

507
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,343
Stop trying to fight it.

508
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,062
Take your best shot.

509
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,156
Hey, what the hell happened?

510
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,450
Snipers are dead.

511
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,330
Get up on the roof,
take as many as you can.

512
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,377
All right, just know a bunch
of chemicals are heading this way.

513
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,581
Scarecrow had the Wayne chemists
mix it up.

514
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,300
That's why he's been stalling.

515
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,718
He wants a big crowd.

516
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,887
He's gonna release the laughing gas
right here.

517
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,764
We need to evacuate the area.

518
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,261
Get these people out of here.

519
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,560
Do whatever you have to.
Get them out of here.

520
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,929
Time to kill this maniac
once and for all.

521
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,357
That was so good! I love you.

522
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,398
Hey, hey! Look! Up in the sky!

523
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,258
Holy crap.

524
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,095
Excuse me, sir. Could you help me?

525
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,431
No can do, sport.

526
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:27,064
Gotta get this rig into position
for the boss.

527
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,104
And where is that?

528
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,355
Paisley Square.

529
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,526
Almost there.

530
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,781
Then I can drop the load

531
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,989
with this lever.

532
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,670
You turn this thing around right now!

533
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,996
Can you not see that...

534
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,631
Like I said, pal,

535
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,335
no can do.

536
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:10,986
<i>It's coming.</i>

537
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,109
Get into position.

538
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,033
Holy moly.

539
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,491
Holy moly.

540
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,285
Jim, are you seeing this?

541
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,166
Yeah, get everyone out of here.

542
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,463
<i>I'm going after Jerome.</i>

543
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,795
I can take it down with a shot.

544
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,839
And risk spilling the chemicals?

545
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,678
Oh, yeah, right.

546
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,891
Oswald?

547
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,438
<i>Jim! Jim, help me.</i>

548
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,646
They knocked me out,
and now I am in some blimp

549
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,227
with that horrible gas.

550
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,153
And the pilot,
he's been hypnotized.

551
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,485
You're on the blimp?

552
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,908
Yes. Yes, you have to help me.

553
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,279
No, you're gonna help us.

554
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,205
You're near the river.

555
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,827
I need you to steer it over there.

556
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,710
Steer a blimp?

557
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,580
Are you out of your mind, Jim?

558
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,382
I don't even drive my own car.

559
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,169
If you don't, thousands will die.
Maybe worse.

560
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,338
What's worse than that?

561
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:22,015
How can you run an empire
in a city full of lunatics?

562
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,520
Hands up.

563
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,983
Beautiful, isn't she?

564
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,861
Just give me a second.

565
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,576
Gotta call Tyler,
tell him he's in position.

566
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,329
<i>Yes?</i>

567
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,332
- Not cool.
<i>- Jerome?</i>

568
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,212
<i>Jerome?</i>

569
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,211
<i>I'm in position...</i>

570
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,883
Doesn't matter.

571
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,882
Too late anyway.

572
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:00,963
Bombs away!

573
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,643
Funny.

574
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,274
No!

575
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,829
Come on.

576
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,875
Now, come on.

577
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,834
Up! Up! Up!

578
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,842
Oh, okay. All right.

579
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,097
Okay, okay. Okay...

580
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,147
River. River... Where is the river?

581
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,029
Quite the dilemma, Jim.

582
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,153
Are you gonna let me fall and die...

583
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,492
Or are you gonna pull me up
and arrest me?

584
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:10,829
What's it gonna be?

585
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,964
A lawman or a murderer?

586
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,435
Good old Gordon.

587
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,558
Always playing by the rules.

588
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,769
That's why I'll outlive you.

589
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,560
That's why I'm loved,

590
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,070
'cause I don't give a damn
about the rules.

591
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,898
It's a long way down.

592
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,654
You sure you'll outlive me?

593
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,235
Oh, I'm sure.

594
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,783
'Cause I'm more than a man.

595
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,991
I'm an idea, a philosophy.

596
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,452
And I will live on in the shadows,

597
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,879
within Gotham's discontent.

598
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,836
You'll be seeing me soon.

599
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,254
<i>Au revoir.</i>

600
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,776
Never thought I'd see this.

601
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,407
Sure he's dead. I can't believe.

602
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,613
Is he?

603
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,039
Yeah.

604
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,829
Get back.

605
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,460
GCPD. Everybody get back.

606
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,569
Mr. Valeska.

607
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:15,079
I meant what I said about your work
being of importance to the city.

608
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,419
Let Wayne Enterprises fund your work
with a grant.

609
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,543
Thank you.

610
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,853
Captain.

611
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,991
Oswald.

612
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,151
Um...

613
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,619
Hello.

614
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,866
Still here.

615
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,241
Will someone please get me
the hell off this thing?

616
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,332
We're on it.

617
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,838
How do we get a blimp down safely
from over a river?

618
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,089
You asking me?

619
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,762
I say we let him stew up there
for a few more hours.

620
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,804
We'll get a hold of
the standby pilot.

621
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,181
<i>Have him advise.
Sit tight, all right?</i>

622
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,428
Oh!

623
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,306
And Oswald Cobblepot,

624
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,482
Gotham thanks you.

625
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,060
Wait, Jim. Jim?

626
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,650
Jim? Jim.

627
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,231
Jim!

628
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,775
Jim!

629
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,539
Never touch me again.

630
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,128
Ms. Kean has a new path to take now.

631
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,672
- It no longer involves you.
- Is that so?

632
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,250
We will accept you leaving this city
and never coming back.

633
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,178
The only thing I'll accept
is you kissing my ass.

634
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,256
We have been trained
by the League of Shadows

635
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,763
in 90 different forms of combat
since we were five years old.

636
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,186
Oh, yeah? Which one of you bitches
wants to go first?

637
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,738
Next time, we kill you.

638
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,101
Let me help you.

639
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,564
Who the hell are you guys?

640
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,525
The ones that have been watching you
and Barbara Kean,

641
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,576
the impostor, for quite some time.

642
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,242
We serve
the one and only true master,

643
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,831
Ra's al Ghul.

644
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,870
But he's dead.

645
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,453
Death is only an illusion.

646
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,505
<i>Hello, brother.</i>

647
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:35,631
<i>Didn't think you can get rid of me
so easily, did you?</i>

648
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,589
<i>See, my days were numbered,
but you...</i>

649
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,593
<i>Oh, you can continue on for me.</i>

650
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,894
<i>Be my ultimate revenge.</i>

651
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,566
<i>So, calm yourself. Don't fight it.</i>

652
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,483
<i>Breathe it in.</i>

653
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,654
<i>This gas was a special mixture
I had made</i>

654
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,447
<i>just for you.</i>

655
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,697
