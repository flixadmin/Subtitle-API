1
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:17,105
Bianca!

2
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:46,628
Bianca Bertinelli?

3
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,692
Who the hell are you?

4
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:50,305
Your life's in danger. I'm gonna
need you to come with me now.

5
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:53,391
My night's just getting started. Bye.

6
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,449
Get off.

7
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:12,562
Help!

9
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:08,225
Seeking his third straight
term, Mayor Ramirez

10
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:11,994
has declared Star City the
safest city in the country.

11
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:14,413
In other news, the vigilante
museum has received

12
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,549
a generous 7-figure donation

13
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:18,576
from Victor and Maria Bertinelli.

14
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:19,843
What are you doing?

15
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:21,837
Babe! You scared me.

16
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:25,299
I'm just the guy who you share
your bed with most nights.

17
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,961
Remember me?

18
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:29,754
How could I forget? Your
snoring always reminds me.

19
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:30,829
I don't snore.

20
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:33,896
Look, I know you hate to be
anything less than perfect,

21
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:36,569
but you do, like old man style.

22
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:38,371
- Ha ha. Right.
- Ha ha!

23
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,170
I got up early to
finish writing my speech.

24
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:47,580
Wait. Is there something
special happening today?

25
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:49,174
Funny. Ha ha!

26
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:52,052
A gift for the graduate.

27
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,810
What's happening?

28
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:06,691
Mia Queen, I love you

29
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:09,269
more than anything in the whole world.

30
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:11,029
Will you marry me?

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,836
Please say yes.

32
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:17,935
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah?

33
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:19,546
Of course. I love you so much.

34
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,584

Dinah, this is where you've been living?

48
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:28,732
Well, it's right above the bar,

49
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:31,759
and it has got a hell of a view.

50
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:35,930
Black Canary and the Captain
of SCPD now owns a bar.

51
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:37,490
Also, when did you learn to sing?

52
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:40,083
We didn't have much time
for karaoke back in 2020,

53
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:42,269
did we?

54
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:44,980
So how did you find me? Sara?

55
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:47,984
She said that she found
you here a couple months ago

56
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:50,264
and that you didn't want
to come back with her.

57
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:55,208
The day after Oliver's funeral in 2020,

58
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,632
I woke up here.

59
00:04:57,634 --> 00:04:59,471
I had no idea how or why.

60
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,656
When I got here,

61
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:03,499
I found out that I don't even exist.

62
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:05,477
I'm sorry. How is that even possible?

63
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,645
I don't know, but there is

64
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:08,838
no trace of Dinah Drake
or the Black Canary.

65
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,341
And what, you're just fine with that?

66
00:05:12,343 --> 00:05:15,228
I guess I came to realize that

67
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,471
not having an identity can either be sad

68
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:19,657
or it can be oddly freeing.

69
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:23,307
I can let go of the people I lost,

70
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,068
mistakes that I made.

71
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,190
I'm not gonna lie. Your Zen
is kind of creeping me out.

72
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,417
Thank you.

73
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:33,099
You know, there has been
no real crime in Star City

74
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,339
in 20 years, Laurel.

75
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:36,508
And Zen's not that hard to come by.

76
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,176
Well, I hate to break it to you,

77
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:41,054
but Star City isn't safe anymore.

78
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:45,350
Bianca Bertinelli's been abducted.

79
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:47,185
Helena's daughter.

80
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:50,101
The socialite. Why... Why
would anybody want to hurt her?

81
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:52,493
Money, revenge, something
to do with Helena.

82
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:56,467
Who the hell knows? D, I
need you to help me find her.

83
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,771
You really came all
the way to the future

84
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:01,157
to rescue a kidnapped socialite?

85
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:07,986
- What am I looking at?
- Star City 2041.

86
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:09,523
This is a year from now.

87
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:12,356
It's not possible. The city's safe.

88
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:13,645
It doesn't stay that way.

89
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,738
Because Bianca
Bertinelli gets kidnapped?

90
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,364
No. Because she dies.

91
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:19,871
3 days from now, her
body is found in the bay,

92
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:21,243
her killer never caught.

93
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:22,367
The city falls apart.

94
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:24,798
Everything that Oliver
sacrificed his life for.

95
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,877
I thought this part of
my life was done, Laurel.

96
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,190
Then don't do it for
you. Do it for Oliver.

97
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:38,478
Okay.

98
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,146
For Oliver.

99
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:42,913
Good. Now there's one
more person we need

100
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,153
who's well-connected.

101
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,456
- And who is that?
- I'll inform you on the way.

102
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:50,490
You do have something
nicer to wear, right?

103
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,325
♪ Lookin' over you ♪

104
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,944
♪ Is something I do ♪

105
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:58,381
♪ Finally had to look... ♪

106
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:02,218
Ms. Queen, when is the wedding date?

107
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,966
What are you going to do
now that you've graduated?

108
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,247
Not sure yet on both counts.

109
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,599
What would your dad
think about your life choices?

110
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:14,046
My father saved Star City
so that we can enjoy it,

111
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,145
and he also never graduated college,

112
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:18,067
so I think he'd be pretty impressed.

113
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,019
Ms. Queen? Ms. Queen...

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,976
It was my Mom's.

115
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,861
JJ knew I'd want the family ring.

116
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:30,931
He's honestly the most
thoughtful guy in the world.

117
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,065
Can I just say what
an amazing man of honor

118
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,784
I'm gonna make at your wedding?

119
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:36,485
William!

120
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:39,006
Zoe, hi!

121
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,862
I hope you don't mind me crashing.

122
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:43,107
Never. It is so good to see you.

123
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:44,776
Where's Keven?

124
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:48,362
No. I thought he was the one.

125
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:51,754
Yeah. Well, apparently only
having one partner was his problem.

126
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:53,811
But it's fine. This is your day.

127
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:56,147
And speaking of,
tomorrow there's gonna be

128
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:57,977
an office for you at Smoak Tech.

129
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,484
How many times do I have to tell you,

130
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:01,561
tech is not really my passion?

131
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:03,194
What is your passion exactly?

132
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:04,612
I don't know.

133
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,566
Because you can't
be a socialite forever.

134
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:08,517
Hmm, she technically can.

135
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,278
No. No, I'm sorry. She
is way too smart for that.

136
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,032
Okay, can I just enjoy tonight

137
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,635
before I have to start adulting?

138
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:16,834
Fine. But I need a drink.

139
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,001
I just want to thank
you all for coming tonight.

140
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:26,630
You are my life.

141
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:30,427
I particularly want to thank
JJ for always having my back.

142
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:31,613
I love you so much.

143
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:32,681
- Aw.
- Aw.

144
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,185
And William.

145
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:36,688
I could not imagine life without you.

146
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,775
Thank you for always
tolerating your little sister,

147
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:43,436
even when I did draw all over
your walls when I was 5. Heh!

148
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,554
- To the class of 2040.
- 2040!

149
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:48,057
Whoo!

150
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:56,708
Is it all right for me to be here?

151
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,909
I'm sure it's okay. Hey.

152
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:01,302
I thought you were
still in rehab, Connor.

153
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:02,714
What's the matter, trust fund?

154
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,198
You don't want me at
your fancy little party?

155
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,700
As long as you don't punch
anyone or set anything on fire,

156
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:07,910
we'll be okay.

157
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:11,806
Can we just try to get
along for one night, please?

158
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:15,542
- Be right back.
- Okay.

159
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:17,895
Hey, Trev, have you seen Bianca?

160
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,735
She was supposed to be here an hour ago.

161
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:21,801
Heh! No, I'm not her keeper anymore.

162
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:23,425
Okay, I thought you guys were still cool.

163
00:09:23,427 --> 00:09:24,885
No, we are, but even
when we were together,

164
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:26,428
she never told me where she was.

165
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,938
But you were the last
to see her, weren't you?

166
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,918
Excuse me?

167
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,408
Your number was the last one she texted.

168
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,563
Uh, who the hell are you?

169
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:33,027
Wait. Is something wrong with Bianca?

170
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,271
I don't know. You tell us.

171
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,780
Ah...

172
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:40,087
You can't just crash my
party and harass my guests.

173
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,276
Do you know who I am?

174
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:42,828
A lot more than you do.

175
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,756
We were friends of your parents.

176
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:47,074
Then how come I've never
seen either of you before?

177
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:49,410
Long story and less than
zero time to explain.

178
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:51,095
Your friend Bianca, she's in trouble.

179
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:53,313
And we need your help to find her.

180
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,508
Yeah. I'm calling security.

181
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,178
Oh. I'm sorry to take
you out of your bubble,

182
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,147
but we really need you.

183
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,688
I know how to protect myself.

184
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,899
- You made sure of that.
- I sure did.

185
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,319
The 4 of you are the
heroes that the city needs.

186
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,329
Hyah!

187
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:18,906
We are staring at our father alive!

188
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:22,034
Dad. So what's next?

189
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:24,265
Mar Novu has seen my fate.

190
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:26,923
- Dad...
- I don't survive Crisis.

191
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,246
Mia, come on. Mia?

192
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:43,045
- Back off.
- Um, I'm sorry. You fainted.

193
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:57,560
Are you okay?

194
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:59,711
Oh, my God.

195
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:05,348
Sorry. Uh, sorry. I... I
guess I had too much to drink

196
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,092
without eating or something.

197
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:09,457
Maybe you should lie down, party animal.

198
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:10,837
Think I need some air.

199
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,649
- Hey, Mia, listen...
- Ooh. No.

200
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:29,980
What the hell did you do to me?

201
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,233
I would love to know that myself.

202
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,319
There's this guy, J'onn J'onzz.

203
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,869
He's a Martian or something.

204
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:38,957
He's why we remember everything
that happened before the Crisis.

205
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,575
Cisco was able to replicate

206
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:43,128
the Martian's powers using tech.

207
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,413
So a friend of Supergirl's has a power

208
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:47,039
a friend of the Flash can replicate.

209
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,870
Yeah. That's what I said.

210
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:50,877
I want to say that you guys are crazy

211
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,562
and that none of this is possible,

212
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,589
but I know you're right.

213
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:56,817
I remember everything,

214
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:58,977
you two fighting alongside my dad,

215
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:02,073
Zoe dying, my...

216
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:04,075
My fiancé killing her.

217
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,496
I remember my father dying.

218
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,268
Why would you do this to me?

219
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,313
Look, there'll be time
for emotions later.

220
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,946
I woke you up because your
friend Bianca was kidnapped.

221
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,623
There hasn't been any crime
in Star City in 20 years.

222
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,576
What is that, like the city's motto now?

223
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,369
You don't know Bianca, all right?

224
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:28,315
She's flaky. She's probably on
a beach somewhere having a ball.

225
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,808
I saw her, and she was taken.

226
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,125
How are you even hesitating?

227
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:33,244
Aren't you supposed
to be the Green Arrow?

228
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,272
Not anymore.

229
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:37,244
Mia, I understand that you are torn

230
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:38,747
between two worlds right now,

231
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:39,834
but we need your help.

232
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:40,861
Look, I don't even know

233
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:42,364
if I can do this anymore, okay?

234
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,027
I haven't trained. I don't...

235
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,327
See? Just like riding a bike.

236
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,532
Is Bianca actually in trouble?

237
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:57,063
Yes. And if we don't
find her, she's going to die.

238
00:12:57,065 --> 00:13:00,401
Fine. I will help you.

239
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:03,282
But this is a one-time thing, okay?

240
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,749
I'm not interested in joining

241
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,244
your Canary Club, all right?

242
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:08,397
I have a life now, I am happy,

243
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,879
and I would like to keep it that way.

244
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:10,945
Whatever.

245
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,500
Well, where was Bianca
when she was taken?

246
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:14,290
Partying at Club V.

247
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:17,053
Nothing Bianca loved
more than a good party.

248
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:18,635
Oh, to be in my 20s again.

249
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:22,139
Ick. Hard pass. I was married at 21.

250
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:25,293
Seriously? Who are you?

251
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,569
Bianca. She was adopted.

252
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:29,257
Any chance that created tension?

253
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:31,923
Helena was a great mom
before she disappeared.

254
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:33,976
She lives with her
great-aunt and uncle now.

255
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,821
Back in the old Star
City, the Bertinellis were

256
00:13:35,823 --> 00:13:37,632
one of the biggest
crime families around.

257
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,244
Well, that sounds like enough reason

258
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:41,320
to violate some privacy laws.

259
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,531
It's time for you

260
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:47,034
to pay that family a little visit.

261
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:52,206
I'm sorry Bianca missed your
party. You know how she is.

262
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,563
Free spirit.

263
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,426
Totally. Actually,

264
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:58,596
I wanted to speak with you about that.

265
00:13:58,598 --> 00:14:01,215
I think Bianca might be
in some kind of trouble.

266
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:02,675
What kind of trouble?

267
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:06,012
Mia's in position. D, you're up.

268
00:14:06,014 --> 00:14:08,681
- You ready?
- Never not.

269
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:10,871
I think Bianca might have been taken.

270
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:12,850
Ha ha! That's ridiculous.

271
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,395
You know how safe it is here.

272
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:16,404
I haven't been able
to contact her in days.

273
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:17,532
Her social media is quiet,

274
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:19,025
and she's not even posting those videos

275
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:20,377
she's always addicted to making.

276
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:21,878
I wouldn't worry about it.

277
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,279
In a couple days, we're gonna find out

278
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:24,714
she's been, uh, what partying

279
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:26,532
off the coast of Corto
Maltese or something.

280
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,909
Dinah, what's your progress?

281
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,607
3 more rooms to go.

282
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,555
You're about to have company,

283
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,550
one of the help, I'm guessing.

284
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:37,813
Mia, we need a distraction.

285
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,471
Wouldn't it be better
to be safe than sorry?

286
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:42,548
I mean, maybe since we're here,

287
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,706
if we call the police...
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

288
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,594
Get Remy!

289
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:47,696
Remy?

290
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:53,451
Remy, we've got an emergency.

291
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:59,774
Do us a favor. Stop
worrying about Bianca.

292
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,233
She's fine.

293
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,639
Okay, I will.

294
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:04,004
I'm clear.

295
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:06,097
Please tell me you got
those eyes and ears placed.

296
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:07,281
All of them.

297
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:08,783
We can see and hear everything

298
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:10,284
that goes down in that house.

299
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,899
Good. I'll meet you at the bar.

300
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:13,954
I want to talk to Bianca's
friends, see what they know.

301
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,563
- You want company?
- Ha ha.

302
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:18,111
And have to explain who you
two are again? No, thanks.

303
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:23,273
You know, I could get used
to all this free alcohol.

304
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:26,017
So that means you will not
be paying your tab downstairs.

305
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,560
I thought it was a friends
drink for free kind of place.

306
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,355
They say anything interesting yet?

307
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:32,792
A couple stock tips, where to vacation,

308
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:34,475
nothing that helps.

309
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:37,120
Ohh, man. This is one hell of a view.

310
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:39,365
I can see why you hide out here.

311
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:41,740
Subtle. I am not hiding.

312
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,319
I told you, the world
doesn't remember who I am.

313
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:46,112
Don't you remember you?

314
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:48,531
I really don't expect you to understand.

315
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:49,833
Try me.

316
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:51,443
I mean, isn't this what friends do?

317
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:54,954
They sit around and drink,
talk about their problems.

318
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:59,125
Okay, well, when I first ended up here,

319
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:02,720
I spent a lot of time asking myself why.

320
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:04,265
It took a while, but I think

321
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,484
I finally understand the answer.

322
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,303
This is the universe's way of telling me

323
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,180
I'm not supposed to be a hero.

324
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,149
Why? Because you didn't get a gold star?

325
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:18,220
Because in this version of the
future, the one where I'm not a hero,

326
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:19,687
everyone is better off.

327
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:22,026
Mia's happ... Mia was happy

328
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:23,899
until we dragged her into this.

329
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,486
Zoe's alive because she's not a Canary.

330
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:30,489
And all of a sudden,
what, you're gun shy?

331
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,842
Zoe didn't die because she was a Canary.

332
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:35,420
She died because she
was a hero, because you

333
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:39,331
inspired her and a bunch
of other women just like her

334
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,658
to fight for something
greater than themselves,

335
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,261
myself included.

336
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,340
What, are you guys on
a break or something?

337
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,301
It's called surveillance.

338
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:51,736
How did it go with Bianca's friends?

339
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:52,878
Let me guess.

340
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,939
"Oh, Bianca was just being Bianca.

341
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:57,108
And, oh, my gosh, what
shoes am I gonna wear?"

342
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,776
They didn't know anything.

343
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:00,703
And, by the way, 3 of
them went to Harvard.

344
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,280
That's awesome.

345
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:09,069
Oh, Logan Bertinelli
just got chatty. Hang on.

346
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:13,574
He's worried about something,
"Taking precautions",

347
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:16,647
specifically moving
"it" out of the city.

348
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,888
What are the odds "it" is Bianca?

349
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,248
Logan's an ass, but he
wouldn't kidnap his cousin.

350
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,536
Well, there's only one way to find out.

351
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:25,270
Let's suit up.

352
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:28,919
You earned it.

353
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:30,716
I'm not wearing that.

354
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:33,275
- Why? It's yours.
- It's my father's.

355
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:35,944
She shouldn't have to wear it
if she doesn't want to, Laurel.

356
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,613
Fine.

357
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:20,950
What the hell are you guys waiting for?

358
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:22,198
Secure our friggin' position.

359
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,505
You go get Bianca, and we'll

360
00:18:23,507 --> 00:18:24,770
take care of Logan and his friends.

361
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:27,123
- What?
- You'll be fine.

362
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,741
Bianca's not here.

363
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:12,828
Looks like some kind
of chemical or drug.

364
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,129
I... I give up, okay?

365
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:18,383
Run!

366
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,553
Well, that could've gone better.

367
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,869
You've got some nerve
leaving me alone out there.

368
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,755
What if I hadn't
remembered how to fight?

369
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,998
But you did. You're welcome.

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,196
I could've died.

371
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:49,449
Okay, that's a little dramatic.
We were there the whole time.

372
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:50,785
D, some help, please?

373
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,344
It was pretty risky, Laurel.

374
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:54,494
How about less talking
about your hurt feelings

375
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:56,885
and more talking about
the fact that your fiancé

376
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,845
just became suspect number one?

377
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,670
There is no way this is JJ.

378
00:20:00,672 --> 00:20:03,424
The guy who attacked
us in the Deathstroke mask?

379
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:05,310
You do know who Deathstroke is, right?

380
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:07,204
It could've been anyone under that mask.

381
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,004
It does seem like a
pretty big coincidence,

382
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:10,559
especially given who JJ was before.

383
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,150
I mean, he used to lead them.

384
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:13,787
Yeah, and I used to be a cage fighter.

385
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:15,379
That is not who I am anymore,

386
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,309
and that is clearly not who JJ is.

387
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:18,487
Are you really that naive?

388
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:20,367
Are you really that judgmental?

389
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:21,868
You don't even have the
slightest bit of doubt

390
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,539
that JJ is the one who
is behind that mask?

391
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,249
No.

392
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:29,084
Prove it.

393
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:32,087
Mia Queen. These are my Plus-2.

394
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,217
See? A much better idea
than punching our way in.

395
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:40,210
A lot less fun, though. Mia,
you sure you're up for this?

396
00:20:40,212 --> 00:20:42,889
I'm here, aren't I?
JJ's office is in back.

397
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:44,391
Dinah, you take cameras.

398
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:46,389
Mia, go distract your fiancé.

399
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:49,059
You sure you're okay?

400
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,580
Yeah. It's the strangest thing.

401
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:55,402
I have all these
memories of my old life,

402
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:58,238
but I have my new ones, too.

403
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,259
I just really don't want it to be him.

404
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:09,433
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

405
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,677
Oh, yeah. I was starting to worry.

406
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,437
You left in a hurry earlier.

407
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,297
Yeah, I wasn't feeling well.

408
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,941
"Actually, I just remembered

409
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,517
you were a dangerous murderer,

410
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,192
probably a kidnapper, too".

411
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:21,612
Hey, be nice, Laurel.

412
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,807
- I need a drink.
- Yeah.

413
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:24,964
- Yeah.
- Come on.

414
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:26,466
There's only one guard at the door.

415
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,555
This should be easy.
Where are we on cameras?

416
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:30,145
Almost there.

417
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,496
In the meantime,

418
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,141
why don't we go back to
talking about Mia's love life?

419
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:35,317
Let's not.

420
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,202
You know I dated your dad, right?

421
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:40,292
- Well, a version of him anyway.
- Gross.

422
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:43,101
My Oliver also went down on the Gambit,

423
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,794
also cheated with my sister.

424
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:46,244
Please stop talking.

425
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:48,455
People are who they are, Mia,

426
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:50,665
no matter what timeline,
universe, or Earth,

427
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,476
and that's not your fault.

428
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,320
Was that supposed to be
some kind of pep talk?

429
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,340
Cameras are down.

430
00:21:58,342 --> 00:22:00,508
That's my cue.

431
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,887
This area is restricted.

432
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:05,305
Oh, I was just gonna
step out and get some air.

433
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:07,199
Trust me, I am not an art thief.

434
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,067
Well, you're welcome to step outside.

435
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,224
Okay, let's not cause
a scene here, Laurel.

436
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:14,079
- I'll do it.
- Fine.

437
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:19,194
No offense, Mia,

438
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:20,861
but if I couldn't get in there,

439
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:23,883
do you really think that
you're gonna be able to just...

440
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,847
Oh, you were saying?

441
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,426
I'm in. Now what do I need to do?

442
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:36,336
Just put the device
anywhere near the computer.

443
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:39,023
It'll transfer the
data from your search.

444
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:46,697
It's working.

445
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,106
Run a search for the Bertinellis.

446
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:49,441
Maybe we'll get lucky.

447
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,694
Uh, something's wrong.

448
00:22:57,693 --> 00:23:00,567
Mia, you need to get out of there now.

449
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:05,405
Hey, step away from the computer.

450
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:06,574
Mia, what are you doing in here?

451
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:07,592
Where is she?

452
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:10,930
I'll take it from here.

453
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,892
What is going on with you?

454
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,468
You break into my office,

455
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,919
and you hack my computer?

456
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:19,921
I know you have Bianca.

457
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:21,923
That's what this is about?

458
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:25,260
You think that I kidnapped her?

459
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:28,430
Do you know how crazy that sounds?

460
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:30,148
You're calling me crazy now. Wow.

461
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,909
Because you are being crazy.

462
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,577
Okay, if you have nothing to hide,

463
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,895
then show me what's in these files.

464
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,925
Our honeymoon.

465
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:51,336
You said that you always
wanted to visit Fiji.

466
00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:53,505
I was hoping I could surprise you.

467
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,893
Namaste.

468
00:23:59,895 --> 00:24:01,470
Can I call you crazy now?

469
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:04,257
Bianca? What the hell?

470
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,426
I have to get back to the party.

471
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:08,208
Okay. Let me explain.

472
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,823
JJ.

473
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:17,038
Bianca looks pretty happy to
be kidnapped, don't you think?

474
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,095
Turn off your socialite
brain and use your gut.

475
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:22,238
Don't you think that
video's a little convenient?

476
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,889
I think whoever posted that is trying

477
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:25,663
to keep people from looking for Bianca.

478
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:27,225
We should analyze it, you know,

479
00:24:27,227 --> 00:24:28,660
see what clues we can
get in finding her.

480
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:30,937
Okay, I just accused
my fiancé for nothing.

481
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:32,364
Oh, he'll get over it.

482
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:35,342
Or you'll move on to someone
who wasn't a homicidal maniac

483
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:37,277
in another life. Win-win.

484
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,442
Oh, frak you.

485
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,370
Okay, that's enough. I think
we just need to calm down...

486
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:42,499
No. I am not the one who cares more

487
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:44,001
about my relationship problems

488
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:45,869
than my friend who might die.

489
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:48,338
Do you not see how selfish you're being?

490
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,625
Me? You're the one who's using my friend

491
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:54,011
to drag me and Dinah back
into this superhero crap

492
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:57,923
just because you can't handle
the fact that Star City's fine

493
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:00,184
and doesn't need you to be
the Black Canary anymore.

494
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:02,636
And here I thought making
you remember your old life

495
00:25:02,638 --> 00:25:05,540
would open your eyes to
how pointless and stupid

496
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:07,307
your new one is.

497
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:09,935
My stupid and pointless
life is the one that

498
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:12,121
my father sacrificed himself to give me.

499
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:13,997
Don't you dare trivialize that.

500
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:16,074
Okay, I think all Laurel
was trying to say is

501
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:18,151
that Bianca's out there,
and she's in danger.

502
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:19,461
Bianca is fine.

503
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,848
You had no right to make me remember.

504
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,218
All that did is bring back
the suffering and the loss,

505
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,887
because that's all being a hero is.

506
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,453
I would've met you at your place.

507
00:25:42,455 --> 00:25:45,422
I needed the drive.

508
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:47,381
I hope that I

509
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:49,825
didn't screw up your event too badly.

510
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:51,937
I wish it was just the
event that you'd screwed up.

511
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:53,403
JJ, I'm sorry.

512
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:56,982
You accused me of kidnapping our friend.

513
00:25:56,984 --> 00:25:59,748
How in the world do you think
I could do something like that?

514
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,348
You were keeping things from me.

515
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,840
I guess I just jumped to conclusions.

516
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:08,955
Jumping to conclusions
is... is I'm cheating on you,

517
00:26:08,957 --> 00:26:10,254
not that I'm a kidnapper.

518
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:11,830
And for the record, I'm neither.

519
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:13,849
I know that.

520
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,592
Can we please just go back to a time

521
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:18,091
before I accused you
of being a criminal?

522
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:20,064
I get it now.

523
00:26:22,384 --> 00:26:25,385
This never had anything
to do with Bianca.

524
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:27,271
What are you talking about?

525
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:30,631
You have never really had to
commit to anything in your life.

526
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:33,369
That's why you brush off
your brother's job offers.

527
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:36,521
And it's why you hesitated
saying yes to my proposal.

528
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:38,857
It's why you're pushing
me away right now.

529
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:40,567
You don't want to marry me.

530
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:41,796
That is not true.

531
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:43,854
Then how come ever since the party...

532
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:47,358
Ever since I proposed to you, it's like

533
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,212
you're seeing someone else
when you're looking at me?

534
00:26:55,917 --> 00:27:00,068
When I look at you, I
see the rest of my life.

535
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,565
I can't marry someone
who doesn't feel the same.

536
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:04,758
John, please.

537
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,718
I... no.

538
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,904
I think it's best we take some space.

539
00:27:16,488 --> 00:27:17,938
We're running out of time.

540
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,612
Please tell me you're close to
finding something on that video.

541
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:22,233
Our hunch was right.

542
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:23,950
There's evidence the image was altered.

543
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:26,370
I'm running a decryption program,
but it's gonna take a bit.

544
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:29,359
Since when did you learn to
do all this Felicity stuff?

545
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,261
I was a police captain,
Laurel. I have tricks,

546
00:27:32,263 --> 00:27:35,341
like knowing when someone's
not telling me everything,

547
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:37,007
for example.

548
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:38,600
Like you.

549
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:40,293
What?

550
00:27:40,295 --> 00:27:43,124
You've been pushing Mia
real hard, which is weird,

551
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:45,924
because normally, you keep a
fairly healthy snark-filled distance

552
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:47,776
from caring too much about anything.

553
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:49,445
This is personal.

554
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:51,113
Look, I wasted a lot of time

555
00:27:51,115 --> 00:27:53,190
pretending to be something I wasn't

556
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:56,118
because it was easier, and I don't
want Mia making the same mistake.

557
00:27:57,793 --> 00:28:01,272
You know, part of empathy isn't only
understanding other people's pain.

558
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:05,003
It's also sharing your own. You
know how hard it is to be a hero.

559
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:07,506
I mean, hell, I'm
struggling with it right now.

560
00:28:07,508 --> 00:28:09,873
Imagine what she's going through.

561
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:12,659
The last time Mia put on
that Green Arrow suit was

562
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,285
the day Oliver died.

563
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:18,307
The program's finished.

564
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:24,170
Oh, boy.

565
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:25,964
Whoever did this wanted people to think

566
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:27,977
she was safe on vacation.

567
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:30,060
They didn't know they
were giving us a lead.

568
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:31,970
Well, thank God for morons.

569
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:33,805
I got to figure out where this is.

570
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:36,349
But for the record,
I think you're right.

571
00:28:36,351 --> 00:28:38,068
If there is evil back in Star City,

572
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,329
the Green Arrow should be here, too.

573
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,507
Oh, God. Are you crying?

574
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:57,845
What the hell are you doing here?

575
00:28:57,847 --> 00:29:03,100
I guess it's that feelings
thing or whatever.

576
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:04,678
Look, I'm sorry.

577
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,882
JJ broke up with me, if you even care.

578
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:12,844
I do care. You're strong
enough to get through this.

579
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:15,140
You're strong enough to get through
anything. I've seen you do it.

580
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:16,534
Is that why you woke me up?

581
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:26,375
Mia, I spent so much of my
life choosing the easy path.

582
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:29,953
And for me, that meant
becoming Black Siren

583
00:29:29,955 --> 00:29:35,551
and destroying things
and killing people.

584
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:37,294
It's not a good look.

585
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:39,537
That's not exactly what I'm doing here.

586
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:43,041
Okay, but can you honestly tell me
that you were happy with your life

587
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:45,084
before I woke you up? Truly?

588
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:47,601
I spent my whole life

589
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:50,482
looking at these pictures of my dad,

590
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:53,218
all of the amazing things
he did for the city,

591
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,095
what a hero he was,

592
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:59,098
wondering how I could
possibly live up to that

593
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,575
in anything I chose to do.

594
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:03,886
And...

595
00:30:06,992 --> 00:30:10,210
And so I chose to do nothing.

596
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:15,402
He would probably be
so disappointed in me.

597
00:30:15,404 --> 00:30:17,134
I doubt that.

598
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:21,412
Your father. He wanted you to be happy.

599
00:30:21,414 --> 00:30:25,250
And he... he gave you all this,

600
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:29,128
but I also think he wanted
you to have a choice.

601
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,632
I am not gonna sugarcoat it for you.

602
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,268
Being a hero kind of sucks.

603
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,470
And it never gets any
easier because it is

604
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:39,764
the hardest thing that you can do.

605
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:42,359
Then why do it?

606
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:44,528
For me, it gave me a purpose.

607
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,981
And that's why I woke you up,

608
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:51,276
so that you could have the
chance to realize your own.

609
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,796
Mia, this is your city,

610
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:56,685
and you're the Green Arrow.

611
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:03,986
Hey. How did it go?

612
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:06,475
Ask her.

613
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:08,477
I'm glad you decided to join.

614
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:11,582
Bianca's my friend. Any
luck finding her location?

615
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:14,632
Not yet. But she's in a
greenhouse of some sort.

616
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:16,853
Only problem is there
are hundreds in the city.

617
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:18,446
It's gonna take time.

618
00:31:19,472 --> 00:31:21,181
But that's not a greenhouse.

619
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:22,613
The design's biophilic.

620
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:24,881
It's meant to power the
building photosynthetically.

621
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,020
What are you, a botanist now?

622
00:31:27,022 --> 00:31:28,277
I took a couple classes

623
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,315
in design theory and
sustainable concepts.

624
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:32,150
Socialites can have brains, too.

625
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:34,411
Great. Well, could you
use your fancy brain

626
00:31:34,413 --> 00:31:36,338
and narrow it down for us?

627
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,119
Uh, there's about 12 buildings
in the city that fit the bill.

628
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:41,930
But only one of them is
currently unoccupied...

629
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:43,679
A complex downtown.

630
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:45,663
Let's go save my friend.

631
00:31:45,665 --> 00:31:47,081
You sure you're ready for this?

632
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,934
One way to find out.

633
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,118
Thermal imaging places
Bianca on the top floor.

634
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,444
There's 2 bodies beside her.
I'm guessing they're guards.

635
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:02,136
How much more company can we expect?

636
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:03,518
It depends on how fast we move.

637
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,677
That's comforting.

638
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,292
Oh, and another piece of good news.

639
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:08,706
The whole place is laced
with meta-dampeners.

640
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:12,209
- So no Canary cries.
- Perfect. Ready?

641
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,769
I so wish I got that on my live stories.

642
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:28,437
We have to go now.

643
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:31,273
Why leave now, huh?

644
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:33,091
The fun is just getting started.

645
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:34,943
Trevor.

646
00:32:34,945 --> 00:32:40,598
You know my name. Heh! I'm flattered.

647
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,901
Cool masks.

648
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:45,326
Yeah, very, uh, 2020.

649
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:47,996
Actually, I... I have...
I have one of my own.

650
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,985
So this is what you've been
spending daddy's money on?

651
00:32:51,987 --> 00:32:54,684
Ha ha. You know, Bianca
never told me that she had

652
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:58,189
such, uh, colorful friends.

653
00:32:58,191 --> 00:32:59,824
Oh, I get it.

654
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:02,954
She broke up with you, and
now your feelings are hurt.

655
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:04,581
- Aw.
- Aw.

656
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,823
Is that why you're doing this?

657
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:07,834
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

658
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:09,127
You're a pawn

659
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:11,795
with the fancy family name.

660
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:13,006
That's the only reason you're important.

661
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:14,483
Yeah, I see why you dumped him.

662
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:16,047
- Enough talking.
- Great.

663
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:18,109
So I guess that means
you're waving the white flag.

664
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:23,683
The 3 of you against all of us.

665
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:26,311
- I'll take those odds.
- So will we.

666
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:59,394
- There's too many of them.
- We have to get out of here.

667
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:00,612
Stay close.

668
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,305
Now what?

669
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,664
We're too high.

670
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:32,252
How are you still alive?

671
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:38,567
Death by tantrum? You're gonna
have to do better than that.

672
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:42,404
Don't come any closer.

673
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,934
You see, all the greenery

674
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:49,894
in this building is linked
to the same system...

675
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:53,967
All state-of-the-art
and all very, very...

676
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,325
Explosive.

677
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,780
If he drops that lighter, this
whole place is gonna go up.

678
00:34:57,782 --> 00:35:00,226
Trevor, don't do this.

679
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:02,282
You can't stop what's coming.

680
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:04,029
She won't let you.

681
00:35:04,031 --> 00:35:05,590
And who the hell is she?

682
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,132
We have to jump.

683
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:21,427
I thought you were trying
to save me, not kill me.

684
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:23,029
Trust me.

685
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:34,600
Welcome back.

686
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,606
Oof. Who are you bitches?

687
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,750
Any word on how Bianca's doing?

688
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:59,473
She is back to her old
self, posting live videos.

689
00:35:59,475 --> 00:36:04,669
So I'm not very good at
this, uh, feelings stuff.

690
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:07,890
I wanted to thank you, both of you.

691
00:36:07,892 --> 00:36:10,986
And now you can go back
to your glamorous life

692
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:13,232
of singing to drunk
hipsters in your bar.

693
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:14,488
Oh, thank you for that.

694
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,325
But, uh, actually, I was
thinking of going part-time.

695
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:21,737
You know, Trevor's not just a
jealous ex-lover trying to get even.

696
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:23,280
Somebody pushed him to do this,

697
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,380
and we still haven't
figured out who or why.

698
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:27,484
Trevor's tattoo looked familiar.

699
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,939
We start there.

700
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:30,245
We?

701
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:34,083
Star City needs the Green Arrow.

702
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:37,202
But what about JJ,
and what about your life?

703
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:38,987
I'm not giving that up,

704
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,164
but I'm also gonna
protect my father's legacy.

705
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,694
Mia, living a double
life is really hard.

706
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:45,594
Well, somebody once told me that

707
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:49,422
being a hero is the
hardest thing you can do.

708
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:51,377
It's also the right thing.

709
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:54,010
Well, that person sounds really smart.

710
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,738
I mean, she has her moments.

711
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,014
But putting on that
suit again wasn't easy.

712
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,535
But it reminded me
that it's not all bad.

713
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,775
There are some really,
really good parts, too.

714
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:11,366
Well, uh, before we get
back to saving the world,

715
00:37:11,368 --> 00:37:13,895
I say we should have
a celebratory drink.

716
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:15,901
And after what we did tonight,

717
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:18,062
I say we deserve the good stuff.

718
00:37:18,064 --> 00:37:20,871
Cheers. To the Green Arrow.

719
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:22,297
To the Canaries.

720
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:26,102
To the future, whatever it holds.

721
00:37:30,808 --> 00:37:33,302
Well, I'm glad you didn't
change the locks on me yet.

722
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:34,551
Mia...

723
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:37,870
Look, before you kick me out,
just please let me say I'm sorry.

724
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:43,225
You were right. I have been acting
weird since the graduation party.

725
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,604
- So then I did spook you.
- No.

726
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:48,249
This has nothing to
do with you proposing.

727
00:37:50,086 --> 00:37:54,663
Look, graduating got into my head.

728
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:59,409
I'm trying to figure out what I
want to do with the rest of my life,

729
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:02,012
what kind of person I want to be. I...

730
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:06,878
I want to help you with that.

731
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,738
And that is why I love you so much.

732
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,556
You're a good person, JJ.

733
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:15,860
I couldn't imagine spending
my life with anyone else.

734
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:27,696
You know, it's been a while
since I had a roommate.

735
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:30,699
I'll get my own place, I promise.

736
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:33,443
Your own place? That
sounds pretty permanent.

737
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:36,545
The city's under threat, and I'm
not gonna leave until it's over.

738
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,041
You know, while you're here,

739
00:38:39,043 --> 00:38:41,328
we could turn this place
into a base of operations

740
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,377
for the Canaries.

741
00:38:42,379 --> 00:38:45,639
Canaries, as in more than just us?

742
00:38:47,218 --> 00:38:50,335
Tonight made me remember
who I really am, Laurel.

743
00:38:50,337 --> 00:38:53,505
I may have been erased,
but I'm not gone.

744
00:38:53,507 --> 00:38:55,966
I need to figure out how I got here.

745
00:38:55,968 --> 00:39:00,005
And while I do that, I can help
a whole new generation of women.

746
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:05,183
So basically, what you're saying is

747
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:07,211
that I was right.

748
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:09,729
Don't gloat.

749
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:12,023
But please do explain
why you didn't tell me

750
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:13,830
the whole story about
what Bianca's death

751
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:16,361
would have meant for the city.

752
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:19,340
Sara said when the city falls...

753
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:24,995
Someone's at the center of it... Mia.

754
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:26,755
But Bianca was dead in the future,

755
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:29,499
and Mia wasn't the Green Arrow.

756
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,340
We should be in the clear, right?

757
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:32,853
I hope so.

758
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:42,220
I can't believe it's been 20 years

759
00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:45,056
since he sacrificed
himself to save the city.

760
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:48,643
Who's that?

761
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:51,855
Oh, just the "Star", The
"Globe", the "Gazette",

762
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,565
"Byline", Channel 52.

763
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,515
They all want to know
if I'm the Green Arrow.

764
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:56,901
Of course they do.

765
00:39:56,903 --> 00:39:58,379
Isn't it a little misogynistic that

766
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,863
they're not calling you as well?

767
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,840
I mean, come on, guys. It's 2040.

768
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:09,498
Oh, my God. You brought the pet rock.

769
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,083
Excuse me. Are you
referring to the hozen?

770
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:14,728
This is the closest thing
we have to a family heirloom,

771
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,714
passed down from Dad to
Aunt Thea to Mom and to me.

772
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:19,510
Show some respect, please.

773
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,144
May I see it?

774
00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:24,564
- Yes, you may.
- Thank you.

775
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:34,734
What the hell?

776
00:40:40,164 --> 00:40:42,047
William!

777
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:07,488
Hey, babe. I didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

778
00:41:11,195 --> 00:41:13,459
Who are you? What do you want?

779
00:41:13,461 --> 00:41:16,846
I need you to remember.

780
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:22,464
I have vision.

781
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:24,475
We can fix this...

782
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:26,116
together.

783
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,160
JJ!

784
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:33,978
You were wrong about me, brother.

785
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,512
It was never a mask.

786
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:46,065
