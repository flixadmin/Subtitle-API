1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,040
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,280
We will bust Penguin one day,
I promise you.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,800
Harvey, we cannot let this slide.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,240
You find someone with the license,
they walk.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,800
Miss Falcone, I need know to that you
are not on some fool's errand

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,360
to rebuild your fathers empire.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,080
An example needs to be made.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,640
You may think you have everything

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,920
but there is one thing
you don't have.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,080
- The Falcone name.
- Was that your plan?

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,480
Get close to Penguin,
gain his confidence, what then?

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,960
I used to be smart. Brilliant.
And now that's gone!

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,920
Never seen nothing like him before.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,160
- Who are you?
- Solomon Grundy.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,120
You know Grundy?

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,240
We're the very best of friends.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,920
With your muscles, we can make money.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,520
We'd like to put our hat in the ring.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,680
Go get the doc!

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
Yeah! Come on!

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,400
Upper cut. Come on!

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,360
Finish him!

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Good as new.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,440
Doctor Lee Thompkins.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,680
Oh, my.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,480
Now, what is a girl like you doing
in a place like this?

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,360
I heard a rumor you were frozen.

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,640
Should've known it was too good
to be true.

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,560
Oh, you're not still mad at me,
are you?

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,600
Mad at you for what?

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,720
Killing Kristen Kringle?

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,040
Or framing Jim for murder,

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,520
so he would be in prison
when I lost our child?

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,160
I'm over all that.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,720
Let's be friends.

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm sensing sarcasm.

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,360
Just as sharp as ever.

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,120
Actually, funny that you mention
that...

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,840
- Goodbye, Ed.
- Wait!

40
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Holy hell.

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,360
Butch Gilzean?

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,600
What have you done to him?

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,200
Nothing. Believe it, or not.

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,920
And he goes by Grundy now.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,920
Hey, why don't you hang over there,
big fella?

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,560
Make sure that wall
doesn't wander off.

47
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
I have no idea what happened to him.

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,160
But he's freakishly strong,

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,840
can't remember anything about his
past life and seems to love me, so...

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,360
Big improvement.

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,000
But I, on the other hand,

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm, I'm really hoping
to get back to who I was.

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,440
When I was on ice my head
got a little scrambled.

54
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,440
- Why should I care?
- Okay.

55
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,360
I came here with Grundy,
going to fight, make some money,

56
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,600
to get me smart again.

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:53,360
But you, Doctor Leslie Thompkins,
you can fix me.

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,240
You want me to fix you?

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,320
- Oh, you really are dumb.
- Okay, okay.

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,360
You're here for some reason.

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,920
I don't pretend to know what that is.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,240
But if you help me, I will help you.

63
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,960
I know you're not really smart
right now,

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,280
so just try to understand this,
I will never help you.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
I was raised to be a gentleman.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,680
But you're also practical.
We were seen at dinner.

67
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,080
As we have been the past
three nights.

68
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,200
All of Gotham knows you have
the support of the Falcone family.

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,560
And I'm fairly certain
no one's watching us now.

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
I...

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,320
I just, I just like to know
where I stand.

72
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,960
This isn't easy for me.

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,120
To have someone I can trust.

74
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
A real friend.

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,440
You can trust me.

76
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Let's have lunch tomorrow.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Just us.

78
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,800
Till then.

79
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Have a nice dinner?

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,800
- How long have you been here?
- Long enough.

81
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
It's time that you tell me
what you're planning.

82
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,440
This again?

83
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,000
Ever since you've come to Gotham,

84
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,320
all you've done
is make Oswald stronger.

85
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,880
It's time I know your end game.

86
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,200
And if I refuse?

87
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,240
I'll put you on a train home.

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,600
I want to make you a promise.

89
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,360
In a matter of days I'll have
Cobblepot in the palm of my hand.

90
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,080
I fail, I'll stay, I'll go,
whatever you want...

91
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,560
Look, the count's good.

92
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,320
Well, now, go on, get outta here.

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,720
- I'll see you next month.
- Yeah.

94
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,560
Someone down there?

95
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,280
Freaking cat.

96
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,200
Oink. Oink.

97
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,280
What the...

98
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,520
<i>If confirmed, bag
and seal immediately.</i>

99
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,920
{\an5}Hey.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,400
It really one of ours?

101
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,320
{\an5}Seems so. He was in the uniform.

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
{\an5}But the killer took his badge.

103
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,160
{\an5}No one recognizes him?

104
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,920
{\an5}Well, that part
we have not figured out yet.

105
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Let me show you.

106
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
{\an5}Good God.

107
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,880
{\an5}Freaky, huh?

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,280
{\an5}Let's find out who this guys is.

109
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Here we go.

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,000
{\an5}Dave Metzger.

111
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,160
{\an5}You know him?

112
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,520
{\an5}Seen him around.

113
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,200
{\an5}Not to speak ill of the dead
but he was a grade A bastard.

114
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,040
{\an5}He have enemies on the force?

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,920
{\an5}No, no cop would do this
to another cop.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,400
{\an5}But he was the candyman.

117
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,320
{\an5}Penguin's bagman.

118
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,080
{\an5}He was the one delivering payoffs
to cops in the precinct.

119
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,480
{\an5}- I mean, that, that's the rumor.
- Yeah.

120
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,680
{\an5}So someone killed him
to send a message...

121
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,440
{\an5}- Where are you going?
- To see Penguin.

122
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,160
{\an5}Maybe he knows why someone
wanted to kill his employee.

123
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
{\an5}Don't go stirring the pot!

124
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,080
Enjoy your lunch Mr. Cobblepot.

125
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,840
{\an5}I need to talk to you.

126
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,280
{\an5}If it takes less than three minutes,
I'm all ears.

127
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
{\an5}A cop was murdered last night.

128
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,040
{\an5}Dave Metzger.

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,880
{\an5}A bagman on your payroll.

130
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,320
{\an5}Oh, and you think
I might know something?

131
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,240
{\an5}Well, sadly, this is the first
I'm hearing his name.

132
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,240
{\an5}A general does not need to know
every foot soldier.

133
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,880
You don't need to know him.

134
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,400
{\an5}I think someone is trying
to send you a message.

135
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,040
{\an5}What sort of message?

136
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,320
The killer placed a severed pig's
head over Metzger's own.

137
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,240
{\an5}Not a very clear message.

138
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,120
Could have all sorts of meanings.

139
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,240
Metzger may have been dirty
but he was still a cop.

140
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,440
{\an5}Someone killed him and is using
his death to make a point.

141
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,560
{\an5}If that is in relation to you,
I need to know.

142
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,280
{\an5}Jim, if someone had a problem
with me, I would know about it.

143
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,880
And I would deal with it.

144
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,440
I guess you're always one step ahead,
Oswald.

145
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,600
It's why I'm alive.

146
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,200
But I would like to help.

147
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,200
- Mr. Penn!
- Right here, Mr. Cobblepot.

148
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,640
Do we have anything that could assist
Detective Gordon in doing his job?

149
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,400
As a matter of fact, sir,
a few days ago,

150
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,720
Mr. Wally Clarke applied
for a burglary permit.

151
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,760
The Pork Barrel.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,840
It's a butcher on Third Street.

153
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
They specialize in offering
the whole...

154
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,440
Thanks for the lead.

155
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,880
Enjoy your lunch, Oswald.

156
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,240
Don't thank me, Jim.

157
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,720
Thank the licensing system
you hate so much.

158
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,880
Now be sure to let me know
if I need to get more involved.

159
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,680
Until then, I'm rooting for you, Jim.

160
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
Have a seat, Wally.

161
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
You know how much trouble you're in,
huh?

162
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,600
You know what we do to cop killers?

163
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,160
I just told him, I didn't kill
nobody, specifically not no cop.

164
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,640
So you didn't lure Dave Metzger
into that alley,

165
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,920
split open his skull
and stick a pig's head on him?

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,120
What?

167
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,280
- Are you crazy?
- That's funny.

168
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,280
Because we searched the dumpster
behind your apartment.

169
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,720
Guess what we found?

170
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,440
Look at that!
Porky don't have no head.

171
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,200
What do you want to bet that head
was on the dead cop we found?

172
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,320
Screw it.

173
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,520
I have enough.

174
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,840
I don't need a confession.

175
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm charging you with the murder
of Dave Metzger.

176
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,400
Wait! No!

177
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,520
It wasn't me.

178
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
It must've been the Prof.

179
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,120
- Who?
- The Professor.

180
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,880
That's what I called him,
because he, he, he talked all fancy.

181
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
He was the one got me
to rob the butchers.

182
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,680
We need a name. A description.

183
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,640
We did it all over the phone.
The whole deal.

184
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,920
I, I dropped the heads
under the Midtown Bridge.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,520
The money was there. I never
met the guy, never got no name.

186
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,520
What do you mean, "heads?"
As in more than one?

187
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,120
How many did this guy want?

188
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,680
It was, it was four.

189
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,680
You think he could've told me
that he only needed the heads.

190
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,480
But no, I had to drag them up
to my house, chop heads...

191
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,600
Hey, shut up.

192
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,640
- Do you know what this means?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,280
It means there's three more victims
out there.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,280
How many bagmen did Penguin
have on the G.C.P.D?

195
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
Wild guess, I'd say four.

196
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,120
The only one I knew was Metzger.

197
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,560
Yeah, well, the people who got paid
by those bad men?

198
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,480
They'll know who they are.

199
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,640
They're not going to talk.

200
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,280
We'll make them.

201
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,080
Hey, don't leave me back here
with this thing!

202
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Hey!

203
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
She's not coming.

204
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,600
- What?
- Sofia.

205
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,240
- Your lunch date.
- It's not a date.

206
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,280
Whatever. She called.

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
She's not coming.

208
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,400
Did she say why?

209
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,520
Something came up?

210
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,640
I don't know. I wasn't listening.

211
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
It's just going to go to waste.

212
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,720
I want you to follow her.
Find out who she's with.

213
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,240
You think she's two-timing you?

214
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
She and I are not...

215
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,720
This lunch was her idea.

216
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,520
Now she cancels all of a sudden?

217
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,320
I want to know why.

218
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
That's all.

219
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,840
Now, Victor?

220
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,680
Today, we have ourselves a treat.

221
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,640
Our beloved Hammer
will take on a new challenger.

222
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
Just in from...

223
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,720
Grundy come from swamp.

224
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,800
Rules are simple.
Last man standing wins.

225
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,640
Besides that, anything goes!

226
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,240
Yeah! Just hit him!

227
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Fight!

228
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,720
What are you doing? Fight!

229
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,800
- Grundy fight now?
- Yes! Now!

230
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,640
Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!

231
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,280
Grundy! Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!

232
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,000
Grundy! Grundy!

233
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,720
- Yes!
- Grundy! Grundy!

234
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,920
Yes!

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,200
Yes! Grundy has a best friend!

236
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,080
Grundy! Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!

237
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,680
Grundy! Grundy!

238
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,520
Looks like I got a new cash cow.

239
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,400
Take good care of him, Doc.

240
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,040
And clean up what's left of Hammer.

241
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,200
We're not looking to bust nobody.

242
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,040
We just want the name of the bagman.

243
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,080
Who delivers Penguin's money?

244
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,640
Don't know what you're talking about,
man.

245
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,520
- Wish I could help.
- Oh, yeah?

246
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Hey! Hey!

247
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,720
Relax.

248
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,480
I know a couple of other guys
we can talk to,

249
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,200
who aren't such douche nozzles.

250
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,120
Seems like you should be looking
for whoever killed Dave Metzger.

251
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,320
Instead a shaking down other cops.

252
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,680
We're trying to save other cops.

253
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,240
More lives are on the line here.

254
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,840
Or you're using a cop getting killed
to go on a fishing expedition.

255
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,800
- Smells like IA to me.
- Hey!

256
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,000
Hold on! Hey! Hey! Just say
you're not helping we get it okay.

257
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,240
Get off me.

258
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,960
We're trying to stop cops
from getting killed!

259
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,280
How can none of you nitwits see that?

260
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,120
You're asking a cop
to snitch on another cop.

261
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,240
It ain't going to happen.

262
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,240
Fine.

263
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,360
- We'll do it your way.
- Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,560
Oh, jeez!

265
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
Going to be a hot one today, huh?

266
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,040
Yeah.

267
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,320
It's got to be 90 out here.

268
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,720
Lot hotter in there.

269
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,200
- Probably a hundred.
- Let me out, you bastards!

270
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,960
You know what, Jim,
I think we forgot to get lunch.

271
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,840
Think we got time?

272
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,840
I could go for a burger.

273
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,160
All right, Culpepper, we're going
to be back in a couple of hours.

274
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Bullock! Let me out!

275
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,840
I'm warning you!

276
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,200
Bullock!

277
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,400
Bullock!

278
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,320
Bullock!

279
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,760
Okay!

280
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,640
Chris Whitlock.

281
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,640
Makes deliveries for the West Side.

282
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,800
But don't say I told you.

283
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,120
Where can we find him?

284
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,760
He's supposed to be in court all day.

285
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,200
My contact on the South Side.

286
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Said their bagman's Jenny Butler.

287
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,600
- Trying to reach her now.
- Good.

288
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,240
I just want to find this guy
Whitlock.

289
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,760
Hope he gives us the last name.

290
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,360
Should be getting out of court soon.

291
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,800
You ever think
you'd be running around

292
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,280
trying to save cops
on Penguin's payroll?

293
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,680
Bad cops.

294
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,320
They deserve to be prosecuted
and stripped of their badges.

295
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,480
Not butchered.

296
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,600
Call the police!

297
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,000
Hundred thousand people
in a square mile

298
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,520
and of course, nobody saw nothing.

299
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,960
Or is willing to admit it.

300
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,480
Butler got off duty last night.

301
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,600
Not seen since she clocked out.

302
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,000
Whitlock is doing court at 9,
never showed.

303
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,480
So, they were both were abducted,
taken somewhere, killed,

304
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,520
then brought to pose
in front of this building.

305
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,320
- Probably for us to find.
- That's a hell of a lot of work.

306
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,800
The killer believes his message
is important.

307
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,920
What? That he's got to rid
the city of dirty cops?

308
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,480
Specifically, the ones
who work for Penguin.

309
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,160
No wonder these guys look on edge.

310
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,320
Where are we on our fourth bagman?

311
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,560
We need an ID.

312
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,960
I'm working on it.

313
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,560
Good afternoon, sir, sir?

314
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,760
Detective James Gordon, G.C.P.D.

315
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,000
You've been playing here all morning?

316
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,880
On and off, you know?

317
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,400
Guy's got to a take a break
every now and then.

318
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,800
Yeah, sure.

319
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,440
You see anything?

320
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,080
Anything out of the usual?

321
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,640
Sorry, Detective,
I ain't seen nothing since the war.

322
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,840
- Right.
- Right.

323
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
- All right, have a good one.
- Yeah.

324
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,160
Man. Man. Really?

325
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,960
Let's try this again.

326
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,240
You see anything?

327
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,960
An old van.

328
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,720
Filippelli Plumbing on the side.

329
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,600
Parked up the street
a good part of the morning.

330
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,400
Guy just sitting there.

331
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,960
Guy. What'd he look like?

332
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,080
White dude.

333
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,720
Didn't see his face.

334
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,000
I took a break.

335
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,720
I came back, the van was gone.

336
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,560
All right, thanks.

337
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Keep the tip.

338
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,360
What happened to you, Butch?

339
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Grundy.

340
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,360
Look at your hand, it grew back.

341
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,320
How is that even possible?

342
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,720
And look at this.

343
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,120
It's not even blood.

344
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,080
It's like swamp water.

345
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,200
Grundy from swamp.

346
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,760
Yeah. I heard.

347
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,560
You know, you don't have a heartbeat.

348
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
But you seem to be doing okay.

349
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,240
You know, Ed is not your friend.

350
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,640
He's just using you.

351
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,440
No.

352
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,000
Ed Grundy friend.

353
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,920
Ed Grundy best friend.

354
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,040
He just wants you to fight,

355
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,600
so he can make money
and make his brain better again.

356
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,480
Once he doesn't need you anymore
he's just going to discard you.

357
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,280
Or kill you, if that's even possible.

358
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,920
Do you understand?

359
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,160
Ed Grundy best friend.

360
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
That's right.

361
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,840
Best buddies.

362
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,960
A team.

363
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,960
Not to mention,
your boss's biggest new attraction.

364
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,840
Smells like we're sticking around
for a while.

365
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Fabulous.

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,720
Unless, of course, you fix the broken
connections in this noodle

367
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,640
then we wouldn't have to stick
around.

368
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,800
We'd be...

369
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
- Gone?
- Yes, thank you.

370
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
- That's the word you're looking for?
- Yeah.

371
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
Of course, I'd pay you.

372
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,720
I'm patching up Grundy
as long as Cherry tells me to.

373
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
That's it.

374
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,200
Keep your money.

375
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,600
How's my best new fighter?

376
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,800
He going to be ready to go again
tonight, Doc?

377
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,160
Yeah, sure.

378
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,520
I got to step out for a while.
I'll be back.

379
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,360
Just make sure you're here.

380
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,480
We got a deal, you know?

381
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,920
Yeah. I know.

382
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,720
Hi, everyone,
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

383
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,080
I'll be right with you, okay?

384
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,920
All right. You can come on in.

385
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,200
Okay. Have a seat right there.

386
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,320
Help you up. One, two, three. Up.

387
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
All right.

388
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
Let's have a listen...

389
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,760
Sofia Falcone.

390
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,080
What are you doing?

391
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,640
Yeah. All right.

392
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,680
That was the Mayor's office.

393
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
Press has gotten wind.

394
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,360
Things are going to heat up fast.

395
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,120
Then we catch him fast.

396
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,880
All the cops who haven't called in.

397
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,360
Hahn. Peterson.

398
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,320
King. Nakajima. Massengale.

399
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,480
Yeah, so their precincts
are already looking for them

400
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,400
but I say we take this list
to Penguin.

401
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,680
- Have him point to a name.
- No need.

402
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,200
Nakajima is the bagman.

403
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
How do you know?

404
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,480
Peterson and Messengale
are both hard core Bible thumpers.

405
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,000
That leaves three.

406
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,400
And I've heard Nakajima's dirty.

407
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,560
Our units are already on their way
to his apartment, same as the others.

408
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,960
I say we retrace his beat.

409
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,720
- Concentrate our resources.
- Jim, hold on.

410
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,440
Doesn't something about this feel
weird to you?

411
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,240
Whoever set the trap for Metzger
knew where he'd be.

412
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,720
And the killer also knew Butler
and Whitlock's schedules.

413
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,040
Are you saying it's one of our own?

414
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,720
Someone who's fed up
with the corruption.

415
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,240
Decided to make a stand.

416
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,640
But to kill them?
Display their bodies that way...

417
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,400
I know, brother. But it's something
we at least have to consider.

418
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,600
Which means anything
that we say out there...

419
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,360
Got a lead on the plumbing van
your blind man saw.

420
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,680
Spotted near that abandoned dairy
on Commerce.

421
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
- Should we get the Strike Force?
- No, Gordon and I will cover it.

422
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
If, we need backup
I'll give you a call.

423
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,600
And till then, don't say a word.

424
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,120
And that's an order. You got it?

425
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,360
Let's go. Come on.

426
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,960
Oink, oink, little piggy.

427
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Yeah!

428
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,520
Our new champion!

429
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,840
Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!

430
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,800
Grundy! Grundy!

431
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,600
So it turns out
Sofia broke her date with you...

432
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,360
It was not a date!

433
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,600
To have lunch with the Mayor.

434
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,520
They went to Angelo's.

435
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,840
She had the lobster ravioli.

436
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,160
He had the tagliatelle.

437
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,000
After they parted ways, Sofia went
to the old Gotham Heritage Hotel.

438
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,200
I don't understand.
That place has been vacant for years.

439
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
If I may, a couple months ago,

440
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,040
I'd gotten word a secret buyer
had purchased the hotel

441
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,680
at six percent over asking.

442
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,720
I think it's safe to assume
that buyer was Ms. Falcone.

443
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,240
But why?

444
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,080
When she got there,
she met with this clown.

445
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,160
The zoning commissioner.

446
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,600
She'd have to have had his approval
for the wall and gate she built.

447
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,960
She's making alliances
with politicians.

448
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,160
Building a fortress.

449
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,400
All the while she's pretending
to be my friend...

450
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,200
she's been planning a war.

451
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,600
Victor, we will be having a chat
with Ms. Falcone.

452
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,400
Just so we're clear,
is this a chat-chat?

453
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,680
Or a shovel-in-the-trunk
kind of chat?

454
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Get the shovel.

455
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,000
Maybe I should rent an apartment
with all this money we're making?

456
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Do you have any openings
in your building?

457
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,080
You know what, what you should be
doing with your winnings

458
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,520
is finding yourself a neurologist.

459
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,560
- Which I am not.
- It has to be you.

460
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,920
You know me, Lee, you know what
this coconut is truly capable of.

461
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,680
Which is why my answer is no.

462
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,880
I know about your clinic.

463
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,400
I'm guessing
that Cherry lets you keep that,

464
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,600
as long as you work these fights.

465
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,280
That's the deal that you have, right?

466
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
So?

467
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,920
So I'm guessing that, that means
something to you.

468
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,680
Which makes you vulnerable to...

469
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
to...

470
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,200
to...

471
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,640
- Blackmail?
- Yes.

472
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,160
- Threats?
- Yes. Both of those.

473
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,560
All right, so, let's hear it.

474
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,360
- What's your brilliant scheme?
- What?

475
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,600
You said you wanted to force me
to help you, so, what is your threat?

476
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Hit me.

477
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,000
If you don't help me,
I am going to...

478
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,520
do something to that clinic.

479
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,560
Oh, my God, you really aren't smart.

480
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Jim?

481
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Nakajima?

482
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,160
Sit tight, buddy, we're going
to get you out of here.

483
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,360
Grenade!

484
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,960
Run!

485
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Harvey!

486
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Harvey!

487
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Detective James Gordon.

488
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,000
I hope you don't mind if I say,
I'm tickled pink to meet you.

489
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,640
I would shake your hand,
if it were possible.

490
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,160
I'm a big fan.

491
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,120
Big, big fan.

492
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,080
Great. My biggest fan is a pig.

493
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,720
Tell me where Harvey Bullock is.

494
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,600
Oh, that dirty pig?

495
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,760
Why do you waste your time with him?

496
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,200
He's holding you back.

497
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,360
Or can you not see that?

498
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,840
Never you fret.

499
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,320
He's still alive.

500
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,280
For the time being anyway.

501
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,200
But you, Detective, you,
you are as safe as safe can be.

502
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
You a cop?

503
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
What?

504
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,560
What makes you think that?

505
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,840
The things you knew.

506
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,520
The routes and schedules
of the cops you killed?

507
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,280
Oh. If I were a policeman,
you could what?

508
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,640
Reason with me?

509
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,120
Appeal to what we have in common?

510
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,960
Well, Jim, may I call you, Jim?

511
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,920
Jim, that's exactly
what I was going to do.

512
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,680
We have nothing in common.

513
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,080
Oh.

514
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,560
I beg to differ, mon frere.

515
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,800
You and I, both, see all too well

516
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,600
the corruption, the filth,
inside the G.C.P.D.

517
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:18,000
You and I know that Gotham cannot
survive unless the cancer is cut out!

518
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,960
We both share the same mission.

519
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,920
Only I do it
with a little bit more flare!

520
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,360
Killing Penguin's bagmen
won't change anything.

521
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,680
It will for them.

522
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,200
It will, quite a bit.

523
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,040
But in the larger scope,
you're right!

524
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Which is why it doesn't stop there.

525
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,480
Not until I've butchered every single
swine on Penguin's payroll!

526
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
That could be half the department.

527
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,200
I never said it would be pretty.

528
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,040
Oh, it's the same old story.

529
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,640
No one wants to see
how the sausage is made

530
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,280
but once it is made,
isn't it delicious?

531
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Bite?

532
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,360
You're delusional.

533
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
You're not doing this for Gotham.

534
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,760
You're doing it
for your own demented reasons.

535
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,440
My reasons are as real
as they come, Jim.

536
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,440
I have suffered profound loss
at the hands of greedy pigs in power.

537
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,280
Pro-found.

538
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Then tell me.

539
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,040
Let me help make it right.

540
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,400
- Without all this...
- Jim!

541
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,640
Oops! Got to go.

542
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,920
Jim, where are you?

543
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,280
Never you fear, Detective,
you and I, we'll meet anon.

544
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,600
Don't you touch him!

545
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,760
Harvey!

546
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,440
Jim?

547
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,760
Backup's coming!

548
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Harvey!

549
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,360
You heard Gordon, you freak!

550
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,960
Backup's on the way!
You got one chance to run.

551
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,200
Lies from a liar.

552
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,040
They would have been here by now.

553
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,640
Besides, we both know,
Captain Bullock, you deserve this.

554
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,440
Harvey!

555
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,720
I do hate to cut and run.

556
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,720
- Oopsie-daisy!
- Hold on, partner.

557
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,480
Hold on, buddy. Hold on.

558
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,640
You're going to be all right.

559
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,120
- Jim...
- You're going to be all right.

560
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,600
I promise you.

561
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
You're going to be all right.

562
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,800
Come on. Come on, buddy.

563
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Come on, pal.

564
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,280
I can't miss any more work.

565
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,200
- They'll fire me.
- It's okay.

566
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,880
I'm going to put you on strong
antibiotics, okay?

567
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,200
Come on!

568
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,960
Oswald, I didn't know
you were coming over.

569
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,400
I thought I'd surprise you.

570
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm sorry I had to cancel lunch
yesterday.

571
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,320
It was unavoidable.

572
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,640
You have to let me make it up to you.

573
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
How about now?

574
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,360
I was actually on my way out.

575
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,520
Oh?

576
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Where to?

577
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,240
This is going to sound strange
but I can't tell you.

578
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,160
Not yet.
I, I want it to be a surprise.

579
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
The thing is...

580
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,960
cat's out of the bag.

581
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,480
- I don't understand?
- I know what you're doing!

582
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,280
The old Heritage Hotel?

583
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,040
The fortress from which you're going
to attack me!

584
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,840
What? No!

585
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,720
Oh, so you weren't pretending
to be my friend

586
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
while building your power base?

587
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,080
I should've known.

588
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,080
But your, your father's blood
definitely runs through your veins.

589
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,760
Luckily, not for long.

590
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,760
Oswald, you're making a mistake.

591
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,880
I'm your friend.

592
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,560
We'll see, won't we?

593
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,760
Now, let's go see
what you're building.

594
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,560
I can't wait.

595
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,040
Barkeep!

596
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,680
- Another grasshopper!
- Those won't help.

597
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,320
All right. Give me your money.

598
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,040
- What?
- The money you made.

599
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,680
Well, that he made. Give it to me.

600
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,200
I don't make any promises
but I'll see what I can do.

601
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,360
Lee, Lee... I just got to know.

602
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,680
Why did you change your mind?

603
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,720
- Is it my charisma?
- Close.

604
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,840
You asked what I was doing
in a place like this.

605
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,040
I didn't want to be here.

606
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,840
I didn't want to be anywhere
near Gotham.

607
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,360
I left. But I couldn't stay away.

608
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,160
Because the Tetch virus,

609
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,720
it hit the Narrows harder
than anywhere else.

610
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,920
- So?
- So?

611
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,600
It was my fault.

612
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,080
Jim tried to stop the virus
and I didn't let him.

613
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,640
I was infected but none the less,
I was there.

614
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,800
I don't have a choice.

615
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,720
- I have to be here.
- Wow.

616
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,280
If you wanted to blackmail me,
by the way, what you should have done

617
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,640
was taken advantage
of Grundy being popular.

618
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,880
Threatened to take him away

619
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,000
and then Cherry, afraid of losing her
star, would've forced me to help you.

620
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,160
Come by the clinic tomorrow.

621
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,680
We'll get started.

622
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,880
Bye, pretty lady.

623
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,000
Ed's going to be smart again.

624
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,200
Ed going to be smart?

625
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,480
Ed's going to be very smart.

626
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,720
It's okay, Charlie.

627
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Oswald?

628
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,240
I want you to know, I forgive you.

629
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,080
Boss?

630
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,080
What is this?

631
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,840
What's happening?

632
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
Kids.

633
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,320
You started an orphanage?

634
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,000
I wanted to surprise you next week.

635
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,480
When everything was finished.

636
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,480
I... I...

637
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,640
Children, back inside please.

638
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,200
Oswald, I want you to know
I understand the pressure you face.

639
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,920
Your very survival depends on seeing
everyone as a potential threat.

640
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,960
And I watched my father bear
that weight for years.

641
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,840
I don't want you to end up like him.

642
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,960
Sofia, please, forgive me.

643
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
How can I?

644
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,360
When I've already forgiven you.

645
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,000
But you do owe me one thing.

646
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,120
Anything.

647
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,720
Lunch.

648
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,080
How do you feel about mac and cheese?

649
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,200
I love it.

650
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Hey.

651
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Hey.

652
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,920
You gave me quite the scare back
there.

653
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,080
How you feeling?

654
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,880
I've had better days.

655
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,200
Doc says you're going to be okay.

656
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,040
No one shows but he knows.

657
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Pyg?

658
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,400
Son of a bitch.

659
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,120
He could've killed me but he cut me
just deep enough to make you choose.

660
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,760
Go after him,
or save my worthless hide.

661
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,880
It wasn't a choice.

662
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,040
Either way, l owe you.

663
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,880
So pay it back now.

664
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,320
Tell me the truth.

665
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,280
How long you been taking money
from Penguin?

666
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,520
You knew Metzger was the bagman.

667
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,840
You knew Nakajima was dirty.

668
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,400
The Pyg says all this stuff
about you deserving to be killed.

669
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,480
I don't know
why I didn't see it before.

670
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,600
Maybe I didn't want to.

671
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,200
I just need to know how long...

672
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,880
are we talking years?

673
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,200
No.

674
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,400
Just since this license crap started.

675
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,120
The commissioner ordered us
to comply.

676
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,560
Then Metzger started showing up with
these envelopes stuffed full of cash.

677
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,320
I didn't do nothing
I wouldn't have done anyway.

678
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,360
You got to understand, Jim,
the bills I got, the debts I got...

679
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
It stops.

680
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,120
Stops now.

681
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,880
<i>Gotham city on high alert.</i>

682
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,120
<i>Gotham finds itself gripped by terror</i>

683
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,600
<i>in the hands of a ritualistic cop
killer, being called Professor Pyg.</i>

684
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,400
<i>He is still at large
after evading the police.</i>

685
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,120
<i>The G.C.P.D are urging people
to remain calm</i>

686
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,920
<i>and to report any suspicious activity
to G.C.P.D Central Command.</i>

687
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,360
"Two mother pigs lived in a pen.

688
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,720
They each had four piglets
and that made ten.

689
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,840
All the piglets loved to play.

690
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,720
And they rolled and they rolled,
in the mud all day.

691
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,360
At night, with their mothers,
curled up in a heap...

692
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:52,320
they squealed and they squealed
until they went...

693
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,240
to sleep."

694
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,400
And sleep well,
for tomorrow the axe shall fall.
