00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,838
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,539
When I was a child,
I saw my mother

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,009
killed by something impossible.
What, Barry, what?

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,978
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,949
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

7
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,651
to the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,754
But secretly, I use my speed

9
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:24,256
to fight crime
and find others like me.

10
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,825
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,194
- Mom!
- And get justice for my father.

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,197
I am the Flash.

13
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,832
Previously on<i> the Flash...</i>

14
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,502
A honeymoon isn't a honeymoon
without Mai Tais.

15
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:37,870
Ronnie?

16
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,038
I can't let
whatever happened..

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,640
Ronnie!

18
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,675
I wanted him to be my husband.

19
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,211
I have watched
you be in love with Iris

20
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,114
Since you were old enough
to know what love is.

21
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,188
He killed my mom.

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,025
♪ Oh, the weather outside
is frightful ♪

23
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,495
♪ But the fire
is so delightful ♪

24
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:07,099
♪ And since we've no place
to go ♪

25
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,968
♪ Let it snow, let it snow,
let it... ♪

26
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,692
There's only two boxes left.

27
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,814
You know, at this rate,
we'll be finished by Easter.

28
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,598
Don't even.

29
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,271
Okay, the only red-suited dude

30
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:50,142
I want in this house right now
is Kris Kringle, you got it?

31
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,921
Uh, these ornaments
are not gonna hang themselves.

32
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,224
- Mm-hmm.
- Grandma Esther's recipe...

33
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:07,593
Light on the bourbon.

34
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,061
Mmm.

35
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:11,063
I always loved her definition
of "light."

36
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,601
And the Christmas tradition
continues.

37
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:19,403
Detective West.
Yeah?

38
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,406
All right.

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,310
Sorry, kids, the DA
wants to ask me some questions.

40
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,213
Make sure there's some nog
left for me when I get back.

41
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,000
No promises.

42
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,722
- What's happening?
- Hey.

43
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,223
Come on.

44
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,625
Oh, come on,
we're doing this already?

45
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,160
Christmas isn't for a few days.

46
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,829
I couldn't wait any longer.

47
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,330
Oh, wait, me first.

48
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,066
Okay.

49
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,578
My mother's wedding band?

50
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,213
A replica, yeah.

51
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,915
You were devastated
when you lost the real one.

52
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,050
Our fifth-grade field trip...

53
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,285
to the zoo.

54
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:09,188
You cried for weeks.

55
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,089
Here.

56
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,163
You remembered.

57
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,567
Yeah.

58
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,369
Steel trap.

59
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,573
I don't know what to say.

60
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:30,142
My gift so sucks
in comparison...

61
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,778
- No.
- by the way.

62
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,685
It's supposed to be
the best one on the market.

63
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,887
I thought you could maybe
use a new one.

64
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,121
It's lame, I know.

65
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,657
No, no, this is great.
I love it.

66
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,392
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

67
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,733
Hey, babe.

68
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,202
Hey, Barry.
Nice ring.

69
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,238
It's beautiful, isn't it?

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,640
It's an exact replica
of my mom's.

71
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,944
- Barry got it for me.
- That's very thoughtful, Bar.

72
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,451
- So are we tree trimming?
- Yeah.

73
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,753
Come on.

74
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,591
Merry Christmas.

75
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,692
Just a small token

76
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,394
- of my gratitude...
- Aw.

77
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,796
for everything you guys
have done for me this year.

78
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,698
I think I speak on behalf
of my colleagues

79
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,468
when I say you've been a gift
for us, Barry.

80
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,370
What's that?

81
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:35,274
This is compliments of Iris...
grandma Esther's famous eggnog.

82
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,709
That's what
I'm talking about.

83
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,144
Maybe later for me.

84
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,047
Wouldn't want to drink
and drive.

85
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,616
Did I say something wrong?

86
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,451
- No.
- No, man.

87
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,755
He, um... this used to be
his favorite time of year,

88
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:53,225
But the accident
happened before Christmas, so...

89
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,593
Kind of ruined the holidays.

90
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,228
I'm gonna
go get him a present.

91
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,130
Maybe that'll cheer him up.

92
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,531
Thank you very much.

93
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,166
Yeah.

94
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,669
So what are you doing
for Christmas, Cisco?

95
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,478
The fact that I asked you
for your shirt size

96
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,213
Should in no way indicate

97
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:19,518
That I am getting you something
shirt-related for Christmas.

98
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,154
Barry seemed
a little odd today.

99
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,690
I'm pretty sure
he wasn't psyched I came by.

100
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,525
You ever think...

101
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:30,829
He maybe might like you?

102
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,931
What?
No.

103
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,133
Friends don't give
friends wedding bands.

104
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,036
He was... he wasn't proposing
to me, silly.

105
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,173
He and I are just best friends.

106
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,042
Well, then he
won't be bothered by this.

107
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,115
A bit early,
but I couldn't wait.

108
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,360
I figured we've been
together a year now.

109
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,995
You pretty much stay there
most nights anyway.

110
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,767
I love you.

111
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,403
That's a yes, I take it?

112
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,776
It was that

113
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,378
Or Stephen Hawking's
new autobiography,

114
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,115
And we both know
how he feels about Hawking.

115
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:26,685
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Bye, Cisco.

116
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,773
Merry Christmas, doc.

117
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,310
Thank you, jimmy, and to you.

118
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,978
Hey, doc,
I know it's a big secret,

119
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,513
But can you give me a hint?

120
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:32,417
What exactly are you working on
in there?

121
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,952
The future.

122
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,122
Doctor, get inside!

123
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,558
Lock down the facility!

124
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,813
Hey.

125
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,716
What are you thinking?

126
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,953
The blood splatter patterns
and trajectory of the remains...

127
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,155
Only a high-speed collision
could have done this.

128
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,658
But to cause this type of damage
to a human in this space?

129
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,962
Whatever hit them would have
to have been moving fast.

130
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,563
Get this.

131
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,398
The witness says
all he saw was a blur.

132
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,467
Sound familiar?

133
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,740
You saw a blur?

134
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,375
W-what was it?

135
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,744
Whatever it was,
it was looking for something.

136
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,413
Well, what did it look like?

137
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:39,451
Like a-a man
in some kind of yellow suit.

138
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,953
Okay.

139
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,989
- Barry, listen...
- I have to check my files.

140
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,490
Joe, you heard him, all right?

141
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,791
The man that killed my mom...
he's back.

142
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,293
I know.

143
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,529
He's been in town
for a few weeks now.

144
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,063
He paid a visit to me
at the house.

145
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,498
He took all the evidence
from your mom's case.

146
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,000
The files are gone.

147
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,668
Why wouldn't you tell me
this sooner?

148
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,570
- I couldn't.
- Why?

149
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,840
Because he threatened
to kill Iris.

150
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,587
The witness described
seeing a yellow blur

151
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,522
Just like the one
that killed Barry's mother.

152
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,692
Then we need to get cracking
and stop this speed psycho.

153
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,295
That... I wasn't trying
to give him a name.

154
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,096
The crime scene
at mercury labs was on a floor

155
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,865
with highly secured vaults,

156
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,900
and the witness said
he was looking for something.

157
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,303
Whatever it was, he wanted it
badly enough to kill for it.

158
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,305
Doctor, what do you know
about this mercury labs?

159
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:36,274
Mercury was one
of S.T.A.R. Labs'

160
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,410
Major competitors
until our little setback,

161
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,612
And then it catapulted
to the forefront

162
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:43,315
led by Dr. Christina McGee,

163
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,951
brilliant but egocentric
physicist.

164
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:50,055
It says here Dr. McGee has
secured half a billion dollars

165
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,123
in private funding to develop,

166
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,760
and I quote, "prototypes for
the technology of the future."

167
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,762
Well, I'll be.

168
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:02,033
Tina's messing with tachyons,
superluminal particles.

169
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,535
Of course.

170
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,804
So what could someone
do with one of those...

171
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,406
- Tachyons.
- Thank you.

172
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,042
Well, I don't know.
Become invincible?

173
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,545
If you could devise a matrix
stable enough

174
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:17,482
To harness their power, you
could travel faster than light.

175
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,217
He's gonna
try to get them again,

176
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,586
So we need to get what mercury
has and use it as a lure.

177
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,589
Exactly right. Cisco, Caitlin,
let's start engineering a trap.

178
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,991
- You got it.
- Of course.

179
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,295
Thanks.

180
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,232
Iris.

181
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,067
Caitlin.
What are you doing here?

182
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,435
Oh, it's been a long day.

183
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,437
It's only noon.

184
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,239
I didn't sleep much
last night.

185
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,241
Yeah, me either.

186
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,644
Um, so I was catching up
on your blog,

187
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,912
And this story caught my eye...

188
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:52,417
About a man whose head
and hands burst into flames?

189
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,085
- The burning man?
- Yeah.

190
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,187
I haven't really updated
that story in a while,

191
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,456
But there are some reports
that I could send you.

192
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,592
That'd be great.
Thank you.

193
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:03,428
Can I ask you something,
girl-to-girl?

194
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,030
Sure.

195
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:08,199
Barry's been acting different
around me lately,

196
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,970
Like he's keeping
some sort of secret from me.

197
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,672
Is there anything
that you know about

198
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:14,839
That I should know about?

199
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,275
Not that I can think of.

200
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,810
However, if you feel

201
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,312
Like Barry's keeping
something from you,

202
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:24,049
You should probably
just ask him yourself.

203
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,283
Yeah.

204
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,820
- Thanks.
- Of course.

205
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,423
- Yeah, okay.
- Gonna get some caffeine.

206
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,859
Barry Allen.
Thank you for coming in.

207
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,428
Dr. Tina McGee.

208
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,596
I assume this is
about last night's break-in?

209
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,532
Well, yes and no.

210
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,000
That's usually how things are
with you, aren't they, Harrison?

211
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,835
We believe
that whoever broke in

212
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,470
Was after one
of your prototypes.

213
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,172
You'll have
to narrow that down.

214
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,873
We have literally hundreds
of projects in development.

215
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,543
One containing
tachyonic particles.

216
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,279
We've had encouraging success
with tachyons, yes,

217
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,282
But there's still a significant
gap between our prototype

218
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,983
And any real-life application.

219
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,153
We were hoping
you would lend us your prototype

220
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,855
To use as a lure.

221
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,356
"Us"?

222
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,092
You're assisting
the police now, Harrison?

223
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,494
I'm consulting
on this particular case.

224
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,229
Listen, Tina,
once this man is apprehended,

225
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,864
Your prototype
will be promptly returned.

226
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,866
You know nobody wants to ensure

227
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,269
The future's
technology more than me.

228
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,538
I appreciate the CCPD's
concerns, Mr. Allen,

229
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,576
But mercury is quite capable
of protecting its own assets.

230
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,679
Good luck with your manhunt.

231
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,424
Hey, Caitlin, check this out.

232
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,061
I think we can fashion
an electronic barrier, right?

233
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,497
We set up a ton
of super capacitors.

234
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,998
We smooth out
the inflection points,

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
And voila...

236
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:53,204
A kick-ass force field
to trap the opposite Flash.

237
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,774
That was me testing out a name.

238
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,275
What do you think?

239
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,647
Are you okay?

240
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,285
Ronnie's alive.

241
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,320
I saw him, Cisco.

242
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,956
I think he was following me.

243
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,492
Caitlin...

244
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,661
Ronnie died.

245
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,963
He was vaporized

246
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,799
In the accelerator
when it went critical.

247
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,167
Ronnie's alive,

248
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:27,105
And he's out there alone
and scared,

249
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,975
And I need your help
to find him.

250
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,890
- Ouch.
- Hmm...

251
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,993
- Your bruise is already healing.
- It still hurts, though.

252
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,629
Not for much longer, honey.

253
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,464
Here, come on.

254
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,903
I'll keep the light on for you.

255
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:03,141
Were you ever afraid
of the dark?

256
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,176
If I turn this light off now,

257
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,879
- Would you be scared?
- No.

258
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,647
That's because I'm here
with you.

259
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,051
See, you're not afraid
of the dark, Barry.

260
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,520
You're afraid of being alone
in the dark,

261
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,123
And that goes away
when you realize something.

262
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,961
You're never really alone.

263
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,629
It's time for bed.

264
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,130
I'm thirsty.

265
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,966
Oh, no, you're stalling.

266
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,568
But I got you covered, buddy.

267
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,637
Good night, slugger.

268
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,377
Sweet dreams,
my beautiful boy.

269
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,090
You can turn off the light.

270
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,874
Mom! Mom!

271
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,877
Nora!

272
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,980
Barry.

273
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,549
I called your name, like...

274
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,020
Your mom's case.

275
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:26,224
I used to study this board
every day.

276
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,359
Lately, I haven't looked at it

277
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,262
As much as I should have.

278
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,798
I didn't know you did that.

279
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,801
I guess there's still some
stuff about me you don't know.

280
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,442
Eddie asked me to move
in with him.

281
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,645
I said yes.

282
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,548
Wow.

283
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,420
You guys
are moving pretty fast, huh?

284
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,957
Well, I mean,
it's been a year.

285
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,560
Eddie thought you
might feel weird about it.

286
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,265
Wha... I don't...

287
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:10,668
Why would he say that?

288
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,371
He thinks that you...

289
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,207
Like me romantically.

290
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,843
I mean, honestly,
it sounds even silly

291
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,180
Suggesting it.
Um...

292
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,614
I mean, Eddie's wrong.

293
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:27,251
I... and if I've seemed
weird before,

294
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:32,190
It's just that this year
has gone by really fast,

295
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,292
And I guess I didn't realize

296
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:37,428
How far along in
your relationship you guys were.

297
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,467
That's what I told him.

298
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,836
Well, I guess

299
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,039
I should get going.

300
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,074
Bye.

301
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,115
It was you.

302
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:34,719
You were the one in my house
that night.

303
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,888
You killed my mother!

304
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,489
Why?

305
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,225
If you want to know that,

306
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,561
You're gonna have to catch me.

307
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,975
Not fast enough, Flash.

308
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,961
- Who are you?
- You know who I am, Barry.

309
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,836
I don't know who you are.

310
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,304
But you do, Barry.

311
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,840
We've been at this a long time,
you and I,

312
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,943
But I'm always one step ahead.

313
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,385
It is your destiny
to lose to me, Flash,

314
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,454
Just as it was
your mother's destiny

315
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,523
To die that night.

316
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,908
He acted like he knew me,
like we'd done this before.

317
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,476
He was antagonizing you, Bar.

318
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,378
I would get close,
and he'd just pull away.

319
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,580
I mean, this was
just some sick game to him.

320
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,981
You'll catch him.
We'll help.

321
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,216
No, you don't get it,
all right?

322
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,518
His speed, it is...
it's beyond me.

323
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,887
I'm not the fastest man alive.
He is.

324
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,957
So how do we catch somebody
that even I can't keep up with?

325
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,126
The beautiful thing
about force fields, Mr. Allen,

326
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,794
Is they're impervious to speed.

327
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,363
Now, we're almost finished
fabricating the trap,

328
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,065
And all that remains
is for Detective West

329
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,267
- to procure the bait.
- I'm on it.

330
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,504
Barry, why don't you stay here?

331
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:09,707
No, Joe, today is not the day
to tell me to stay behind.

332
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,315
If Judge Hankerson
was gonna sign this,

333
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,283
He would have done so already.

334
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,352
Look, I'm sure you don't want
this investigation

335
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,721
To get any more public than it's
already been, do you, doctor?

336
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,189
This has Harrison Wells

337
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,691
Written all over it
in big, black letters.

338
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:30,995
I am not giving you
my tachyon prototype.

339
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,664
It was quite the tour
of your facility, doctor.

340
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,167
You were fine to let
us dumb cops walk around,

341
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,202
But I majored in physics
and chemistry,

342
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,037
And I saw a whole lot of stuff

343
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,340
That<i> science showcase magazine</i>
would love to hear about.

344
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,076
So should I call
their editors directly

345
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:49,313
Or just leave a few posts
on their website?

346
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,717
You'll have the tachyon device
within the hour.

347
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,820
I see why Harrison holds you
in such esteem, Mr. Allen.

348
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,555
You're very much alike.

349
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,762
Nicely done.

350
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,433
- Hey, Joe, you got a second?
- Not now, Eddie.

351
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,136
I read the witness statement.
The Flash was there.

352
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,738
I know you got something
in the works.

353
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,640
Yeah, but you don't want
any part of this.

354
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,775
I've got a task force
approved to capture him,

355
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,910
And I want in.

356
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm not asking permission, Joe.

357
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,881
Excuse me?

358
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,249
If my task force
isn't a part of this,

359
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,251
I'll go to Captain Singh.

360
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,853
I'll tell him
something's going on,

361
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,855
And you're not talking...
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:35,459
You'd do the same thing
if you were me.

363
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,095
Fine.

364
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,733
We follow the ionized
particles,

365
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,136
And that should lead
us right to him.

366
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,172
The CPMs are increasing.

367
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,044
We should have told
Dr. Wells and Barry.

368
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:55,279
No, not until we're sure
it's him.

369
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,117
Oh, wow.

370
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,755
Look, Ronnie is not
like you remembered him.

371
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,326
What does that mean?

372
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:12,096
Just don't freak out
when you see him, okay?

373
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:15,733
Oh, I really wish that was
because the batteries were dead.

374
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,380
Ronnie?

375
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:33,918
Ronnie, it's me, Cait.

376
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,287
Look, I brought Cisco with me.

377
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:39,523
We're here to help you.

378
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,460
You were in an accident.
Do you remember?

379
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:45,930
I'm not Ronnie.

380
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:49,533
Yes, you are.
You're Ronnie Raymond.

381
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,837
I'm not Ronnie.
I told you that.

382
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,672
Now get away from me.

383
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,108
Look, we just need
to take you back

384
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,776
To S.T.A.R. Labs.

385
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:02,546
We'll help you remember
who you are.

386
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,149
Firestorm.

387
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,030
The tachyon device
is in place.

388
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,832
You think it'll work?

389
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,301
It'll work.

390
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,273
So how do we advertise to him
that the prototype's here?

391
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,909
We'll take care of that.

392
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,083
What's the problem?

393
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,218
Look, Barry...

394
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,755
Me and Dr. Wells
have spoken, and...

395
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,692
We think it would be best
if you weren't here for this.

396
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,528
What are you talking about?

397
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,062
You're too close to this.

398
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,898
Or maybe
you're not close enough.

399
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,366
If you hadn't been too scared

400
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:57,001
And warned me
that he was here weeks ago,

401
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,869
I could have been prepared
for this.

402
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,939
I think we can all appreciate
Joe's concern for Iris, Barry.

403
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,474
That's why I have to be here!

404
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,075
I'm the best chance
at catching this guy!

405
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:08,979
Not right now,
not in this state.

406
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,715
This man stabbed my mother
through the heart

407
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:14,285
And sent my father to prison
for it.

408
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,620
This is my fight.

409
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:20,057
Not today, son.

410
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,051
Caitlin...

411
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,153
Don't worry.

412
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,955
Hey.

413
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:54,158
Now that we know he's out there,
we will find Ronnie again.

414
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,294
Why...
so we can throw him in there

415
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,531
With all
the other meta-human psychos?

416
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,972
I used to play this game
in my head.

417
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:12,243
What would I give up for just
one more minute with him?

418
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,949
My house, my career...

419
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,185
The rest of my life?

420
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,224
Today I finally got
that minute.

421
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:30,160
And I wish I hadn't.

422
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,731
Seeing him like that,
what he's become...

423
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,002
Dear god...

424
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:40,971
I wish
he had just died that day.

425
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:44,241
Oh.

426
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,196
Merry Christmas, slugger.

427
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:11,101
Merry Christmas.

428
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:15,873
You all right, Barry?

429
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,776
I screwed up, dad.

430
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,280
After years of searching...

431
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,683
I finally found him.

432
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:30,120
I found the man
who killed mom...

433
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:33,457
The man in yellow,
the one in the lightning.

434
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:38,696
He's out there, and I had him.

435
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:42,032
He got away.

436
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:45,603
I-I was so close.

437
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:53,711
I promised you that
I would get you out of here.

438
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:57,548
Every day you spend in here
has been because of him...

439
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,618
Until today.

440
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,288
Now you're in here
because of me, and I'm so sorry.

441
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,590
I...

442
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,962
Barry.

443
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:16,467
Barry, this is not your fault.

444
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,502
Look at me.

445
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,505
I know what you've given up.

446
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,341
Every decision you've made
in the past 14 years

447
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,010
Has been
because of me and your mom...

448
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,378
What you studied,

449
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,749
Why you became a CSI,
even with Iris.

450
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:34,985
- Iris?
- You're my son.

451
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,322
You don't think
I know how you love her?

452
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,025
But you never pursued her

453
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,661
Because you were too consumed
with what happened to me

454
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,796
And your mom
to let yourself have a life.

455
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:49,099
Well, let it go now, Barry.

456
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:52,002
Hear me now.

457
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,673
The man in the yellow suit...

458
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,609
Has taken enough
from us already.

459
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,014
Don't let him take any more.

460
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:25,569
Hey.

461
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:26,737
Just in time.

462
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:29,173
I am almost done.

463
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,742
Are there awards
for tree trimming?

464
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,712
Because this is award-worthy.

465
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,385
Are you okay, Bar?

466
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,264
I love you, Iris.

467
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,667
Oh, I love you too.

468
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,275
When we were kids,
I loved you

469
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:08,612
Before I even knew
what the word "love" meant.

470
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,314
And then my mom died,

471
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:13,984
And I had to go live with
the girl that I had a crush on.

472
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,793
Look, I...
there were so many times

473
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:24,628
That I wanted to tell you...

474
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,798
Junior prom,
when I went away to college,

475
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,433
When I came back from college,

476
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,302
Nights that we stayed up
talking, all the birthdays,

477
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:35,606
All the Christmases,
but I-I never did.

478
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:39,843
I just... I kept it in.

479
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:42,146
After I lost my mom and my dad,

480
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:46,116
I was afraid that if you
didn't feel the same way,

481
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,887
I would lose you, too.

482
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,255
That's the irony.

483
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:55,759
I was so scared
of losing you that I did.

484
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:58,762
I know I've had our whole lives
to tell you this,

485
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,664
And you're with Eddie now,
and I know that,

486
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,499
And I know my timing
couldn't be any worse,

487
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,068
But I just...

488
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,905
I couldn't lie to you any more.

489
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,312
I'm sorry.

490
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,022
Okay.

491
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,635
Sending out another pulse.

492
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,073
Are you certain
this trap will work?

493
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,108
I've sent up at least three
charges into open satellite.

494
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,244
If anyone's looking
tachyonic particles,

495
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,079
They'll know we got them.

496
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,032
Let's see what we caught.

497
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,215
Cisco? Lights.

498
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,285
Sure thing, Dr. Wells.

499
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:40,063
Detective Thawne, would you
like to read him his rights?

500
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,835
Joe, what are you doing?

501
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:49,406
Getting some answers.

502
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:53,744
14 years ago,
you murdered Nora Allen.

503
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,245
I want to know why.

504
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,181
Why?

505
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:02,953
Dr. Wells, we meet at last.

506
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:05,422
What do you want
with the tachyonic particles?

507
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,759
My goals
are beyond your understanding.

508
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:12,529
Oh, I don't know,
I'm a pretty smart guy.

509
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,264
I knew
you were exceptionally fast,

510
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,900
So any trap we manufactured
would have to be invisible.

511
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,302
I knew your cells

512
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,038
Could repair themselves
at extraordinary speeds,

513
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,706
So you could withstand

514
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,475
The damage this is doing
to your body right now.

515
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,777
The super capacitors...

516
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,578
The containment field
is fluctuating.

517
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,213
They need to get
out of there now.

518
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,883
The reason I know all this
is because your powers

519
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:36,253
Are almost exactly
like those of the Flash.

520
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:38,922
Oh, I'm not like the Flash
at all.

521
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:42,626
Some would say I'm the reverse.

522
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,227
Dr. Wells, evacuate!

523
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,896
Get out of there now!

524
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:47,297
Dr. Wells!

525
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:57,274
Cisco, turn off the barrier!

526
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,309
If I turn it off,
that thing's gonna get out.

527
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,945
Cisco, he's gonna kill wells!

528
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,358
Find him!

529
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,841
Don't move, or we will shoot.

530
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,986
I warned you not to hunt me.

531
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,288
Barry!

532
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,703
Our race is not yet done.

533
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,939
See you soon, Flash.

534
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:48,385
Don't look for me again.

535
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,776
Why did it...

536
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,412
Not kill me?

537
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:17,514
I don't know, Eddie.

538
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,816
But you know more
than you've been telling me.

539
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:39,069
They're called meta-humans.

540
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:41,905
"Meta-humans"?

541
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:46,443
People with very powerful
abilities.

542
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:49,513
You and me are the only guys

543
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:53,383
On the force that know
what's really going on.

544
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:56,319
And we need to keep it
that way...

545
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,822
So nobody else gets hurt.

546
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,461
Can you do that?

547
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,537
And the Flash?

548
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,606
Do you know who he is?

549
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,481
Yeah, I do.

550
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,053
He's the guy that saved
both of our lives tonight.

551
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,199
I've been going over
the data,

552
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,034
And I still don't know why
the containment system failed.

553
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,503
I must have missed something.

554
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:47,671
I'm sorry.

555
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:50,006
It's not your fault, Cisco.

556
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:53,910
But if you both feel the need
to apologize for something,

557
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,046
You might start
with the not telling me

558
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,782
That Ronnie is still alive.

559
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:01,885
I asked Cisco
not to say anything.

560
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:05,088
Once I saw
what Ronnie had become,

561
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,924
I needed...

562
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:11,428
I needed time to see
if I could make him whole again.

563
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,463
I'm sorry.
I know you're mad.

564
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,265
No.

565
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,267
I don't know what I would have
done differently

566
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:20,403
In your situation.

567
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,573
I know I have made you a lot
of promises.

568
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,243
I know I've not been
able to keep them all.

569
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:30,914
But on my life,
I promise you this...

570
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,551
We will bring Ronnie home.

571
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,858
Hey, Bar.

572
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,797
You know my mom traveled
around the world twice?

573
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:51,134
She spent a semester
abroad in Spain,

574
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,937
And she loved it so much
that after she graduated,

575
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,972
She went to Europe.

576
00:37:55,974 --> 00:38:00,310
Didn't stop till she'd been
to a few dozen other cities.

577
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:06,583
She always wanted to go back,
but she never got a chance.

578
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:11,488
I offered to send you abroad
when you were in college.

579
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,856
Yeah, I know.
I remember.

580
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:14,958
I...

581
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,495
I couldn't take off.

582
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:20,997
I mean, the truth is

583
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:24,167
I'm stuck here...

584
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:26,836
In Central City.

585
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:31,608
Fear has kept me in that
living room for 14 years.

586
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:39,749
Joe, I-I was mad at you

587
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:42,319
For being scared.

588
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:45,522
But I mean, the truth is

589
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:49,693
I was
the one that was scared.

590
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:52,329
I've been afraid
of the man in yellow

591
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:56,299
For my whole life.

592
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,835
That's why I lost.

593
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,340
When you first moved in
with us,

594
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:06,076
I thought
it was gonna be too much.

595
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:10,113
I'm already a single dad.
Finances were tough.

596
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,215
And you were a little boy
who just lost his mother.

597
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:15,685
But, man, was I wrong.

598
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,587
Within two weeks, you had
changed the whole dynamic

599
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,255
Of the house.

600
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:22,092
Suddenly, the house was filled
with this...

601
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:24,027
Light..

602
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,695
This energy.

603
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,598
I mean,
you brightened up everything.

604
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,369
You'd seen more darkness
than any man will in a lifetime,

605
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,939
And you never let
it dim your soul.

606
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:39,743
So there I was, thinking
that I'm changing your life

607
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:42,612
By taking you in, but...

608
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,681
The truth is...

609
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,686
You changed mine.

610
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:52,822
So don't lose
that light now, Bar.

611
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,825
The world may need
the Flash, but...

612
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,966
I need my Barry Allen.

613
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,542
Let's go home.

614
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,644
Yeah.

615
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:24,053
♪ Have yourself a merry... ♪

616
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,522
- Hey.
- Oh.

617
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:27,657
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?

618
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,927
I invited them.

619
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,595
Where's Dr. Wells?

620
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,931
Uh, he wasn't feeling up
to a social gathering,

621
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,767
But he appreciated
the invitation.

622
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,604
- Eggnog?
- Yes.

623
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,607
Merry Christmas, Barry.

624
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,576
You too, Eddie.

625
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,945
Hey, I, um...

626
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,017
Well, I just wanted
to say, um...

627
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:56,252
I heard you're moving in
together,

628
00:40:56,254 --> 00:41:00,256
And I'm really happy for you.

629
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,959
Thanks.

630
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,897
Merry Christmas.

631
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,068
Mm.
Day like today,

632
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,539
Grandma Esther's eggnog seems
a little light on the bourbon.

633
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,110
- Hey, Joe.
- Hmm?

634
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:24,247
- I saw something weird tonight.
- Yeah, Cisco, I saw it too.

635
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:28,084
No, I mean, when the Flash
and the man in yellow

636
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,286
Were going full-on bumper cars
on each other,

637
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,655
I was watching the electricity
coming off of them...

638
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,891
Yellow and red electricity.

639
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,559
When Barry was a kid,

640
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,661
He said he saw red and yellow
lightning in his house

641
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,298
The night his mother died.

642
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,667
There were two of them.

643
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,303
The man in yellow
may have killed Barry's mother,

644
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,239
But...

645
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:52,976
There was another speedster
