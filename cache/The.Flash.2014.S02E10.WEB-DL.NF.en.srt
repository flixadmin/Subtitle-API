00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:05,172
BARRY: <i>I know I'm moving pretty fast, but
stop me if you've heard this one before.</i>

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,549
<i>Boy meets girl. Happens every day.</i>

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:11,261
<i>Except this boy was struck by lightning
and became the fastest man alive.</i>

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,888
<i>So, nothing is ever that simple.</i>

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,850
-(EXCLAIMS)
-Oh, my... Oh, uh... Careful.

6
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:22,064
-Ho! Sorry. It's all good. It's all good.
-(CHUCKLING)

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,233
Those... Those weren't
for me anyway, right?

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,819
They were. I didn't realize
roses were so flammable.

9
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,196
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,989
Well, it's the... It's the thought
that counts.

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,910
And, you know, proper fire safety
management, that counts most.

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:41,541
Yes. I have spent most of my life
feeling very unlucky.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,959
Yeah, and now?

14
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,878
Feels like I've been
struck by lightning twice.

15
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:52,177
No!

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,595
(PANTING)

17
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,517
Help!

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,355
(CHOKING) Help.

19
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:09,194
Flash, everything you have will be mine.

20
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,821
-No!
-No! No!

21
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:13,281
(SCREAMING)

22
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,575
(GASPS)

23
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,922
{\an8}Okay, so, there's my desk.
Upstairs is Anti-Crime and the CSI lab.

24
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:33,801
{\an8}That's where Barry works.
And we have the open files...

25
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,264
{\an8}And that is a pencil. That, stapler.

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,143
{\an8}Okay. Sorry, Wally. Obviously,
your sister got the funny genes.

27
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,102
Captain, I want you to meet somebody.

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,605
This is my son. Wally West.

29
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,106
Handsome young man, Joe.

30
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,691
Hey, he's a West. He can't help that.

31
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,860
Your pops here is a hell of a detective.

32
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,362
Obviously not.

33
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,449
Pleasure to meet you, Wally.

34
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,121
{\an8}Anyway. I'm glad you're here, Wally.

35
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,665
{\an8}Yeah, I've always wanted a baby brother.

36
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,583
{\an8}What about the White Shadow?

37
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,629
{\an8}You're joking but,
yeah, we did call Barry that.

38
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,799
{\an8}He's been pretty busy. He's doing
a whole lot of running around.

39
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,802
{\an8}But, why don't we do dinner?
The whole family?

40
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,470
I... I got plans.

41
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,930
Iris will cook.

42
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:21,266
Dad, we just met the kid.
We don't want to kill him.

43
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,810
All right. We do take-out.
Chinese, whatever. Come on.

44
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,020
Where are your cuffs, Tail Lights?

45
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,481
Come on. Let's go.

46
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,857
{\an8}You know that kid?

47
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:35,488
{\an8}Uh, no, no. You know, it's just
what they say. I got one of those faces.

48
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,242
{\an8}I'll see you guys at dinner.

49
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,660
{\an8}Okay.

50
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,373
{\an8}Any chance I could chat with you
for a minute?

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,833
{\an8}Yeah. What's up, Detective?

52
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:49,711
{\an8}Oh, I... I meant Iris.

53
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,672
{\an8}Yeah. You're not needed.

54
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:57,093
{\an8}I am needed. Somewhere.
I'm gonna go there.

55
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,511
{\an8}(CHUCKLES)

56
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,347
{\an8}What can I do for you?

57
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,183
{\an8}Uh, I just wanted to talk with you...

58
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,311
{\an8}About Barry.

59
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,235
{\an8}I know that Barry's, you know,
practically your brother

60
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,779
{\an8}so I understand that your loyalty
is obviously to him, not me,

61
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,907
{\an8}but I was just hoping that maybe
you would think I'm good for him,

62
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,201
{\an8}so you'd want to help me figure him out.
(CHUCKLES)

63
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,122
{\an8}Well, I mean, if you did that,
you would be the first.

64
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,500
{\an8}-Wonderful. That gives me tons of hope.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

65
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,377
{\an8}It's just... Um...

66
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,923
{\an8}He's being... Not "distant" but...

67
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,174
{\an8}"Guarded."

68
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,219
{\an8}Yeah. He's being guarded.

69
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,930
{\an8}And he's waking up from these bad dreams
and not telling me about them.

70
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:46,058
{\an8}And I know that we got close really quick.

71
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,937
{\an8}It's just... It's like
there's something holding him back.

72
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,524
{\an8}Here's the thing about Barry.

73
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,238
{\an8}He has a bad habit of carrying
the weight of the world on his shoulders.

74
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,740
Burdens that aren't even his to bear.

75
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,575
But he doesn't have to do that with me.

76
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,911
Which is exactly what you should tell him.

77
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,372
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

78
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,591
(CLATTERING)

79
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,346
Hey! No. Absolutely not.

80
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,266
You don't get to throw somebody else's
stuff when you're pissed off.

81
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,768
(CLATTERING)

82
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,228
Thank you.

83
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,485
What is this?

84
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,572
Wrong answers.

85
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:43,616
Maybe you're asking the wrong questions.

86
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,618
What does that mean?

87
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,620
I've been thinking about this a lot
recently.

88
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,457
We keep trying to come up with ways
to make Barry faster,

89
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,710
but I still think we can figure out a way
to make Zoom slower.

90
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,504
We tried that already, remember?
Those darts didn't slow him down at all.

91
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,089
Yeah, I know. I'm not
talking about the darts, okay?

92
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,467
The darts clearly didn't work.
They just pissed him off.

93
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,304
I'm talking about something else.
A way we can steal Zoom's speed.

94
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,977
How?

95
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,854
The Turtle.

96
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,482
As some of you may well know,

97
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,652
I've been deeply embroiled in a secret,
one-sided battle with an invisible enemy.

98
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,571
No. Not the Turtle again.

99
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,990
What? What is the...
Who is the Turtle?

100
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,533
It's Cisco's white whale.

101
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,826
Half whale, half turtle.

102
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:30,037
Mmm, no. Do you see what you're doing,
Caitlin? Everybody's confused now.

103
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,331
Get to it.

104
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,667
I stumbled upon a few of these cases when
we were looking for the Reverse-Flash.

105
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,462
Robberies that were seemingly
committed at high-speed.

106
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,255
People holding their beloved items
one second,

107
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,715
those items were gone the next.

108
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,216
Tell me what you see.

109
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,016
So he can, what? Stop time?

110
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:53,227
No, no, no. Look at the time code.
It's still running.

111
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:58,190
Yeah, okay. So if he's not stopping time,
what is he doing?

112
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,818
He's slowing down everything around him.

113
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,906
And that is why we call him The Turtle.

114
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:06,908
Why have you never
mentioned this guy to me before?

115
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,619
Oh, I don't know. I think we've just been
a little distracted, you know?

116
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,954
What with Captain Cold, and the
Weather Wizard, and Gorilla Grodd.

117
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,205
Do I need to go on?

118
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,042
Okay, so, if we can catch him,
figure out how he uses his powers...

119
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,045
Maybe we can show Zoom
what life is like in the slow lane.

120
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,838
How would you even know where to find him?

121
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,716
Well, the robberies in the videos
all correspond with police reports

122
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,886
that were dismissed as
"lost or missing items" instead of thefts.

123
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,054
The suspect's MO being?

124
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,889
Items of immense personal value.

125
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,230
Huh...

126
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,193
Oh! It appears that there's
a press conference at CCPD

127
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:45,112
because the Vandervoort diamonds
have just been recovered.

128
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,241
From hell's heart, I stab at thee.

129
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,788
The perpetrators who committed this
heartless crime have been apprehended,

130
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,247
and are now in our custody.

131
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,749
And we're happy to report

132
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,711
<i>that the famed Vandervoort diamonds have
been returned to their rightful owner.</i>

133
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,964
The real gem is the return
of my great grandfather's ring.

134
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,509
<i>Getting that returned to the family
is what's most priceless to me.</i>

135
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,844
Gotcha.

136
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,997
The ring is gone. What happened to it?

137
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,667
Lock this place down. No one
leaves this room. Sweep the Precinct.

138
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,672
Well, the good news is,

139
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,424
whatever the Turtle did,
it only affected you temporarily.

140
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,887
Yo! What was it like?
Being in Turtle Time?

141
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,306
Yeah. No, it was weird.
It was like waves of inertness.

142
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,644
Like all the energy was suddenly sucked
out of my body, and then it would return.

143
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,687
That's because
that's exactly what was happening.

144
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,815
He has the ability to transfer all the
surrounding kinetic energy into himself.

145
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,527
Leaving everyone else
in a temporary state of potential energy.

146
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,819
That's right.

147
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,696
So why could I still move?

148
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:13,117
Your speed. Your speed allows you to
change positions faster than anyone else.

149
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,078
So you can convert your stored
potential energy back to kinetic energy.

150
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,497
Excuse me. Where are you going?

151
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,541
Trying to figure out how to use this
against Zoom.

152
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,334
You remember Zoom?

153
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,212
"Cisco, please join me.

154
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,841
"We'll use your idea, and take it to new
scientific heights and save the world."

155
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,342
"Yes, I'd love to."

156
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,847
Okay! Facial recognition software
found us a match

157
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:40,227
from the press conference footage.
The Turtle's name is Russell Glosson.

158
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,771
He was a small-time thief,

159
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,649
who stopped thieving
after the particle accelerator explosion.

160
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,151
All right, I'm gonna head to work.
Catch Joe up.

161
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,320
Let me know if you find out
anything else.

162
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,033
You okay?

163
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,870
Yeah, yeah. It's just... (CLEARING THROAT)

164
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,834
It's hard to look at that and not think
about how I can't help people anymore.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,212
Well, we have lots of technology here.

166
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,381
Why don't we figure out
how to get your speed back?

167
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,926
(INHALES) I'm a scientist too, Caitlin.

168
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,638
And when I first got here, all I did was
work on how to get my speed back.

169
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,183
Believe me, whatever test you could run...

170
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,894
I've already done it.

171
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,069
JOE: <i>The Turtle?</i>

172
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,529
<i>Cisco's been looking for this guy forever.</i>

173
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,281
<i>Singh just put an APB out on him.</i>

174
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,243
Um... How did everybody know
about Glosson before I did?

175
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,412
Mmm. Cisco's got a whole list of
unidentified metas.

176
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,666
The boys around here are calling him
Cisco de La Mancha.

177
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,251
(CHUCKLES)

178
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,796
Hey, are you good?
You seem a little jittery.

179
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,047
A little anxious.

180
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,091
Let's be honest.

181
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,803
I'm really nervous about
this whole dinner tonight with Wally.

182
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,429
Come on. Why are you...
Why are you nervous?

183
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,974
You're, like, the best dad ever.
He'll see that.

184
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,435
(SIGHS) It'll be a whole lot easier
with you being there.

185
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,271
Joe, I wouldn't miss it.

186
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,482
-See you tonight.
-All right.

187
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,613
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

188
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,156
-You got a sec?
-Yeah.

189
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,448
I just...

190
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,451
I just want to make sure
everything's okay.

191
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,870
Yeah.

192
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,873
Yeah, I'm... I, uh, don't want to nag.

193
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,792
That's not, you know, who I am. I just...

194
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,046
I don't want you to feel burdened
by anything.

195
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,798
No, I don't.

196
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,675
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

197
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:39,931
Yeah, wait, Patty. The New Years
is always a hard time for me.

198
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,933
It's when my mom died,

199
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,143
so just those memories all come out
and they're hard to put away.

200
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,645
So if it feels like
I haven't been communicating...

201
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,229
I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I didn't know.

202
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,856
No, no, no.

203
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:54,570
Look, um, we haven't had a romantic night
in a while.

204
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:58,199
What do you say, tomorrow night,
we get some dinner and drinks,

205
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,160
and maybe a little kissing...

206
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,662
That sounds like what we need.

207
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,914
Okay. All right, I'll see you later.

208
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,248
Okay.

209
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:07,667
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

210
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,507
Okay, I think we can call it.
Wally is not coming.

211
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,428
I'm sorry, Joe.
I know how much this meant to you.

212
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,516
He's a kid, right? I get it.

213
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,060
He could have at least called.

214
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,687
Well, there could be a number of reasons
why he didn't.

215
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,067
Thank you for being here. I love you.

216
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,778
-I love you.
-(BOTH GROAN)

217
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,990
See you in the morning, Barr.

218
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,366
Yeah.

219
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,375
Well, West family 2.0
is not really off to a great start.

220
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,503
You've been quiet all evening.

221
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,506
The Turtle?

222
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,341
How do you know about him?

223
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,926
(CHUCKLES)

224
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,055
No, erm. No. Just had a lot on my mind.

225
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:09,228
Patty? We... We may have met for coffee.

226
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,397
Iris...

227
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,190
She really cares about you, Barry.

228
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,235
And she's just wondering
why you've been so "guarded."

229
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,862
And what did you tell her?

230
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,114
I told her to talk to you.

231
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,698
Oh, that's not cool.

232
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:27,830
You know, she did mention
that you've been having nightmares.

233
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,585
About Zoom killing her.

234
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:41,886
Look, I know that things have been
moving pretty fast between you two.

235
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,140
But you realize you can't keep things
from her forever, right?

236
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,936
One day, you're going to have to
tell her the truth.

237
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,355
That I'm The Flash? I can't do that.

238
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:58,152
Barry... I wish a year ago,
you had told me the truth.

239
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,029
So, what?
You think that I should just tell her?

240
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:04,783
I think that if you are serious
about being with her,

241
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,786
you have to.

242
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,376
All right. Then that's what I'm gonna do.

243
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:18,630
I'll tell Patty I'm The Flash.

244
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,100
Hey. You guys got anything?

245
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,435
I think we found the next target for

246
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,313
our 30-something
metahuman-not-a-ninja Turtle.

247
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,982
How long did it take you
to come up with that one?

248
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,817
It just came out of my mouth.
Did you see that? That was amazing.

249
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,528
Central City Museum is hosting
a special black-tie event tonight

250
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,530
showcasing <i>The Crystal Ball.</i>

251
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,242
It's a famous painting, apparently,

252
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,826
recently recovered from Markovia.

253
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,122
The painting is on loan to the museum
from the Silverberg family.

254
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,167
{\an8}Jacob Silverberg, himself, said, "The
painting's safe return means more to us

255
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
"than all the money in the world."

256
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,463
It's like they're begging Turtle
to rob it.

257
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,298
Okay, yes. This is a plan.

258
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:07,429
So, the Turtle will make his move, and
we can be there waiting to take him down.

259
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,598
How do you look in a tux?

260
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,560
Come on. He's 6'2", he's square-jawed
and he's jacked. I think he looks fine.

261
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,811
I'm 6'4".

262
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,188
Oh, crap.

263
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,439
Problem?

264
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,860
No. No.

265
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,738
An opportunity. Maybe. Hold on.

266
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,327
Hey, you. I'm excited to see you tonight.

267
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,538
Yeah, me too. Actually, about that, um...

268
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,418
So I know I said let's have dinner, but,
uh, you've been wanting me to share more.

269
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:41,755
So, I thought that I would share
that I love art.

270
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,341
Okay. Interesting.

271
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,886
<i>Yeah. No, it's just, you know,
I can't get enough of art.</i>

272
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,556
Anyway, there's this event
at the Central City Museum tonight.

273
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:53,684
They're showing this really famous
painting that I've always loved.

274
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,438
Actually, I don't know anything about art.

275
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:03,152
But, what's the saying? I know what
I like, and I like you, so count me in.

276
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,237
All right, great. I'll see you at 8:00.

277
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,488
ALL: 7:00.

278
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,781
Or 7:00. I'll see you at 7:00.

279
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,575
Okay. 7:00 it is.

280
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:10,826
Bye.

281
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,871
You know, you're a really great superhero,
a really great superhero...

282
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,082
Thanks. Thank you.

283
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,626
But, do you think it's a good idea, when
you're fighting crime, to bring a date?

284
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,380
I'm gonna tell Patty that I'm The Flash.

285
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,134
What... Is that a bad idea?
What do we think?

286
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:31,013
I will say, she put bullets
in King Shark and Harry.

287
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,058
So, as far as I'm concerned,
that's Team Flash material to me.

288
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,477
All right. Yes. Thank you, Cisco.
Yeah. Thank you.

289
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:37,769
-Cool.
-Mmm...

290
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,272
I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna tell her.

291
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,735
Don't tell her.

292
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,114
Huh?

293
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,451
You care for this woman?

294
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,953
(CHUCKLES)

295
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,789
That's nice. Then keep her
as far away from this as possible.

296
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,625
And here's why.

297
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:06,465
If Zoom finds out who you care for,
who you love, who you live for,

298
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,261
he'll take them from you.

299
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,493
(SIGHS) All right. Keep your eyes open
for the Turtle.

300
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,912
A sentence I never thought I would say.

301
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,844
Cisco, are you and Harry in position?

302
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,223
CISCO: <i>I'm in the security feed. I've got
the facial recognition software running,</i>

303
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,517
so we'll be able to spot Turtle
before he makes his move.

304
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,976
(WHISPERS) Turtle.

305
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,522
Why do you insist
on giving them ridiculous nicknames?

306
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,359
Me? Who's the genius
that came up with "Zoom?"

307
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,656
Yeah, well...

308
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,785
I'll tell you.

309
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:21,540
About two years ago,
this was on Earth-2 now,

310
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:29,881
the CCPD there, they got a 911 call
about a hostage situation.

311
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,470
But when the S.W.A.T. team got there,
there were no hostages.

312
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:36,972
It was a trap.

313
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:42,603
Zoom set a trap in order to show
the police that they could not stop him.

314
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:48,650
And he killed 14 officers. Men and women.

315
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:54,365
Slaughtered them.
Left one alive to tell what happened.

316
00:17:55,074 --> 00:18:01,788
That officer described blue lightning
zooming all about

317
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,416
as his comrades,

318
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,919
brothers- and sisters-in-arms,
were murdered.

319
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:14,135
That officer considered himself
to be a lucky one,

320
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,888
spared in order to tell the tale,

321
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,476
until Zoom went to his house that night
and killed him, too.

322
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,357
Anyway, that's how
we got the nickname Zoom.

00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,121

326
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,291

I can't figure you out, Barry Allen.

337
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:36,217
That is because I work hard
to hide who I really am.

338
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,469
You don't have to hide with me.

339
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,765
I just have to really trust someone,

340
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,477
if they're gonna know the truth.

341

362

00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:02,633
He saves people who need saving.

466
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,554
It's a waste of time saving people.

467
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,351
They take everything for granted.

468
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,146
So you take the things
that matter most to them.

469
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,108
My wife, Rosalyn, took me for granted.

470
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:23,321
She wanted to leave me,
the thing I valued most.

471
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,658
So that's what this is about?
You're hurt because your wife left you.

472
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,412
I couldn't let that happen.

473
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,876
So I made her mine.

474
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,337
Forever.

475
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:47,888
(GASPS)

476
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,159
I do hope I spelled your name right.

477
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,704
JOE: <i>Barr, we'll find her.</i>

478
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,415
I'm not getting any leads on this guy.

479
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:17,125
It's like he's totally
fallen off the grid.

480
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,253
(STUTTERS) You know, any of the stuff
he's stolen, I can't find it.

481
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,382
He keeps them. He keeps them
the way a serial killer collects trophies.

482
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,884
He's stolen a lot of stuff.

483
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,303
Which means he needs a lot of space
to store it, right?

484
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:32,057
That's where we start.
See if he rented any storage spaces.

485
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,393
No, no... I'm not getting anything.

486
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:40,398
Wait a minute. His ex-wife used to be
an archivist

487
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,568
for antiquities at the Naydel Library
before it shut down.

488
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:46,571
And it shut down three months
after the accelerator exploded.

489
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:48,656
That place is big enough to hold
Turtle's stuff?

490
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,200
Okay, all right.

491
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,203
Wait, Barry, we haven't even figured out
how to neutralize the Turtle's power.

492
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,205
Well, I'm gonna have to power through it.

493
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,586
(PANTING) All right.
I'm outside the library.

494
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,089
Barry, the only way to save Patty

495
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,049
is if you grab her
in between each of the Turtle's pulses.

496
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,884
You'll only have two-tenths of a second
to make your moves.

497
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,178
I got it.

498
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,978
(GRUNTING) No!

499
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,980
(SHUDDERING)

500
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,836
(GROANING)

501
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,812
I guess he doesn't care about you
as much as I thought.

502
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,441
No!

503
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,822
No! No! Please...

504
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,940
(GRUNTS)

505
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,193
(PANTING)

506
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,864
Patty. It's all right.

507
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,495
Thank you. Thank you.

508
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:01,539
Thank you, whoever you are.

509
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,169
It's okay. It's okay.

510
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:17,472
Hey, Turtle.

511
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,934
So you want to know
my new definition of "irony"?

512
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,522
Now you are our most prized possession.

513
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,817
(CHUCKLES)

514
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,736
(SCREAMING)

515
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:34,780
Patty okay?

516
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,116
She is. Yeah.

517
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,504
CAITLYN: <i>Jay.</i>

518
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,256
Yeah?

519
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,803
I know. Why didn't you tell me
that you're sick?

520
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,767
The champagne...

521
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,352
You took my DNA off the glass.

522
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:08,856
You know I lost my husband.
How hard that was for me to move on.

523
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:13,569
How could you let me get close to you
knowing that soon, I'd lose you, too?

524
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:15,363
(INHALES SHARPLY)

525
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,493
I just... I didn't expect this.

526
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,078
I didn't expect you.

527
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,705
Then help me find a cure.

528
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,625
There is no cure.

529
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,129
The only way to save me
is to get my speed back.

530
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,175
And the only way to do that
is to stop Zoom.

531
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,343
Then let's stop him.

532
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,347
Yeah.

533
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,977
(KNOCKING)

534
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,982
Hey.

535
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:55,611
I think I left my sweater here
the other night. It's green.

536
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,156
Oh, yeah.

537
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,576
I thought that didn't look like Barry's.

538
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,291
I'm heading back to Keystone tonight.

539
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,335
That's a fast trip.

540
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,213
Yeah, well, it's getting a little hot
in Central City for me.

541
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,174
Don't worry, I'll try not to run
too many lights on the way there.

542
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:25,891
You know, if you're waiting
for an apology, it's not coming.

543
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,853
No, no. I'm...

544
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,772
I'm the one that should be apologizing
to you.

545
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:37,612
I felt bad not being there
while you were growing up,

546
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,366
and I was pushing
this whole father-son thing.

547
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,576
I'm sorry.

548
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,246
Let's just slow down a bit.

549
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:48,498
I won't try to be your instant dad

550
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,126
and you won't have to pretend
that you want to be my son.

551
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:55,170
Deal?

552
00:36:58,048 --> 00:36:59,259
All that food for you?

553
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,263
Doesn't have to be. You like chow mein?

554
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,139
No.

555
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,935
But I like kung pao chicken.

556
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,990
PATTY: <i>Initial and sign.</i>

557
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,536
<i>There you go. Thank you, guys.
Crazy night.</i>

558
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,829
-Patty. Hey.
-Hi.

559
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,915
Um, can we talk? Like, really talk?

560
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:32,166
Yeah, uh...

561
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,294
No. Now is not really an awesome time.

562
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,547
I have a mountain of paperwork on my desk
I need to finish, so I'm sorry, I can't...

563
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,257
Okay, no, no. Okay. Really quick.

564
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,927
Um, so you were right.
You were right about everything.

565
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:47,932
Um, I've been closed off and weird
and all the things that you said I was.

566
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:51,811
But mostly, I have not been honest.

567
00:37:51,977 --> 00:37:53,020
Barry?

568
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,399
I'm leaving Central City.

569
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,279
What?

570
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:06,742
Before Mardon, and before my dad,
before everything

571
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,620
I always wanted to be CSI.

572
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,416
And four years ago, I was accepted into
the Forensic Science program

573
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,875
at Midway City University.

574
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,921
That's a really great school.

575
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,800
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I just... I didn't go.

576
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:27,137
You know, I deferred to become a cop
and catch my dad's killer.

577
00:38:29,014 --> 00:38:30,308
And I've done that.

578
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,810
So, uh...

579
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,563
So it's time to move on.

580
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,483
From the job.

581
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,112
From everything.

582
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,328
Patty, Patty, Pat...

583
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,966
<i>Journal log entry number 113.</i>

584
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:10,222
Jess, I'm coming for you.

585
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,142
Soon. I promise.

586
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,397
<i>I was thinking earlier today
about the time that you were four,</i>

587
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,858
<i>I took you to the planetarium,
just you and me.</i>

588
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,612
I remember because it was the first time
I took you out all by myself.

589
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,408
The planetarium was crowded,
you held my hand for dear life.

590
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,494
Or maybe it was the other way around.

591
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,455
But it was in the Mars exhibit
that I lost you.

592
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,124
Panic. I had that place locked down.

593
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,669
And in one minute, I had
every security guard looking for you,

594
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,505
and I could feel the fear rise
in the back of my throat,

595
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,965
and something else rising also.

596
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:50,388
Some dark instinct inside me

597
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:54,850
<i>about what I would do
to the person who had taken you.</i>

598
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,894
<i>The things I would do...</i>

599
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,647
<i>Unspeakable things.</i>

600
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:06,361
<i>And it was in that moment that I realized
for certain</i>

601
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,702
<i>that I would do anything to get you back.</i>

602
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,594

Gideon.

604
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,694
Yes, Professor Thawne?

605
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,320
Where the hell am I?
