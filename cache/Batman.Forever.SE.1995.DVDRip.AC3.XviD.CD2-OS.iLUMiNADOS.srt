1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,318
I have something for you. It's on the table.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,432
I hope you like it.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,836
Call it clinical intuition.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,796
I thought your dreams
might need changing.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,389
My parents were murdered
in front of me...

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,277
when I was just a kid.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,314
I don't...

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,514
remember a lot of what happened...

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,271
but what I do comes to me
in my dreams, flashes.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,636
There's a new element now though,
I haven't seen before.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,797
It's a red leather book.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,072
Something else.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,118
My dreams are coming to me
when I'm awake now.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,913
Bruce, you're describing
repressed memories.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,515
Images of a forgotten pain
that's trying to surface.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,275
Oh, damn. Wait, I'll be right back.

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,508
Is it possible...

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,319
there's an aspect of your parents' death
that you haven't faced?

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,789
You were so young when it happened.

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,758
Maybe I'll leave you two alone.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,477
This goes way beyond taking
your work home, doesn't it, Doctor?

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,319
All right.

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,599
I think he's fascinating.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,913
Clinically.

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,917
Why does a man do this?

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,355
It's as if he's cursed
to pay some great penance.

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,035
What crime could he have committed
to deserve a life of nightly torture?

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,317
It's more than just...

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,679
professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,351
Bruce, are you jealous?

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,195
No.

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,310
I can't be jealous of Batman.

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,558
I want to be close,
but you won't let me near.

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,918
What are you protecting me from?

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,879
You want to know me?

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,519
You want to know who I am?

37
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,114
I guess...

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,512
we're all two people.

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,718
One in daylight,
and the one we keep in shadow.

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,549
Rage, violent...

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,114
passion.

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,474
Excuse me.

43
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,073
I'm kind of busy.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,434
<i>I'm sorry to bother you, sir.</i>

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,557
<i>I have some rather distressing news</i>
<i>about Master Dick.</i>

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,675
Is he all right?

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,877
<i>I'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.</i>

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,839
He ran away?

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,996
<i>Actually, he took the car.</i>

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,479
He boosted the Jag?

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,959
<i>Not the Jaguar.</i>

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,753
<i>The other car.</i>

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,552
- The Bentley?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,151
<i>The other car.</i>

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,071
Come for a little ride
in my love machine, babies.

56
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,433
Chill, this is Batman.

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,511
Open up, Batman.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,309
Wait a minute. That's not Batman.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,799
What're you talking about?

60
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,359
That's Batboy.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,558
It ain't the Bat!

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,479
Go, go!

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,069
Hey! Let her go!

64
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,558
Who the hell are you?

65
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,159
I'm Batman.

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,190
So I forgot my suit, all right?

67
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,318
- Come on, run!
- Wait.

68
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,630
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

69
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,674
- Go.
- Thanks, you saved my life.

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,194
I could definitely
get into this superhero gig.

71
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,833
Batman!

72
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,668
Bastard!

73
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,679
It should've been you! It's your fault!

74
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,399
If you'd have told Two-Face
who you were at the circus...

75
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,391
they'd still be alive!

76
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,949
If Bruce Wayne could've given his life
for your family, he would have.

77
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,037
All I can think about every second
of the day is getting Two-Face.

78
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,628
He took my whole life.

79
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,798
When I was out there tonight...

80
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,235
I imagined it was him that I was fighting...

81
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,072
even when I was fighting you.

82
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,033
And all the pain went away.

83
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,989
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I do.

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,871
Good. 'Cause you gotta help me find him.

85
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,198
And when we do...

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,396
I'm the one who kills him.

87
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,154
So, you're willing to take a life?

88
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,831
As long as it's Two-Face.

89
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,675
Then it will happen this way:

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,672
You make the kill.

91
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,718
But your pain doesn't die with Harvey,
it grows.

92
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,793
So you run out into the night
to find another face and another...

93
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,559
and another...

94
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,357
until one terrible morning
you wake up and realize...

95
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,789
that revenge has become your whole life...

96
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,351
and you won't know why.

97
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,397
You can't understand.

98
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,199
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

99
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,713
Yes, they were.

100
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,273
We're the same.

101
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,676
If we're the same, Bruce, help me.

102
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,149
Train me, let me be your partner.

103
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,195
No.

104
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,948
I can't.

105
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,636
You still have a choice.

106
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,034
Look, Bruce, I'm a part of this,
whether you like it or not.

107
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,512
<i>And tonight, all of Gotham society</i>
<i>has turned out for Edward Nygma's...</i>

108
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,478
<i>gala unveiling of his New Improved Box.</i>

109
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,956
- Thanks, Al.
- My pleasure, sir.

110
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,429
<i>They'll be dining and dancing</i>
<i>the night away...</i>

111
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,112
<i>on the glamorous roof of the Ritz Gotham.</i>

112
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,751
Mr. Nygma,
what's it like to have your face...

113
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,831
on the cover of every magazine
in Gotham?

114
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,636
Edward, how does it feel to be
the city's newest, most eligible bachelor?

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,070
Gotham must know!

116
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,152
There's Bruce Wayne!

117
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,389
Brucie!

118
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,115
Eddie, he is too cute.

119
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,589
How come you don't look
so good in that suit?

120
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,955
Shut up. You're here to work.

121
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,158
- How's my mole?
- Fine.

122
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,916
What about rumors of a NygmaTech
takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

123
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,356
NygmaTech's stock is outselling
Wayne Enterprises' 2-to-1.

124
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,318
- Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?
- Yes.

125
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,713
Bruce, old man.

126
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,916
The press were just wondering
what it feels like...

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,594
to be outsold, outclassed,
out-coiffed and...

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,075
generally outdone in every way.

129
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,835
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

130
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,070
Great party. Nice suit.

131
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,839
Wit. Good.

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,230
- And you are?
- Chase.

133
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,548
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

134
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,476
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...

135
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,160
You can call me anything you want.

136
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,912
Ladies and gentlemen, the future!

137
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,030
My New Improved Box offers
fully interactive holographic fantasies.

138
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,510
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

139
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,673
How do you create these images, hon?

140
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,388
That, my dear, is my little secret.

141
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,597
Fully interactive holographs.

142
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,036
Only a high-frequency carrier wave,
beamed directly into the brain...

143
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,712
could create such images.

144
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,109
Yeah, and you wish you'd thought of it.

145
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,191
Yes, don't be a sore loser, Brucie.

146
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,238
- Step inside. Give it a try.
- Edward...

147
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,675
if you can introduce images
into the mind...

148
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,355
what prevents you
from extracting images out of the mind?

149
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,358
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.

150
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,753
Shall we dance?

151
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,472
Naughty, naughty.

152
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,833
Looking for something?

153
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,718
I was just wondering how you turn it off.

154
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,394
Clever.

155
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,470
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

156
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,397
<i>Good evening, Mr. Wayne.</i>

157
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,749
<i>Relax.</i>

158
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,955
<i>Tell me your dreams.</i>

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,790

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,548
<i>Tell me your secrets.</i>

161
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,674
<i>Tell me...</i>

162
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,236
<i>your deepest, darkest...</i>

163
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,673
<i>fears.</i>

164
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,637
No. No!

165
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,313
Relax, folks!

166
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,756
It's only an old-fashioned
low-tech stickup!

167
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,796
We're interested in the basics!

168
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,156
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

169
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,789
Hand them over nice and quietly,
and no one will be hurt.

170
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,392
Emergency, Alfred.

171
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,348
Yes, sir?

172
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,718
Be calm, everybody!

173
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,558
Just be calm!

174
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,914
Excuse me!

175
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,471
You're ruining my big party!
Are you insane?

176
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,438
We're sick of waiting for you
to deliver the Batman, dear boy.

177
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,476
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

178
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,437
Patience, hell, we want him dead!

179
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,069
And nothing brings out the Batman
like a little murder and mayhem!

180
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,435
The least you could have done
is let me in on the caper.

181
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,672
We could have organized this, planned it,
pre-sold the movie rights.

182
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,514
Batman!

183
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,389
Your entrance was good, his was better.

184
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,748
The difference? Showmanship.

185
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,878
Emergency, Alfred.

186
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,350
Oh, sir. I could be fired for this, sir.

187
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,549
Perhaps they'll have me back
at Buckingham Palace.

188
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,949
All right, boys! Phase Two!

189
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,956
My place, midnight.

190
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,478
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

191
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,709
Why can't you just die?

192
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,955
Hi.

193
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,232
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

194
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,959
You got a real gratitude problem,
you know that, Bruce?

195
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,508
I need a name. Batboy? Nightwing?

196
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,239
I don't know, what do you think?
What's a good sidekick name?

197
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,311
How about
"Dick Grayson, college student"?

198
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,119
Screw you. I just saved your life.
You owe me.

199
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,078
You were totally out of control.
You're going to get yourself killed.

200
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,594
- You're looking at your new partner.
- No.

201
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,636
Whenever you go out at night,
I'll be watching.

202
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,439
And wherever Batman goes,
I'm gonna be right beside him.

203
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,829
I mean, how are you gonna stop me?

204
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,433
I can stop you.

205
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,234
Al, hang this next to the Batsuit...

206
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,478
where it belongs.

207
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,710
And you're encouraging him.

208
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,349
Young men with a mind for revenge
need little encouragement.

209
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,158
They need guidance.

210
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,712
You, above all, should know
the consequences of the life you choose.

211
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,640
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

212
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,079
Perhaps the lady's just what
the doctor ordered.

213
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,435
She seems lovely and wise.

214
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,273
I've never been in love before, Alfred.

215
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,279
Go to her.

216
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,472
Tell her how you feel.

217
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,994
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

218
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,832
Let the lady decide.

219
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,114
I'm sorry.

220
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,758
I can't believe this.

221
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,718
I've imagined this moment
since I first saw you.

222
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,918
Your eyes.

223
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,639
Your lips.

224
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,759
Your body.

225
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,591
And now I have you...

226
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,753
and I'm wishing you were somebody else.

227
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,713
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

228
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,118
I've met someone.

229
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,153
He's not you.

230
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,276
I hope you can understand.

231
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,033
I understand.

232
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,948
Well...

233
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,276
That's just what I said.

234
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,519
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:

235
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,036
How to map the human mind.

236
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,994
Would you like to see what our old friend
Bruce Wayne has in his head?

237
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,798
Riddle me this.

238
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,633
What kind of man has bats on the brain?

239
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,600
- Go ahead. You can say it.
- You're a genius.

240
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,398
Oh, stop.

241
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,431
So, from this day on...

242
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,672
Batman is no more.

243
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,593
You can't just quit. I mean...

244
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,831
there's monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.

245
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,595
I've dedicated my life
to helping strangers I've never met.

246
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,711
Faces I've never seen.

247
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,311
Well, the innocent aren't
faceless anymore.

248
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,757
You can't tell me what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

249
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,752
My dad told me
that every man goes his own way.

250
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,796
My way goes to Two-Face.

251
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,952
You gotta help me.

252
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,511
And if you do find Harvey...

253
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,989
and then you kill him, what next?

254
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,228
Exactly.

255
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,995
Then you'd be alone, like me.

256
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,751
No, you've got to let this go.

257
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,717
Listen to me, Dick. I'm your friend.

258
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,598
I don't need a friend right now, all right?
I need a partner.

259
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,636
Two-Face has got to pay.

260
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,914
Please.

261
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,555
Chase is coming over for dinner.
I'm going to tell her...

262
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,433
everything.

263
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,795
Come on upstairs. We'll talk.

264
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,519
- Good evening, Dr. Meridian.
- Good evening, Alfred.

265
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,273
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween to you.

266
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,517
I asked you here tonight...

267
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,751
because there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

268
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,990
I wanted to tell you something, too.

269
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,153
What I wanted...

270
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,711
Go ahead, you go first.

271
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,592
All right, okay.

272
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,912
Trick or treat!

273
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,710
All my life, I have been...

274
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,709
I have been attracted
to a certain kind of man.

275
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,392
The wrong kind of man.

276
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,916
And, I mean, look what I do
for a living, right?

277
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,033
And since I met you, I...

278
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,988
Oh, God.

279
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,232
Why am I so nervous?

280
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,591
And don't eat too much tonight...

281
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,513
or you'll be sick in your beds.

282
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,114
Happy Halloween!

283
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,397
Bruce, what's wrong?

284
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,311
It's happening again.

285
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,748
Flashes.

286
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,952
My parents' death.

287
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,479
Your memories are trying
to break through, don't fight them.

288
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,516
I want to tell you something.

289
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,717
- Something I've never told anyone.
- It's all right.

290
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,791
It's all right. I'm here.

291
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,874
<i>I'm here.</i>

292
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,549
<i>The night of my parents' wake...</i>

293
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,508
<i>the priest's words gave no comfort.</i>

294
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,359
<i>Of course.</i>

295
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,270
<i>There, on my father's desk, the red book.</i>

296
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,759
<i>His journal.</i>
<i>He had written in it every day of my life.</i>

297
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,954
<i>But now he'd never write in it again.</i>

298
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,599
<i>At that moment, I knew</i>
<i>my life would never be the same.</i>

299
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,354
<i>I raced out into the storm...</i>

300
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,396
<i>trying to outrun the rage.</i>

301
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,754
<i>The pain.</i>

302
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,159
<i>Then I fell.</i>

303
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,273
<i>I fell forever.</i>

304
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,351
<i>The cave was monstrous.</i>

305
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,199
<i>It must have been there for centuries.</i>

306
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,077
<i>And there, deep in the shadows...</i>

307
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,314
<i>I saw...</i>

308
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,396
<i>It was coming toward me.</i>

309
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,958
<i>I was scared at first, but only at first.</i>

310
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,079
<i>The figure in the dark was my destiny.</i>

311
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,269
<i>It would change my life forever.</i>

312
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,390
<i>I would use its image to strike terror...</i>

313
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,869
<i>into the hearts of those who did evil.</i>

314
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,078
<i>I would ensure what happened to me</i>
<i>would never happen to anyone else again.</i>

315
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,032
<i>I would have my revenge.</i>

316
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,279
Bruce, what are you trying to tell me?

317
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,912
Chase, I'm...

318
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,228
Twick or tweet!

319
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,429
Trick.

320
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,758
Remember the plan.

321
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,751
Seize and capture.

322
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,232
- No killing.
- That goes double for you.

323
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,711
If I was a superhero...

324
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,835
where would I hide?

325
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,151
Spank me.

326
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,837
<i>Intruder alert!</i>

327
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,630
"Intruder alert!"

328
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,233
Shut up!

329
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,833
Now, that's impressive!

330
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,878
You know, it's always risky introducing
a tamed animal into the wild.

331
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,713
They may have trouble adapting
to their new environment.

332
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,792
Somebody tell the fat lady she's on in five.

333
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,991
Joygasm!

334
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,353
Get the girl!

335
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,635
No!

336
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,638
Don't kill him.

337
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,792
If you kill him...

338
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,196
...he won't learn nothing.

339
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,389
Bruce!

340
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,113
Master Bruce.

341
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,671
How are you, young man?

342
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,598
You haven't called me that for a long time.

343
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,592
Old habits die hard.

344
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,072
Are you all right?

345
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,070
- Where's Chase?
- I'm afraid they've taken Dr. Meridian.

346
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,311
Master Dick has run away.

347
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,070
The cave has been destroyed.

348
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,750
And there's another riddle.

349
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,710
I'm coming, my sweet.

350
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,912
Like the jacket?

351
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,670
It keeps me safe
when I'm jogging at night.

352
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,596
Batman will come for me.

353
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,794
Batman?

354
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,632
Batman, you say?

355
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,393
Coming for you?

356
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,671
I'm counting on it!

357
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,033
What is that? Where's that coming from?

358
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,154
- There.
- Who the hell is doing that?

359
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,039
The Riddler.

360
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,192
"We're five little items
of an everyday sort.

361
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,594
"You'll find us all in a tennis court."

362
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,874
In...

363
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,191
"A, E, I, O, U." Vowels.

364
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,992
Not entirely unclever, sir.

365
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,548
But what do a clock, a match...

366
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,710
chess pawns, and vowels
have in common?

367
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,199
What do these riddles mean?

368
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,397
Every riddle has a number in the question
and they arrived in this order:

369
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,870
13, 1, 8, and 5.

370
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,394
13, 1, 8, and 5.

371
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,708
What do they mean?

372
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,756
Perhaps letters of the alphabet?

373
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,751
Of course, 13 is "M."

374
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,150
1 would be "A," 8 would be "H"
and 5 would be "E."

375
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,196
"M-A-H-E."

376
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,634
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.

377
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,310
18 is "R."

378
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,118
"M-R-E."

379
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,390
How about "Mr. E"?

380
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,870
- Mystery?
- And another name for mystery?

381
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,154
Enigma.

382
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,152
Mr. E. Nygma.

383
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,113
Edward Nygma.

384
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,234
Stickley's suicide was obviously
a computer-generated forgery.

385
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,676
You really are quite bright,
despite what people say.

386
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,235
Are all the Batsuits destroyed, Alfred?

387
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,278
All except the prototype
with the sonar modifications you invented.

388
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,998
But you haven't tested it yet.

389
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,558
Tonight's a good night.

390
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,719
What do you suggest, Alfred? By sea...

391
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,239
or by air?

392
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,593
Why not both?

393
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,358
Who's your tailor?

394
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,396
I took the liberty, sir.

395
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,355
"R"? What's that stand for?

396
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,909
Robin.

397
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,878
Riddler and Two-Face can make
a pretty lethal combination.

398
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,757
I figured you could use a hand.

399
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,229
Two against two are better odds.

400
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,595
I can't promise I won't kill Harvey.

401
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,116
A man's got to go his own way.

402
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,516
A friend taught me that.

403
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,712
Not just a friend.

404
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,159
A partner.

405
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,672
He's not coming.

406
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,713
Shut it down.

407
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,312
Wait a minute!

408
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,956
Hey, go!

409
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,793
Go.

410
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,751
A-14.

411
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,229
Hit!

412
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,154
- Sweet.
- B-12.

413
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,033
Hit! And my favorite vitamin, I might add.

414
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,959
- That sinking feeling.
- I like this game.

415
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,155
C-9.

416
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,074
You sunk my battleship.

417
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,479
Who, me?

418
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,672
This is your captain speaking.

419
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,719
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.

420
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,559
I got him.

421
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,549
I hope they can find the little black box.

422
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,114
Now...

423
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,117
the real game begins.

424
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,556
Holy rusted metal, Batman!

425
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,871
The ground, it's all metal.

426
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,474
It's full of holes, you know. Holey.

427
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,519
Robin, wait.

428
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,799
The whole island's moving.

429
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,593
Looking for us?

430
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,351
That was for my mother!

431
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,959
My father!

432
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,833
My brother!

433
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,358
And this is for me.

434
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,790
Finally, justice is served!

435
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,433
Let us die!

436
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,439
You're a man after our own heart, son.

437
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,517
I'll see you in hell.

438
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,350
I'd rather see you in jail.

439
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,550
Oh, good boy.

440
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,717
The Bat has taught you very well.

441
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,677
Noble. Stupid...

442
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,879
but noble.

443
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,557
Riddle me this.

444
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,153
Riddle me that.

445
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,671
Who's afraid of the big black bat?

446
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,997
No more tricks, Edward.

447
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,672
Very well, then.

448
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,952
Let's get real.

449
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,270
Release Chase.
This is between you and me.

450
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,874
And me. And me!

451
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,910
You've been sucking Gotham's
brain waves...

452
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,468
and now you've devised a way
to read men's minds.

453
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,073
You betcha!

454
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,751
Soon my little Box will be on
countless TVs around the world...

455
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,628
feeding me credit-card numbers,
bank codes...

456
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,711
sexual fantasies, and little white lies.

457
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,836
Into my head they'll go.

458
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,310
Victory is inevitable.

459
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,830
For if knowledge is power...

460
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,678
then a God am...

461
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,834
I!

462
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,793
Was that over the top? I can never tell.

463
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,753
By the way, I've seen your mind, freak!

464
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,277
Yours is the greatest riddle of all.

465
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,319
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman
ever truly coexist?

466
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,517
We'll find out today!

467
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,594
But first, let's meet our contestants.

468
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,350
Behind curtain...

469
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,000
number one...

470
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,358
the absolutely fabulous
Dr. Chase Meridian.

471
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,716
She enjoys hiking, getting her nails done...

472
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,076
and foolishly hopes to be
the love of Bruce's life.

473
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,634
And behind curtain number two...

474
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,955
Fatman's one and only partner.

475
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,393
This acrobat turned orphan...

476
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,314
likes Saturday morning cartoons
and dreams of one day being...

477
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,915
bare naked with a girl.

478
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,356
And below these contestants...

479
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,237
my personal favorite:

480
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,155
A watery grave!

481
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,756
Just one little touch...

482
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,952
and five seconds later
these two day-players are...

483
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,235
gull feed on the rocks below.

484
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,794
Not enough time to save them both.

485
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,030
Which one will it be, Batman?

486
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,553
Bruce's love?

487
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,518
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

488
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,192
There is no way for me
to save them or myself.

489
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,234
This is all one giant deathtrap.

490
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,514
Judges?

491
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,357
I'm sorry. Your answer must be
in the form of a question.

492
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,000
- But thank you for playing.
- Wait.

493
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,840
- I have a riddle for you.
- For me?

494
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,199
Really?

495
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,268
Tell me.

496
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,637
I see without seeing.

497
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,997
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

498
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,959
What am I?

499
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,598
Please!

500
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,149
You're as blind as a bat!

501
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,908
Exactly.

502
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,354
Bummer.

503
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,314
Thanks.

504
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,791
All those heroics for nothing.

505
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,792
No more riddles,
no more curtains one and two.

506
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,711
Just plain curtains.

507
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,515
Aren't you forgetting something, Harvey?

508
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,919
Your coin.

509
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,954
You're always of two minds
about everything.

510
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,949
Yes, of course. You're right, Bruce.

511
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,917
Emotion's always the enemy
of true justice.

512
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,639
Thank you.
You've always been a good friend.

513
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,749
Why?

514
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,032
Why can't I kill you?

515
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,558
Too many questions.

516
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,759
Poor Edward.

517
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,316
I had to save them both.

518
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,473
You see,
I'm both Bruce Wayne and Batman.

519
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,031
Not because I have to be.

520
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,197
Now, because I choose to be.

521
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,591
Thank you for responding to my request
for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

522
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,598
Edward Nygma has been screaming
for hours...

523
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,468
that he knows the true identity of Batman.

524
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,954
Edward?

525
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,669
Who...

526
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,593
is it?

527
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,151
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase.

528
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,478
Do you remember me?

529
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,838
How could I forget?

530
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,431
Dr. Burton tells me...

531
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,311
you know who Batman is.

532
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,998
I can't tell you if you don't say "please."

533
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,433
Edward, please. Who is Batman?

534
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,914
I'm Batman.

535
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,032
Your secret is safe.

536
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,629
He is definitely a wacko.

537
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,949
Wacko. Is that a technical term?

538
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,434
Listen...

539
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,909
I won't be needing this anymore.

540
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,434
Thank you for giving me a new dream.

541
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,432
Don't work too late.
