00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,915
<i>You think you know
the truth about him?</i>

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,418
<i>You know nothing.</i>

4
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,892
<i>His father was Zeus. The Zeus.</i>

5
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,194
<i>King of the gods.</i>

6
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:09,501
<i>His mother,
alcmene, a mortal woman.</i>

7
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,238
<i>Together, they had a boy.</i>

8
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,174
<i>Half human,</i>

9
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,709
<i>half God.</i>

10
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:24,783
<i>But Zeus' queen, hera,</i>
<i>saw this bastard</i>
<i>child as an insult,</i>

11
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:28,854
<i>a living reminder of
her husband's infidelity.</i>

12
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:31,824
<i>Alcmene named
the boy Hercules,</i>

13
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,959
<i>which means "glory of hera,"</i>

14
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:37,763
<i>but this failed to
appease the goddess.</i>

15
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,766
<i>She wanted him dead.</i>

16
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,688
<i>Luckily,
he took after his father.</i>

17
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,357
<i>Once he reached manhood,</i>

18
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,094
<i>the gods commanded him
to perform twelve labors,</i>

19
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,563
<i>twelve dangerous missions.</i>

20
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,133
<i>If he completed
them all and survived,</i>

21
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:17,903
<i>hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace.</i>

22
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,191
<i>He fought the lernean hydra!</i>

23
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:55,307
<i>He battled
the erymanthean boar!</i>

24
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:11,757
<i>But his greatest labor
was the nemean lion.</i>

25
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,565
<i>This was no ordinary beast.</i>

26
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:26,038
<i>It had a hide so tough,
no weapon could penetrate it.</i>

27
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:42,721
<i>But even this</i>
<i>monster was no match</i>
<i>for the son of Zeus.</i>

28
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,693
What a load of crap!

29
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,461
Every word is true.

30
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,865
You know what I think?

31
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:57,135
This friend of yours
doesn't even exist.

32
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:58,971
Laugh all you want.

33
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:04,042
He's coming.
And be warned, gryza,
he despises pirates.

34
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,111
Macedonia has been good to us.

35
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,481
Plenty of villages
ripe for pillaging.

36
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,049
We are here to stay.

37
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,584
Finish him.

38
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:18,190
The more you struggle,
the faster you drop.

39
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,427
Indeed, your fleet is strong.
I...

40
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:30,469
Yet, as I was about to explain
before I was so
rudely interrupted,

41
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,105
the nemean lion
was strong, too.

42
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,840
Yet, he still destroyed it.

43
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:39,778
And not with a sword
or a spear or arrows. No!

44
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,851
I did it with my bare hands!

45
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,489
Or so they say.

46
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,793
Hercules.

47
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,495
Is this all the men you have?

48
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,031
There's 40 of us. One of you.

49
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:03,969
The king of this land
has offered me gold
to dispose of you.

50
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,638
So leave, or die.

51
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,807
I get paid either way.

52
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,877
Make him bleed.

53
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,118
Five men with a single blow.

54
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,455
Still think you can destroy
the son of Zeus?

55
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,691
Bring me his head!

56
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,629
Seems they need
more convincing, autolycus.

57
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,464
That's why we're here.

58
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,868
Atalanta.

59
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,539
Amphiaraus.

60
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,343
May Zeus forgive you.

61
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,645
Tydeus?

62
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,435
Die, Hercules!

63
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,510
Ah, good man.

64
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,455
Hurry!

65
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,190
Hurry! Uncle!

66
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,394
Uncle, hurry!

67
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,329
Hurry! Hurry!

68
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,633
Any longer, Uncle...

69
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:45,771
And the girls
would finally be safe
from your attentions.

70
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,543
The rest of you may go.

71
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,012
But not you.

72
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,793
Thirteen,

73
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,896
14, 15, 16,

74
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:15,233
- 17, 18, 19, 20.
- That was fun.

75
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,670
Twenty pirates
at two gold pieces a head,

76
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,373
minus the headless ones.
Let's see.

77
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:21,807
Not a bad night.

78
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:25,710
You see how the pirates ran?
My story
softened their resolve.

79
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,313
Their resolve must
be broken, iolaus.

80
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,348
When you spread
the legend of Hercules,

81
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,017
make it bigger, scarier.

82
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,287
The more they believe
Hercules is truly
the son of Zeus,

83
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,789
the less likely
they are to fight.

84
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,858
Oh!

85
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,594
Aye.

86
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,263
- Amphiaraus?
- Mmm?

87
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,532
Care to join us here on earth?

88
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:57,576
A lion and a crow in strange
alliance, fighting across
a sea of corpses.

89
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:07,319
If you're going
to use those herbs,
amphiaraus, at least share.

90
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,620
Huh?

91
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,296
Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

92
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,899
Fight it!

93
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,034
Keep practicing, boys!

94
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:26,338
So who's next? You? You?

95
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,639
Ah!

96
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,709
That's a pretty sight.

97
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,144
One more payday, autolycus,
that's all we need.

98
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,748
Then we get to live like
the kings we've served.

99
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,351
Or live simply.

100
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,587
You still dreaming
of barbarian lands?

101
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,757
Beyond the aegean.
At the shores
of the black sea.

102
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,061
That is where I will live out
the rest of my
days in solitude.

103
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,997
Boring, if you ask me.

104
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,564
Maybe so, autolycus.

105
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:57,636
But I'll never find peace
unless I move as far
away as possible.

106
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:58,970
What of tydeus?

107
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:03,041
Without you to
temper his rage,
I fear what he may become.

108
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,442
Tydeus will go with me.

109
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:08,113
Civilization has become
too civilized for us.

110
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,514
Uncle!

111
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,585
Join us.
The girls are
eager to welcome you.

112
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,629
See?
I told you I knew Hercules.

113
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,532
Are you his servant?

114
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,100
I'm his nephew.

115
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:29,968
Are you, really?

116
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,336
I tell of
Hercules' twelve labors,

117
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,639
like the nemean lion,
the apples of the hesperides,

118
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,206
the belt of hippolyta

119
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,076
with its buxom naked Amazons
and exciting bondage.

120
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,813
-I immortalize him...
-He talks,
while the rest of us fight.

121
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:45,417
It is a wonder
you share the same
blood as Hercules.

122
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,553
Have fun.

123
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,589
- Ladies.
- Oh...

124
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,043
What do you
want with Hercules?

125
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,812
My words are for him, not you.

126
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,615
Atalanta, it's all right.

127
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,723
You certainly are
a hard man to find.

128
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,092
Maybe I don't want
anyone to find me.

129
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,593
I'm not just anyone.

130
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,429
My name is ergenia,
daughter to lord cotys.

131
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:35,433
Your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir.

132
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,270
My father is most unfortunate.

133
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,073
He battles a warlord, rhesus.

134
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,241
Our land is torn by civil war.

135
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:47,479
Every day, villages are
destroyed, crops ruined,
innocents slaughtered.

136
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,447
We all have problems.

137
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:55,387
Well, perhaps I can
convince you to make
our problems your own.

138
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:56,955
Unfortunately, my lady,

139
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:00,325
Hercules is fully committed
till the feast of dionysus.

140
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:00,992
We could, however,

141
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,130
advance you to
the front of the line,
for the right price.

142
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:05,897
Hmm.

143
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,699
I thought heroes
fight for glory.

144
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,868
But mercenaries
fight for gold.

145
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,836
Lord cotys is a rich man.

146
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,404
I like him already.

147
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:17,308
If you agree to aid him,
he will pay your
weight in gold.

148
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,547
Eat up.

149
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,689
"A lion and crow in
strange alliance."

150
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,857
Told you.

151
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,265
Where are we going?

152
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,394
It is good to see
you safe, my lady.

153
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:50,535
This war claims
more victims every day.
We were concerned, my lady.

154
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:54,606
Thank you, general sitacles.
I was well protected.

155
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,640
Ah.

156
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,410
The mighty Hercules. An honor.

157
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,548
Though not quite
as big an honor
as I expected.

158
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,619
General, go tell my father
Hercules is here.

159
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,692
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

160
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,326
It's meant to be.

161
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:19,497
It took five years
and a thousand men
to build her temple.

162
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,499
Hera is the patron
goddess of thrace.

163
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:25,837
Everyone knows the legend,
how hera seeks to
destroy Hercules.

164
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,341
Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

165
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,876
Mother!

166
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,511
Arius.

167
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,483
- You're Hercules.
- That's right.

168
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,352
My name is arius.
I know all your
labors by heart.

169
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,122
You killed the giant geryon
with a single blow,

170
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,191
cleaned the augean stables
in one night.

171
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:46,891
Hercules is probably tired.

172
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,793
And the labor of the hide,
and the labor of the mares.

173
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,429
- That's enough, arius.
Come along.

174
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,363
Stay away from him.

175
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,300
Men who deal in violence
attract violence.

176
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:59,537
But he's Hercules.
He's no mere mortal.
He's the greatest!

177
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,475
Lord cotys will see you now.

178
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,685
Have you ever met royalty,
Hercules?

179
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,654
Once or twice.

180
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,573
- Father!
- Ah!

181
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,279
Megara.

182
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,950
Welcome home, my love.

183
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,958
Hercules!

184
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,999
Whenever I'm here,
I imagine this is what
elysium must look like.

185
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,867
Well, men like us
have the means

186
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:06,704
to create our own
paradise on earth.

187
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,906
Look.

188
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,941
Magnificent, aren't they?

189
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:15,546
Well, do not keep us
in suspense. Are we safe
from the monster hydra?

190
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,385
The hydra's heads,
your majesty.

191
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,528
The masks of serpents.

192
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,598
No wonder men thought
they were monsters.

193
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,068
You've done your sovereign
a great service. Come.

194
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,237
Let the people
have their hero.

195
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:43,675
All hail king eurystheus.

196
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,844
And the mighty
protector of Athens,

197
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,747
Hercules!

198
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,850
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

199
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:58,556
A man faced with such
adoration might be tempted
to think himself a God.

200
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,061
I only want to be
a husband and a father.

201
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,270
Lord cotys awaits.

202
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,691
Hercules.

203
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,594
Welcome.

204
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,565
An honor to
host such a legend.

205
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,734
Lord cotys.

206
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,471
But in legend, you fight alone.

207
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:50,742
My reputation would not exist
without my comrades.

208
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,311
Autolycus of sparta.

209
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,415
Tydeus of thebes.

210
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,185
Atalanta of scythia.

211
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,288
Iolaus of Athens.

212
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,291
And amphiaraus of argos.

213
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,893
Amphiaraus?

214
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,797
The famed seer of argos.

215
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,199
It is said you have glimpsed
your own death,

216
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,871
so you fight each battle
knowing that it is not yet
your time to die.

217
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,273
What else can you
tell of the future?

218
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,777
Only what the gods
see fit to reveal.

219
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:26,344
A shame.

220
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:29,414
It would have been
a great gift to know
the outcome of this war.

221
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:33,851
The gods can be
frustrating sometimes,
lord cotys.

222
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:45,430
With respect, I fear tha
t the task ahead might not be
suitable for a woman,

223
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,566
even if she is
an Amazon warrior.

224
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,208
I stand corrected.

225
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,213
When the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel,

226
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:06,184
it was intended as
the high seat of all thrace.

227
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,153
But now thrace is divided.

228
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,388
This war has
depleted our forces.

229
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,559
We're left with nothing
but farmers and merchants
to replenish our army.

230
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,894
It takes every one of us
to resist rhesus.

231
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:21,265
People think that
he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal.

232
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,401
Only by a God.

233
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,636
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

234
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,973
<i>His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.</i>

235
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:33,811
<i>He leads an army of monsters,
half horse, half human.</i>

236
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,547
Centaurs?

237
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,984
- You've actually seen them?
- They have been seen.

238
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,688
Come, Hercules.

239
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,192
Let me show you what misery
rhesus has brought us.

240
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,799
Every week,
more refugees arrive
seeking my protection,

241
00:18:54,801 --> 00:19:00,071
most of them covered
in blood, crippled or
burnt by rhesus' men.

242
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:05,309
I feared nothing could ever
be good again,
till you arrived.

243
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,312
I'm just
a mercenary fighting for gold.

244
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,750
How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

245
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,720
How others
perceive us is important.

246
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,589
And your name, like it or not,

247
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,292
is a rallying cry.

248
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:31,135
I have seen too much reality
to trust in legends,
and I am not alone.

249
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,071
Nobody has any faith anymore.

250
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:39,777
The people need a hero.
They need
someone to look up to.

251
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,148
My son believes in you.

252
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,584
Bring us peace,

253
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,755
and I will
believe in you, too.

254
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,031
I'm convinced
these are good people.

255
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,734
I see.
And who's more convincing,
cotys or his daughter?

256
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:07,672
All the gold on earth is not
as convincing as
a pair of breasts.

257
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,407
Maybe, but gold never ages.

258
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,076
Which is why
I got them to
double our price.

259
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,980
Double your weight in gold?
Well done.

260
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:16,847
Amphiaraus?

261
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:17,949
If it be the will of Zeus.

262
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,951
Which title
sounds more terrifying
to our enemies?

263
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:24,322
Savior of thrace"
A legend is born"?

264
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,724
Both sound
terrifyingly boring.

265
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,828
What are we supposed to do
with an army of farmers?

266
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,565
Train them.

267
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,535
Oh, shit.

268
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:47,511
In war, there is one thing
more important than killing.

269
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,913
Surviving.

270
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:53,784
My companions
and I will show you
how to stay alive,

271
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:58,155
so that you may return home
to your farms someday.

272
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,959
Autolycus.

273
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,695
Shield wall! Form!

274
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,849
Corpses!
Every last one of you!

275
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:28,085
Because your
shield wall was weak.

276
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,587
Dead.

277
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,389
Dead.

278
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,190
Very dead.

279
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,193
Soldier,

280
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,329
many lives depend on you.

281
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,766
When attacked,
lock your feet in the ground.

282
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,770
You understand?

283
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,238
Yes, sir.

284
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,774
When a shield wall is strong,

285
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,677
nothing can ever defeat it!

286
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,913
You must learn
to work together,
react together.

287
00:21:55,915 --> 00:22:00,217
When you do, each individual
will become a link in a chain

288
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:03,354
that will be
stronger than iron.

289
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,994
I hope the enemy
has a sense of humor.

290
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:15,199
Right. Today's lesson,
how not to stab yourselves!

291
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:20,905
It is imperative that
we strike now, my lord,
given this opportunity.

292
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,540
Ah! There you are!

293
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:27,478
Hercules,
my scouts have brought news.
Rhesus is on the move.

294
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,647
Archers who shoot lightning
from their bows.

295
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,617
And infantry 4,000-strong,
their minds bewitched.

296
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,186
Demons march with them.

297
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,854
So now we're fighting demons.

298
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:40,257
No stranger than the monsters
I hear you faced, Hercules.

299
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:44,128
My lord, rhesus is preparing
to attack bessi lands.

300
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,930
He will be on
them within six days.

301
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:49,100
If the bessi fall, we're next.
Unless we intercept him.

302
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:53,137
Your men need weeks,
if not months, of training
before they're ready.

303
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:56,540
The bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

304
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,211
If we do not protect them,
then there will
be a bloodbath.

305
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,746
Face rhesus with
an untrained army

306
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,781
and you risk losing
far more than a single battle.

307
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:08,953
My lord, rhesus is coming.
I vouch my life on it.

308
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,721
The longer rhesus lives,

309
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:16,660
the more villages will
be burnt and the more
innocents will be killed.

310
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:20,698
Assemble your men.
We march tomorrow.

311
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:26,804
Hercules,
the gods have
offered us a gift.

312
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,606
We must not squander it.

313
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,776
Are your gods going to
be fighting with us?

314
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,411
No.

315
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,247
The son of Zeus will.

316
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,998
I've seen how you
watch over Hercules.

317
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,402
Tell me,

318
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,205
how did a woman,

319
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,574
beautiful woman,

320
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:07,278
fall in with
these hardened men?

321
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,679
Killers?

322
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,686
Son of Zeus need
a woman's protection?

323
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,988
I don't protect him.

324
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,559
I protect you from him.

325
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,395
Hmm.

326
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:48,586
General, from now on,
maybe you should favor
the company of your men.

327
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:57,661
He pulled a knife?

328
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,731
It was only a small prick.

329
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,535
Ah!

330
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,041
Your mother told
you to stay away.
You should listen.

331
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,410
What's wrong with him?

332
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,349
Tydeus is my
most loyal warrior.

333
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,785
He was born in war.

334
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:59,623
When I found him,
he was more animal than human.

335
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,563
He never speaks
of what he saw.

336
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,165
He never speaks at all.

337
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,835
But he relives it every night.

338
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,405
Come.

339
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,307
Let's find your mother.

340
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,182
When I grow up,
I want to be
a great hero like you.

341
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,786
Like me?
- No hero is
greater than Hercules.

342
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:29,353
I know all your labors.

343
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:33,824
Like the cretan bull,
you wrestled it for seven days
and seven nights.

344
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:34,525
Uh, that's a bit exaggerated.

345
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:38,362
-And struck it 49
times with your club.
-Maybe not quite that many.

346
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:43,133
Until it fell dead
and crete was saved.
It's my favorite labor.

347
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,535
Also queen hippolyta's belt,

348
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:48,772
with its buxom Amazons
and exciting bondage.

349
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:52,643
-Do you even know
what that means?
-No.

350
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,088
- Mother.
- Arius.

351
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,857
You're supposed to be in bed.

352
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,361
Why are you in the hospice?

353
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,930
My mother saves
people's lives.

354
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,732
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

355
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:19,236
So, out of necessity,
I taught myself
the art of healing.

356
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:21,005
If I could be like you,

357
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:25,175
I would protect all of thrace
and no one
would ever get hurt.

358
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,387
Here.

359
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,557
I was going to give this
to someone else,

360
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,028
but I never got the chance.

361
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,264
Only a hero may wear this.

362
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,801
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

363
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,706
Is this
the nemean lion's tooth?

364
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,509
- It is.
- Thank you.

365
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,411
Thank you.

366
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:01,779
Good night.

367
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,281
Good night, Hercules.

368
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,553
Have no fear.

369
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:15,159
If you fall in
the service of a just cause,
your souls will go to elysium,

370
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:20,264
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes,

371
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,732
like theseus.

372
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:22,866
Odysseus!

373
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,001
And the great achilles.

374
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:29,373
Or if you're lucky,
you'll go to Hades,
where all the fun people are.

375
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,182
Iolaus.

376
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,850
Your place is
beside lord cotys,
where it's safe.

377
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:43,821
I've been giving it a lot
of thought, and I really feel
I'm ready to fight.

378
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:45,723
You're a storyteller,
not a warrior.

379
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,657
We share the same blood.

380
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:49,827
And I will not see it shed.
Chariot.

381
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,161
Now.

382
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,237
Thracians,

383
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,874
the shield wall is your home.
Your shelter.

384
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:07,878
When you sleep,
the wall is your blanket.

385
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,515
When you fight,
the wall is your armor.

386
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,817
The shield wall will
never break formation

387
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:17,588
as long as there is
breath in your body.

388
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,290
Remember these words,

389
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,293
and you will taste victory.

390
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,730
- Move the army out!
- Move out!

391
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,833
Halt!

392
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,100
Halt!

393
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,970
- Halt!
- Halt!

394
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,836
We are too late.

395
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:16,106
Rhesus has already been here.

396
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,880
Leave the chariots.
We'll go down on foot.

397
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:54,411
The lion and crow
cross a field of corpses.

398
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,482
I hate being
right all the time.

399
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,454
Halt.

400
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,723
- Halt!
- Halt!

401
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,069
This head is rotting.

402
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,739
A week old, at least.

403
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,478
Yet some of these
bodies are fresh.

404
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,728
Uncle!

405
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,940
And we've walked into a trap.

406
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:07,250
Shield wall! Form a single
square! Protect lord cotys!
Iolaus, go!

407
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,286
Shield wall!

408
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,031
We're here to help them.
Why are they attacking?

409
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:21,999
This is rhesus' doing.

410
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,002
They say his spells have
the power to cloud minds.

411
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,271
Turn comrades
against each other.

412
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,515
King's guards,
around lord cotys!

413
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,526
Amphiaraus,
do we die in this battle?

414
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:54,231
My time's not come yet.
Not sure about yours.

415
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,834
That's comforting.

416
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,444
I think he wants a challenge.

417
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:30,901
Hercules' fists
have been dipped
in the blood of the hydra!

418
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,537
Lethal to anyone but him!

419
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,441
Watch!

420
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,420
Did you see that?

421
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,389
The gods fight on our side!

422
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,630
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

423
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,299
Hercules! Hercules!

424
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,669
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

425
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,418
Battle position!

426
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,830
Lady Artemis, if I am to fall,
let me be judged...

427
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,166
Stand fast!

428
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,383
Hold your position!

429
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,600
Do not yield!

430
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,926
No retreat! Stay in the wall!

431
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,795
Hold the lines!

432
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,097
Do not yield!

433
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:50,200
Defend lord cotys!

434
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,561
The wall has been breached!

435
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:25,935
Seal up the shield wall!
Defend lord cotys!

436
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,410
Whip!

437
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,322
Hercules!

438
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,290
Bring the chariots!

439
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,900
Defend your lord!

440
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,946
No!

441
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,892
Advance!

442
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,311
Make way!

443
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,292
Where is rhesus?

444
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,681
Lord cotys.

445
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,017
We came here to
save this village,

446
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,621
but, no, they killed
half my army.

447
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,957
Rhesus.

448
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,059
This is all his doing.

449
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,560
And yours.

450
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,094
I warned you.

451
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:41,598
Your men are brave,
but untrained,
unprepared for battle.

452
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,634
Give me time to make warriors.

453
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,838
Very well.

454
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:57,347
Cover up,
before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal.

455
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,157
Phineas.

456
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,226
You plead your life.

457
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,595
And I gladly offer it.

458
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,832
I failed to see this trap.

459
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,934
The fault is mine!
Spare the other scouts.

460
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,969
General sitacles.

461
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:23,840
I think we've lost enough men
for the day, don't you?

462
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,808
But just to avoid
future misunderstandings,

463
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:30,280
I'll be taking charge
of your scouts from now on.

464
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:32,248
Is that clear?

465
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,888
Thank you.

466
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,392
Another mistake,
I'll end you myself.

467
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:16,759
I'm applying a salve of mint,
chamomile and Clay
to seal the wound.

468
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:20,730
This is extract of
lithops for the pain,
a powerful sedative.

469
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:25,401
It should rest you after
consuming it. It may have
certain side effects.

470
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:26,736
I don't need it.

471
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:30,173
Ah, forgive me, I forgot.
No mortal can harm Hercules.

472
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:35,445
And, uh, your lion's hide
is indestructible?

473
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,248
Drink, son of Zeus.

474
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:45,788
Arius' father was the same,
he distrusted medicines.

475
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,156
Where is he now?

476
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:51,127
Taken by the gods
before my son was born.

477
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,595
I'm sorry.

478
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,897
I never knew my father.

479
00:43:55,499 --> 00:44:00,370
Well, he must have been
very, very strong.

480
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,440
Tell me about arius.

481
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:07,176
Oh. He's a good boy.

482
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:10,680
And someday,
he will make a fine king.

483
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,382
Do you have any children?

484
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,787
Do they live in Athens?

485
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:20,256
Thank you for your care.

486
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,669
The sedative
will help you rest.

487
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,937
How could you do
such a terrible thing?

488
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:08,871
By law, I should execute you,

489
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:12,942
but I believe
a more fitting punishment
would be to let you live.

490
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:16,612
So you can walk
the earth in torment,
haunted by the knowledge

491
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:21,884
that you alone are responsible
for the death of
your loved ones.

492
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,354
The great Hercules.

493
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:30,526
Hands forever stained
with innocent blood.

494
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,663
Get out, you monster.

495
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:34,697
Get out!

496
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,805
No!

497
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:31,314
It happened
again, didn't it, hmm?

498
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:35,351
Another vision of Cerberus,
the three-headed
beast of Hades?

499
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:39,222
The gods show you things
they don't share with others.

500
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:42,758
There's a word for that.
Madness.

501
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,727
When we were
driven from Athens,

502
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:47,663
I consulted
the oracle of delphi
on your behalf.

503
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:49,532
Do you remember her prophecy?

504
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:53,970
"Hercules must
finish the labor
that remains unfinished."

505
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:56,138
And what is that, Hercules?

506
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,910
Confront
the beast that haunts you.
Only then will you find peace.

507
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:01,477
I speak from experience.

508
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:06,549
No matter how far you run,
no matter how fast you go,
the beast will follow.

509
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,986
Man cannot escape his fate.

510
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,336
Room for one more
in your company?

511
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:31,641
It'd be a pleasure having
female companionship
for a change.

512
00:48:31,643 --> 00:48:34,577
Atalanta doesn't quite count.
No offense.

513
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,847
If only your manhood
was as long as your tongue.

514
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,616
Both can satisfy
in different ways.

515
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:47,890
You're a famed
storyteller, iolaus.
Grace me with a story.

516
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:50,793
Any particular subject,
my lady?

517
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,830
Murder, of a woman
and her three children.

518
00:48:56,366 --> 00:49:00,036
Is it true? Did Hercules
slaughter his own family?

519
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:03,039
- Who said so?
- Oh, soldiers talk.

520
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,841
They say if Hercules
ever returns to Athens,

521
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,611
king eurystheus
will have him executed.

522
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:16,419
Hercules had
completed his labors
and returned home. But hera...

523
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:19,322
No myths. I want the truth.

524
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,490
No one knows the truth.

525
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,192
Not for sure.

526
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:29,031
We found Hercules alone.
His wife, megara and
the children, dead.

527
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,833
He remembers nothing.

528
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,668
Do you believe he is innocent?

529
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:38,441
We grew up together, both
orphans, trying to survive in
the streets of Athens.

530
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:43,179
We found a home in the army.
Looked out for each other.

531
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:47,483
Hercules'
strength set him apart.

532
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:51,620
Kings of Athens started to
send him on all the most
dangerous missions.

533
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:53,089
The twelve labors.

534
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:55,191
And he took me with him.

535
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:56,659
To fight by his side.

536
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,628
And with each mission,
our numbers grew.

537
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:04,266
Scythia, the Amazon kingdom
where the royal family
had been assassinated.

538
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:07,203
My family was gone.
Everyone was gone.

539
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:10,272
Hercules helped me
avenge their murder.

540
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,541
He became my brother-in-arms.

541
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,112
Thebes, the city of corpses,

542
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:18,647
where we found a single child,

543
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,883
still alive.

544
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,518
Hercules took tydeus in when

545
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,255
everyone else saw
nothing but a wild animal.

546
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,126
You know how a rumor spreads.
How a legend grows.

547
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:31,927
Hercules' deeds
were so incredible,

548
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:36,499
they could not possibly
have been
performed by a mere mortal.

549
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,767
So we played along.

550
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:43,406
We encourage people to think
Hercules was the son of Zeus.
It's good.

551
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:45,207
Scares the enemy.

552
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,343
Iolaus helps.

553
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:48,844
He talks nice.

554
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,748
You're very loyal friends.

555
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,683
You're avoiding my question.

556
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,119
Hercules is a warrior.

557
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:59,255
And there is something
that haunts warriors.

558
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:00,856
It can cloud their minds.

559
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:04,360
We call it the blood rage.

560
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,129
This rage afflicted Hercules.

561
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:09,632
He made me vow to keep
the world away from him.

562
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:13,135
To make sure that he would
never harm innocents again.

563
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:16,705
And that,
my lady, is the truth.

564
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,574
The truth,

565
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,344
Whatever the truth,

566
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:25,314
the death of his loved ones
haunts Hercules.

567
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:28,284
Only the gods can help him,

568
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,153
if he listens.

569
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,362
Come! Gather around,
soldiers of thrace,
and behold,

570
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:44,266
when Hercules gives an order,
even the gods listen.

571
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,168
Zeus' master ironsmith,

572
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,003
using the forges
of your own citadel,

573
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:53,275
has crafted
these divine weapons
that will make you invincible.

574
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,978
As steel is hewn into shields,

575
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,982
so, too, will you be
hewn into warriors.

576
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:05,955
You shall carry
the shield of Hercules!

577
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:14,763
It's lighter.

578
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:18,067
Infused with the souls
of stymphalian birds

579
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:19,568
from Hercules' sixth labor!

580
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:23,939
Spirits of birds?
How does that work, exactly?

581
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,208
Well, much as
birds take flight,

582
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:31,480
so, too, are these shields
lighter than air.
It's in the fibers. Here.

583
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,950
Try on the helmet of Hercules.

584
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:41,924
It covers my whole face.

585
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:46,662
Forged after Hercules' very
own helmet, when he
defeated the demon geryon.

586
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:51,634
You sure it wasn't your
horseshit that frightened
geryon to death?

587
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:52,835
Mmm?

588
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:53,969
General sitacles,

589
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:58,340
perhaps you
would care to inspect
the armor of Hercules?

590
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,691
Leather armor?

591
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,159
Mmm?

592
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,495
We will be skewered like pigs.

593
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,100
Linothorax.

594
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:29,138
Hewn from the skin of
the erymanthean boar.

595
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,440
It's indestructible.

596
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:37,213
Wait. If it's indestructible,
how did Hercules
cut it off the boar?

597
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:42,384
He used
an indestructible blade.

598
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,139
One, two.

599
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,349
Get up.

600
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:15,684
Next!

601
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,027
Again!

602
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,795
Both eyes open.

603
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,132
Keep practicing.

604
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,136
Firmer grip.

605
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:36,105
Elbow up.

606
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,374
Good.

607
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,442
Shield wall! Form!

608
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,449
Stand tall.

609
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,553
Excellent.

610
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,149
Careful you don't
cut yourself, boy.

611
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,218
Again!

612
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,960
Rhesus is here.

613
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:35,331
Close enough to stick
a blade between his ribs.

614
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:35,898
What did you see?

615
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,035
Centaurs.
Half man, half horse.
Hundreds of them.

616
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:41,937
He saw shadows in the night.

617
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,873
My lord, I will go ahead
into the rhesus camp.

618
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:48,077
I will bring
word of his plans.

619
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:55,417
If we let them get
past mount asticus,
thrace will fall.

620
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,719
You want to stop rhesus?

621
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:58,954
We'll go through the forest
and they'll
never see us coming.

622
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,925
It'll slow down our chariots.
A gamble.

623
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,927
I have a plan.

624
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,065
The scouts have returned.

625
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:14,236
Rhesus has made his camp
in mount asticus,
72 leagues away.

626
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:17,373
Once these men
are ready, we march.

627
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:21,377
So, have you seen
if we win or lose?

628
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:25,381
The gods have been
annoyingly silent
on that matter.

629
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,181
What they have told me is that

630
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:30,386
I'm soon to discover
there truly is
a heaven or a hell.

631
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:32,654
When will you die?

632
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:36,525
Within a week in a place
that looks
an awful lot like hell.

633
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:40,696
As always,
the gods are
generous with hints,

634
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:43,265
but cheap on specifics.

635
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,735
Cheer up, Hercules.

636
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:51,640
I've lived, not always well,
but long enough.

637
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,878
I'm ready for what's next.

638
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,219
Thracians, halt!

639
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:08,023
Shield wall! Form!

640
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,429
Battle positions!

641
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,300
Tydeus?

642
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,814
There is no enemy camp.

643
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:08,750
This is the right place.

644
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,769
Centaurs!

645
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,838
They're real.

646
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:55,364
It seems that we're expected.

647
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,314
Centaurs?

648
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:33,302
Rhesus!

649
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:38,874
You have come
looking for a fight,
and we are happy to oblige.

650
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:42,578
Hercules. The son of Zeus.

651
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,813
Your legend ends here.

652
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:46,348
Look at me.

653
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,817
Do I look afraid?

654
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,660
Phineas.

655
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,096
Traitor!

656
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,231
Hades will have you!

657
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,901
After it has you, my lord.

658
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:07,102
It is over, cotys.

659
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:11,406
Mount asticus on your front.
The woods at your back.

660
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:14,109
And my troops
outman you three to one.

661
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:18,880
Surrender now,
and we shall
consider being merciful.

662
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:22,484
Men die who speak to my lord
in such a manner.

663
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,525
You've made your choice.

664
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,242
Go!

665
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,890
In this moment, on this day,

666
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:05,427
become the man
you were born to be!

667
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:10,899
You have it within yourselves
to write your own legends!

668
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:15,337
Let it be to death or victory!

669
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,043
Charge!

670
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,952
Shield wall!

671
01:01:32,423 --> 01:01:33,889
Flanks out!

672
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,599
Maybe today.

673
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,355
Now!

674
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:28,610
Watch as the Amazon
uses the arrows of Artemis...

675
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:30,445
Silence, boy!

676
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:36,852
Spears forward!

677
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,472
Archers, ready!

678
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,142
Loose!

679
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:52,828
Advance!

680
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,605
Set them aflame!

681
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,778
Take cover!

682
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,447
Defend lord cotys!

683
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,201
Maybe not.

684
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,370
Shield wall! Attack!

685
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,475
Push forward!

686
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:57,092
To kill a snake,
cut off its head.

687
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:16,077
Victory is yours, lord cotys!

688
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,713
It is not over yet!

689
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,416
Fucking centaurs.

690
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:08,530
Hail, lord cotys!
Hail, lord cotys!

691
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:11,166
Hail, lord cotys!

692
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,995
Halt!

693
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:48,303
Get up.

694
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,772
Get up.

695
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,314
- Up.
- Enough!

696
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:12,460
You helped
a tyrant enslave a nation.

697
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:15,663
All I did was stop you
from burning more villages.

698
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:17,599
I burned no villages.

699
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:18,900
Then who did?

700
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:20,769
Ask yourself,
if cotys is beloved,

701
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:23,638
why did he need
to hire mercenaries
to do his dirty work?

702
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,306
Keep moving, dog.

703
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:28,943
You've been
fighting on the wrong side.

704
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,411
Where are you going?

705
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,247
I'm taking some
water to the prisoner.

706
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,717
Sit down.

707
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,791
It's time.

708
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:29,904
Thrace is finally united.

709
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,475
One land,

710
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,643
one king,

711
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,813
one thrace.

712
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,015
One land!

713
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:42,784
One king! One thrace!

714
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:46,654
Thrace is not a man,
a king, or a God!

715
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,323
Thrace is her people!

716
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:57,999
Who cares what rhesus claims?
Our work is done.

717
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,301
Let's collect our
fee and be gone.

718
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,715
Don't do anything foolish.

719
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,286
Where are you going?

720
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:26,928
I saw pity in
your eyes for rhesus.

721
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:28,630
Why?

722
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:30,198
Look at me.

723
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,901
Cotys is responsible
for this war, isn't he?

724
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:40,508
You lie very well. Clearly,
your father's daughter.

725
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,879
I didn't do it for my father.
I did it for my son.

726
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:49,551
If I disobeyed cotys or
resisted in any way,
arius would be executed.

727
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:54,055
I did what any mother would.
I protected my child.

728
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,958
My husband was king.

729
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,028
And cotys poisoned him
to take his place.

730
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,897
Rhesus fought back.
Civil war broke out.

731
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:06,234
Arius is the legitimate king.

732
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,437
My father is old.

733
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,174
He will not live forever,
and once he is gone,

734
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:16,744
my son will be a good king.

735
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,681
And he will heal this land.

736
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:21,316
That's a dream.

737
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,751
And you can help.

738
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:27,322
Please, when you leave thrace,
take arius with you.

739
01:10:27,324 --> 01:10:29,524
Please keep him safe.

740
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,060
Find another savior.

741
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:33,661
Hercules?

742
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,799
The king
commands your presence.

743
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,572
My lady.

744
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,385
Ah, champion of thrace!

745
01:10:57,387 --> 01:11:00,154
Something tells me
we're not gonna get paid.

746
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:03,925
- You could be right.
- Oh, shit.

747
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:09,264
You wanted conquerors,
not heroes.

748
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:11,399
You betrayed me, cotys.

749
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,268
Betrayed?

750
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:17,438
A mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold

751
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,642
can hardly presume to
judge his employers.

752
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:23,244
Let's not
quibble about details.

753
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:31,753
We all know your legend,
Hercules.
But here is mine.

754
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:34,322
When I was a general
in the army of thrace,

755
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:37,425
I had dreams of
ruling this kingdom.

756
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:40,795
But thanks to you,
my dreams have grown.

757
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,431
I now crave an empire.

758
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:48,736
My thousands will
train more thousands,
and they even more.

759
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,872
The lessons of
Hercules will spread.

760
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:53,574
What you began here
can never be stopped.

761
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:58,579
And if you fear
what such an army may do,

762
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,182
then lead it.

763
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,356
You want me to serve you?

764
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:11,893
Spare me the moral outrage.

765
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,928
Child killer.

766
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:19,867
Getting us all killed,
bad idea.

767
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:27,275
Well,
I must take this as a "no."

768
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:29,610
In that case,

769
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,648
your services are
no longer required.

770
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:40,688
You will be paid in full.
Bring them the gold.

771
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:26,100
If we hurry,
we can be spending
our fortunes in Macedonia.

772
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,872
Take mine, too.

773
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:36,144
What do you
think you're doing?
Let's go.

774
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:38,346
There will be no
more innocent blood
on my hands.

775
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:41,816
I can't leave
without setting this right.

776
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:43,751
Oh, I see.

777
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:48,089
And who's gonna be paying us
for this suicidal endeavor?

778
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:49,023
Thrace needs our help.

779
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:51,726
To hell with thrace.
We have gold.

780
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,060
You remember the black sea.

781
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:57,999
That beach you spoke
of is within reach.
Leave now, be free.

782
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,403
I would never be free.

783
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:07,475
In this fight, you're alone.

784
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,212
Never saw that one coming.

785
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:13,915
- How can you just walk away?
- You can't just leave.

786
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,550
- Why not?
- It's all right.

787
01:14:15,552 --> 01:14:19,654
You've sacrificed
your lives for me.
Now you can finally be free.

788
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:22,690
Whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid.

789
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:24,425
Debt?

790
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,696
You think we follow you
because we owe you?

791
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,165
Look around, Hercules.

792
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,634
We're family.

793
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:36,070
All we have is each other.

794
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:40,975
We will fight for you.
And if it's our time,
we will die for you.

795
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,344
Because you would die for us.

796
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,216
Take that, too.
I have no need of it.

797
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:49,951
This is madness.

798
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:51,052
You want madness?

799
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:55,323
Tonight, a spear of flame
will Pierce my heart.

800
01:14:55,924 --> 01:15:00,061
Is that not
the most insane death
you've ever heard of?

801
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:13,341
Crazy. The lot of you.

802
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,042
Autolycus.

803
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:18,679
Iolaus. Go with autolycus.

804
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:20,615
I think I'll stay.

805
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:20,915
Nephew.

806
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:26,787
Uncle, all I've ever done is
tell stories of great deeds
performed by others.

807
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:32,293
It's time I stopped
telling their stories.
Started living my own.

808
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:37,064
Well, you may have all
completely lost
your minds, but not me.

809
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,901
Not me.

810
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:44,305
Autolycus?

811
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,911
Live like a king, my friend.

812
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:01,222
What about cotys?

813
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,060
He paid us to save thrace.

814
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,895
Let's not disappoint him.

815
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:39,026
Lay down your arms.

816
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:42,496
Lay down your arms!

817
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:46,133
Or your nephew dies first.

818
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:05,553
I invite you to join me.
You refuse.

819
01:17:05,555 --> 01:17:08,522
I order you to leave.
You return.

820
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:11,959
Get
your hands off me.

821
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:16,063
I overheard her
conspiring with Hercules.

822
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:20,334
They were planning to remove
the young prince
from your protection.

823
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,041
No.

824
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,910
Let go of him!
Don't touch him!

825
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,316
Arius! No!

826
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:41,022
No! You're hurting him! No!

827
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:43,624
Hercules, no!
Help me! Stop!

828
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:46,761
- Help! No!
- Arius. No.

829
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:49,063
Arius! No!

830
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:38,646
Magnificent, aren't they?

831
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:43,851
An extraordinary species.
Incredibly loyal.

832
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:46,554
As long as they're fed.

833
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,390
- Remember them?
- Eurystheus.

834
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,927
They remember you.

835
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:56,030
Confused, Hercules?

836
01:18:56,032 --> 01:19:01,802
Kingdoms are won with armies,
but empires are
made by alliances.

837
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:07,808
King eurystheus and I
will now rule all of Greece.

838
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:17,718
Cerberus only
exists in my mind.

839
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,322
Speak a little louder,
Hercules.

840
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,825
I didn't quite catch that.

841
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,329
The wolves.

842
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:32,900
They were there that night.

843
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,202
<i>The wolves were there.</i>

844
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:37,304
<i>You drugged me.</i>

845
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,657
<i>The wolves were there</i>
<i>the night my</i>
<i>family was murdered.</i>

846
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:03,164
My men told me
how your children screamed

847
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:06,901
as my wolves
gnawed on their bones.

848
01:20:08,171 --> 01:20:12,339
As their fangs
despoiled your daughter's

849
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,241
pure flesh.

850
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:18,445
When the people
called out your name
louder than mine,

851
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:21,782
you see,
when they saw you as a God,

852
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:24,518
how long before
they saw you as their king?

853
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,452
I wanted nothing!

854
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:29,023
Precisely! Your sin, Hercules,
was that you had no ambition!

855
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:32,159
I can deal with
an ambitious man!
He can be bought!

856
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:35,830
But a man who wants nothing
has no price!

857
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:40,634
Killing you would have
turned Athens against me.

858
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,803
I had to ruin your name.

859
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,309
My wife!

860
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:50,010
My children!

861
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,047
Well, you have our permission
to join them in death.

862
01:20:53,049 --> 01:20:58,419
All of you!
Starting with my
faithless daughter!

863
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:01,155
No! Get off me!

864
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,891
No! No! No!

865
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:06,360
Unhand me! No!

866
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,862
She's your own
flesh and blood!

867
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:10,164
I will raise arius to be
my worthy successor!

868
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:15,369
You stay away from my boy!
You monster, you bastard!

869
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,772
-You are a monster!
You are a monster!
-No!

870
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:21,575
You are not a man!

871
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:23,377
You're a demon!

872
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:25,379
Who are you?

873
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,814
Are you a murderer?

874
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:29,016
Damn you! I curse you!

875
01:21:29,018 --> 01:21:32,152
Are you a mercenary
who turns his
back on the innocent?

876
01:21:32,154 --> 01:21:33,587
Stay away from my son!

877
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:35,222
Are you only the legend?

878
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:38,726
Or are you
the truth behind the legend?

879
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:40,694
No! Father,
please, please, please.

880
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:42,663
We believe in you.

881
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,199
We have faith in you.

882
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:46,967
Have faith in yourself.

883
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:48,035
Save me!

884
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:49,470
Remember the man
that you are.

885
01:21:49,472 --> 01:21:53,474
Father,
the gods will punish you!
You cannot escape this time!

886
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:55,943
Remember the deeds
you have performed,

887
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:57,978
the labors you
have accomplished!

888
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,314
No! No!

889
01:22:00,316 --> 01:22:02,082
- Stop it!
- Leave her alone!

890
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,551
Now, tell me!

891
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:05,553
Please!

892
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:08,255
Who are you?

893
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:12,660
I am Hercules!

894
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:25,339
Unleash the wolves!

895
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:30,711
Get away!

896
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:32,379
Ahh!

897
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:42,656
Three wolves should be
more than enough for one lion.

898
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:45,826
Ahh!

899
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:47,394
Hurry!

900
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:54,902
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

901
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:58,572
No!

902
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,685
Ahh!

903
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,668
The gods have
revealed your innocence.

904
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,637
The final labor is complete.

905
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,007
But I'm just getting started.

906
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:43,283
Doesn't take a vision to know
what's waiting
for us up there.

907
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,148
My time.

908
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:27,761
Excuse me.
That was my moment, my fate.

909
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,630
You're welcome.

910
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:44,545
I'm going after eurystheus!

911
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:08,368
Hercules, listen to me.
None of this is my fault.

912
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,604
You see,
cotys poisoned my mind.

913
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,507
Turned me against you.

914
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:14,908
I like you.

915
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:15,509
No, stop.

916
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:19,646
I command you to stop!
I'm your king!
You took an oath to obey me!

917
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:21,982
You swore to Zeus!

918
01:25:21,984 --> 01:25:23,517
Wait, wait, wait.

919
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:27,921
You fight for gold.
I have plenty of gold.
Name your price.

920
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:31,058
Find it in your
heart to forgive.

921
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,398
You want forgiveness?

922
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,850
Ask my family for forgiveness.

923
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:17,604
I've never
killed a God before.

924
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:29,716
I really think I'm
ready to fight now.

925
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:35,389
Well done, warrior.

926
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:48,569
- Eurystheus?
- Dead.

927
01:26:48,571 --> 01:26:51,605
- We need to find arius.
- Follow me.

928
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,387
Soldiers of thrace!

929
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:11,892
You followed me in battle.
Follow me now.

930
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,427
Don't be fools!

931
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:17,097
Hercules is mortal! Not a God!

932
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:21,735
Anyone who sides
with him will die!

933
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,905
And I will show you.

934
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,640
Bring him.

935
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,045
- Arius!
- Mama!

936
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:34,648
No! He's your grandson!

937
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,484
You failed to save
your children, Hercules.

938
01:27:37,486 --> 01:27:39,953
But you may yet save him.

939
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:41,555
Please, father! No!

940
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,657
Admit defeat!

941
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:45,659
Bow to me!

942
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:49,796
You have until
the count of three!

943
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:54,001
One!

944
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:55,836
Two!

945
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:00,874
Don't just stand there!
Kill someone!

946
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,944
Protect lord cotys!

947
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,382
Arius, run!

948
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:09,683
Mother!

949
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,019
Get the boy!

950
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,828
Ahh!

951
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,207
Tydeus!

952
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:12,346
Attack!

953
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:14,247
Hold them back!

954
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:31,631
Spears!

955
01:29:36,638 --> 01:29:38,472
Go through the fire!

956
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:47,180
Here! Here! Help! Come on!

957
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:52,619
Easy, tydeus.

958
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,384
Hercules.

959
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:46,740
Lock shields!

960
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:49,576
March!

961
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:53,613
Find peace, my brother.

962
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:14,601
As you said, Hercules,
there is no way to
defeat a shield wall!

963
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:17,404
There is no way out!

964
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:20,540
Come out and face me!

965
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:30,951
You're no hero! You're no God!

966
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:33,386
You're nothing
but a mercenary!

967
01:31:33,388 --> 01:31:37,257
Your wife and
children deserved to die!

968
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,447
What're you doing?

969
01:32:00,449 --> 01:32:02,449
Get back up there!

970
01:32:02,451 --> 01:32:05,552
Hercules must die!

971
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:09,823
Come on!

972
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:15,295
Kill that filthy bastard!

973
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:17,891
Hercules! Hercules!

974
01:33:18,025 --> 01:33:21,528
Hercules! Hercules!

975
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:27,033
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

976
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:30,637
Hercules! Hercules!

977
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:40,213
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

978
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:44,250
<i>You want to know
the truth about Hercules?</i>

979
01:33:44,252 --> 01:33:46,086
<i>There it is.</i>

980
01:33:46,088 --> 01:33:50,357
<i>To be honest,
I prefer it to the legend.</i>

981
01:33:50,359 --> 01:33:54,561
<i>The world needs a hero
they can believe in.</i>

982
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:58,331
<i>Is he actually
the son of Zeus?</i>

983
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:01,134
<i>I don't think it
really matters.</i>

984
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:04,838
<i>You don't need to be
a demigod to be a hero.</i>

985
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,408
<i>You just need to
believe you're a hero.</i>

986
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:11,578
<i>It's what worked for him.</i>

987
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:17,350
<i>But then again,
what the hell do I know?</i>

988
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:20,754
<i>I'm supposed to
be dead by now.</i>
