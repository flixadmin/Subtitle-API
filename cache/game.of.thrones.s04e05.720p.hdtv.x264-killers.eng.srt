May the Smith grant him strength

00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:04,478

this heavy burden.

she that knows
the fate of all men,

and guide him through the
dark places that lie ahead.

I now proclaim Tommen

Your Grace.

23
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:36,520
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

24
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:54,155
Your Grace.

25
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:59,176

26
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:01,379

27

Long may he reign.

28
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,520
He sits the throne
like he was born to it.

29
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:13,224
Yes. He wasn't,
though, was he?

30
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:15,776
No, he wasn't.

31
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,701
You still mourn for Joffrey?

32
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:25,903
He was my husband.
My king.

33
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:28,072
He would have been
your nightmare.

34
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:34,328
Your Grace, I feel...

35
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:36,514
You knew exactly what he was.

36
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:39,133
I did, too.

37
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,618
You never love
anything in the world

38
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:43,054
the way you love
your first child.

39
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:47,258
Doesn't matter what they do.

40
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:52,680
And what he did, it shocked me.

41
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,268
Do you think I'm easily shocked?

42
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,702
No.

43
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:02,139
The things he did shocked me.

44
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:10,448
He's only a boy.

45
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:12,950
A good boy.
A decent boy.

46
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,869
He always has been.

47
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,089
<i>Who was the last
decent king, I wonder?</i>

48
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:20,007
He could be the first man
who sits on that throne

49
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,793
in 50 years
to actually deserve it.

50
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:26,931
It would be some
consolation, wouldn't it?

51
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:30,000
For all the horror
that put him there.

52
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,241
He will need help...

53
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,611
if he's going to rule well.

54
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:42,613
He has you.

55
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:45,232
A mother is not enough.

56
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:49,820
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

57
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,655
Oh.

58
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:53,741
After all
that's happened...

59
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:59,830
it sounds strange,
I know, but I am...

60
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:02,299
I haven't even given
any thought to it,

61
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:04,084
what comes next.

62
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:07,338
It would be a great
honor, of course.

63
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,474
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

64
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,845
Yes, speak to your father.

65
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:17,765
I'll speak to mine.

66
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:25,906
We may be faced with an alarming
number of weddings soon.

<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>

68
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:29,693
I won't even know
what to call you.

69
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,530
Sister?

70
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,450
Or Mother?

71
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,003
Hmm.

72
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:42,573
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

73
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,026
Murdered at his own wedding.

The Second Sons took
the Meereenese Navy.

76
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:53,717
Who told you to take the Navy?

77
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,886
No one.

78
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:58,389
So why did you do it?

79
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:00,441
I heard you liked ships.

80
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:06,063
How many ships?

81
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:07,364
93, Your Grace.

82
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,732
How many men can they carry?

83
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:11,652
9,300, not counting sailors.

84
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,621
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

85
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:15,489
The Lannisters have more.

<i>And now their king is dead.</i>

89
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:25,716
8,000 Unsullied,

It's hard to say.
It could be enough.

93
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:40,264
But we're not fighting to make
you queen of King's Landing.

94
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:43,267
10,000 men
can't conquer Westeros.

95
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,969
The old houses
will flock to our queen

96
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:46,570
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

97
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:49,406
The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

98
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,525
as they always have.

99

There's other news.

100
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,615
From Yunkai.

101
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,035
Without the Unsullied
to enforce your rule,

102
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:03,954
<i>the Wise Masters have
retaken control of the city.</i>

104
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,176
and sworn to take
revenge against you.

105
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:12,596
And in Astapor,

106
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:15,349
the council you installed
to rule over the city

107
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:18,469
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

<i>who's declared himself
"His Imperial Majesty."</i>

Please leave me.

110
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:33,117
Not you, Jorah.

111
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,082
It appears my liberation
of Slaver's Bay

112
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,134
isn't going quite as planned.

113
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:54,054
You could sail for Westeros

114
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:56,090
and leave it all behind.

115
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:57,808
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

116
00:08:57,842 --> 00:09:01,011
A boy many believe to be a
bastard with no right to it.

117
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,897
They've never been
more vulnerable.

118
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:07,351
You counseled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

119
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,987
I didn't listen.

120
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,156
That all worked out well.

121
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,325
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>

122
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:21,782
How can I rule seven kingdoms

123
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,535
if I can't control Slaver's Bay?

124
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:28,589
Why should anyone trust me?

125
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:31,208
Why should anyone follow me?

126
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,726
<i>You're a Targaryen.</i>

127
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,795
You're the Mother of Dragons.

128
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:39,216
I need to be more than that.

129
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:50,394
I will not let those I have
freed slide back into chains.

130
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,397
I will not sail for Westeros.

131
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,432
What, then?

132
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:59,336
I will do what queens do.

133
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,575
I will rule.

134
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:41,945
Pull up your hood.

135
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:46,283
A memorable shade.

136
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:49,169
But how would they know?

137
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:52,673
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

138
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:55,626
Ones about rich girls
they'll never meet.

139
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:02,516
Is this the only way
into the Eyrie?

140
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,718
The mountains are impassable.

141
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,303
If you want to get to the Eyrie,

142
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:08,222
you need to go through
the Bloody Gate.

143
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:11,725
It doesn't matter how
large your army is,

144
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:14,445
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

145
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,480
three men abreast

146
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:19,066
and get slaughtered like goats.

147
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:22,069
The first Lords of the
Vale didn't have much,

148
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,654
but they had these mountains

149
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:25,656
and they knew how to use them.

150
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:28,408
And the fortress they built
here has never been overcome.

151
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,211
Not once in 1,000 years.

152
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:33,997
Know your strengths,
use them wisely,

153
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:37,417
and one man can be worth 10,000.

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,567
Oh.

164
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:47,821
I have brought you a gift.

165
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:53,994
Lord Baelish.

166
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,747
- My lady.
- Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

167
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:59,416
A beautiful gift
for a beautiful boy.

168
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:02,135
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

169
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,670
My name is Al...

170
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:06,173
Oh, do take down
that hood, child.

171
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:08,258
Don't you think know
who you are?

172
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:11,144
<i>You think I'd let my intended</i>

173
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,146
leave the Eyrie
on urgent business

174
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,816
without knowing
what that business was?

175
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:21,154
I let him go so he could
bring you here to me.

176
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:27,194
My flesh and blood.

177
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,114
It's wonderful
to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

178
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:33,450
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

179
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:34,618
Of course.
I understand.

180
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,253
No one can know you're here.

181
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,372
It would put us in a very
precarious position.

182
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:40,007
I would never say a thing.

183
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,593
The Lannisters
want to destroy us.

184
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:44,544
They've been trying for years.

185
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:46,630
<i>Now they know
what it feels like.</i>

186
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:50,467
Mummy said they killed your mother and
they chopped off your brother's head.

187
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,689
They did, and my father's.

188
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:58,308
They killed my father,
too, with poison.

189
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:02,446
I wanted to make the little
Lannister baby man fly,

190
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,648
but Mother said I couldn't.

191
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,483
Make him fly?

192

your cousin Sansa.

203
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:34,511
But you're not to call
her Sansa in front of anyone

00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,363
but Uncle Petyr and myself.

Sansa, this is my son Robin.

00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:41,985
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Robin.

207
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,354
Robin, show Sansa
to her chamber.

208
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,573
Take the back stairs.

209
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,528
Go.
We'll speak soon.

210
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,372
What took you so long?

211
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:05,375
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen I,

212
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:09,046
extricating Sansa,
getting her here alive.

213
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:12,883
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

214
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:17,104
Let's get married tonight.

215
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:19,439
Ought we not...

216
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:22,559
inform the Lords of the
Vale about the ceremony?

217
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,478
There's only one
Lord of the Vale.

218
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,363
The others can all hang.

219
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:28,815
Lurking and simpering
on the stairs like buzzards

220
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:32,285
the moment my husband died,
trying to get their claws in me.

221
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,820
I do think that
we could wait until...

222
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:36,206
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

223
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,575
We had our wedding night
many years ago.

224
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:40,711
Or don't you remember?

225
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:43,714
Like it was yesterday.

226
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:47,918
What wife would do for you
the things I've done for you?

227
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,804
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

228
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:53,673
When you gave me those drops

229
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:56,143
and told me to pour
them into Jon's wine,

230
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:57,644
my husband's wine...

231
00:15:57,678 --> 00:16:00,847
when you told me
to write a letter to Cat

232
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:03,233
telling her it was
the Lannisters...

235
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:20,117
Faded into nothing.

236
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:23,120
Only speaking of it
can make it real.

237
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,175
Tonight it is, then.

on the septon immediately.

I'm warning you.

242
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:51,148
I'm going to scream when my
husband makes love to me.

243
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,367
I'm going to scream so loud,

244
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:57,487
they'll hear me clear
across the Narrow Sea.

250
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:27,517
As soon as decency permits.

251
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:31,555
After we've allowed Tommen the
appropriate time to mourn his brother

252
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,324
and Margaery
to mourn her husband.

253
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,827
- A fortnight?
- That seems reasonable.

254
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:39,863
No jugglers,
no jousting dwarves,

255
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:43,200
no 77-course meals.

256
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:47,637
And your wedding to Loras?

257
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,257
Shortly after Tommen's.

258
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,676
- Shortly?
- A fortnight.

259
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:55,962
I know you don't like them.

260
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,415
I didn't like your husband.

261
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,650
Used to pat me
on the back a lot.

262
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:02,285
I didn't trust him.

263
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,321
We had that in common.

264
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:07,958
You don't need to make formal
alliances with people you trust.

265
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:10,610
Then whom can we trust?

266
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:14,397
Ourselves alone.

267
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,902
The Tyrells

268
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:21,571
are our only true rivals

269
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,323
in terms of resources

270
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:26,576
and we need them on our side.

271
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:29,045
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

272
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,299
Robert had me funding him.

273
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,585
Wars swallow gold
like a pit in the earth.

274
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:38,972
I suppose that explains why we
did so well in the last one.

275
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:43,059
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

276
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:44,227
Haven't a clue.

277
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:45,929
Go on, your best guess.

278
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,765
Pounds, tons, ounces?

279
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:51,268
Doesn't matter.
The answer is the same.

280
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,937
That can't be.

281
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:57,023
Our last working mine
ran dry three years ago.

282
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:00,160
Then how do we pay for anything?

283
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,612
The crown owes
the Iron Bank of Braavos

284
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,281
a tremendous amount of money.

285
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:05,916
How much?

286
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,085
A tremendous amount.

287
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:13,290
There must be someone
at the Iron Bank

288
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:15,759
you can speak to,
come to some arrangement.

289
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:17,544
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.

290
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,179
There is no someone.

291
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:21,798
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

292
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,934
And a temple
is comprised of stones.

293
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,886
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

294
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:31,558
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

295
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:35,195
That's what the Iron Bank is...
a temple.

296
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:38,448
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

297
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:41,985
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

298
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:44,754
You can't sway them
with excuses.

299
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,425
If you owe them money and you
don't want to crumble yourself,

300
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:50,910
you pay it back.

301
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:52,746
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown

302
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:54,581
will help a great deal
in this respect.

303
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:58,435
It's for the good of the
family, I understand that.

304
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:04,090
I'm not sure my brothers do.

305
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:11,431
I know you're building
a strong case against Tyrion.

306
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:14,651
<i>And as a mother,
that is your right.</i>

307
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:19,189
But as a judge, I cannot
discuss the trial with you.

308
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:21,358
I respect that.

309
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:26,029
We don't need to discuss it.

310
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:32,002
The Lannister legacy is the
only thing that matters.

311
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:35,205
You've started wars
to protect this family.

312
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,540
Turned your back on Jaime

313
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:40,643
for refusing to
contribute to its future.

314
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:43,913
What does Tyrion deserve

315
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:46,499
for lighting
that future on fire?

Would you shut up?

327
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:24,637
I can't sleep
until I say the names.

328
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:28,308
The names of every
fucking person in Westeros?

329
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:31,177
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

Hate's as good a thing
as any to keep a person going.

332
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:38,184
Better than most.

333
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:41,738
We come across my brother,

334
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:45,241
maybe we can both cross
a name off our list.

335
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:51,030
If he were here right now,
what would you do?

336
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:00,957
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up

337
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,126
so I can get some sleep.

338
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:09,099
Go on, get it over with,

339
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,718
your list of doomed men.

340
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:15,855
I'm almost done.

341
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,024
Only one name left.

342
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:20,777
Go on.

343
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:30,653
The Hound.

344
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:38,962
Thank you.

345
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:41,047
Your mother always had a
sweet tooth, you know?

346
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:42,632
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

347
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,835
At suppertime, she would go
straight for honey cakes,

348
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:47,554
candied almonds, custard.

349
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:49,255
Anything sweet.

350
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:50,840
Eventually, your grandfather

351
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:53,426
had to assign a septa
to watch her at meals.

352
00:22:53,477 --> 00:22:56,012
Cat was the firstborn
daughter after all.

353
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:58,014
It was important
that she remain desirable

354
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,682
so Father could arrange
a good match for her

355
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,402
and she was starting to get fat.

356
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:05,855
My mother fat?

357
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:10,076
She never let me have my pudding

358
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,861
until I'd finished
all my proper food.

359
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:15,281
This is before she married your
father and moved to the North.

360
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:18,918
By the time you were born, your
father's austerity had become hers.

361
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:22,005
Marriage changes people.

362
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:26,709
I didn't mean for you to stop.

363
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,545
Go on, enjoy them.

364
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,717
How do you like them?

365
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:36,769
They're delicious.

366
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:42,141
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

367
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:43,810
Oh, gods, no.

368
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:46,980
Petyr had three crates brought
all the way from King's Landing.

369
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,898
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

370
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,733
He's so kind.

371
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:52,735
He really cares for you.

372
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:55,705
Think where you'd
be without him.

373
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:58,074
In their clutches
and tried for murder.

374
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:02,128
Yes.
I'm very lucky.

375
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,746
He feels responsible for you.

376
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,381
Oh, I know he does.
I'm so grateful.

377
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,250
Why?

378
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:10,086
Why does he feel
responsible for you?

379
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:13,006
Well, I'm half Tully.

380
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:15,592
- He loved your family so much.
- Loved your mother.

381
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:17,594
- No.
- That's what you wanted to say.

382
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:19,062
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
He's married to you.

383
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:21,180
Your mother never
loved him. Never.

384
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:24,150
Cat always went straight
for the sweetest thing.

385
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:27,237
The most obvious thing.
Your Uncle Brandon.

386
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:30,240
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

387
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:32,775
He almost killed Petyr
in a duel.

388
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:35,028
And your mother
loved him anyway.

389
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,698
And now Petyr is risking
his life to save you,

390
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:41,451
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him

391
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:44,504
no more than those
whores in his brothels.

392
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:47,457
- Has he told you about them?
- No.

393
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:50,293
He hasn't told you about the vile
things they do with their bodies?

394
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:52,512
The vile things they let
him do with their bodies?

395
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:54,764
- <i>No, never.</i>
- Are you pregnant?

396
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,185
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never...

397
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,104
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.

398
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:03,189
What have you let Petyr
do with your body?

399
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:05,775
- Aunt Lysa, no, I...
- Your young, pretty body.

400
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,478
- Nothing. I'm a virgin.
- Don't lie to me.

401
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,814
You're hurting me.

402
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:13,316
I'll know if you lie.

403
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:16,152
I'm a virgin, I swear it.

404
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:17,987
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

405
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:19,989
All he says is that I'm stupid.

406
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,991
I'm a stupid little girl
with stupid dreams

407
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,910
who never learns
and I'm a terrible liar,

408
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,282
so I should always
tell the truth.

409
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:27,547
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

410
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:30,049
- Not once, not ever.
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

411
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:33,670
It's all right.

412
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,838
It will all be all right.

413
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:37,173
You'll be a widow soon.

414
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:39,592
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

415
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:41,844
and you'll be free
to marry Robin.

416
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:44,013
You'll be the Lady of the Vale.

417
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:46,432
Hmm.

how to ride a horse?

00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:14,260
Yes, my lady, when I was young.

422
00:26:14,294 --> 00:26:16,295
There wasn't much call for
it with Lord Tyrion, though.

423
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:18,931
He preferred litters.

424
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:21,684
Perhaps you should
have stayed with him.

425
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:29,976
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

426
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:33,446
It could take weeks to get to the
Wall, depending on the weather.

427
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,148
That's a long way off.

428
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:38,151
Well, Lady Sansa's
brother's at Castle Black.

429
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:40,737
If I were her,
that's where I'd go.

Feel free to stop at any point.

00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:46,242
Never, my lady.
I'm your squire.

432
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,828
I've made it this far in
the world without a squire.

433
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:50,296
I don't see why I need one now.

434
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,081
All knights have

00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,755
I swore an oath, my lady.

00:26:58,757 --> 00:27:01,307
I am releasing you
from that oath.

439
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:06,562
That means you could leave.

440

What do you think
will happen if you leave?

- It was not.
- Was? He dead?

- Yes.
- How?

- He was killed.
- Who by?

That's why Ser Meryn...

For your paramour?

490
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:37,607
For one of my daughters.

491
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:40,059
You have several, don't you?

492

Eight daughters?

495
00:30:45,482 --> 00:30:47,316
The fifth is difficult.

496
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,986
I named her after
my sister Elia.

497
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:51,654
Beautiful name.

498
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:53,572
Yes.

499
00:30:53,624 --> 00:30:56,659
But I can't say it
without turning sad.

500
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,629
And after I turn sad,

501
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:01,831
I grow angry.

502
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,583
Perhaps that's why
she's difficult.

503
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:07,720
The gods love their
stupid jokes, don't they?

504
00:31:07,754 --> 00:31:10,006
Which joke is that?

505
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:12,425
You're a prince of Dorne.

506
00:31:12,476 --> 00:31:14,677
A legendary fighter.

507
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:16,896
A brilliant man feared
throughout Westeros.

508

But you could not
save your sister.

I'm a Lannister.
Queen for 19 years.

510
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:25,488
Daughter of the most
powerful man alive.

511
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:28,190
But I could not save my son.

512
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:30,660
What good is power

513
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:33,696
if you cannot protect
the ones you love?

514
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:35,531
We can avenge them.

515
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:38,034
Yes, we can avenge them.

516
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:42,254
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

517
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:45,508
I know he did.

518
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,995
We will have a trial and
we will learn the truth.

519
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,381
We'll have a trial, anyway.

520
00:31:56,553 --> 00:32:00,056
I haven't seen my
daughter in over a year.

521
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,058
The last time I saw her,

522
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,394
she was swimming with two of
my girls in the Water Gardens.

523
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:08,230
Laughing in the sun.

524
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:12,234
I want to believe that.

525
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:15,071
I want to believe she's happy.

You have my word.

We don't hurt

528

Everywhere in the world,
they hurt little girls.

529

Would you bring her
a gift for me?
