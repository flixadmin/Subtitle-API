1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,280
<i>Time travel is real</i>

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,480
<i>and all of history
is vulnerable to attack.</i>

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,240
<i>Which is why we must
travel through time</i>

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,040
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called time aberrations</i>

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,000
<i>and to erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,240
<i>We are a team
of outcasts and misfits.</i>

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,080
<i>So please, don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,440
<i>We're something else.</i>

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,560
<i>We're Legends.</i>

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,520
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,400
We're The Justice Society of America.

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,760
Dr. Mid-Nite, Star Girl.

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,400
Copy that.

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,480
The Spear allegedly
has the power to rewrite reality.

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,120
I know that you're one
of the protectors

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,880
of the Spear of Destiny,
and I know that you know

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,520
where the other pieces are hidden.

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Oh... okay, okay.

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,360
The piece of the Spear's
inside your telescope.

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,040
Will you put the gun down, Jax?

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,360
He's with the Legion now.

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,640
Why are you protecting him?

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,880
I'm protecting you.

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Hello, Charles.

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,680
Oh, I see you found a way
to cure your blindness.

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,480
The future is full of marvels,
Captain Hunter.

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,120
No longer a captain, I'm afraid.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Wow.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,480
What do we have here?

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,400
This is a bio-morphic implant

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,240
capable of modifying
its host's neural processes.

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,360
One day, this could end
violence as we know it.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,120
Or, by the same means, amplify it.

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought none of us were supposed
to contact the other again.

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,560
A new threat, I'm afraid.

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,480
A cabal of sorts is after the Spear.

38
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm rounding up the fragments.

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Why?

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,200
They're safer apart
than they are together.

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,200
They'll be safe
at the Vanishing Point.

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Really?

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,520
You said the Time Masters
couldn't be trusted.

44
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,720
Did I? Bollocks, so I did.

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,400
I suppose we're gonna have
to do this the hard way, then.

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,000
Now, where is
the fragment of the Spear

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,320
that I had you protect?

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,960
I don't know why you want it,
but you'll never find it.

49
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,360
Well, seeing as you've been posing

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
as a researcher
in cybernetic implants...

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,160
my guess is that you have
hidden the fragment...

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
Inside you.

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
<i>What's going on?</i>

54
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,240
{\an5}Lily's algorithm located
a piece of the Spear of Destiny.

55
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,720
{\an5}When? I mean, I know just now,
but where are we headed?

56
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,240
<i>Detroit, the year 3,000 AD.</i>

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,520
Journey into the distant future.

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,480
- How exciting.
- Speak for yourself.

59
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,240
Come on, man.
Who doesn't like the future?

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,000
I like history. Yeah, I know

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,840
it's filled with terror and violence,

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,440
- but the future just...
- It's uncertain.

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,880
Yeah, and it freaks me out a little.

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,120
Then just stay on the ship.

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
You think I should stay on the ship?

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,880
I don't care. It's up to you.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,840
I am a time travel professional.

68
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,440
If you need me to visit the future...

69
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,960
I can visit the future.

70
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,160
And I'm just saying
it's entirely up to you.

71
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,400
And I'm just saying shut up.

72
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,760
Nate, you'll stay on the ship.

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
The rest of us
will go find the Spear.

74
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,440
<i>Unfortunately, the medallion
is no longer sensing</i>

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,160
<i>the presence of the Spear fragment.</i>

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,720
So we came here for nothing?

77
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Maybe not.

78
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,600
Gideon, do they have booze
in the year 3,000?

79
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
Better yet, Gideon.

80
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,280
{\an5}Do you have the last position
of the fragment?

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,720
Somebody find
a light switch or something.

82
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,280
What the hell does
a light switch look like

83
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,600
in the year 3,000?

84
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,920
Yeah, I guess there's not many places

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,240
you can go with a light switch.

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,400
But everything else
is leaps and bounds

87
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,960
beyond our current science.

88
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Amaya...

89
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,400
- Charles.
- How do you know the stiff?

90
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,680
This is Dr. Mid-Nite
of the Justice Society.

91
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,320
What's a member of the JSA
doing this far into the future?

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,520
Rest in peace.

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
That's sweet, Mick.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,280
No, it's what
he wrote on the floor...

95
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,520
R.I.P.

96
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,640
That's not "Rest In Peace".

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,320
It's the name
of Dr. Mid-Nite's killer.

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,040
I just don't get it.

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Please be more specific.

100
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,520
That could be a very long list.

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,160
Okay, even assuming

102
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,040
{\an5}the Legion took
the Spear fragment from here...

103
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,160
how did they know it was here?

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,360
Without the medallion, you mean.

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,480
Rip must've told them.

106
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,400
{\an5}Somehow, he remembers where
the pieces of the Spear are.

107
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,520
Well, then it's a good thing
you let him escape.

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,720
Do you wanna say something to me?

109
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,200
{\an5}Jax told me about how
he was gonna kill Rip in 1776

110
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,640
and about how you stopped him.

111
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Because we're not killers, Amaya.

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,760
Except for yourself
and Mr. Rory and...

113
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,360
I'll stop helping now.

114
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm not condoning murder

115
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,840
but the JSA would've captured Rip

116
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,160
without regard for sentiment.

117
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,520
You think I let Rip go

118
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,840
- because of sentiment?
- Yes.

119
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
All right, let's just
all take a breath.

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm sorry
that your friend got killed.

121
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,400
And it may be sentimental...

122
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,760
but my team comes before tactics.

123
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,280
{\an5}And as a result, you've put
the whole of reality at risk.

124
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,560
Maybe this is why
your team loses so often.

125
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,520
<i>Pardon the interruption...</i>

126
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
Excellent timing, Gideon.

127
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,120
<i>Your daughter Lily's algorithm</i>

128
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,560
{\an5}<i>has identified a location
for another piece of the Spear.</i>

129
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,200
Well, when it rains, it pours.

130
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,560
Where is it, Gideon?

131
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,320
<i>A small island known as Britannia
in the year 507 AD.</i>

132
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,480
Medieval England.

133
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,360
See, this is what
I'm talking about...

134
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,200
a nice,
well-documented piece of history.

135
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,680
Knights in shining armor...

136
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,040
damsels in distress...

137
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,320
and best of all, jousts.

138
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,640
Well, jousting didn't appear
in England till 1300 AD.

139
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,120
Don't take this away from me.

140
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Raymond.

141
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,520
{\an5}Just forget about history
for once, all right?

142
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
We're in the Age of Legend.

143
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,520
Well, remember
as Santayana once said.

144
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,440
"Those who cannot remember history

145
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,440
are condemned to repeat it."

146
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Was he a knight?

147
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,720
I don't remember his name.

148
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,680
{\an5}And I was pretty obsessed
with Arthurian lore as a kid.

149
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Well, if you were...

150
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,560
you would know
that there were not jousts.

151
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,240
Oh... well...

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,240
agree to disagree.

153
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Fair.

154
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,360
Are you skipping Medieval Times,
as well, Professor?

155
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,960
{\an5}Yes, I was just catching up
on some research.

156
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,440
{\an5}- What'd you do?
- Excuse me?

157
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
Don't say excuse me.

158
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,120
It makes you sound guilty.

159
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,120
{\an5}I haven't the foggiest idea
what you're talking...

160
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,400
- What are you doing?
- Thieves.

161
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,280
They have a certain smell.

162
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,800
I thought that was just
because you didn't bathe.

163
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,040
What'd you steal?

164
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,600
How dare you even suggest...

165
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,640
What did you steal?

166
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,920
Dr. Mid-Nite wouldn't be needing it,

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
so I figured I'd...

168
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,760
I couldn't resist.

169
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,920
Though I prefer the term "borrowed".

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,320
Impressive.

171
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
There's hope for you yet.

172
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,440
Look, all I'm saying is...

173
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,800
the stories you grew up
on are just that.

174
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,440
They're stories, all right?

175
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,400
{\an5}The Medieval world
was a time of turmoil.

176
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280
It was the collapse of Rome

177
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
{\an5}which led to the collapse
of civilization itself.

178
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,280
And don't even get me started
on the health and sanitation.

179
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Yeah, please don't.

180
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,160
Cholera, diphtheria...

181
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,000
{\an5}typhoid fever, and I'm not
even touching skin diseases.

182
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
{\an5}Speaking of which, why did you
choose to dress like a leper?

183
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,240
{\an5}I didn't.
This is historically accurate.

184
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,440
{\an5}You all look like you're going
to a Renaissance Fair.

185
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,760
- What is it?
- We're being followed.

186
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
{\an5}And by the way,
even if I was a leper...

187
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,320
it'd be way less obvious than

188
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,960
a bunch of knights in shining armor.

189
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,000
Wait... I mean, hold mean...
I mean, hark!

190
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,480
Good knight, we intend you no harm.

191
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,480
We are but mere travelers
in this land.

192
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,440
Your dialect is way off.

193
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,240
{\an5}I, Raymond of the Palms,
and my band of merry men

194
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,600
and women, humbly request
safe passage to Camelot

195
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,240
and an audience with King Arthur.

196
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,360
King Arthur?

197
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,200
Yes, you can see his crest
on their shields.

198
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,000
I am Guinevere.

199
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,080
We shall escort you to Camelot...

200
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,080
but your leper must remain
outside the castle walls.

201
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,440
I'm not a leper!

202
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,120
Still think this is just a story?

203
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,160
This place shouldn't exist.

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,560
There's no need of that here.

205
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
We're all equal
in the court of Camelot.

206
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,560
That's why I love this guy.

207
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,280
Our paths crossed in the wood

208
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
while tracking the Black Knight,
Your Grace.

209
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,200
How then are we to know
that they're not in league

210
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,640
with that vile rogue?

211
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
- Ray?
- Your Grace...

212
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,440
I swear we are not your enemies.

213
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,560
We are warriors on a quest,
a race against evil.

214
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,840
A great evil haunts my land
these many days...

215
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,600
kidnapping my noble Knights
of the Round Table.

216
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,600
Therefore,
it'll fall on my wisest adviser

217
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,440
to measure the truth of your words.

218
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,800
Oh, please don't say it.

219
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,120
Summon Merlin!

220
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,400
Get ready to fight
our way out of here

221
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,960
if Merlin rules against us.

222
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,320
That's Star Girl.

223
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,960
What are you doing in Camelot?

224
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,680
This ship never ceases to amaze me.

225
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,880
Well, speaking of amazing... Merlin?

226
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,840
Just an identity I adopted
to fit into this era.

227
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,760
But what are you even doing
in this era?

228
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,320
Let me guess, it has something
to do with the Spear of Destiny.

229
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,400
We found Dr. Mid-Nite in year 3000.

230
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,360
He's dead, Courtney.

231
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,840
We think he was killed
because he possessed

232
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,400
a piece of the Spear.

233
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
What do you know
about the JSA's final mission?

234
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,680
Obsidian told me
that the JSA disappeared

235
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,080
after a trip to Leipzig in 1956.

236
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,320
The mission was to recover
the Spear of Destiny

237
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,360
and keep it from falling
into enemy hands.

238
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,760
And how was it that you were
all scattered throughout time?

239
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,200
We were joined
on our mission by someone

240
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,880
who called himself a Time Master.

241
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,920
- Rip Hunter.
- Yes.

242
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,400
<i>He said the Spear
could alter reality itself...</i>

243
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
that it was too powerful
for any man or woman to possess.

244
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,560
So, we broke it
into four separate pieces.

245
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,880
Mr. Hunter took one...

246
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,520
And took the rest of you
to three different time periods.

247
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,960
When I arrived in Camelot,
it was a middling kingdom.

248
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,680
To help me protect
my piece of the Spear,

249
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,720
I fashioned it into the
legendary court of King Arthur

250
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,080
and his Knights of the Round Table.

251
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,200
Courtney, I respect your devotion.

252
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,400
But shouldn't you at least tell me

253
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,560
where the fragment is hidden?

254
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,960
Don't worry, Amaya.

255
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,520
I promise,
the piece is somewhere very safe.

256
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,280
Your tracking
in the woods was excellent.

257
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,000
There's not many people that can
get the jump on me like that.

258
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,400
I was a warrior
long before I was a queen.

259
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
Why does it sound like
you preferred that?

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,120
Politics is not one of my passions.

261
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,200
But Arthur is a true friend and ally,

262
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,880
and I believe in his vision
for a more just

263
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,000
and peaceful kingdom.

264
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,920
From what I see,
Camelot lives up to its reputation.

265
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,880
Where is the good king?

266
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,960
On hunt...

267
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,200
no doubt chasing a boar
through the brush as we speak.

268
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,680
Do your worst, knave.

269
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,520
I'd rather die than surrender.

270
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,400
Then you are an idiot.

271
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,120
You're not going to run me through.

272
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
No.

273
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,480
We have something else in mind
for you, Your Majesty.

274
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,440
I can't believe Marty and Mick
are missing this.

275
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Like, right?
I mean, when's the next time

276
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,520
we're gonna get to feast in Camelot?

277
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Hey, guys, check it out.

278
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,400
That's Sir Galahad.

279
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,600
How do you know that?

280
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,520
Because he's sitting
in the Siege Perilous.

281
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
What?

282
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Come on.

283
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Some kind of historian you are.

284
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,600
Siege Perilous is a special seat

285
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,280
reserved for only
the purest of knights.

286
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
I don't how many times
I have to tell you.

287
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,000
There's a difference between
legend and history.

288
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

289
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Sir Galahad.

290
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,640
Oh, is this seat taken?

291
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,360
It is now, my friend.

292
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,480
Apologies. You must get
this all the time.

293
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,000
But I must tell you,
I am a really big fan.

294
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
A fan?

295
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,440
So you make wind?

296
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,440
No, no, no, no, no...

297
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,600
Well...

298
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,520
I mean, maybe after all this food.

299
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,840
No, what I mean is I'm a...
I'm a big admirer of yours.

300
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,080
You've heard tale of my exploits?

301
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,480
Yes! Yes!

302
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,120
Since I was a wee lad.

303
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,000
It's hard to explain.

304
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,880
I am but a servant.

305
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,200
It is my honor to serve the true
inspiration of Camelot's glory...

306
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,240
King Arthur, for was it not he

307
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,520
who said that might must serve right,

308
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,240
lest it bloom into
the cruel flower of tyranny?

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,760
Yet another reason I love him.

310
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,560
They sound the return of the king.

311
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,800
Arthur's captured the Black Knight.

312
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,160
Arthur, I was beginning to...

313
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,840
Oh, sorry about the ruse,

314
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,560
but I figure it was
the only way to get inside.

315
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,200
Oh! Hey, guys.

316
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,320
I see you've met
my friend Arthur here.

317
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,760
Give us a smile, Arthur.

318
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Arthur...

319
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,320
The king has left the building.

320
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,720
You don't get the reference?

321
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
Oh, pity.

322
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,680
Basically, your king now does
anything I want him to do.

323
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,080
So if you don't want him to spill
your blood all over this floor,

324
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,680
I suggest that you hand over
your fragment of the Spear.

325
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,040
My patience is running short.

326
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,840
The fragment. Where is it?

327
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,760
As long as I live,
you will never have it.

328
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,200
That might turn out
to be shorter than you think.

329
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,960
Stand fast, or your king dies.

330
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,040
All I have to do is think it,
and he slits his own throat.

331
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,560
Ultimatum time.

332
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,200
Deliver the fragment to me by dawn

333
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,920
or I'll come back with an army
just as obedient as Arthur here.

334
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,680
Choice is yours.

335
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Camelot...

336
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,360
or the Spear.

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,880
Galahad, may you rest in peace

338
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,800
where sorrow and pain are banished.

339
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,920
May the everlasting light
of Camelot shine upon you.

340
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,800
How do you know this Black Knight?

341
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,760
His name's Damien Darhk.

342
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,680
He works with the speedster

343
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,920
who turned Rip Hunter
against the JSA.

344
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,640
Well, Rip's not the only one
under their control now.

345
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,520
That thing's dark magic
has turned my king...

346
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,920
my own husband into my enemy.

347
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,920
- It's not his fault.
- And yet I watched him

348
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,200
strike down Sir Galahad
with my own eyes.

349
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,400
You have to believe that
your husband can be saved,

350
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,240
or else he will be truly lost.

351
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,840
Unless we stop
the Black Knight's army...

352
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
we may never find out.

353
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,680
My Queen, you must be strong.

354
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
With King Arthur missing,
the Knights of the Round Table

355
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,840
will look to you to lead them.

356
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,160
The mantle of king is Arthur's.

357
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Not mine.

358
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,520
Guinevere, wait.

359
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,960
Look, sometimes the mantle
just falls into your lap.

360
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,360
Trust me.

361
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,560
I know that it's hard.

362
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
You're clever...

363
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,640
you're brave...

364
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,560
and you are a natural-born commander.

365
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,960
I know you can do this.

366
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
You saw what they did to Arthur.

367
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,640
Imagine what they could do with
an army of brainwashed knights.

368
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,760
What are you suggesting?

369
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,120
The fragment of the Spear...

370
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,680
we need to get it out of the castle.

371
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,000
How can your team protect the Spear?

372
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,680
You couldn't even protect
Dr. Mid-Nite.

373
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
That's not fair.

374
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm not going anywhere,
and neither is the fragment.

375
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Fascinating.

376
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,320
It seems to contain some sort of,
sophisticated receiver.

377
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,840
Clearly, it's the same
technology I...

378
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,080
I... I found in Dr. Mid-Nite's lab.

379
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,680
- Grey, you didn't.
- You bet he did.

380
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,640
Nicked it off the dead guy.
Even I was impressed.

381
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,040
I was simply curious.

382
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,600
And it's a good thing I did.

383
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,240
These components appear to be a set.

384
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,960
Perhaps functioning together
as transmitter and receiver.

385
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,200
- Or commander and soldier.
- Exactly.

386
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,160
The commander wears the transmitter,

387
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,720
sending orders via
an electro-telepathic signal

388
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,880
to this receiver
worn by the soldier.

389
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,640
Well, anything with a signal
can get hacked.

390
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,800
That is the hope, yes.

391
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,760
So all we need to is somehow

392
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,920
boost the brain power
of whoever's wearing this.

393
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,640
Or find someone

394
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,360
with a preternaturally
powerful brain.

395
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,080
You mean you?

396
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,240
Fine, if you insist.

397
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,640
Now, all we need is a test subject.

398
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,200
Someone who's mind is pliable.

399
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
What?

400
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,520
Hey, Sir Drools-A-Lot.

401
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,520
Prepare the rest of your tin men
to get ready to march.

402
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,160
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

403
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,080
Prepare your men, King Arthur.

404
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,920
As you wish, my liege.

405
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,880
Prepare to march.

406
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,920
Who knew these things
would come in handy?

407
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,800
Now, Mr. Rory, I want you
to get up out of that chair.

408
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,280
No, I command you
to get up out of that chair.

409
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,600
Do... do you feel anything at all,
a foreign impulse...

410
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,200
just like twinge perhaps?

411
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,800
Wait, I'm picking up on something.

412
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,360
Oh, my God. It's working.

413
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,080
I'm hungry.

414
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,720
This is a disaster.

415
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Wait.

416
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,560
It seems our adversaries
are sending a signal of their own.

417
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
What does that mean?

418
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,680
Oh, dear God.

419
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,840
It means the Legion
is coming for Camelot.

420
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,640
Valiant Knights of Camelot...

421
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,760
I know the fear you feel.

422
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,480
We stand now
on the precipice of doom.

423
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,480
Our king has been taken from us.

424
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,720
Evil draws close

425
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,840
and hope, it seems, is lost.

426
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,600
But we must rise
and face this challenge

427
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,680
as Arthur would have wanted.

428
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,560
We must remember who we are.

429
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
We're brothers and sisters.

430
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,080
We're fighters and friends.

431
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,240
We are not mere knights.

432
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,040
We are Camelot!

433
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
We are Camelot!

434
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,960
We are Camelot!

435
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,680
We are Camelot!

436
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,360
The dark army approaches.

437
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,880
It's reached the great wood.

438
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,680
It seems your wizard is too late.

439
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,000
Is she talking about Professor Stein?

440
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,360
No matter.

441
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,920
We shall settle
this at the point of our swords.

442
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,120
Camelot calls
to you in its hour of need.

443
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,120
Will you answer?

444
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,680
Who will follow me
onto the field of battle?

445
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,160
Dude, what are they doing?

446
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
These guys don't stand
a chance out there.

447
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,680
Is this really worth the risk
for some dream?

448
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,520
Yes, because a long time ago

449
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,480
that dream meant
the world to a little boy...

450
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,280
and he still remembers.

451
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,960
This isn't gonna end well.

452
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
What are you doing?

453
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,440
If Star Girl won't give us
the fragment for safe-keeping...

454
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,360
You're stealing it?

455
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,080
She's not thinking straight.

456
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
I should have known.

457
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,400
You sure this is the way
you wanna do it?

458
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,320
Star Girl was your teammate,
not to mention your friend.

459
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,000
The Legion of Doom
are closing in on us as we speak.

460
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,720
There's no time for sentiment.

461
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,880
Do you really wanna
chance Damien Darhk

462
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,000
having the power to rewrite reality?

463
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
I guess not.

464
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,600
It's set in stone.

465
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,640
Not for long.

466
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,880
Damn, that was badass.

467
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,600
Let's get out of here.

468
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,040
Put it down.

469
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,800
We should attack now.

470
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,200
Let me tell you
how an ultimatum works.

471
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,040
The so-called Legends have until dawn

472
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
to deliver the Spear.

473
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,200
You don't actually believe

474
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,760
that they'll hand it over, do you?

475
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,920
Perhaps not,
but meeting on a battle field

476
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,840
is infinitely more wise
than laying siege to the castle.

477
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Right.

478
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,920
I just thought that
you would want my expertise.

479
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,520
After all, I have already retrieved

480
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,720
two fragments of the Spear, but...

481
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,080
Word to the wise,

482
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,040
speak to me with respect.

483
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,440
That little thing on your head
doesn't control me.

484
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,720
I don't want to fight
with you, Amaya,

485
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,960
but I will if I have to.

486
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,160
Then get ready, because I'm
not leaving without the fragment.

487
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
Hey, we have enough
enemies as it is

488
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,920
- without fighting each other.
- You left us, Amaya.

489
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,400
I was there to protect the Spear,

490
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,680
and I will continue to protect it
until I take my last breath.

491
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,240
Because you know
that doing the right thing

492
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,600
is more important than
doing what feels right.

493
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,280
You're still a member
of the Justice Society.

494
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,560
No, I'm not.

495
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,360
My heart belongs in Camelot.

496
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
Your heart?

497
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,800
You of all people should understand.

498
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
It wasn't duty that led you
to join the Legends.

499
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,560
You've fallen in love with Arthur.

500
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,160
Your make-believe kingdom
is a real soap opera.

501
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
How can you expect me to turn away

502
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,040
from the truest
thing I've ever known?

503
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,200
All I know is that the Legion of Doom

504
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
will not stop until they get this.

505
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,320
And once they do,

506
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,640
the world, as we know it, is over.

507
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,880
Which is why you're taking it, Amaya.

508
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,240
I can't go,
so you have to fulfill my oath.

509
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,280
Protect the Spear.

510
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,960
All right, you heard the wizard.

511
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Let's boogie.

512
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,200
Ray, this is wrong.

513
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Please tell me
that's not Galahad's sword.

514
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,360
I know, it's not
historically accurate, but...

515
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
I couldn't resist.

516
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,080
It's like a saber made of light.

517
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
Yeah.

518
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,720
Oh, just don't call it a light saber.

519
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,240
- Major trademark issues, right?
- Yeah, trademark.

520
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,040
Have you lost your complete mind?

521
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,800
No, I focused the ionic energy
into Galahad's sword.

522
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,160
That's great, Ray.
But Sara says it's time to go, so...

523
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,040
What? But the battle
hasn't even begun.

524
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,520
Precisely why we're leaving now.

525
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,760
Listen, Amaya found the fragment

526
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,160
so there's need
for this medieval warfare.

527
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,440
That's great news, right?

528
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Let's go.

529
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,880
In case you weren't listening,
this is the part where we run.

530
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,080
- I can't.
- Sure, you can.

531
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,680
Left foot, right foot, repeat,
let's go.

532
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,320
No, Nate. Look around you.

533
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,400
All of these men are willing
to die on the battlefield

534
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,880
not for some Spear, but for an idea.

535
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,800
And I get it now.
Camelot isn't about history.

536
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,960
It's not even
about some dusty old books

537
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,520
that got a lonely kid
through childhood.

538
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,240
It's about one noble idea...

539
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,800
that we can all stand up
for what's right,

540
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
no matter what.

541
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,280
And I can't walk away from that.

542
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
I believe you, Ray.

543
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,560
I do. And Camelot's great.

544
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,760
But if you don't leave right now,

545
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,080
- you're gonna die here.
- Would it kill you

546
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,600
to be just a little bit
more supportive?

547
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,320
You don't get it, man.
I checked the manuscript.

548
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,800
I saw your funeral.

549
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,800
Well, sounds to me like
the stuff Legends are made of.

550
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,360
All right, Gideon,
let's get ready for takeoff.

551
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,520
<i>- Yes, Captain.</i>
- This doesn't feel right.

552
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,280
We don't just leave people
in trouble.

553
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,120
They're knights and they're
fighting so we can get away.

554
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,320
- With the piece of the Spear.
- And without Rip.

555
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,640
Take comfort
we live to fight another day.

556
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,240
The Legion already
has two pieces of the Spear.

557
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,280
I don't like it, but we cannot
risk them getting a Yahtzee.

558
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,360
What the hell's a Yahtzee?

559
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,200
<i>System's online, Captain Lance.</i>

560
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,680
<i>We are ready to time-jump.</i>

561
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Where's Raymond?

562
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,040
With this sword, I dub thee

563
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,720
Sir Raymond of the Palms,
defender of Camelot.

564
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,000
Rise, good knight.

565
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,520
I tried talking to him,
but he's hell-bent

566
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,080
- on getting himself killed.
- Doesn't he know

567
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,360
that we have the piece of the Spear?

568
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,360
All he seems to care
about is being remembered

569
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,080
in some BS bedtime story.

570
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,760
- We can't leave him behind.
- We're not leaving him.

571
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
He chose to say.

572
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,520
Amaya, I know you're following
JSA protocol at whatever cost

573
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,280
but this is seriously screwed up.

574
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,320
We can't risk losing
a piece of the Spear,

575
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,080
especially when the Legion
is being backed by

576
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,400
evil Knights of the Round Table.

577
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,680
I thought you were gonna
un-evil-fy them.

578
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,600
We were if we just had
a little more time.

579
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,120
- We still can.
- And what happens if you can't?

580
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,440
Well, as much as Haircut's
a pain in my ass,

581
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm not gonna let him fight alone.

582
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,800
Sit down. That's an order.

583
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,920
- What's an order?
- Don't test me, Mick.

584
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,720
Don't threaten me, blondie.

585
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,680
I can't believe I'm actually
agreeing with Mr. Rory.

586
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
- Sara.
- I said sit down.

587
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Stop.

588
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,320
I've already lost one team.

589
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,600
I'll be damned if my decision
rips the Legends apart too.

590
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,120
- What are you saying?
- Listen to your gut, Captain.

591
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,520
Don't abandon Ray.

592
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,440
He may be sentimental, but the team
should come before tactics.

593
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,760
You're right. Let's do this.

594
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,680
Guinevere's knights are not
gonna able to last long

595
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
against Damien Darhk's army
unless you three...

596
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,440
Take out Mid-Nite's
mind control tech.

597
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,920
- We're on it.
- We are?

598
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Amaya, Nate...

599
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,480
you ready to go get
medieval out there?

600
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,640
Wait, you have got it reversed.

601
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,640
I need the transmitting device,
not the receiver.

602
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
I got an idea.

603
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
What if it's not about brain power

604
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,640
but about intensity? Like his.

605
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,920
We don't have time for this.

606
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,800
Put the dog collar on, Professor.

607
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,440
I have more patents
than Mr. Rory has felonies

608
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,800
and that's saying something.

609
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,120
To think that his mind
is more powerful than mine...

610
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Shut up.

611
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,640
Wait, did you shut up
because you wanted to

612
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,760
or because he told you to?

613
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,680
Make him answer.

614
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,120
Answer the man, Professor.

615
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,520
- Astonishing.
- It worked.

616
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
I knew it. Okay.

617
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,880
Now all we got to do
is amplify the signal.

618
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,240
- What do you want me to do?
- Just rest your brain, Mr. Rory.

619
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,640
We'll let you know
when it's time to take control

620
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,920
of the evil army.

621
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Oh, finally
I get to fulfill my destiny.

622
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
God help us.

623
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,440
So, came to fight for
an imaginary kingdom after all?

624
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,960
I came to fight for a friend.

625
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,600
A really dumb friend.

626
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,160
Okay, I need you
to unleash the darkness

627
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,600
on those brainwashed knights.

628
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,920
Let them inside your head.

629
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,840
Fill their minds
with every brutish impulse,

630
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,280
every traumatic memory.

631
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,200
That just be enough
to overload the system.

632
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,400
Spare nothing.

633
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,360
Poor babies.

634
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,920
Be gone, devilish sorcerer!

635
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Damien...

636
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,800
Sorry, I don't do rescues.

637
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Yeah.

638
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,240
Damn it, Ray!

639
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,080
You're here to finish me off,
Captain?

640
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
What are you doing?

641
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
Saving your life.

642
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,560
Give it up, Raymond.

643
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,920
You're a glorified nerd,
not a knight.

644
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,160
I'm Sir Raymond of the Palms.

645
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,720
and on behalf
of my 12-year-old self...

646
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,840
allow me to retort.

647
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,800
Yield, Damien!

648
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,240
Okay, okay, I submit.

649
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Ray!

650
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Ray!

651
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,760
Ray. Oh, come on, buddy.

652
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,720
Open your eyes, you stupid bastard.

653
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,200
Ray, come on!

654
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,520
- Ray!
- Stop yelling at me.

655
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,000
Ray, you brilliant bastard.

656
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,720
It's not Ray anymore.

657
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,560
It's Sir Raymond of the Palms.

658
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
Yeah.

659
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,520
I'm never gonna call you that, buddy.

660
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,400
Thank you, Amaya.

661
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,720
Tales of your deeds

662
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,320
will honor these halls
for longer than you can imagine.

663
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,960
The honor is mine, Your Grace.

664
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Hey.

665
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,920
So you're staying?

666
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,120
Like you, I found a new home.

667
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,320
- Like me?
- With the Legends.

668
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,680
The team suits you.

669
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,680
Take care of yourself, Courtney.

670
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You too, Amaya.

671
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
What was that all about?

672
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
- Just a little friendly advice.
- Yeah?

673
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,680
We should get going. Where's Ray?

674
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,000
He said something about

675
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,120
paying his respects
to the queen before we left.

676
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,040
Funny.

677
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,240
Sara said the exact same thing.

678
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,200
I just wanted to say good-bye.

679
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,760
I enjoyed meeting you.

680
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,560
And I you, Sara Lance...

681
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
a lot.

682
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,000
Sara Lance-A-Lot.

683
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I should go.

684
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,280
Do you really have to leave?

685
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,520
It is I, Raymond of the Palms,
my lady...

686
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,080
come to bid my fair lady adieu.

687
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,120
Oh, well...

688
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,680
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.

689
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
- Sara.
- It's okay, Ray. Come in.

690
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,400
And a thousand thanks
for your service to the realm.

691
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,280
If ever your travels
bring you back...

692
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,080
there will always be a seat
at the Round Table

693
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,120
for Sir Raymond of the Palms.

694
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,920
Thank you, My Lady.

695
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,280
You know, every good legend
ends with a kiss.

696
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,360
Goodbye,Guinevere.

697
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,600
Surely, you must admit

698
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,520
that it's not
a superior intelligence

699
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,360
but rather, the murky depths
of your mind that proved vital.

700
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,280
Just admit it,
my brain saved the day.

701
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,160
I will admit nothing of the sort.

702
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,640
All right, I'll admit it.

703
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,040
Walking around in a legend
felt just as real as

704
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,480
walking around any part of history.

705
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,680
And you know what?
Maybe, legend and history

706
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,480
aren't so different after all.
Maybe they're just stories

707
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,120
to remind us where we come
from and who we can become.

708
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,320
So what do you say?

709
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,920
You wanna find out
how you're gonna be remembered

710
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,520
in everyone's favorite bedtime story?

711
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Nah.

712
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,360
I think I'd rather make up
my future as I go.

713
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Nice.

714
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,360
I got something I wanna say to you.

715
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,440
Well, I'm a captive audience,
aren't I?

716
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,120
I was gonna kill you

717
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,960
for what you did to Sara.

718
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,160
But she stopped me, and I'm glad.

719
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,840
But make no mistake...

720
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,440
you are not Captain,
and this is not your ship.

721
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,040
Not anymore.

722
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,800
So if you even think about
hurting anyone on my team...

723
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
I will not hesitate to end you.

724
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,960
Feel good to get
that off your chest, did it?

725
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Gideon.

726
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,280
<i>I'm here, Captain.</i>

727
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,240
You always are.
