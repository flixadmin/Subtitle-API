1
00:00:00,593 --> 00:00:02,927
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,584
Valerie Vale, Gotham Gazette.
This isn't the first time

3
00:00:08,652 --> 00:00:09,919
that a bounty hunter has apprehended

4
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:11,954
an escapee. Is the GCPD

5
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:14,156
incapable of handling
this threat themselves?

6
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:15,658
Your body is beginning
to reject the changes

7
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:17,426
we made to your DNA.

8
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:18,394
How do I fix it?

9
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:21,464
Strange. He's the only one.

10
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,199
You remember Marv.

11
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,233
He's one of yours.

12
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:27,236
Hey, kid. Take it.

13
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:29,115
Keep feeding strays, one's
gonna follow you home.

14
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:30,710
While trapped in Indian
Hill, I was led to believe

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:33,013
an unnamed group had taken
control of my company.

16
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,549
I want to talk face-to-face, or
the information that I've gathered

17
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:36,783
will be sent to every newspaper

18
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:38,318
and television station in Gotham.

19
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:40,287
- We caught a spy.
- Ivy?

20
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:41,988
- No!
- Marv?

21
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:47,661
Ivy?

22
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:49,296
Alfred!

23
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:52,566
Alfred!

24
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:01,522
Bruce.

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,644
You wanted to talk.

26
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:11,017
Forgive me.

27
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:15,689
Better?

28
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:18,959
I know you.

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,095
I've seen you at Wayne
Enterprises events.

30
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:26,700
You've been inside my home.

31
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:29,135
My name is Kathryn.

32
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:32,539
I represent the group
you've asked to speak with.

33
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:34,341
You didn't have to hurt Alfred.

34
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:37,310
He would not have permitted
you to meet with us alone.

35
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:39,179
You tried to kill me.

36
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:42,449
You were behind Indian Hill.
Hugo Strange was hired by you.

37
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:45,051
Is that why you're here, Bruce?

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,488
To ask questions you
already know the answers to?

39
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,491
Who are you?

40
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:53,460
What do you call yourselves?

41
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:55,595
Our name is unimportant.

42
00:01:57,298 --> 00:01:59,199
Now,

43
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:01,234
you made a threat.

44
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:07,664
Referring to evidence you'd
uncovered of our existence.

45
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:12,012
We would like to know what you found.

46
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,942
Nothing certain.

47
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:18,985
Until now.

48
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:20,947
A bluff.

49
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,857
- Nicely played.
- It wasn't just a bluff.

50
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:25,292
The more I studied my company's doings,

51
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:27,427
the more there were things
that could only be explained

52
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:28,840
by your existence.

53
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:32,265
Still, I had to know for sure.

54
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,433
Now I do.

55
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,135
And what now?

56
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:37,904
According to you, we
tried to kill you once.

57
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:39,539
I began all this because
I wanted to solve

58
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:41,174
my parents' murder.

59
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:44,062
Six months ago, I concluded
your organization responsible.

60
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:46,513
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

61
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,085
But there are other...

62
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:53,586
considerations.

63
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:55,957
Such as your own life.

64
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,726
The lives of those close to you.

65
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,565
You're here to make a deal.

66
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:08,134
What do you have to offer?

67
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:09,736
Wayne Enterprises.

68
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:13,206
You cannot give someone
what they already possess.

69
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:14,874
I'm not finished.

70
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:19,279
If I die, my shares will be turned over

71
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:20,828
to the federal government.

72
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,552
Investigators will comb through
every file, every asset.

73
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:27,554
Are you prepared for
that kind of scrutiny?

74
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:29,689
That would be unfortunate,

75
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:32,459
but we would weather the storm.

76
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:35,611
- What else?
- The Wayne name still has meaning.

77
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:39,699
It's a symbol of light and hope.

78
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:42,202
For a group such as yours,

79
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,604
I could provide a useful distraction.

80
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:48,141
You are an impressive young man.

81
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,910
Still,

82
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:54,047
your offer is not sufficient.

83
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:56,683
We will also require that you cease

84
00:03:56,751 --> 00:04:00,186
all investigation into our existence

85
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,021
and your parents' murder.

86
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:05,359
Any violation of that, in the slightest,

87
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,862
and our agreement is void.

88
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,550
I need your answer now.

89
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,083
I agree.

90
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:32,485
I'm happy to hear that.

91
00:04:32,553 --> 00:04:35,188
Needless to say, you
will not see me again.

92
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:36,856
Good-bye, Bruce.

93

94
00:04:58,344 --> 00:05:01,246
Morning. Surprised to see me?

95
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,248
Not really. What do you want?

96
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:05,623
- I have a proposition.
- Not interested.

97
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:07,786
Oh, come on. Think of it as a way

98
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:09,221
to say "I'm sorry for handcuffing you

99
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,757
to a car door." Except I'm not.

100
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,794
Wow. So this is where you live.

101
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,597
Anyone considering a life in
bounty hunting should see this.

102
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:19,965
Preferably wearing a hazmat suit.

103
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,551
You don't bring women here, do you?

104
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:24,269
All right.

105
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:26,305
Fish Mooney.

106
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,304
Penguin's million-dollar bounty.

107
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:29,806
I can help you get it.

108
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:34,513
Ooh, see, now you're thinking,

109
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,946
"A million dollars,

110
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,081
that can buy me a lot of scotch."

111
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:40,350
But, hey, when you're
rich, do everyone a favor,

112
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,685
spring for a maid, will you?
Or just firebomb the place

113
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:44,254
and be done with it.

114
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:48,403
What's in it for you?

115
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,950
- A story.
- That's it?

116
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:54,264
It shocks you that I love my
job and I want to be good at it?

117
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:55,465
Kinda.

118
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,033
Why not just bring her in yourself?

119
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:01,554
Why give me a million dollars?

120
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,240
Because I'm a bigger person than you.

121
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:08,344
And...

122
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:09,812
because I couldn't find her.

123
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,682
Ah. You lost touch with your source.

124
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,050
The one working for Mooney.

125
00:06:14,118 --> 00:06:16,219
I did not lose touch with my source.

126
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:18,706
I just have no way of contacting her.

127
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,095
She always found me.

128
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,125
Oh, well, that's better.

129
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,662
It's a million dollars.

130
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,097
Don't be so damn lazy. I mean,

131
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:31,301
that's your job, right? Your
specialty. You find people.

132
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,636
You're a bounty hunter.

133
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:38,207
- Who's your source?
- So we have a deal?

134
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,010
No handcuffing this time.

135
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:43,846
- Who's your source?
- She's a petty thief.

136
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:46,950
A street kid. I like her
though. She's got style.

137
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:50,987
- What's her name?
- Selina Kyle.

138
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:53,389
You two ever cross paths
when you were a cop?

139
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,224
Once or twice.

140
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:57,460
Well, that's great. So
you know where she lives.

141
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:59,309
No. Not a clue.

142
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,053
But I know someone who might.

143
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:13,910
Oh... my... God.

144
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:15,411
Hello, Barbara.

145
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,480
"Hello, Barbara"?

146
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:19,415
Is that all I get?

147
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:23,086
- How you been?
- Oh. How've I been?

148
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,921
Well, see for yourself.

149
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:27,757
I mean, it's no art gallery,
but there's less chance

150
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:29,805
of me dying of boredom.

151
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,095
How's Lee?

152
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,364
We're not together.

153
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,299
No. I thought by now

154
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,501
you would've chased her
down, put a ring on it.

155
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:41,504
Did you dump her? Oh, I bet you
dumped her, didn't you? You're such

156
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:43,806
- a heartbreaker.
- I feel like I walked into something.

157
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:45,875
'Cause you did. Who are you?

158
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,177
Valerie Vale. I work for TheGazette.

159
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:51,014
- We're working on a project.
- I bet.

160
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:52,930
She your new girlfriend?

161
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,183
- No.
- No.

162
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:57,620
Jim and I were engaged.

163
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:59,561
Until I called it off.

164
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,259
Uh-huh. We're looking for Selina.

165
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,262
Oh, wait, I remember
this. You kidnapped him

166
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,631
and his girlfriend, held
them hostage in a church.

167
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,633
Aren't you supposed to be in Arkham?

168
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,602
I was, but turns out I'm totally sane.

169
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:16,372
Got a paper proving it.

170
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,908
Yeah. Signed by Hugo Strange. Again,

171
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,122
Selina, have you seen her?

172
00:08:24,383 --> 00:08:25,715
A kiss.

173
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:28,552
That's my price.

174
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:32,328
Is she serious? Are-are you serious?

175
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,158
Do it.

176
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:39,996
Never mind.

177
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:43,966
You're honestly no fun.

178
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:46,102
Try her squat down on Drake and Powell.

179
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,870
That's it? I've already been there.

180
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:51,941
She may have mentioned an
old bank near Kane Sound.

181
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,878
Jim.

182
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:02,085
I had a dream about you the other night.

183
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,787
You were in this horrible accident,

184
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,390
and you lost both of your legs,

185
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,903
and then I had to push you
around in a giant baby carriage.

186
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:15,198
Good seeing you, Barbara.

187
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:18,997
Do not.

188
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:27,176
So you really think Fish is
using the bank as an old base?

189
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:28,745
If I had to bet, yeah.

190
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:31,614
Me, too. So how 'bout I call the GCPD,

191
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:33,683
give them the exclusive,

192
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:36,950
they take in Fish, and you get squat?

193
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:43,559
Hey. Open the door.

194
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:45,328
You should've let me
come to find Peabody.

195
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:46,562
- Vale!
- And, you know what,

196
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,965
- I like your ex.
- Vale! Hey! Hey!

197
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,194
Hey there.

198
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:53,329
You all right?

199
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:55,898
Thirsty.

200
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,268
I-I don't have anything on me,

201
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:01,604
but I live just up the road.

202
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:03,172
What's your name?

203
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:10,947
Ivy.

204
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,726
My name's Ivy.

205
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:32,184
Barnes is gonna want to
known where you got this.

206
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:34,342
Oh, come on, you know I
can't give up my source.

207
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,044
Don't forget our deal. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

208
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,379
As soon as Fish Mooney's booked,

209
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,513
you get first crack at her,

210
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:41,049
but for now stay out of the way.

211
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,417
All right.

212
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:44,197
All right, fellas, listen up!

213
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,452
We don't know what we're
gonna find in there,

214
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:49,555
so rule number one is be careful.

215
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:51,723
And keep your eyes
peeled for Ethel Peabody.

216
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,294
She's the state witness that
was abducted last night.

217
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,662
I don't have to tell you guys

218
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:58,664
that this is the call
we've been waiting for.

219
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:02,234
Let's go in there and end
this thing once and for all.

220
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,782
Oh, we have

221
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,817
company.

222
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:20,786
GCPD!

223
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:23,288
Don't nobody move!

224
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,039
Get Sebring a medic now.

225
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:16,775
Anyone see Mooney?

226
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,977
For months, I warned

227
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:20,879
the police about the threat to our city

228
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:25,083
posed by Hugo Strange's freaks,
by the murderer Fish Mooney,

229
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,718
and how did they protect you?

230
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,487
They said that Fish Mooney wasn't real.

231
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:30,188
That these escapees

232
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,491
were victims who need our help.

233
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,660
Well, Fish Mooney was real.

234
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:38,130
And once she was cornered
by the GCPD, finally,

235
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:39,564
they let her escape.

236
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,500
And these "victims"...

237
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,669
Well, I, for one, am not afraid

238
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:47,239
to call them by their
proper name: monsters!

239
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:49,107
Our city

240
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:51,510
is being invaded by monsters,

241
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:53,812
attacking our brothers and sisters,

242
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,013
and it is up to us!

243
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,581
To you!

244
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,017
To kill every monster you see!

245
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:00,152
Who is with me?

246
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,063
Master Bruce, wake up.

247
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:11,665
Come on.

248
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,800
Wake up, Master B.

249
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:15,475
Master B, wake up.

250
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:19,406
Here you go, sunshine.

251
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:21,775
Morning.

252
00:14:21,843 --> 00:14:23,310
You all right?

253
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,845
How did I get back here?

254
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:26,246
I don't know; I got the foggiest.

255
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:27,714
I mean, I just came in
here to call the police

256
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:29,049
and-and then I found you.

257
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:30,592
Alfred.

258
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:33,453
You all right?

259
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,119
You all right, then.

260
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:37,491
You know, I reckon it was
that sameckonit was thate

261
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:39,126
masked bastard that
knocked me spark out.

262
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:42,631
I mean, he came in and out
without so much as a peep.

263
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,971
I saw them, Alfred.

264
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:54,941
I spoke to them.

265
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,601
And?

266
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:58,902
It worked.

267
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:05,075
They agreed.

268
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:08,312
What, just-just like that?

269
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:11,148
I mean, you talked about the stuff

270
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:12,716
that we-we talked about, right?

271
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,752
Yes.

272
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:21,892
But I had to promise not to
investigate them anymore.

273
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,460
Not Indian Hill,

274
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:26,412
not the corruption within my company,

275
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:28,979
not my parents' murder.

276
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:35,141
I see.

277
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,741
Alfred.

278
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,711
It was the only way.

279
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:46,083
You weren't the only one
they threatened, were you?

280
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,488
Hey?

281
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,590
No.

282
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,661
Do you intend on keeping your word?

283
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,832
Yes.

284
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,400
I do.

285
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:08,205
And how do you know...

286
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:10,607
they will keep theirs?

287
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,085
Hey, Alvarez, where's Bullock?

288
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:24,021
He's not back from the old bank yet.

289
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:26,356
You missed a big payday, Gordon.

290
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:27,858
We nabbed five of those freaks.

291
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:30,212
Yeah, trusted the wrong person.

292
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:31,736
I know the feeling.

293
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:35,065
Can we call this even?

294
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:37,534
You got me. I got you.

295
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:39,870
It's over. Let me buy you a drink.

296
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:46,269
Yeah... it's over when I get Fish.

297
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:47,714
You can read about it.

298
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:54,418
I do not want to get in trouble.

299
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:58,155
Odd as it might seem, I
do enjoy working here.

300
00:16:58,222 --> 00:16:59,389
I'm just looking to find Fish.

301
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,425
I do that, everybody wins.

302
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:02,726
Fine.

303
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:04,194
You know she's sick.

304
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:05,629
That's the reason for those drugs

305
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:07,130
she and the others were stealing.

306
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:08,598
That's what Peabody said.

307
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,534
I figured that was why Mooney
was trying to find her.

308
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,102
See if she could fix her.

309
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,137
Well...

310
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:15,839
it appears something went wrong.

311
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,940
This is Ethel Peabody.

312
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:22,112
You're sure?

313
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,281
Two separate tests confirmed it.

314
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:26,249
You remember there was a body

315
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:27,818
at the pharmaceuticals warehouse,

316
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:29,486
a worker ID'd

317
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:32,122
as 35 years old but
who looked a hundred?

318
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,890
I remember.

319
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:37,594
So, Mooney kidnaps Peabody,

320
00:17:37,662 --> 00:17:40,530
and then has one of
her creatures kill her.

321
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:41,598
Why?

322
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,300
Did Peabody give her what she wanted?

323
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:44,367
She no longer needed her?

324
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:45,969
It seems unlikely.

325
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:49,406
My bet, Peabody simply couldn't fix her.

326
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:53,210
Leaving Mooney still
searching for the cure.

327
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:54,845
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

328
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:57,848
There's only one person in
Gotham who could help her.

329
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,816
Hugo Strange.

330
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:11,261
Detective Bullock.

331
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,730
Yeah, that's me.

332
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:15,699
Fish Mooney wants to see you.

333
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:21,605
All right, all right, all right!

334
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:23,607
I'm going.

335
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:35,336
Hello, Harvey.

336
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:36,570
Long time.

337
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:37,905
Hey, Fish.

338
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:39,373
How you doing?

339
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,842
- Not so good.
- Sorry to hear that.

340
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,871
You know, there's a lot of
people out there looking for you.

341
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:46,180
Yeah.

342
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:48,482
I need to find that bastard, Strange.

343
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:53,354
Yeah, well, you know I
can't help you with that.

344
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:55,689
Oh.

345
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:57,925
Yes, you can.

346
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:02,937
And... you will.

347
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:17,283
I'll help you find Strange.

348
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:19,473
Good boy.

349
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,016
This is it.

350
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:34,053
Nothing special, but it's home.

351
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:36,587
You hungry?

352
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,388
Just thirsty.

353
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:39,556
Beer?

354
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:40,557
Pop?

355
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,392
Tea?

356
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,461
Water.

357
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,605
So sad.

358
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:56,340
Poor things.

359
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:58,375
My ex-wife left a box of
clothes when she moved out.

360
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,043
You're welcome to them,
if you want to change.

361
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:02,898
Okay.

362
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:04,815
So, where are you from?

363
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:07,084
Gotham.

364
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:12,022
Listen, if you need to
use the phone, go ahead.

365
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,011
Why would I need to use the phone?

366
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,559
Someone's got to be looking for you.

367
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:16,767
No.

368
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:20,097
- No one.
- Really?

369
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:21,331
A beautiful girl like you?

370
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:25,093
You think I'm beautiful?

371
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,638
So, who are you?

372
00:20:31,776 --> 00:20:33,618
Just a girl.

373
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,580
Cops killed my dad.

374
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:38,448
My mom left.

375
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:40,584
I was alone.

376
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,146
Abandoned.

377
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:45,989
But then...

378
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,992
something happened and...

379
00:20:50,795 --> 00:20:52,930
I changed.

380
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:56,500
Grew.

381
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:58,268
I'm different...

382
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:02,272
inside and out.

383
00:21:05,443 --> 00:21:07,477
So sad.

384
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:09,546
I'm gonna get rid of that.

385
00:21:09,614 --> 00:21:12,883
I've never been that good
at taking care of things.

386
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:15,019
What are you doing?

387
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:18,488
Relax. They're just plants.

388
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:20,324
I'll get those clothes.

389
00:21:26,898 --> 00:21:28,332
You don't know that Mooney has him,

390
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:30,367
or that she's looking for Strange,

391
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:31,501
and, again,

392
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:33,103
you shouldn't even be here.

393
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:34,571
Harvey isn't answering his phone.

394
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:35,472
Nobody knows where he is.

395
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,874
Well, you could start by looking

396
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:39,076
in every place in Gotham
that serves booze.

397
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:41,745
And we found this...

398
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:44,081
beside his car.

399
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,961
She's looking for him.

400
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,622
With Peabody dead,

401
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:52,689
that'd be her next logical step.

402
00:21:52,757 --> 00:21:53,857
Damn.

403
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:55,459
Damn, damn!

404
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:56,660
You have to call someone.

405
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:58,061
Tell them Fish is on her way.

406
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,264
Call who? The Feds?

407
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:02,566
I don't even know which
department has Strange.

408
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:04,635
But you do know where they're
hiding him, don't you?

409
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:06,159
You and Bullock both know.

410
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:10,574
They took him to a
place outside the city.

411
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:13,110
It's like an old mansion,

412
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:14,611
but on the inside, it's a
high-tech research facility.

413
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:17,347
The government has scientists
debriefing him, don't they?

414
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:20,684
They want to know what he
discovered in Indian Hill.

415
00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:21,785
You have to tell us where it is.

416
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:23,632
The hell I do.

417
00:22:25,523 --> 00:22:26,823
I'll take you there.

418
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:39,136
Are you sure this is the place?

419
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:42,105
Yeah. This is where I dropped
Strange off a few months ago.

420
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:45,842
All right, show time.

421
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:57,321
Hey, fellas.

422
00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:58,922
At ease, soldiers.

423
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,724
Detective Bullock, GCPD.

424
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,493
- Where's your badge?
- My badge?

425
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:05,295
Oh, man, I must've dropped it.

426
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:06,496
I'm here to see Strange.

427
00:23:06,564 --> 00:23:07,564
We haven't heard anything.

428
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:09,132
You haven't? That's strange.

429
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,600
I mean strange weird,
not the guy Strange.

430
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:12,069
Do you have ID?

431
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,504
Yeah.

432
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:19,676
- Um...
- Who the hell...?

433
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:20,777
Hold it!

434
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:23,626
I said hold it!

435
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:53,543
Stop right...

436
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,372
Professor Strange.

437
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,443
You and I have some unfinished business.

438
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,807
Look at you.

439
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:39,209
Amazing.

440
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,462
You were my greatest creation.

441
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,375
Your greatest creation who's dying.

442
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:48,722
What?

443
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:55,274
You're going to fix me, Daddy.

444
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,664
And when that's done,

445
00:24:57,732 --> 00:25:00,200
you're going to make me an army,

446
00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:04,738
so I can have this city
kneeling at my feet.

447
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,994
But I can't...

448
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:10,577
fix you.

449
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:15,749
Fish, cops. Lots of them.

450
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:18,919
You have a few minutes
to rethink your answer.

451
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:21,406
I'd suggest you do.

452
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:48,181
It's Bullock.

453
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,052
Harvey. Harvey, you all right?

454
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,787
Oh, he's fine.

455
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:55,622
But this ain't Harvey.

456
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,557
I want to talk to him.

457
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,293
Sure.

458
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,328
- You don't control me anymore.
- Sid.

459
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:06,233
Hey, Cap. How are ya? Sorry.

460
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:08,368
One chance, Mooney.

461
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:11,571
You let him go, you might
just make it out of this.

462
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:12,906
Chump.

463
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:14,975
Don't you know you're
speaking to a dying woman,

464
00:26:15,043 --> 00:26:17,844
which severely limits
your negotiating position?

465
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:20,480
So here's how it's going to go down.

466
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:22,449
One cop comes within 20 feet

467
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:24,251
of this place, and Harvey,

468
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,954
although I love him, will eat a bullet.

469
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:31,925
You had to come back, didn't you?

470
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:34,194
Like a bad penny.

471
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:35,462
Now where were we?

472
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,664
Fish, you got to give it
up; you're surrounded.

473
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:38,832
You got nowhere to go!

474
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,200
Shut up, Harvey.

475
00:26:41,135 --> 00:26:42,469
What's going on?

476
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:44,348
- How's Bullock?
- Listen up!

477
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:46,840
I want you to create a full perimeter.

478
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:48,542
Snipers on every corner.

479
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,077
Mooney does not make it out of this.

480
00:26:50,144 --> 00:26:50,944
Understood?

481
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:52,879
- Yes, sir.
- Now go.

482
00:26:52,947 --> 00:26:54,214
- Captain.
- What?

483
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:55,649
You cannot just leave him in there.

484
00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:57,050
You think that's what I'm doing?

485
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,752
I'm just not charging
through the front door

486
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,853
so he gets killed.

487
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:01,021
And I'll remind you,

488
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:02,889
you are no longer a police officer.

489
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:05,792
Get in my way, and
I'll have you arrested.

490
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:13,300
Oh, no, not the press.

491
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:15,001
Keep the press back.

492
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,804
Keep them back.

493
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:28,982
We are standing outside the
mansion and preliminary reports

494
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,917
are that wanted Indian
Hill escapee Fish Mooney

495
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:34,755
has barricaded herself inside
and is holding a hostage.

496
00:27:34,822 --> 00:27:36,757
This is it, Butch.

497
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:39,126
She's finally cornered.

498
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:41,027
Like a rat.

499
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:42,729
Yeah, but what are you gonna do?

500
00:27:42,797 --> 00:27:44,765
The cops are already there.

501
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:53,673
The GCPD is not Gotham.

502
00:27:53,741 --> 00:27:55,842
Gotham listens to me.

503
00:27:57,211 --> 00:28:00,147
It's time to round up our friends.

504
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:04,050
Believe me, if I could fix you, I would.

505
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:06,420
I think of you as one
of my own children.

506
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:08,021
But I can't.

507
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:10,190
So what am I supposed to do?

508
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:11,258
Give up?

509
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:14,361
Do you not understand what you are?

510
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:15,762
What you represent?

511
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,670
You are the first of a new generation.

512
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:21,902
A new Eve.

513
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:28,141
You know, I owned a club once.

514
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:32,145
Ran protection on the side.

515
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:35,248
Every first of the month,
people would pay me.

516
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,651
Every once in a while,
someone would come up short.

517
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:38,952
And they'd say,

518
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,255
"Mooney, I don't have the money.

519
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:44,624
Mooney, I need more time."

520
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:47,160
And they'd cry and cry.

521
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:51,765
And then I discovered
that when I squeezed them,

522
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:54,634
and squeezed them,

523
00:28:54,702 --> 00:28:57,471
and squeezed them,

524
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:01,308
they always had more.

525
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:06,246
You are going to fix me...

526
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,750
or I swear to God, I will make you pray

527
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:12,285
for your death.

528
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:15,222
Fish.

529
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:18,158
What are the cops doing now?

530
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:19,826
It's not the cops.

531
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:25,065
What the hell is this?

532
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:36,743
Cordon off this entire area.

533
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,473
No one gets near the house.

534
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:42,916
Cobblepot,

535
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:44,384
what the hell are you doing here?

536
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:45,886
What you have proven to be incapable of

537
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,320
time and time again.

538
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:49,189
This is a GCPD operation.

539
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:52,559
I am ordering you and
this mob to disperse.

540
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:54,661
- Immediately.
- Fat chance.

541
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:57,564
I will not let those
monsters escape again.

542
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,533
Fish Mooney dies tonight!

543
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,700
Yeah!

544
00:30:00,768 --> 00:30:02,168
Dammit, Cobblepot.

545
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:04,771
One of my detectives is inside.

546
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,239
This is the last time I'm gonna ask.

547
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:07,340
Back up!

548
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:08,875
You've had your chance, Barnes.

549
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,911
Now it's my turn.

550
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,746
Who's with me?

551
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:15,649
Stay back!

552
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,189
You killed a lot of our friends, Gordon.

553
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:03,509
A lot of your friends had it coming.

554
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,766
So do you.

555
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:09,069
That's enough.

556
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,805
Bring him in.

557
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,516
Kill them now!

558
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:20,807
Stay back!

559
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:24,745
Jim, what the hell are you doing here?

560
00:31:24,812 --> 00:31:26,680
Saving you; I thought that was obvious.

561
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:28,515
Oh, yeah. Totally. Thank you.

562
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,350
Why are you here, Gordon?

563
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:31,918
Did your little cop friend send you

564
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:33,687
to get me to turn myself in?

565
00:31:33,755 --> 00:31:35,989
'Cause that's not going to happen.

566
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:37,491
I'm here on my own.

567
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:38,892
I only want Bullock.

568
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,060
Really?

569
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:41,161
You'd risk your life

570
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:42,863
for this broken down old thing?

571
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,131
Thanks.

572
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:46,466
He'd do the same for me.

573
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:47,701
I would, it's true.

574
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:49,870
Well, you've helped me,

575
00:31:49,937 --> 00:31:51,838
'cause now I have two hostages.

576
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:53,907
Barnes won't see it that way.

577
00:31:53,975 --> 00:31:56,576
Hell, you kill me, he'll
probably thank you.

578
00:31:56,644 --> 00:31:58,912
I've been nothing but a
pain in the ass to him.

579
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,013
Also true.

580
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:06,239
Then you better give me one good reason

581
00:32:07,354 --> 00:32:10,157
why I shouldn't have
my friends kill you.

582
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,728
Because I can get you out of here.

583
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:16,730
And exactly how do you plan to do that,

584
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,199
considering this whole
place is surrounded?

585
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:20,767
That's my problem.

586
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:22,536
I get you out of here,
you give me Bullock.

587
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:23,770
That's the deal.

588
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:30,377
I get this one.

589
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:33,692
- Wait a second...
- Deal.

590
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,985
You have two minutes.

591
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:54,067
Jim, you just keep surprising me.

592
00:32:54,135 --> 00:32:58,104
Shut up. How'd you like to
have Fish all to yourself?

593
00:32:58,172 --> 00:32:59,940
Don't tease.

594
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:03,677
She'll be in the woods behind
the mansion in five minutes.

595
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,946
All you have to do is one thing.

596
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:07,360
Name it.

597
00:33:12,553 --> 00:33:15,121
Cobblepot, get this crowd to disperse,

598
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:17,991
or I'll make them disperse.
And there will be bloodshed.

599
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,993
Promise?!

600
00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:22,095
People of Gotham!

601
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:23,930
The time for action is now!

602
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:25,866
Kill the monsters!

603
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:27,834
Kill them now!

604
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:32,205
We need all units to the front
of the house immediately!

605
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,915
The mob's broken through the front,

606
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:43,850
but the back is clear. We
can make it to the woods.

607
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:47,354
Time to go. You two hold
'em off as long as you can.

608
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:48,989
And, Harvey, no hard feelings.

609
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,658
Fish, screw you.

610
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:53,660
Fair enough. Jim,

611
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:55,996
- you can't let her take me.
- Good-bye, Professor.

612
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:57,063
She's going to kill me.

613
00:33:57,131 --> 00:33:59,199
She's gonna kill me!

614
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:01,101
Stop!

615
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:37,637
Go!

616
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:44,277
That's better.

617
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:46,179
Just old friends.

618
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:48,381
- Oswald...
- Don't call me that!

619
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:50,116
My name is Penguin.

620
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:53,920
Do you know how long I've
been looking for you?

621
00:34:53,988 --> 00:34:55,956
How long I've waited
for this very moment?

622
00:34:56,023 --> 00:34:57,090
Mr. Cobblepot...

623
00:34:57,158 --> 00:34:59,626
- Quiet!
- So this is it?

624
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:02,095
I spare your life,

625
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:05,632
and you shoot me dead in
the woods like an animal?

626
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:09,102
Pretty much, yes.

627
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:13,039
But I will admit,

628
00:35:13,107 --> 00:35:16,154
that night under the
bridge stayed with me.

629
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:18,345
Why?

630
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:22,115
- Why what?
- Why didn't you kill me?

631
00:35:22,183 --> 00:35:25,385
I have gone over that night 1,000 times,

632
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:27,410
and it doesn't make any sense.

633
00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:30,056
Why didn't you kill me?

634
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:32,612
I would've killed you in an instant.

635
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:37,119
- Answer me!
- Because you're mine.

636
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,713
You were my umbrella boy, remember?

637
00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:45,338
You rubbed my feet

638
00:35:45,406 --> 00:35:47,340
when they were tired.

639
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:50,010
And now look at you,

640
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:52,679
the terror of Gotham.

641
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,417
Everything I've done in my life,

642
00:35:57,485 --> 00:36:00,987
possibly the best thing

643
00:36:01,055 --> 00:36:02,522
was turning

644
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,959
Oswald Cobblepot into...

645
00:36:06,027 --> 00:36:08,198
the Penguin.

646
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:12,044
I couldn't destroy that.

647
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,270
Ask him.

648
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:19,039
He understands

649
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:23,076
what it is to bring
something into being.

650
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:25,855
It is a part of you.

651
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:29,115
Forever.

652
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:40,694
Good-bye, Fish.

653
00:36:42,063 --> 00:36:44,364
Don't come back.

654
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:06,762
Got some more fuel for the fire!

655
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:34,290
Penguin! Penguin!

656
00:37:34,357 --> 00:37:36,358
Penguin! Penguin!

657
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:38,194
Penguin! Penguin!

658
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:40,729
Penguin! Penguin!

659
00:37:40,797 --> 00:37:42,097
Penguin!

660
00:37:46,603 --> 00:37:49,271
Tell Barnes something, would you?

661
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:51,373
I'm going home.

662
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:23,606
Next time,

663
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:25,811
remember to water.

664
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:33,716
Well, I, for one,

665
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:35,417
am personally very
glad not to be staring

666
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:37,987
at those bloody box files and
that flaming bulletin board,

667
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:40,473
tramping down those
stairs to that dank cave.

668
00:38:41,991 --> 00:38:45,193
It does leave one question
unanswered though, doesn't it,

669
00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:46,875
- Master Bruce?
- What's that?

670
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:50,299
Well, you know, with all this
spare time on your hands,

671
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:51,791
how are you gonna fill it?

672
00:38:53,072 --> 00:38:55,343
Well, I imagine you have some ideas.

673
00:38:55,422 --> 00:38:56,675
I do.

674
00:38:58,408 --> 00:39:00,643
Dancing lessons.

675
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:03,501
Dancing lessons.

676
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:06,048
That's right. I mean, a man
of your station should be able

677
00:39:06,116 --> 00:39:08,717
to guide gracefully a
beautiful young girl

678
00:39:08,785 --> 00:39:10,486
across a dance floor, don't you think?

679
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:13,122
And I suppose that you're gonna
be teaching me these lessons.

680
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:15,791
Why, I certainly could. You
know, I was quite well regarded

681
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:18,866
as a... bit of a dancer
in my day, actually.

682
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:20,107
Were you?

683
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:21,630
But I think I'll leave
that particular ordeal

684
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:23,450
to someone more qualified.

685
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:41,183
Right.

686
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:43,319
Step out.

687
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:44,648
Slowly.

688
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:53,436
Who are you?

689
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,298
Oh, my word.

690
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:09,680
Please don't hurt me.

691
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:23,025
You don't quit, do you?

692
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:25,294
I came by to let you know
that tomorrow's paper

693
00:40:25,362 --> 00:40:28,197
is gonna lay out Bullock's
story of how Fish got away.

694
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:31,800
How she just... vanished
while you two were escaping.

695
00:40:31,868 --> 00:40:33,725
Great. Can't wait to read about it.

696
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,125
And it's a load of crap.

697
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:37,706
You want to know what I think?

698
00:40:37,774 --> 00:40:39,608
I got the feeling you're
gonna tell me either way.

699
00:40:39,676 --> 00:40:42,211
I think you made a deal with Fish.

700
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:45,547
You let her escape with Strange
in exchange for Bullock's life.

701
00:40:52,722 --> 00:40:54,656
And how would I manage that?

702
00:40:54,724 --> 00:40:58,060
I saw Penguin get a call
before the riot started.

703
00:40:58,128 --> 00:40:59,661
When the mob attacked,

704
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:02,097
Barnes ordered all
the cops to the front.

705
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:06,500
And that's when Fish slipped
into the woods with Strange.

706
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,071
By that logic, Penguin

707
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,973
helped Fish escape.
Why would he do that?

708
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,610
'Cause he wanted Fish all to himself.

709
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:14,540
I mean, that is what you
offered him, wasn't it?

710
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:18,947
You promised to help Fish
escape, but you did it

711
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:21,750
by double-crossing her and
delivering her to Penguin.

712
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:24,573
If that were so, I'd be
a millionaire by now.

713
00:41:25,092 --> 00:41:27,389
Except Fish isn't dead.

714
00:41:28,016 --> 00:41:30,906
Penguin would've dragged her
in front of the mob if she was.

715
00:41:35,265 --> 00:41:37,246
So what happened in the woods?

716
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:40,421
I don't know.

717
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:44,481
I do know

718
00:41:45,147 --> 00:41:48,187
that you're gonna have a hard
time collecting all that cash.

719
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:51,814
'Course, that wasn't why
you did any of this, was it?

720
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:56,470
Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?

721
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,768
- Wait...
- Shut up for once.
