<i>Last season
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,480
We have the six totems,
but you can't fight

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,720
what you can't see.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,720
What if the only way to kill
Mallus is to let him out?

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,040
Guys, we did it!

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,360
My father's Time Stone.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,840
He died to give you a second chance.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
Don't waste it.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,480
Whose brilliant idea
was it to let an ancient demon

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,400
out of his bloody cage?

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,080
Well, you opened a door, love,

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,320
and Mallus wasn't
the only thing that got out.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,400
<i>The newest musical sensation
to cross the Atlantic</i>

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>a group of young men from Liverpool</i>

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,320
<i>who call themselves the Beatles
have just arrived at JFK.</i>

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,080
<i>The Beatles.</i>

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,160
<i>That's B-E-A-T,</i>

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,680
<i>because that's the way
they keep the beat.</i>

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,240
Hey, Z, if you had to sleep with one

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
which one would it be?

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,040
How can you even tell them apart?

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,080
Well, Paul's the cute one,

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,720
George is the quiet one,
there's Ringo...

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,440
Never met an Englishman
I haven't wanted to

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,680
punch in the face.

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,160
Relax, Mick. If it wasn't
for the British Invasion,

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,760
there would be no Rolling Stones,
no Led Zep,

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,560
no Black Sabbath.

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,840
- Black Sabbath.
- Yup.

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,440
Well, then we... we need to protect

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,040
these mop heads from whatever's
screwing up history.

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
That's right, Mick.

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,760
So, Gideon sent us
on a wild goose chase.

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,680
This event in history is playing out
exactly as it should.

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,320
The British are coming!

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,640
The British are coming!

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,920
Interesting fact. The real
Paul Revere didn't actually say...

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,640
Oh, my God, it's Paul Revere!

39
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
I got this.

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,320
Who are you people?

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,840
Where am I?
Why are all those women screaming?

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,920
And now for the midnight
ride of Ray Revere.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,520
- Sorry.
- Nate Revere to the rescue.

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
Now ring the alarm back in 1775.

45
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,040
I got a country to save, suckers!

46
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,640
See you back on the ship, Nate.

47
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,840
The British are coming!

48
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,040
The British are coming!

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,720
Geez, who died?

50
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,480
Oh, come on.

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,680
{\an5}We just met the Beatles
and saved Fourth of July.

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,080
No, it's cool
it's just all becoming...

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know. Old hat.

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,040
{\an5}Yeah, we did spend all
of last night year returning

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,960
{\an5}displaced people to
their proper place in history.

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,880
Four years doing the same old crap.

57
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,280
Yeah, I'm beginning to think
Wally had the right idea

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,920
{\an5}taking time off, clearing
his head, traveling the world.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,280
Speaking of the same old crap,

60
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,480
isn't that what he did last year?

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,440
{\an5}Look, all I know is,
Constantine promised us new,

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,600
{\an5}mysterious monsters.
So where they all hiding?

63
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,320
I'm confused.

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,960
{\an5}We are all happy that there
was only one dragon, right?

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,080
We don't want to be fighting
werewolves in the Alamo.

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,160
Well, it would be good
for our ratings.

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
What ratings?

68
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Oh, you don't know?

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,800
{\an5}The Time Bureau
rates all their employees.

70
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,320
{\an5}But don't worry.
We have a few dedicated fans.

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,160
Yeah, Gary doesn't count.

72
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,640
{\an5}Who gives a damn
about Time Pig ratings?

73
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,960
I want dragons.

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,160
What is wrong with you guys?

75
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Don't you get it?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,480
Constantine was wrong.

77
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,600
{\an5}Our crazy plan
to let Mallus out worked.

78
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,360
Finally, we're not screw-ups

79
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,800
forced to clean up our own mess.

80
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,320
{\an5}For once in our lives,
we are actual heroes.

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720
<i>Captain, I'm receiving a communiqué
from Director Sharpe.</i>

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Put her on, Gideon.

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Captain Lance,

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,320
I would like you
and your team to report

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,200
to the Time Bureau immediately.

86
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,640
Copy that.

87
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,240
Gideon, set a course for Star City.

88
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm not talking about
our field office, Miss Lance.

89
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,600
I meant our Time Bureau
Headquarters in D.C.

90
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Over and out.

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
Damn it!

92
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,160
Who told Ava about the dragon?

93
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,000
{\an5}You sure that you can't
tell us what all this is about?

94
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,200
{\an5}Oh, I'd love to,
but the boss-lady will kill me.

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Mick.

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,880
- Talk.
- I can't. Director Sharpe said...

97
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
Whatever Ava threatened is nothing

98
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,040
{\an5}compared to what
I'm about to do to you.

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
You told her about the dragon
head, didn't you, Gary?

100
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,880
- What? No.
- Did Constantine

101
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,600
- get you to squeal?
- I wish.

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,760
We looked there are no
more monsters.

103
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,320
This isn't what you think.

104
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,520
Then what the hell is it?

105
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,520
Surprise!

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,120
{\an5}On behalf of the Time Bureau,
I would like to recognize

107
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,960
{\an5}Captain Lance and her crew
for fixing the final Anachronism.

108
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,720
Congratulations!

109
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,600
What does that even mean?

110
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,040
Well, it means that...

111
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
{\an5}Paul Revere
was the final crack in the timeline.

112
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,920
You, my friends, fixed history.

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,360
The same history we broke.

114
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,920
Just take the win.

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,040
I don't want your stinking medal.

116
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,000
- There's an open bar.
- Where?

117
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,240
Sorry, Sara, I know you don't
like surprises, but...

118
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
I like this one.

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,160
Now, I was thinking maybe
you could give me a tour

120
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,800
of the Headquarters, Director Sharpe.

121
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,000
Gee, I really wonder how

122
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,360
she managed to escape
from the Time Bureau.

123
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Yeah...

124
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,520
I mean, if I had to...

125
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
if I had to guess,

126
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,960
{\an5}I'd probably say that someone
must have given Nora

127
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,680
her dead father's Time Stone.

128
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,120
{\an5}And furthermore,
that someone must have done it

129
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,960
in hopes that she would
turn over a new leaf in life.

130
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,320
{\an5}Sounds like that someone
forgot about Nora's serious

131
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,160
{\an5}lack of ethics...
around a murder, for one...

132
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,920
But that someone must have had

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,600
{\an5}a really big heart
to give her a second chance.

134
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,280
You're a good guy, Ray Palmer.

135
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,920
{\an5}- Okay, I got to go.
- No, no, no...

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Yes, I got to get back to the ship.

137
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,520
{\an5}The Legends aren't
used to being on furlough.

138
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,200
Come on, they will be fine
for one night.

139
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,320
Besides, I was hoping that you

140
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,760
and your team would be spending
more time here in 2018.

141
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,840
But mostly, you know...

142
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,040
You, with me...

143
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,920
In this apartment.

144
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,240
Ava Sharpe.

145
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,960
Are you trying
to make a kept woman out of me?

146
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
What? No! I wouldn't dare.

147
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm... just...

148
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
saying that, you know,

149
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,520
since you fixed all the Anachronisms,

150
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
maybe you wouldn't mind being kept

151
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,440
just part of the time.

152
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,720
It would be fun
to come home to you.

153
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,720
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,600
Oh, that was stupid.

155
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,160
You just got back into town,
and here I am hitching

156
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,360
the old U-Haul
to the back of the Subaru.

157
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,320
- It was stupid.
- No, no.

158
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,760
Hey, it wasn't that. I'm...

159
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,280
I'm just thinking and...

160
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,720
I'm ready to take the next step.

161
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I...

162
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,280
am ready

163
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,920
to be a partially kept woman.

164
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,360
Yes! Come here.

165
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,040
Okay. So why don't you rustle us up
another bottle of champagne,

166
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,400
and let's make this thing official.

167
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,840
- That, I can do.
- Yeah?

168
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Hello, John.

169
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,640
You know, tonight really isn't
a night for celebration, Sara.

170
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,800
The darkness, it's rising.

171
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,160
What are you doing?
And what does that even mean?

172
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Mallus wasn't the only
prisoner to escape

173
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,480
when you decided to pull back
the veil between our worlds.

174
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,640
And yet for the past five months,

175
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,280
the Timeline has been quiet.

176
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,040
If you wanted to come and see me,

177
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,240
all you had to do was ask.

178
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,640
Five months is a blink of an eye

179
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,480
for an immortal monster.

180
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,800
Look, this is your bloody mess, Sara.

181
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,280
So, stop playing
tiddlywinks with the missus

182
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,160
and get ready
for the fight that's coming.

183
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,760
What if this is who I am now?

184
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Really?

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,520
This is who you are?

186
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,560
Fuzzy throws
and fluffy pink slippers?

187
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,920
I like my pink fluffy slippers.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,280
Okay, reunion's over.

189
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,440
Time to go.

190
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,520
What am I looking at?

191
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
The knuckle bones
of a martyred saint, obviously.

192
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
They act as a divining rod
able to detect the presence

193
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,280
of beings not belonging to our world.

194
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,720
My team spent the last five
months scouring the Timeline

195
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
for another one of your
mystical creatures.

196
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,160
You wanna know what we found?

197
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Nothing.

198
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
What the hell are you doing here?

199
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Is everything all right?

200
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Yeah, everything is great.

201
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,360
- I was just telling Sara...
- About an exorcism

202
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,560
that he has to do
tomorrow in Georgetown.

203
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,120
It's really nothing
you wanna hear before bedtime.

204
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,840
Come back again soon now, John.

205
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,360
Don't be shy about that doorbell.

206
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,960
I'll be seeing you around, Sharpie.

207
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,640
Should I be worried
about your ex-lover breaking

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
into my apartment, or...

209
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
Well, I thought that...

210
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,920
this was our apartment.

211
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,280
You are smooth.

212
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,400
Don't forget the bubbly.

213
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,280
Bollocks.

214
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,640
Mick, what are you still doing here?

215
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,160
Machine's still spinning,
and I'm still standing.

216
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,160
You know what?
Hook me up with one of those.

217
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,360
Now that we fixed
our last Anachronism,

218
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
it's only a matter of time
before the Bureau

219
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,080
puts us out to pasture
which blows,

220
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,760
because being a Legend was
the only thing I was good at.

221
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,600
Well, speak for yourself.
I was a great criminal.

222
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
At least we got these cool medals.

223
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
Actually, the medal
has to remain top secret,

224
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,440
because no one can know
about time travel.

225
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,320
So I'll just take these
back now for safe-keeping...

226
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you say you
and I find some real action?

227
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,280
Mick, I am 100 percent down.

228
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,240
Oh! I'll come with.

229
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
I could have just called us an Uber.

230
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,960
You ready to steal something pretty?

231
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,360
Yeah. I could do some light theft.

232
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,200
What is this, spring break?

233
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,520
I'm talking about a felony.

234
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
- Now get in!
- You know what, Mick?

235
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,800
If we're gonna rob a house,
we really should

236
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,480
make sure there's stuff
in there worth stealing.

237
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,760
And I think I know
just the neighborhood.

238
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,480
Mick, wait, wait, wait!
You are so aggressive.

239
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,480
Why don't you look for a spare key?

240
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
- Good spotting, pretty.
- Yeah.

241
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm a real criminal mastermind.

242
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Bingo.

243
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,720
Yes, I'd like to report a robbery.

244
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,880
You will do nothing of the sort.

245
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,600
Oh, Nate, it is so good to see you!

246
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,560
What the hell is going on here?

247
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Mick...

248
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,520
these are my parents.

249
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,120
I am Dorothy Heywood
you can call me Dot. Hi.

250
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,520
And this is my dad, Hank.

251
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,000
Henry Heywood.

252
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,240
And I believe
one of my great grandmother's

253
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,280
silver candlesticks
has found its way into your coat.

254
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,080
Oh, you have exquisite
taste in silver, Mr...

255
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,720
Rory. Mick Rory,
of the Central City Rorys.

256
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
We didn't mean to scare you, Mom.

257
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,800
I thought you'd be up
by Martha's Vineyard

258
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,480
- this time of year.
- Oh, we were!

259
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,840
But your father just took
a very exciting job at the Pentagon.

260
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,800
We'll... we'll get going,
right, Mick?

261
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,200
- Good idea.
- Don't be ridiculous.

262
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,040
Mr. Rory, do you like sandwiches?

263
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,400
Bet your ass, I do ma'am.

264
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,760
Wonderful, then

265
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,360
I'm gonna fix you boys
a little midnight snack.

266
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,880
You too, Henry.
You're one of the boys.

267
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Gary, wake up!

268
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
I got a hunch there might
be a monster loose in history.

269
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,840
Like the dragon you made me
not tell Director Sharpe about?

270
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Exactly.

271
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,520
No.

272
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,480
The Timeline's
only showing a few burps.

273
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,200
This is the only significant one.

274
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,680
What if there's a creature
that no one's noticed yet?

275
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,600
The only way people
wouldn't notice a monster is

276
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
if it was hiding.

277
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,880
Or if they were on drugs.

278
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm gonna go check it out.

279
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,960
- I'll come with!
- Nope.

280
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,360
But if you're going back
to 1969, you're gonna need...

281
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,800
Your time courier.

282
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,840
Going somewhere, Raymond?

283
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,080
And don't give me any of that

284
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
routine maintenance
on the jumpship crap.

285
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,360
Yeah, no. I wouldn't do that.

286
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,920
I... I had Gideon
monitor the Time Bureau.

287
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,040
Someone over there pulled up
unusual activity in Woodstock, 1969.

288
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,800
You think it's Nora,

289
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,760
and if the Time Bureau
finds her first,

290
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,720
she's going to tell them you're
the one who helped her escape.

291
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,520
Ray, I'm not going to let
you get on that jumpship.

292
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,400
But...

293
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Not without me.

294
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Oh, good.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,960
I was not looking forward to dealing
with those hippies on my own.

296
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,440
What's a hippie?

297
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
<i>I'm going up the country</i>

298
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,320
<i>Baby, don't you wanna go</i>

299
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,160
<i>I'm going up the country</i>

300
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
{\an5}<i>Baby, don't you wanna go</i>

301
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,720
<i>I'm going to some place</i>

302
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,240
<i>Where I've never been before</i>

303
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,680
Give peace a chance.

304
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,640
Together,
we can end the war in Vietnam.

305
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,320
Hey!

306
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,280
Yeah, this place is groovy.

307
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,440
So, tell me, why would
Nora Time Stone to the least

308
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,160
evil event in history?

309
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
Well, who knows?

310
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,800
Maybe she's turning over
a new, non-evil leaf,

311
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,880
- inspired by yours truly.
- Right.

312
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,800
- All right.
- What is that?

313
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,280
Oh, it's my old
trusty Eagle Scout compass.

314
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,600
I thought we could locate
the epicenter of the temporal

315
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,080
disturbance the old-fashioned way.

316
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,200
- It sounds like a blast, Ray.
- Yeah!

317
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,600
197, 198, 199...

318
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,640
Sorry, Ray.
Looks like Nora's in the wind.

319
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
What is that?

320
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,520
What is that?

321
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,440
Ray?

322
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,560
It's beautiful.

323
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,360
It's like some
sort of magical pixie goo.

324
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,640
No, not that. That!

325
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,520
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

326
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,760
Why? Who would wanna
kill hippies at Woodstock?

327
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,600
Literally ripping
people's hearts out!

328
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,080
Now, that's the Nora I remember.

329
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,960
You certainly can
eat a lot of sandwiches,

330
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,440
Mr. Rory.

331
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,680
Where did you get
those big muscles?

332
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,800
Prison.

333
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,600
What a hoot!

334
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,240
Isn't he a hoot, Henry?

335
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,960
He's a real barrel of laughs.

336
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,280
Excuse me.

337
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,080
So you just drop in on us
in the middle of the night,

338
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
after barely a phone call
for the past two years?

339
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
I know, Dad, I'm sorry.

340
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,800
I've just been busy.

341
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
- Busy doing what?
- History stuff.

342
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,960
You know, the same stuff
you never took seriously.

343
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,200
Maybe that's because
deductive historical

344
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,720
reconstruction
isn't an actual profession!

345
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,840
So should I have your mother
just grab her checkbook

347
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,160
now, or would you prefer
your friend here swipe it out

348
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,320
of her purse on the way out?

349
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
It would be easy either way.

350
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
I don't want your money, dad.

351
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,080
Then, why are you here?

352
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,520
Honestly, I don't know.

353
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
You don't...

354
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,120
We had a name for people like you,

355
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,240
back in my day...

356
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,640
Here comes the big rant
about hippies, go ahead.

357
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
To tell the truth,

358
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,920
I have nothing
but pity for those people.

359
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, since when?

360
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,600
Since they were slaughtered
like lambs back in '69.

361
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,080
Look, I'm not saying
the Woodstock Massacre

362
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,400
was their fault,

363
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,400
but it wasn't not their fault either.

364
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,200
Mom, thanks for the sandwiches!

365
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,080
There's something wrong
with history.

366
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,720
Not Noras. Hi!

367
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,160
Not Nora, not Nora...

368
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,320
definitely not Nora.

369
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,880
Ray, I really don't need
to hear your inner dialogue.

370
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
Sorry, I'm just... I'm... I'm...
I'm nervous, and upset.

371
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,440
I mean,
how could she be so heartless?

372
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,680
Pun not intended.

373
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,320
Well, her father did give her
over to a demon-loving cult so.

374
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
- Nora Darhk is here?
- Sara?

375
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,720
Hey, what are
you doing at Woodstock?

376
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,360
Probably the same thing as you are,

377
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,560
looking for whatever
is messing with history.

378
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,880
Huh, I think I just saw
Joan Baez talking to

379
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
Carlos Santana.

380
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Woodstock...

381
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,320
Turns into a massacre.

382
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,000
Nate! You're here too?

383
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
Yeah, buddy.

384
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Hey.

385
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Hey!

386
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,920
Okay, what is going on?

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,520
Woodstock is no longer
remembered as three days of

388
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,400
peace and love, but instead,
the end of the hippie movement.

389
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,240
Reports from survivors
are sketchy at best.

390
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,000
But what they all could agree
upon was there was a series of

391
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,000
grisly murders that ultimately
lead to a deadly stampede

392
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,160
when 400,000 kids try
to escape the festival at once.

393
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,880
Yeah, Ray and I just saw
a body in the woods

394
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,720
with a gaping hole in its chest.

395
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,040
We think that Nora did it.

396
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,600
- Well, that's a relief.
- It is?

397
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,560
Yeah, it means we're in the clear.

398
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,920
Look, it's not our fault
the Time Bureau let Nora escape.

399
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
Guys, come check this out.

400
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,280
Don't panic. I left Mick alone here.

401
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,480
He's itching to punch a hippie.

402
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
That's not good.

403
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,360
Is that what I think it is?

404
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,880
Twilight Sparkle come to life.

405
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You're a brony?

406
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
Dude, we're brony bros.

407
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Mick, join the herd!

408
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
Out of my way.

409
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

410
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,440
Well, it's not a dragon,
but it'll have to do.

411
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,160
Mick, hold on, it's not like
it's hurting anyone.

412
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,040
We didn't screw things up
for the better this year.

413
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
We screwed things up
for the more magical.

414
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
It's beautiful!

415
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, my God!

416
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
What!

417
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,880
Oh my God! Is it...

418
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,720
Yup, yup. It's eating her heart.

419
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm gonna be sick.

420
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,000
- Mick, shoot it.
- Shoot it!

421
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,520
Damn horse is fire-proof.

422
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,040
I hate glitter.

423
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
- Seriously?
- Where'd it go?

424
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,560
Okay, we can fix this

425
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,600
before the Time Bureau
even has to know about it.

426
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,040
Oh, really? Can we?

427
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,000
Look, Ava still thinks of me
as the woman

428
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,920
who saved the world
last year, and I don't

429
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,560
want her to know that there's
a whole new problem with history.

430
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,280
Yeah, that we basically created.

431
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,440
You go find the unicorn,

432
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,120
and I'll go find Constantine.

433
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,560
Yup. Every time.

434
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,320
{\an5}Somebody can't read bloody signs.

435
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,520
You don't know that there's
a "do not disturb" sign

436
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,720
on the bloody door?

437
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Sara.

438
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,360
Yeah, I can't talk right now, love.

439
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,800
I've got a threesome
that's about to pop off

440
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,760
in here with some contortionists.

441
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
You were right.

442
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
What was that now?

443
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,240
You were right!

444
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,240
There's a magical creature
at Woodstock. Now let's go!

445
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,720
You know, for someone
with a time traveling machine,

446
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,840
you seem to be in an awful hurry.

447
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,400
John, the unicorn
has already gored two hippies.

448
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,920
- A unicorn?
- Yeah.

449
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,680
Well, all right, I'm in.

450
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,200
But first, I need to know,

451
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,520
was any of your team
musked by the beast?

452
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,720
If that's what you're calling

453
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,640
its sparkle-sauce, then, yeah. Why?

454
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Oh, they're in for one hell
of a ride.

455
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,840
Man, I wish my dad could see us

456
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,720
now hunting a bloodthirsty
creature through Woodstock.

457
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,080
What's the beef between
you and your old man anyway?

458
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,320
- He hit you?
- No.

459
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,440
- Burn you?
- Nope.

460
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,800
Did he dress up like a clown
and scare the hell out of you?

461
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,040
What the hell, Mick? No.

462
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,600
He was emotionally unavailable
to me when I was growing up.

463
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,080
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

464
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,480
To the whole world,
my dad was this great

465
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,720
larger-than-life guy, but to me,

466
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
he was just cold.

467
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Hank?

468
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,160
What?

469
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
I'm not your dad!

470
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,800
Oh, so you're ashamed of me?

471
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,560
I'm sorry I didn't follow
in your footsteps and enlist.

472
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,920
But for your information,
I had a medal pinned to my chest,

473
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,360
only you don't have
the clearance to see it!

474
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,040
- What's happening?
- What?

475
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Axl?

476
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,720
I'm getting something off my chest.

477
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,080
And you know what, Hank?
It feels pretty good.

478
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,960
I just wish for once, you would
tell me you're proud of me

479
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,600
no matter what I do with my life.

480
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
You know what I'd say?

481
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
I love you.

482
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
I love you too.

483
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,560
Really?

484
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,720
I thought you were dead.

485
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,240
I thought you were dead
on the inside.

486
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,080
<i>I've been waiting for a long time</i>

487
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,880
Ray. Ray, my hand is glowing.

488
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,480
- Can you see it?
- No.

489
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,960
- It looks like your hand.
- No, no.

490
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,960
You got to open your eyes, man.

491
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,720
It's all around us.

492
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
What is?

493
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Love.

494
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,480
Oh, those hippies had the right idea.

495
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,400
Woodstock is beautiful.

496
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,400
- What's wrong, Ray?
- What?

497
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,960
You were hoping to see Nora here.

498
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,720
- You like her, Ray-Ray!
- No, no!

499
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,320
I do not like Nora.

500
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Because you love her.

501
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,720
No-oh, no!

502
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,880
The only reason I ever
want to see Nora Darhk again is

503
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,440
so that I can take
the Time Stone back

504
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,120
and I can lock her up
in the Time Bureau.

505
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,880
Oh, my God, she's here!

506
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,480
You know,
a unicorn is no bloody joke.

507
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,000
You might want to get your
ol' girlfriend on the blower.

508
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,920
You didn't tell Director Sharpe

509
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,440
that you let all the monsters
out to play, did you?

510
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,240
Ava and I are
in a great place right now.

511
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,920
Better than great.

512
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,360
In fact, she asked me to move
in with her, and I said yes.

513
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
So, why rock the boat
unless absolutely necessary?

514
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,400
Because when
the boat eventually tips,

515
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
- you'll both bloody drown.
- Nice.

516
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,800
I'm just trying to look after you,
love.

517
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,400
You and I are similar
we're both survivors.

518
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,000
But our survival
comes at a terrible cost.

519
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Look, you can take it
from a man who's caused nothing

520
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,240
but misery to everyone
he's ever loved.

521
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,280
Trust me, end it
with Ava before it's too late.

522
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,160
You ever think that you cause misery

523
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,000
not because of some romantic
"I was born to walk alone" crap,

524
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,440
but because you're an ass

525
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,680
who doesn't know
how to trust people?

526
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,280
You know, I trust

527
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
that people around me
get hurt, killed,

528
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,600
or far, far worse...

529
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,240
You think that I'm not scared?

530
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,160
That I don't know grief?

531
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,160
I'm not willing
to turn my back on life,

532
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,000
because that is exactly
what you're doing, John.

533
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,680
Our friends and family,
they don't make us weaker

534
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,200
they make us stronger.

535
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,360
You know what you need?

536
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,080
You need to be a part of a team.

537
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,920
You were saying?

538
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,280
This is King Solomon's
original grimoire...

539
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,320
The oldest magical textbook
in existence.

540
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,520
Now, if there's a spell
to quell our equine friend,

541
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
it'll be in here.

542
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,000
Well, not to pressure you,
but the entire fate of

543
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,880
the sexual revolution
is in the balance here.

544
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,840
It is my favorite revolution.

545
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,440
John! Welcome aboard.

546
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,320
Hey, Ray big-man!

547
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,800
Glad to see you're all back
from the land of milk and honey.

548
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,800
I'm still a little fuzzy
on how exactly we were

549
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
Roofied by a horse.

550
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,200
That beast sprays a powerful
mind-altering hallucinogen

551
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
to disarm its prey.

552
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,160
"How to expel a magical creature
from the mortal realm."

553
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,800
Now the ingredients
for this spell aren't so easy

554
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
to come by.

555
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,720
Don't suppose any
of you lot have the saliva

556
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,720
from a nine-fingered man, now do you?

557
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,600
You could chop off one of my pinkies.

558
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,920
No, Ray. Don't be the Giving Tree.

559
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,440
Now, as every Deadhead knows,

560
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,320
Jerry Garcia was missing
most of his middle finger

561
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,480
on his right hand
from a wood chopping accident.

562
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,520
Cool, so how do we get his saliva?

563
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,880
Jerry, my man!

564
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,040
Can I get a hit of that?

565
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,600
This doobie will make you fly.

566
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,400
Cool, cool.

567
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,560
Spin-move!

568
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Hey!

569
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Not cool.

570
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,680
We need the Protection Stone
of a powerful shaman.

571
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
Watch it...

572
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
<i>Go ask Alice</i>

573
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,400
<i>When she's ten feet tall</i>

574
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,760
Brother.

575
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,960
And the lock of a doomed woman.

576
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,360
<i>When the men on the chessboard</i>

577
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,120
<i>Get up and tell you where to go</i>

578
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,840
Janis, this is,
this is quite the honor.

579
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,240
Little robot man.

580
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,360
Hi.

581
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
My mom is a huge fan.

582
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Your mom?

583
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,040
And for our final ingredient...

584
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,760
<i>I think she'll know</i>

585
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,440
Quis virginem.

586
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
What?

587
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,520
A virgin.

588
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
A virgin, at Woodstock?

589
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,640
Good luck with that
this is the least celibate

590
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
place in history.

591
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Are you serious?

592
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,920
<i>Yeah, apparently virgins
are like catnip to unicorns</i>

593
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,480
and we need one to volunteer.

594
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,520
Rory, do you see any
virgins where you're at?

595
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,600
- No.
- Oh, come to think of it...

596
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,800
I do know one virgin.

597
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,560
No, not a chance.

598
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,960
- This feels wrong.
- Well don't worry, we'll be

599
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,640
watching from a short distance,
and you'll be... fine.

600
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,840
What am I supposed
to do with the pomegranate?

601
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,760
Oh, the unicorns,
they can't get enough of them, mate.

602
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,560
Yeah that, and human hearts.

603
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,920
So, the pomegranate is the bait?

604
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah, we wouldn't
put an interim member

605
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,000
of our team in jeopardy, right guys?

606
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,720
I'm an interim Legend?

607
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Well, then.

608
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,280
Oh, one more question,
are you sure that I'm a virgin

609
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,240
because that thing we did...

610
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Positive, mate.

611
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,920
Mr. Unicorn!

612
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,040
Come get this nice, juicy,
red pomegranate.

613
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,200
Admit it, this is
fun working with a team.

614
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,120
Well if ol' Gary gets eaten alive,

615
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,600
it only goes to prove my point.

616
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,000
People who care about us die.

617
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,320
- What was that?
- Oh, nothing mate.

618
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,080
You're golden, carry on, yeah?

619
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,920
Oh, hold it up... up a bit. More!

620
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,200
That's the money.

621
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,920
Come on, pretty pony.

622
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Come on, come on.

623
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,480
Enjoy your snack.

624
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,800
Oh, no, that's not
pomegranate juice, is it? Guys?

625
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,280
John, whatever
you're gonna do, do it now!

626
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,400
All right, here goes.

627
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,360
I don't wanna die a virgin!

628
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,560
Seriously,
you're meditating right now?

629
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,920
John, hurry!

630
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,240
Come on, John.

631
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,840
Help! Help!

632
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Help me!

633
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,000
Gary, are you okay?

634
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,520
- Just a scratch.
- Where'd the unicorn go?

635
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,960
Sent that bastard
straight to hell, didn't I?

636
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,760
Yup, folks, that is some
Grade A magic right there.

637
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,240
Maybe the Bureau will up our ratings.

638
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,840
People do love the supernatural.

639
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,040
Gary, you're like really bleeding.

640
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,120
The unicorn bit my nipple off!

641
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,320
Hey, maybe Gideon
can make you a new one.

642
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,160
Forget it, mate.
Come on, it's a badge of honor.

643
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,440
You see, my soul
is heading straight to hell,

644
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,560
but your nipple...
it just got there first, that's all.

645
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,920
It's like we're two birds
of the same, dark feather.

646
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,760
Yeah, yeah, that's right, mate.

647
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,600
Come on, let's grab a beer.

648
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,840
All right?

649
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,840
Now about this whole
virgin situation.

650
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Nathaniel...

651
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,120
I assumed you would
have left town by now.

652
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,800
Yeah, I decided
to stay a couple extra days.

653
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,560
Let me guess, you got fired
from whatever online college

654
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,200
you conned into hiring you.

655
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,200
Sweet burn, Hank, but...

656
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I was just...

657
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,480
wondering if you wanted
to have a beer with me?

658
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
We don't do that.

659
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,120
Maybe we should start.

660
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Wow, you're looking
a little glum there buddy.

661
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Just...

662
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,800
thinking about all the musicians
who died after Woodstock.

663
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,520
Janis Joplin overdosed in 1970,

664
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,080
sad and alone.

665
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,240
That's terrible, but this
is obviously about Nora.

666
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,720
When I gave her the Time Stone,
our hands touched,

667
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,720
and... I felt a spark.

668
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,440
Ray, Nora is...

669
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,720
Nora is like a unicorn,
beautiful and dangerous.

670
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,000
She is going to eat you alive.

671
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,520
I guess she and I are doomed.

672
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,680
There's something
I want to show you.

673
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Come on.

674
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay.

675
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,520
I don't understand.

676
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,440
What are we doing here?

677
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,400
That's my mom, and that's me.

678
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,920
We lived in D.C.

679
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,240
in 2018 before my brother was born.

680
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,440
It would be so easy, Ray...

681
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,320
to just walk over there
and tell her to get her

682
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,480
family and go to Canada
before everything changes

683
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,400
before this country
that she worked so hard to become

684
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,400
a citizen of betrays her.

685
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,400
You'd be changing your future.

686
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,400
You'd never meet us,
you'd never become a Legend.

687
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,240
Think of all the people you saved.

688
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,760
Yeah, I know. I know.

689
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,880
There's no loophole where I can
save my family, and not screw up

690
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,600
history, but that doesn't
mean I don't feel guilty every day

691
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,120
that I have the power
to change everything, and...

692
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
I do nothing.

693
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,240
I'm so sorry, Z.

694
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,960
Look at her, Ray.

695
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,160
How could anyone be afraid of her?

696
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,360
Hello!

697
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,040
Smells good in here.

698
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,600
Oh, yeah, I burned
the first chicken piccata,

699
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,240
but I think
I got the second one just right.

700
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,520
Those our medals?

701
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,640
I wanted to remind you of all
the good you did last year.

702
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,680
Yeah, we, we weren't that good.

703
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,080
Would you stop being
so hard on yourself, Sara?

704
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I'm proud of you.

705
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,240
When we freed Mallus,
we accidentally released

706
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,560
magical monsters into the world.

707
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,880
And I didn't want to tell you
because I love the idea

708
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,000
of us living together,
and I didn't want to risk that

709
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,200
or you thinking that maybe
I wasn't such a screw-up.

710
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,840
- I know.
- You do?

711
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,840
Gary was very proud
about losing a nipple.

712
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,800
- But you cooked dinner...
- Yeah!

713
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,160
Because I love you, you goober,
and nothing is gonna change that.

714
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,520
Even after I went behind your back

715
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,480
to work with Constantine
to send a unicorn to hell?

716
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,640
Okay, yeah, I wasn't
so crazy about that part.

717
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,320
Let's not talk about Constantine.

718
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,840
I'm crazy about you. Come here.

719
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,080
Stop being neurotic.

720
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,520
I don't think that you're a screw-up.

721
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,040
I think that you are a damn fine
Captain,

722
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,160
faced with some
extraordinary circumstances.

723
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,320
God, I love you.

724
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
And...

725
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,200
I got a question.

726
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Do we...

727
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,520
You and I, think that maybe right now

728
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,680
is not the best time
for me to move in?

729
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,160
You know that I want to
nothing would make me happier.

730
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,080
It's just...
I feel like I need to be out there.

731
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
With my team.

732
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
I understand.

733
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
But can you promise me
that our relationship will

734
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,920
continue to evolve, please?

735
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,400
I want this... you and me for real.

736
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
So do I.

737
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,680
We're gonna figure it out.

738
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
No.

739
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,520
I haven't even asked
you anything yet.

740
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,080
It's not even magic, love,
it's deduction.

741
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,640
You need me to join the Legends,

742
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,960
despite knowing that needing me

743
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,560
always causes somebody trouble.

744
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
What is up with you?

745
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,520
Something must have happened
in the last five months.

746
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,320
You're more miserable than usual.

747
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Look...

748
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,680
You and I are friends.

749
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,800
And I like friends.

750
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,000
Friends are useful, but roommates...

751
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,760
See, Sara, I would rather
bloody top myself

752
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
then move in with you lot.

753
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,200
See you around, John.

754
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,960
So long, Sara.

755
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,920
<i>One pill makes you larger</i>

756
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,280
<i>And another makes you small</i>

757
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,560
<i>And the pill that</i>

758
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,040
<i>Mother gives you</i>

759
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,720
<i>Don't do anything at all</i>

760
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,640
<i>Go ask Alice</i>

761
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
<i>When she's ten feet</i>

762
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
<i>Tall</i>

763
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,400
All right then, who are you?

764
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,600
Come on, who wants some?

765
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,480
'Cause I'm a nasty piece of work.

766
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,040
Get your bloody paws off me!

767
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,960
Oh, bollocks.
