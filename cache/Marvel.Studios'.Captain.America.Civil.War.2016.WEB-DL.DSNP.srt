Whatever form that takes,
I'm game.

If we can't accept
limitations,

if we're boundary-less...

This is the United Nations
we're talking about.

486

It's not the
World Security Council,

487
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,200
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D.,
it's not HYDRA.

488

No, but it's run by people

And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

Is that how
you see this?

955

It's internment, Tony.

Special Ops on this.

What happens when
the shooting starts?

1137
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,040
What, do you kill
Steve Rogers?

SECRETARY ROSS:
If we're provoked.

1139
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,240
Barnes would've been
eliminated

1140
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,920
in Romania
if it wasn't for Rogers.

1141
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,880
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

1142

Feel free to check my math.

1143
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,320
All due respect,
you're not gonna solve this

1144
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,680
with boys and bullets, Ross.

1145
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,960
You gotta let us
bring them in.

1146
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,040
How would that end any
differently than last time?

1147
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,240
Because this time,

1148
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,080
I won't be wearing loafers
and a silk shirt.

1149
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,160

My left arm is numb.
Is that normal?

1157
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,520
You all right?

1158
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,760
Always.

1159
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,120
36 hours. Jeez.

1160
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,320
We're seriously understaffed.

Oh, yeah.

It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now.
Any shot?

1163
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,360
You really think
he'd be on our side?

1164
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,600
No.

1165
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,960
I have an idea.

1166
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,560
Me, too. Where's yours?

1167
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,520
Downstairs.

1168
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,840

It's about time we met.

Yeah. Yeah.

Regarding the...

1185
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,560
You didn't even tell me
about the grant.

About the grant.
The September Foundation.

1187
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,360
Right.
Yeah.

1188
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,440

you applied?

1189

Yeah.

1190
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,200
I approved,
so now we're
in business.

1191
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,880
But you didn't
tell me anything.
What's up with that?

You keeping secrets
from me now?

I just know how much
you love surprises

so I thought I would
let you know...

Anyway, what did I apply for?

1196
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,320
That's what I'm here

Yeah, well,
we come in all shapes
and sizes, you know?

01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,720
This walnut date loaf
is exceptional.

Let me just stop you there.
Yeah.

1202

Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

it's pretty well funded.

talking to.

Sure.

Anyway, look, um,

1214
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,640
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

1215
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,440
Ah-ah! Me first.
Okay.

Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds,
40 miles an hour.

1222

That's not easy.
You got mad skills.

1223
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,240
That's all on YouTube,
though, right?

1224
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,840
That's where you found that?

1225
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,040
Because you know
that's all fake.

1226
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,160
It's all done
on the computer.

What is it?

01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,520
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,840
Exactly.

you're not.

01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,560
Nobody.

1246
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,960
Not even your unusually
attractive aunt?

1247
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,400
No. No.

1248
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,160
No! If she knew,
she would freak out.

1249
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,040
And when she freaks out,
I freak out.

1250

is really cool? This webbing.

is off the charts.

Adhesive gloves?

1256
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,520
It's a long story. I was...

1257
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,360
Lordy! Can you even
see in these?

1258
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,520
Yes, I can.

1259
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,840
I'm blind!

1260
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,400
I can see in those.

1261
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,480
Okay?

1262
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,920
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

1263
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,280
it's like my senses
have been dialed to 11.

1264
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,040
There's way too much input,

1265
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,120
so they just kinda
help me focus.

1266

You're in dire need
of an upgrade.

outta that twin bed

my whole life,

01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,600
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1276
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,240
Mmm-hmm.

1277
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,680
I read books,
I build computers.

1278
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,560
Yeah, I would love
to play football,

1279
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,200
but I couldn't then,
so I shouldn't now.

1280
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,960
Sure,
because you're different.

1281
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,560
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1282
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:15,040
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1283
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,360
and then the bad things
happen...

1284
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,000
they happen because of you.

1285

So you wanna look out
for the little guy,

1286

you wanna do your part?

a better place,
all that, right?

01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,320
Yeah, just looking out
for the little guy.

1289
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,960
That's what it is.

a driver's license.

1294
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,560
You ever been to Germany?
No.

1295
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,760
Oh, you'll love it.

1296
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,840
I can't go to Germany.
Why?

1297
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,560
I got homework.

1298
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,080
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

1299
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,280
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop
out of school.

1300
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,520
Might be
a little dangerous.

1301
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,480
Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm
taking you on a field trip.

1302
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,160
Don't tell Aunt May.

1303
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,120
All right,
Spider-Man.

1304
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,920
Get me out of this.

1305
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,200
Sorry. I'll get the...

01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,280
What is it?

1308
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,880
Stay here, please.

(GASPS)

1310
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,000
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1311
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,600
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

1312
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,320
Disappointing my kids.

1313
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,360
I'm supposed to go
waterskiing.

1314
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,640
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1315
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Clint!

1316
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,240
You should not be here.

1317
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,840
Really?

1318
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,080
I retire for, what,
like five minutes,

1319
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,200
and it all
goes to shit.

1320
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,760
Please consider
the consequences
of your actions.

1321
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,960
Okay, they're considered.

(GROANS)

1323
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,800
Okay, we gotta go.

1324
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,560
It's this way.

1325
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,920
I've caused
enough problems.

01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,960
You gotta help me, Wanda.

1328
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,840
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1329
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,160
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1330
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,240
Shit.

1331
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,280
(GROANS)

1332
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,400
I knew I should've stretched.

VISION: Clint,
you can't overpower me.

1335
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,520
I know I can't.

1336
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,680
But she can.

1337
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,280
Vision, that's enough.
Let him go.

1338
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,160
I'm leaving.

1339
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,480
I can't let you.

1340
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,840
I'm sorry.

1341
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,200
If you do this...

1342
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,640
they will never stop
being afraid of you.

1343
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,520
I can't control their fear,
only my own.

1344
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,920
CLINT: Oh...

1345
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,200
Come on. We got
one more stop.

1346
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,760
ATTACHE: It's just
a matter of time.

1347
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,680
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

1348
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,400
and behavioral pattern scans.

1349
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,120
Move or you will be moved.

1350
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,080
As entertaining
as that would be...

1351
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,400
You really think
you can find him?

1352
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,560
My resources are
considerable.

1353
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,120
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

1354
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,720
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1355
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,600
You know where they are.

1356
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,840
I know someone who does.

1357
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,040
Not sure you
understand the concept
of a getaway car.

1358
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,240
It's low profile.

1359
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,600
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1360
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,920
Can you move
your seat up?

1361
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,160
No.

1362
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,560
I owe you again.

1363
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,720
Keeping a list.

1364
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,640
You know, he kinda
tried to kill me.

1365
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,240
Sorry. I'll put it
on the list, too.

1366
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,840
They're going to come
looking for you.

1367
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,040
I know.

1368
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,040
Thank you, Sharon.

1369
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,600
That was...

1370
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:24,760
Late.

1371
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,920
Damn right.

1372
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,280
I should go.

1373
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:32,440
Okay.

1374
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,160

1375
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,400
You know I wouldn't
have called

1376
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,560
if I had any other choice.

1377
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,000
Hey, man,
you're doing me a favor.

1378
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,520
Besides, I owe a debt.

1379
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,240
Thanks for having
my back.

1380
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,920
It was time to
get off my ass.

1381
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,120
How about our
other recruit?

1382
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,840
He's rarin' to go.

1383
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,840

01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,200

your hand too long.

Jeez.

1394
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,520
Ah, look, I wanna say,

1395
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,680
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

Uh, good to see you.

01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,200
Look, what happened
last time when I...

It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

They tell you what
we're up against?

Something about
some psycho-assassins?

We're outside the law
on this one.

you're a wanted man.

Yeah, well, what else is new?

1406
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,000
We should get moving.

So, until they figure out

how to get this stuff
out of my head...

one of them find peace...
