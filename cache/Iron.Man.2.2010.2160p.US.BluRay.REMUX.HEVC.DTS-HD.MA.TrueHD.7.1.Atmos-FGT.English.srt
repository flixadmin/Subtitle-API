Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,

I may well not be an expert,

but you know who was the expert?

164
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,559
Your dad. Howard Stark.

Really a father to us all,

Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.

169

And yet he insists it's a shield.

He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,926
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

916
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,469
Now, if I didn't know better...

917
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,429
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

918
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:49,224
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

919
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,477
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

920
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,397
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

921
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,690
Is that possible?

922
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,401
Well, according to Mr. Stark's
database security guidelines,

923
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,362
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorized usage.

924
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,781
(SCOFFS)

925
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,909
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you? Uh-uh.

926
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,869
What do you want from me?

927
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:13,665
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

928
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,960
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the center of my universe.

929
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,088
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

930
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,214
Hit him.

931
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,510
(GROANS) Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

932
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,139
Could you please not do anything awful
for five seconds?

933
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,684
- What did she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

934
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,895
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

935
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,814
We're trying to get you back to work.

936
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,816
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

937
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,985
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

938
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,571
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

939
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,906
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

940
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,326
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

941
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:53,830
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

942
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:57,000
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

943
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:03,006
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.
Candygram.

944
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:11,222
HAMMER: I brought you something.
Oh, yeah.

945
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,558
- (BIRD SQUAWKS)
- (HAMMER CHUCKLING)

946
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,477
We got you the bird, pal!

947
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,895
This is not my bird.

948
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:20,690
What do you mean? That's the bird.
This is the bird. Yeah!

949
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:23,693
Pulled a lot of strings to get this bird.
This is a great bird.

950
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,488
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

951
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:29,032
- (POUNDS TABLE)
- Hey, man, this not my bird.

952
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:35,288
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

953
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:39,292
I mean, you know, look, don't get
so attached to things. Learn to let go.

954
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:40,752
(BIRD SQUAWKS)

955
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,923
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

956
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:48,802
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

957
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,310
Um...

958
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,855
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

959
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,983
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

960
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,653
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

961
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,446
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

962
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,825
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

963
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:15,328
See, Ivan?
He can't put his head in there. That's...

964
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,040
That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

965
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:22,502
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

966
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:25,004
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

967
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,674
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

968
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:31,302
People make problem.
Trust me. Drone better.

969
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:36,099
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

970
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,852
You said, "No problem."

971
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,855
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

972
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,607
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

973
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,651
Like Iron Man. You understand?

974
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,988
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

975
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,157
Hey, man.

976
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,996
Don't get too attached to things.
Learn to let go.

977
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,794
These drones
better steal the show, Ivan.

978
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,840
You understand?
Better rock my world, Ivan.

979
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:23,229
Unbelievable.
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

980
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:26,691
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

981
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,986
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

982
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:32,405
Sir?

983
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,241
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

984
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,868
We'd like this to introduce it.

985
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,578
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

986
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,456
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

987
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,584
- We've got to make this happen.
- Yes, General, but...

988
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,669
It's also an order.

989
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,379
Yes, sir.

990
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,466
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

991
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,927
Thank you, sir.

992
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,811
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

993
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:05,813
No, it was finished.

994
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:09,609
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturized it and put it in my...

995
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,361
No. Howard said the arc reactor

996
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,112
was the stepping-stone
to something greater.

997
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:17,742
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

998
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,037
He was on to something big,
something so big

999
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,956
that it was gonna make
the nuclear reactor

1000
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,874
look like a triple-A battery.

1001
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,627
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

1002
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,797
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

1003
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,924
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

1004
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,260
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

1005
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:37,220
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

1006
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,013
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

1007
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,808
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fueled rage.

1008
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,477
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

1009
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:48,731
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

1010
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,400
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

1011
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,610
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

1012
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:57,073
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

1013
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,158
to finish what he started.

1014
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,827
- He said that?
- Mm-hmm.

1015
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,538
Are you that guy? Hmm? Are you?

1016
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:08,918
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

1017
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,674
I don't know
where you get your information,

1018
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,843
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

1019
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,386
What do you remember about your dad?

1020
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,263
He was cold, he was calculating.

1021
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,099
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me.

1022
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,767
So it's a little tough for me to digest

1023
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,312
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

1024
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,772
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

1025
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,691
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

1026
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,276
was when he shipped me off
to boarding school.

1027
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,444
That's not true.

1028
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,196
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

1029
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:41,284
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1030
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,535
What?

1031
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,163
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1032
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,789
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

1033
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,625
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

1034
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,418
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

1035
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:53,921
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

1036
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:56,924
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

1037
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:58,676
Oh, and Tony,

1038
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:03,097
remember, I got my eye on you.

1039
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,981
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

1040
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:13,858
Good luck.

1041
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,197
Please.

1042
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,992
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

1043
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,244
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

1044
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,914
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

1045
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,667
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorized by Director Fury

1046
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,002
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

1047
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,922
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

1048
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,092
I will tase you and watch <i>Supernanny</i>
while you drool into the carpet.

1049
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,552
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

1050
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,513
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

1051
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:14,544
- Think this is the power source?
- Major, this is not a scientific exercise.

1052
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,587
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

1053
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,840
Yes, sir.

1054
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:20,550
HAMMER: Oh, yes!

1055
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,929
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday?

1056
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:28,266
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?

1057
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,309
(SIGHING REVERENTLY) Oh!

1058
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:34,397
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

1059
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,650
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

1060
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,235
What am I going to do for you?

1061
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:42,363
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

1062
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:45,450
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

1063
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,869
I'm talking about firepower.

1064
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,455
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

Too downtown? I agree.

1068
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,383
M24 shotgun, pump action.

1069

Five-round magazine.

1070
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,679
You know what? You're not a hunter.
What am I talking about?

1071
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,972
I'm getting rid of it.

1072
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,558
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

1073
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,351
They do make something
better than waffles.

1074
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:15,855
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

1075
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,148
so I'm gonna put it right here.

1076
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,443
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

1077
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,362
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

1078

You're tough.

1079
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,533
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

1080
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,285
Don't let anyone tell you different.

1081
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,955
This is an M1 347.62 Minigun.

1082
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,501
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

1083
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,711
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho,

1084
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:41,172
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

1085
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,259
Okay.

1086
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:50,598
These are the Cubans, baby.
These are the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

1087
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,560
This is a kinetic-kill,
side-winder vehicle

1088
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:58,815
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

1089
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:03,027
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

1090
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,279
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

1091
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:08,699
A book that would make <i>Ulysses</i>
look like it was written in crayon.

1092
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,660
It would read it to you.

1093
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,787
This is my Eiffel Tower.

1094
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,957
This is my Rachmaninoff's <i>Third.</i>
My <i>Pietà.</i>

1095
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,126
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

1096
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:23,923
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

1097
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,926
I call it the Ex-Wife.

1098
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:33,975
That's the best I got.

1099
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,731
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

1100
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:44,819
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
- I think I'll take it.

1101
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:47,738
- Which one?
- All of it.

1102
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:50,575
All of it.
