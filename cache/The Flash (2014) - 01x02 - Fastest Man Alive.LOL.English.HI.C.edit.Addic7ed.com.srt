1
00:00:01,393 --> 00:00:03,360
My name is Barry Allen.

2
00:00:03,362 --> 00:00:05,762
I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:07,397
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,132
I saw a ball of lightning.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,401
Inside the lightning there was a man.

6
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:12,769
He killed my mom.

7
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:14,438
I swear to God I didn't do this.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,139
- Where's mom?
- What happened that night

9
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,541
was impossible.

10
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:20,043
Then an accident made me the impossible.

11
00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:23,280
- [Gasps]
- You were in a coma.

12
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,348
- For how long?
- Nine months.

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,217
Your muscles should be atrophied,

14
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,785
but instead they're in a state
of cellular regeneration.

15
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:31,021
I wasn't the only one affected, was I?

16
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:35,192
We've been searching for
other meta humans like yourself.

17
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:37,194
All my life I've wanted to do more.

18
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:40,063
And the first chance I get
to help someone, I screw up.

19
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:42,432
The good you do must far outweigh the bad.

20
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:44,568
You're not gonna be in here much longer.

21
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,204
Whoever killed mom,
I think I finally have a way

22
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:48,538
to find them.

23
00:00:51,142 --> 00:00:53,076
This is the part where
I'm supposed to do the whole

24
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:54,411
intro thingy.

25
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:56,179
Barry Allen, fastest man alive...

26
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,614
But you know all that already.

27
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:59,216
All right, let's get to the good stuff.

28
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:00,884
You see that smoke? That's a fire

29
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:04,254
on Western and 3rd
in downtown Central City.

30
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,990
And that blur? That's me on my way to it.

31
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,759
I'm going 352 miles an hour.

32
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:12,362
And it's a slow day.

33
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,763
This is Ladder 52.

34
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:15,265
We're still at least two minutes out.

35
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,600
People are gonna die in there.

36
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:19,169
I know.

37
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,004
Barry?

38
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:23,974
Barry!

39
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:25,242
What? Did I miss it?

40
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:27,477
You overshot by about six blocks.

41
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,678
[Sighs]

42
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,514
My bad.

43
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:31,948
Paige!

44
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,184
My daughter! Has anyone seen my daughter?

45
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:37,087
Paige! Whoa!

46
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:39,322
You there yet?

47
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:42,325
What are you doing?

48
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:43,426
Nothing.

49
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:45,028
Who were you talking to?

50
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,263
- No one.
- Are you talking to Barry?

51
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:47,998
- Who?
- Barry Allen?

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,966
Struck by lighting?
Was in a coma for nine months?

53
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,502
Woke up being able to run
faster than the speed of sound?

54
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:53,770
- Ring a bell?
- No.

55
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:55,205
Haven't talked to him.

56
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,007
Cisco, there's fire everywhere!

57
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,910
Cisco, are you still there?

58
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,278
Mom?

59
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,246
Mommy!

60
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:11,021
- Whoa!
- Mommy!

61
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,326
[Siren wails]

62
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,597
Everybody's out.

63
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,165
What else you got for me, Cisco?

64
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,834
Barry, it's Caitlin.

65
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:28,171
Hey, Caitlin.

66
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:29,506
How's your day?

67
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:32,676
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs. Now.

68
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:34,144
On my way.

69
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:39,182
[Exhales] Oh.

70
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,520
Have you both lost your minds?

71
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,322
Who do you think you are?

72
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:47,691
Well, I'm the eyes and ears,
and he's the feet.

73
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:48,992
This isn't funny.

74
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,061
You could have gotten yourself killed.

75
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:52,596
You can't be running around the city

76
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:53,697
like some supersonic fireman.

77
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,532
Why not?

78
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:58,001
This is what we talked about:
me using my speed to do good.

79
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:00,170
We talked about you helping us contain

80
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:01,605
other people who might have been affected

81
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:03,273
by the particle accelerator explosion.

82
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:04,941
Meta-humans.

83
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:07,744
And aside from Clyde Mardon,
we haven't found any.

84
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:09,713
People in this city still need help.

85
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:11,247
- [Sighs]
- And I can help them.

86
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,216
We can help them.

87
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,051
Will you please say something?

88
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:16,653
I think what Caitlin is saying,

89
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,155
in her own spectacularly angry way,

90
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,624
is that we are just beginning to understand

91
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:22,392
what your body is capable of.

92
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,961
Not to sound like a broken
record, Mr. Allen...

93
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:26,963
I do caution restraint.

94
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,732
Dr. Wells...

95
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:32,302
I doubt restraint is how you got
to be the man you are today.

96
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,437
In a wheelchair and a pariah.

97
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,309
Lack of restraint
is what made me these things.

98
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:43,113
Know your limits.

99
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,714
Don't expect me to patch you up

100
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:47,584
every time you break something.

101
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,452
Hey, uh... Anything happen out there today?

102
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:51,221
The sensors in the suit were kicking back

103
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:54,724
some weird telemetry, like your
vitals spiked for a few seconds.

104
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:56,259
Never felt better.

Hey, Joe, everything all right?

108
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,201
Great. I got a fresh crime scene...

109
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,469
A dead body...

110
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,138
Detectives interviewing witnesses...

111
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,340
miles of that yellow tape
stretched over everything.

112
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:12,676
I'm only missing one thing.
Can you guess what that is?

113
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:15,178
I'll be right there.

114
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,781
My day job beckons.

115
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,185
When do you think he'll realize

116
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:24,220
he didn't take his clothes?

117

[Indistinct police chatter]

at least six Glock 19s

Oh. [Nervous laugh]

I was going so fast this
morning, I didn't even notice.

but it was six guys.

Look, the tracks.
They're all crossing each other.

is truly remarkable.

I've always had
a very simple set of beliefs.

Gravity makes things fall.
Water makes things wet.

the fastest man could
run a mile in four minutes.

00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:46,029
Go on back to your room.

168
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,263
I want to see my dad.

169
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,032
I already said no, Barry.

170
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,367
He didn't do those things.
He didn't hurt my mom.

171
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,136
I was there that night. I saw.

172
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,804
- There was a man.
- Yeah, I know.

173
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:57,640
We've gone through this already.

174
00:06:57,642 --> 00:07:01,444
Then why can't I go see him?

175
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:03,513
Because I said so.

176
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:06,049
You're not my father!
You can't tell me what to do!

177
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,318
Right now, I am the only adult
that gives a damn

178
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,554
what happens to you, so yes,
I can tell you what to do.

179
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,722
Now go to your room.

180
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,225
I hate you!

181
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,432
[Exhales]

182
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,067
This is all of your fault.

183
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,535
I could have taken European folklore

184
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:01,504
to cover my sociology requirement, but no.

185
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:03,439
You said, "take journalism, Iris."

186
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,974
Reporters have all of the fun."

187
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:07,043
Guess what, Barry?
Reporters have none of the fun.

188
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,078
Journalism is boring. I'm bored.

189
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,748
I blame you. What?

190
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,950
Why are you staring at me like that?

191
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,586
You look really nice.

192
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:17,987
Thanks.

193
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:20,390
Why don't you look nice?

194
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:22,292
This afternoon? Suit and tie?

195
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,793
The university is giving Simon Stagg...

196
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,662
- Simon Stagg.
- Some big award.

197
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:27,430
- And you agreed...
- To explain the science stuff

198
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:29,732
for your article.
It's all coming back to me now.

199
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:32,101
How fast can you get home and change?

200
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:33,970
Uh, pretty fast.

201
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,405
Hey, Allen.

202
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:36,773
Joe asked me to see where you're at

203
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,608
on the evidence
from the gun store shooting.

204
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,742
Oh, hey, Iris.

205
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:41,244
Detective.

206
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,048
Please, guys, uh, just kiss already.

207
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,617
I already know, remember?

208
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,891
Ah. Thanks for being so cool
about this, Barry.

209
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:57,994
I know it's not easy keeping a big secret.

210
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,963
[Sighs] I'm getting used to it.

211
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:05,668
[Applause]

212
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,170
I find it quite remarkable,

213
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,372
having once been a timid freshman

214
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:10,606
at Central City University,

215
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,608
to be standing before you now,

216
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,377
the regents choice for man of the year.

217
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:17,213
While I very much appreciate the award,

218
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:18,481
the real honor for me is knowing that

219
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:20,950
my work in organ transference

220
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:23,319
helps give people a second chance at life.

221
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:25,888
Thank you all very much for coming.

222
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,859
Okay. All right, first things first...

223
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,327
Simon Stagg's work in cellular cloning

224
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:32,862
has led to huge advancements

225
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,497
in the future of organ replacement...

226
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:36,032
Are journalists allowed
to drink on the job?

227
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,533
Okay. If you are bored already,

228
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,835
just wait till we get to the science behind

229
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:41,070
cellular regeneration.

230
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:42,872
I have missed this, Barry.

231
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,674
I feel like we haven't spent
any quality time together

232
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:46,376
since you woke up from the coma.

233
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,778
Yeah, I've had a crazy few weeks, I know.

234
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,015
I thought maybe you'd been
avoiding me because of Eddie.

235
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:54,350
I know you think it's wrong,
me dating my dad's partner,

236
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:55,352
- and I just...
- No.

237
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:58,955
That is not it. At all.

238
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,857
Oh! Oh!

239
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,358
Mr. Stagg, I was wondering if
I could get a quote from you

240
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,027
for my article. Not now, miss.

241
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:07,497
- I'll just make something up.
- [Laughs]

242
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,365
So... What were you gonna tell me?

243
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:12,001
You looked like
you were about to say something.

244
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,736
Yeah... [Gunshots]

245
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:17,673
- [Grunts]
- Ah!

246
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:19,942
Quiet down! All of you!

247
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:20,944
Oh, my God.

248
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:23,312
Quiet!

249
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:24,981
How considerate!

250
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:27,784
You're all wearing your finest jewelry!

251
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:31,821
Almost like you knew
we were coming to rob you!

252
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:33,823
Now everybody line up!

253
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:41,497
Don't. Don't.

254
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,000
Freeze!

255
00:10:46,904 --> 00:10:48,905
D-d-drop your weapons!

256

Barry.

258

Barry.

259
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,136
Barry!

260
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,704
I turned around and you were gone.

261
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:24,707
What happened? Are you okay?

262
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,876
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I...

263
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:29,045
I went after them to
try and get the plates.

264
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:30,913
- Wha...?
- And I...

265
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:32,715
I fainted.

266
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:41,390
- Hi.
- Iris.

267
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:42,458
Where were you?

268
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,759
Dad, go easy.

269
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:45,895
I found him outside. He fainted.

270
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,396
You want me to get you a paramedic, Allen?

271
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:49,532
No, I'm fine. Thanks, Eddie.

272
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,800
I thought I was dead.

273
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:53,069
I saw the gun go off, and then... boom.

274
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:54,837
Suddenly I'm outside.

275
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,006
I have no idea how I got there.

276
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,075
Let me talk to you for a second.

277
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:02,278
Yeah.

278
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,113
You chased those gunmen, didn't you?

279
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:05,615
Yeah, they must be the same guys

280
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,250
that knocked over the gun shop
earlier today.

281
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:10,286
And what were you going to do
when you caught them?

282
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:11,621
Huh?

283
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:13,156
Ask them nicely to pull over?

284
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:14,991
You're not bulletproof.

285
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:16,692
Wait. Are you?

286
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,794
- No, but...
- Okay.

287
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:20,096
No more heroics.

288
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:21,631
Chasing bad guys is not your job.

289
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:24,033
It's mine. You're not a cop.

290
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,668
Promise me.

291
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,203
Promise.

292
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,105
And you know Iris is not stupid.

293
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:32,408
Start making better excuses
than "I fainted."

294
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,509
I...

295
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:35,311
You lied to us.

296
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,580
How could you not tell us you're
experiencing dizzy spells?

297
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,348
We're your doctors.

298
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,250
God knows what's going on inside your body.

299
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,252
Your cells are in a constant state of flux.

300
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:45,955
You could be experiencing
cardiopulmonary failure

301
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:49,158
or a transient ischemic attack.

302
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,360
Mini stroke. Probably not.

303
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:55,131
You of all people should know
that in science, we share.

304
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,366
We do not keep secrets.

305
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:00,937
Wow... I haven't seen anyone

306
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:04,373
make her that angry since Ronnie.

307
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,175
Ronnie was Caitlin's fiance?

308
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:08,678
The one that died the night of
the accelerator explosion?

309
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,180
Yeah. He is...

310
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:13,182
missed.

311
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:14,817
Now...

312
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:17,520
Let's figure out why
this is happening to you.

313
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:20,189
We're all set.

314
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:22,758
A little padding. Just in case.

315
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,026
Yeah.

316
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:31,200
You're sure about this, Cisco?

317
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,736
Most home treadmills have a
maximum speed of about

318
00:13:33,738 --> 00:13:35,171
12 miles per hour.

319
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:37,340
This one has been Cisco'ed.

320
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:40,142
Trust me. It can handle your speed.

321
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:42,044
Okay.

322
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:53,656
Heart rate, blood pressure,
nerve conduction all normal.

323
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,057
For Barry.

324
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,525
Brainwave function within standard limits.

325
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:59,195
[Laughs] I told you
the treadmill could take it.

326
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:00,396
Caitlin.

327
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,632
Look at the glucose levels.

328
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,133
Oh, my God. Of course.

329
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,234
- Right?
- It was so obvious.

330
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:06,269
Glucose levels. Barry!

331
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,004
We think we know why you keep...

332
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,741

333
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,381
Barry!

334
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:40,303
Where's Barry?

335
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:43,105
Taking a shower.

336
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,241
At three o'clock in the afternoon?

337
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,476
If I go up those stairs,
am I gonna see Barry Allen?

338
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:50,379
Or are you gonna be grounded
for a week for lying to me?

339
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:51,747
I'm sorry, Daddy.

340
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:54,750
But don't worry. I know where he went.

341
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:57,219
Me too.

342
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,231
[Groans] I passed out again?

343
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,566
Total metabolic failure

344
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:12,835
brought on by acute hypoglycemia.

345
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:14,170
I'm not eating enough.

346
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,204
So an I.V. bag and I'm good to go?

347
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,707
[Chuckles]

348
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,275
Try 40.

349
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:20,843
Guess you were thirsty.

350
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:22,111
We're gonna need to fashion you a new diet

351
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,779
based on your metabolic changes.

352
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,048
I've done a few calculations.
You need to consume

353
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,552
an amount equal to roughly 850 tacos.

354
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,154
Unless we're talking cheese and guac,

355
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,290
which is like a whole other
set of equations.

356
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,292
For Mexican, I recommend Tito's.

357
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:38,527
On Bruckner Avenue?

358
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:39,695
Best burrito in the city.

359
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:41,163
Detective West.

360
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:44,834
What brings you to S.T.A.R. Labs?

361
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:46,736
When I couldn't find you at your lab,

362
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,138
I started doing a little research.

363
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,609
Turns out there's been reports
of a red streak around the city,

364
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:56,679
stopping muggers, rescuing
people from burning buildings.

365
00:15:56,681 --> 00:16:01,384
You didn't tell him
we were working together?

366
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:03,018
Joe, I can explain.

367
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,789
You already have a job
in law enforcement, Barry.

368
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,524
I suggest you get back to it.

369
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:10,726
Mm-hmm.

370
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:12,561
Don't look at me. I'm on your side.

371
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:13,963
Detective.

372
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,231
We all want what's best for Barry.

373
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,299
If you wanted what was best for Barry,

374
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:19,068
you'd try to talk him out of this lunacy

375
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,837
instead of encouraging him going
out there risking his life.

376
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,508
You saw a man control the weather.

377
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,578
What are the police gonna do
against someone like that?

378
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,213
Since the accelerator explosion

379
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:34,250
we suspect there may be more like him.

380
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:35,584
And you're gonna do what?

381
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:37,219
Catch them?

382
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,788
Are you insane?

383
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,223
You think because you can run real fast

384
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:43,559
that you're invincible? You're not!

385
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,227
You're just a kid.

386
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:48,597
My kid.

387
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:52,468
I'm not your kid, Joe.

388
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,037
And you're not my father.

389
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,375
My father's sitting in Iron Heights.

390
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:02,244
Wrongfully convicted.

391
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:03,946
You were wrong about him.

392
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:06,115
And you're wrong about this.

393
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:07,950
Now I may not be able to help him,

394
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:10,753
but if I can save someone
from a burning building

395
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:13,856
or stop some armed thieves,
I'm gonna do it.

396
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,859
And you can't stop me.

397
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,294
So don't try.

398
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:28,137
You think you're so smart.

But you don't know what you don't know.

401
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:36,612
And I hope that you're clever
enough to figure it out

402
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:38,614
before somebody gets killed.

403
00:17:57,033 --> 00:18:00,102
Where's the rest of your crew?

404

It's not my fault you and
your team moved too slow.

409
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:10,346
I told you where Stagg would be,
not how long he'd be there.

00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:11,914
I need his full itinerary.

411
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,250
And security access to his office and home.

412
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:15,918
Screw you.

413
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,887
I've got a reputation
in the security business.

414
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,755
It's one thing if my employer gets iced.

415
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:22,358
It's another if it happens in his bedroom.

416

You'll do what I ask, Mr. Java.

417

do to me without your army?

Simon Stagg's head of security
was murdered last night.

423
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:21,951
The coroner took some skin samples.

424
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,419
Hopefully they belong to the killer.

425
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:25,054
See if you can find a match.

426
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:26,255
Can't be a coincidence that Stagg's benefit

427
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:27,623
was attacked last night.

428
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,224
I'm going to interview Stagg now.

429

- I'll come with you.
- Your job is in here.

You were supposed to meet me at Jitters

to give me some scientific
background for my article.

a new article topic in 24 hours

There was a murder last night.

These skin cells belong to the murderer,

463
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:38,494
but these cells are naive.

464

someone wants to kill me?

Well, we're not sure, Mr. Stagg, but...

00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:05,247
Not now, Barry. An armed gunman
is shooting up Stagg Industries.

00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:07,216
Joe's there.

00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:54,976
Even the other night when those robbers

662
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,044
shot at the security guard,

663
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:58,380
he said he was whooshed outside.

664
00:30:58,382 --> 00:31:01,216
Something out there is saving people.

665
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:02,384
I thought you were taking journalism.

666
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:04,152
Not science fiction writing.

667

Ever since I have known you

668

you have believed in the impossible.

Look, I told you I'm through.

673
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,232
I know, but you need
to get to S.T.A.R. Labs

674
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:19,301
right now.

675
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:29,978
- Barry, it's okay.
- It is not okay.

676
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,947
Black is here, and he's just...
Standing there.

677
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:34,783
That's not him, is it?

678
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:36,651
It's one of his replicates.

679
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:38,053
How did you get it?

680
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:40,622
I grew him.

681
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:43,258
I isolated a sample of
Black's blood from you suit

682
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,660
to see if I could trigger the
in vitro cultivation process

683
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:47,662
and learn how Black multiplies.

684
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:50,432
So I exposed the target cells to
a protein gel,

685
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:52,233
and they began replicating...

686
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:53,301
Into that.

687
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:54,303
Why isn't he...

688
00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:56,404
It doing anything?

689
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:57,972
We did a brain scan.

690
00:31:57,974 --> 00:32:00,375
Involuntary motor functions
are active, little else.

691
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,910
We think it's acting as a receiver.

692
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:04,846
The clones are an
empty shell without Black.

693
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:06,181
Shut down the real Black,

694
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:08,283
and you might shut them all down.

695
00:32:08,285 --> 00:32:10,151
But how do we know which one's
the real Danton Black?

696
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:12,287
That occurred to me
given your own passing out.

697
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,955
Black has limits, just like you.

698
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:15,657
Controlling all of those clones

699
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,993
must require a tremendous amount
of physical strength.

700
00:32:18,995 --> 00:32:22,430
So, look for the one showing
signs of weakness or fatigue.

701
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:23,432
He's the prime.

702
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:24,999
Just a theory...

703
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,968
But one you might want to put to
the test, Mr. Allen.

704
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,337
Plus, I whipped up these

711
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:42,283
The prime.

712
00:32:42,285 --> 00:32:43,618
My guess is, the prime is on the move.

713
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,986
This one heard the summons to battle.

714
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:46,721
And I know where he was summoned to.

Beyond me.

720

Maybe way beyond them, too.
