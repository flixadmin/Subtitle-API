What are we supposed to do with this?

159
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,084
Bullet-proof pants.

160
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,337
I suggest that you wear them.

161

Thank you, agent Murphy,

With gaviria
there will be a future

165
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,274
[Steve] César gaviria was riding
a wave of public support

166
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,318
for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.

167
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,074
But we had a target of our own:
José Rodriguez gacha,

168
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:29,703
who we tracked to cartagena
through one of our informants.

169
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:39,379
[Gacha in Spanish] Have you heard
of this thing called a computer?

170
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,842
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.

171
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:49,306
[Boy] It's a new kind of technology
that's coming out.

172
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,559
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, dad.

173
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,897
Hey, honey.

174
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,069
You look very beautiful today.

175
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:08,784
Relax, baby. Relax.
We don't bite. [Chuckles]

- I want you.

177
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,501
- [Gacha] Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.

178
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,339
I want to fuck her.

179
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:26,468
We have more important things
to worry about right now, my son.

180
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,848
Talk to me. What do you know?

181
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,810
Don gonzalo,
we have people all over the property.

182
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,228

about medellin?

00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,614
The same, boss.

186
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,785
Carrillo's entire search bloc
is out looking for Pablo.

187
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,245
[Gacha] Thank you, navegante.

188
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,373
- Here to serve, boss.
- — keep us safe.

Don Freddy.

190
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,174
Son... a question.

191
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,512
Are we sheep or are we wolves?

192
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,975
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves! Right.

193
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,560
I like it.

194
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:22,941
[Navegante in Spanish] They're in
a house outside of cartagena, right here.

195
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,820
Just know there are
a lot of people guarding him.

196
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:32,033
Navegante, you've been
working for gacha for many years.

197
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:36,037
I'm sure in that time you've
earned way more than we are giving you.

198
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,499
So tell me,
why do you want to betray him?

199
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,130
That fucker's crazy.

200
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,758
He's gonna get us all killed.

201
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,313
I don't believe him one bit.

202
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,107
What do you care
why he's doing it?

203
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:09,321
Because we have 23 agents with
outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.

204
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:13,575
And he has twice as many men
with brand new weapons.

205
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,368
And frankly...

206
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:19,873
I'm tired of sending young men
to face certain death.

207
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,083
So then we have to be smart.

208
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,254
We have to create a trap.

209
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,924
If we catch him alive,
he'll give us Escobar.

210
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,508
And the ochoas.

211
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:34,346
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.

212
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,764
I want him dead.

213
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,974
He doesn't care about death.

214
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,144
He only fears rotting in jail.

215
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,441
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.

216
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:51,363
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?

217
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,240
These aren't your men.

218
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,659
You have no family here to lose.

219
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,245
If this goes badly, there will be
more widows and orphans,

220
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,498
and I'll have to carry that
on my shoulders.

221
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,256
I trust his information.

222
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,302
And I trust you.

223
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:20,100

It'll be on your conscience.

Who's this guy?

227
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,461
I don't know, but if poison
showed his face to pick him up,

228
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,171
he must be really important.

Here's your payment, sir.

It'll be taken to the coast of Spain
on a cargo ship.

231
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:04,311
From there, our trucks
will take it to the basque country.

[Gustavo] What's that?

235
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,580
As far as I know, you and my cousin
have an agreement.

236
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,999
The agreement is for this amount.

238

5,000 kilos or no deal.

239
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,718
Then there is no deal. Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?

00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,850
Forgive my cousin, sir.

5,000 it is, then.

Gaviria's life was on the line...

My wife was with Colombia's

and my partner was in cartagena.

He had his own mission,
with a group of cops

00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:10,186
who had seen their friends and relatives
die at the hands of gacha.

- Yes, sir.

where, when and how?

[In English] I appreciate your concern,
madam ambassador,

doesn't know that?

Yes, I know.

410
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:29,662
But tell me, agent Murphy,
how do you expect him to win the election

411

if he hides like a scared rabbit
behind all this violence?
