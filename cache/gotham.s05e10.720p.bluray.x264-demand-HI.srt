However, I'm afraid
this process

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,920
will be agonizing
and, unfortunately,

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,279

Just 'cause we rebuild
some bridges

50
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,757
doesn't mean things are
gonna suddenly improve.

So, uh, future got you spooked?

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,039
(sighs) Yeah, I guess.

53

Can't say I understand.

Eh, good work.
Hope it's not wasted.

All joking aside.

70

We're here because of you.
Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,315
And you're gonna be a father.
That's a future I'll take.

72
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,113
Over the past year,

73
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,919
you've all done good work.

74
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,396
We've made Gotham a safe place
for kids and families.

75
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,475
We've given people the food
and medicine they needed.

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,674
But it's not over yet.

77
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,953
So, no matter what
General Wade says today,

78
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,033
the work continues.

79
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,111
Give yourselves
one more round of applause.

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,713
And get back to work.

81
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,830

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,278
Nice to finally
meet you in the flesh.

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,592
General,
welcome to Gotham.

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,792
Good that you've reestablished
some semblance

87
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,200
Seems like
the Green Zone

88
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,477
stretches to every corner
of the island.

89
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,879
General, Wayne Labs
show toxicity levels

90
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,000
way below the threshold
the government set for us.

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,520
All due respect,
Mr. Wayne,

92
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,080
but I got to go with what
my people tell me on this.

93

94

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,029

It can't possibly
make that big a difference.

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,256
It's only the difference
between getting off this island

99
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,873
or sinking to the bottom
of the river.

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,760
Well, then Pengy can off-load
a few of his knickknacks.

101
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,195
Not a chance.

102
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,394
Because you know what's worth
its weight in gold?

103
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,678
- Gold.
- Ah!

107
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,354
Go to the clinic.
Go have your baby.

108
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,040
What? So the two of you
can hightail it

109
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,197
off this rock without me?
I don't think so.

110
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,398
I assure you we will not
launch without you.

111
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,199
Ed and I will finish
making preparations

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,829
and we will be ready to launch
the moment you get back here

113
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,997
with that little bundle of joy.

114
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,559
Or unless I should
drive you to the clinic

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,234
in light of your
delicate condition?

116
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,869
I can do it.
I'm not that delicate.

117
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,716
Remember that
if you even think

118
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,474
about double-crossing me.

119
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,256
It's very kind of you
to offer to drive her.

120
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,112
I knew she would
never accept my help.

121
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,456
Should I start the engine?

122
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,834
One less passenger
to worry about.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,320
Oh, two, actually.

124
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,319
You are so right.

125
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,074
(chuckles)

126
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,031
(gasps, chuckles)

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Found it.

128
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,080
Ah, well done, Miss Kyle.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,195
All right, let's have a look.

130
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,873
Uh, here we are.

131
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,117
Oh, so this guy's the architect
who designed Wayne Manor?

132
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,475
Yes, right.

133
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,277
With the reunification,
a new Wayne Manor must follow.

134
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,632
And it'll be just
like the old one?

135
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,476
Oh, nothing is
just like it was.

136
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,878
So why are we looking
at the old plans?

137
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,434
Perhaps I'm not ready
to let go of the past.

138
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,640
Well, if it makes
you feel better,

139
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,155
I wish I could
blow up my past.

140
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,360
Well, maybe you will.

141
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,096
One day, when you
build something new,

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,555
the past will always
be part of it.

143
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,870
As for me,

144
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,833
now Master Bruce is grown,

145
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,349
building a new manor might be
my last great service to him.

146
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
A home.

147
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,195
And then what?

148
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,400
You retire?

149
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
No.

150
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,990
I will stand guard,
as I've always done.

151
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,034
I thought this was all settled.

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
This is bull.

153
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,834
My results are
accurate, Jim.

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,320
BULLOCK: <i>We don't know this general.
Maybe he's with Walker.</i>

155
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,512
Let's not get carried away.
Bruce, go and check on the tech.

156
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,276

157
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,556

THOMPKINS:
<i>It's Lee.</i>

160
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Everything okay?

161
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,915

You're kidding.

164
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,040
THOMPKINS:
<i>You better come quick.</i>

165
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,875
Are you okay?

166
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,598
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,998
<i>I'll try to get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

168
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
<i>Try to.</i>

169
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,592
Um... try to wait for me.

170
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,477
It doesn't really work that way.

171
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
I know.

172
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Okay.

173
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,276
<i>Wait.</i>

174
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I love you.

175
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,239
(labored breathing)

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,789
I love you, too.

177
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Jim!

178
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
We did it.

180
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,120
You did it. We got
through it, Jim.

181
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
WADE:
<i>Captain.</i>

182
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
All clear.

183
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,676
Congratulations.

184
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,879
Reunification can begin.

185
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,239
Well, I'm glad
I can make you so happy.

186
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,920
Funny thing is, sir,

187
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
that's just the second best
news I've gotten today.

188
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,512
(distant rumble)

189
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
What's that?

190
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
(bang)

191
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,634
- Jim.
- Incoming.

192
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,680
Everybody get back!

193
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,275
Get inside! Get inside!

194
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Go, go.

195
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,997
(gunfire)

196
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,478
(grunting)

197
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,953
(bones crunch)

198
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
(man screaming)

199
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,756
Eduardo?

200
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,389
Not anymore.

201
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,712
All right, people, listen up.

202
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,160
I want squads
headed for Knights Stadium,

203
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,636
Yeavley Park,
and Granton Station.

204
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,310
Work your way out.
We got to find him, people.

205
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,639
Bloody hell happened?

206
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,869
Seems that Jim's
old army buddy

207
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,679
wasn't quite as dead
as we'd hoped.

208
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,873
I got squads
covering the north side.

209
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,240
<i>They're sweeping from Coventry</i>

210
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,216
down to Miller Harbor,
but they could be anywhere.

211
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,336
Well, give us an
area to search

212
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,714
- and we'll get it covered.
- Uh...

213
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,279
<i>Take Reatton,</i>

214
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,600
work your way
to South City Park.

215
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,070
Looks like you're not done
protecting Bruce yet, Alfred.

216
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,312
(rasping)

217
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Eduardo.

218
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,754
What did Walker do to you?

219
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,159
When I was
in Peña Dura prison, Jim,

220
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,233
<i>the guards played a game.</i>

221
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,273
They'd choose one of us...

222
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,874
and they buried us alive.

223
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,036
They'd take bets on whether
you could dig your way out.

224
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,079
But then they'd bury you deeper.

225
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,753
And play again.

226
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,994
I was the champion.

227
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,990
To survive that...

228
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,992
I had to stop being human.

229
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,310
I had to become...
something else.

230
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,516
I became Bane.

231
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,039
<i>Only I didn't know it yet.</i>

232
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,911
But she knew
and she showed me the way.

233
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,191
If the world is full
of monsters,

234
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,352
the only way to defeat them...

235
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,712
is to become one yourself.

236
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,069
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,633
You were a good soldier.

238
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Hmm.

239
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,274
Don't pity me, Jim.

240
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,672
We are building the future.

241
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,477
She's given me
a purity of mission.

242
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,559
And unlike the army,

243
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,035
she is willing
to carry things out.

244
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,997
A new world is coming.

245
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,040
Strong...

246
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,549
merciless...

247
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,350
unyielding.

248
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,353
I've heard it all before.

249
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
Not gonna happen.

250
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,720
And how are you going
to stop me, Jim?

251
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
<i>Not me.</i>

252
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,080
You kidnapped Bruce Wayne and
a general of the U.S. Army.

253
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,472
You talk about your future,
Eduardo, but you don't have one.

254
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,160
But Eduardo's dead, Jim.

255
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,919
There is only Bane now.

256
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,040
(door opens)

257
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Rise.

258
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,553
I said rise!

259
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,909
WALKER:
<i>Not so formal.</i>

260
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,159
Captain and I are acquainted.

261
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,154
Get the other one.

262
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,355
I recognize your voice,

263
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
but I don't know
what to call you.

264
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,679
<i>I know it's not Walker.</i>

265
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,234
So who are you?

266
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,831
That's a good question.

267
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,759
Perhaps Bruce Wayne can help us
figure that one out.

268
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,718
(footsteps approach)

269
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
You okay?

270
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,320
(panting):
Yeah.

271
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,595
You want hostages?

272
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,158
You've got me and a
general of the U.S. Army.

273
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,470
Let him go.

274
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,154
<i>This has nothing
to do with him.</i>

275
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,277
"This has nothing
to do with him"?

276
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,471
But, Captain, you don't
even know what "this" is.

277
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,072
This, everything
I have done here,

278
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,391
is about punishing Gotham.

279
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,199
For the sins
of Bruce Wayne.

280
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,759
You can start now.

281
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,000
No... no!

282
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,080
(grunts, groans)

283
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,680
And again.

284
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
(grunts)

285
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
So...

286
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,240
Bruce Wayne.

287
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,357
I'm thinking of a name.

288
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,997
Can you guess whose it is?

289
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
What?

290
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,271
Wrong.
And again.

291
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,476
(shouts)

292
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,318
Want to take another guess?

293
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,879
Farewell, my beloved Gotham.

294
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,677
City of my birth.

295
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,992
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

296
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,472
Though I leave you today...

297
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,596
my heart will always remain.

298
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,874
I do so hate goodbyes.

299
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,919
Well, you're in luck.

300
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,456
- We're not going anywhere.
- What are you talking about?

301
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,836
Engine won't start; pressure
regulator valve's missing.

302
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
Or rather it's stolen.

303
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,311
Barbara!

304
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,997
(exhaling heavily)

305
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,435
Blood pressure's normal.

306
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,592
I'm glad something
about this is normal.

307
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,670
So how long's this gonna take,
Doc, soup to nuts?

308
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,880
Are you in a hurry
or something?

309
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,314
No, it's just that, uh...

310
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,994
I just feel like
you've been...

311
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,753
so great about this, and,

312
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,696
you know, it's been
awkward as hell for you,

313
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,792
and... I haven't even
really said thank you.

314
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,320
I don't expect a thank you
from you, Barbara.

315
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,936
Then perhaps the best
thank you would be for me

316
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,713
to get out of here
as soon as possible.

317
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,840
Whatever's on your mind...

318
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,192
the health of the baby
comes first.

319
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,789
I know that.

320
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,072
So, long haul or short,
we're here.

321
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,232
Until you have
a healthy baby in your arms.

322
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,635
That's all I want.

323
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,676
(softly):
Okay.

324
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,115
(exhales sharply)

325
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,155
- (grunts)
- Stop it!

326
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,711
A name, a person.

327
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,396
The reason
this is all happening.

328
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,477
Can't you guess yet?

329
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,632
I don't know!

330
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,070
If you want to punish
me, then do it.

331
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,595
Hurt me, not him.

332
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,960
I am hurting you.

333
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,874
- (panting)
- There's nothing more painful

334
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,351
than seeing
your friends suffer.

335
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,199
But he's more
than just a friend,

336
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,953
isn't he, Bruce?

337
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,598
Jim Gordon's been
like a father to you.

338
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,356
Oh.

339
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,434
How awful it must be
to watch another father die.

340
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,319
(strained exhale)

341
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,236
Who am I doing this for?

342
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
Say the name.

343
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,835
(grunts)

344
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
(groans)

345
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,516
When the ones you love die...

346
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,513
it's like a part of yourself
is cut off...

347
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,229
forever.

348
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,471
(sobs)

349
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,034
You know that.

350
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,037
So why do I hate you so much?

351
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,198
Who was cut away from me?

352
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,475
Last chance.

353
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,711
(whimpers)

354
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,236
Yes.

355
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,120
Now you know.

356
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,279
Say his name.

357
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,310
Say it.

358
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,073
Ra's al Ghul.

359
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,396
This is revenge
for his death.

360
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,114
And who am I?

361
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,674
You're his daughter.

362
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,036
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

363
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,590
And revenge is just
the beginning of what I want.

364
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,073
(Bane rasping)

365
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,910
NYSSA: <i>The League of Shadows
is everywhere.</i>

366
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,274
<i>Did you think my father's
mission would die with him?</i>

367
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,555
Humankind will be purged
of weakness.

368
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,274
I'm just starting
with you and yours.

369
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,235
You're right.

370
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,754
I killed Ra's.

371
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,552
So whatever you need to do...

372
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,949
do it to me.

373
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
No.

374
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,433
<i>You can't take all the blame
for killing my father.</i>

375
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,999
I mean, you did have
some help, right?

376
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,349
<i>Someone who quite literally
gave you a helping hand.</i>

377
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,673
- What are you doing?
- (yells)

378
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,198
Well done, Barbara.

379
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,954
Go get Barbara Kean.

380
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Eduardo...

381
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,360
She's pregnant.

382
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,439
She's carrying a child.

383
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,914
A child.

384
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,071
One soul's future
weighed against the world's.

385
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,832
Your concern seems petty, Jim.

386
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,916
If he touches a hair
on that child's head,

387
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
I will destroy
everything you have.

388
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,034
I don't have anything left,
just my father's mission.

389
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,599
Bane wants you to join
that mission with us.

390
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,075
To see the world as he sees it.

391
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,560
- Never.
- STRANGE: Never say never,

392
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,279
<i>- Captain Gordon.</i>
- No!

393
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,033
NYSSA:
<i>How does it feel, Bruce,</i>

394
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,950
knowing that all of this
is your fault?

395
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,998
Tell me.
I'd really like to know.

396
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,071
(screams)

397
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,438
(groaning)

398
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,433
There must be something
you can give me.

399
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,432
We're out of the drugs
that you need.

400
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,959
It's okay. You're almost there.

401
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,536
I'll get you some ice chips
so you don't get dehydrated.

402
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,119
Gee, thanks.

403
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Lee.

404
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,230
Ed.

405
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,113
Don't worry,
I'm not here for you.

406
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,038
But for the record,
you stabbed me first.

407
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,359
If you two are quite done,

408
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,796
we are actually here
for Barbara.

409
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,351
Or more precisely,
what she stole from us.

410
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,776
I don't know what this is about,
and I don't care.

411
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,336
You two need to get
out of here right now.

412
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,794
(chuckles) Gladly.

413
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,189
<i>Just as soon
as Barbara</i>

414
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,040
gives us the...
What's it called?

415
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,714
- Pressure regulator valve.
- Right.

416
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
That.

417
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
(sighs)

418
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,510
I should have known that you
would try to screw us over.

419
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,151
You only noticed because you
tried to screw me over first.

420
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,119
Second, technically.

421
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,272
Okay, she's in the middle
of having a baby.

422
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,153
And we are in the
middle of trying

423
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,710
to leave Gotham,
and we can't do that

424
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,991
without a crucial part
of the submarine

425
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,357
which will ferry us
all away from here!

426
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,696
That's why you were
in such a rush

427
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,110
- to get out of here.
- As are we.

428
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,158
Hand over
the part... now.

429
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,193
Don't point that at the baby.

430
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,796
What? No, I did not!

431
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,556
I... I was merely trying
to make a general

432
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,080
threatening gesture
with a firearm.

433
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,776
But you did, though.
You pointed the gun at the baby.

434
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,714
All right, fine. I'm sorry!
Now give us what we want!

435
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,634
No! You think I'm stupid
enough to have the part on me?

436
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,797
It's hidden away,
somewhere safe.

437
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,078
And if you think you can torture
me into telling you where,

438
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,670
there is literally
nothing more painful

439
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,317
than what I am going
through right now!

440
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,359
(explosion)

441
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,079
(screaming in distance)

442
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,199
NURSE:
<i>Hey, you stay out of here.</i>

443
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
This is a hospital.

444
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,716
(neck snaps)

445
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,390
(bell dings)

446
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,679
Barbara Kean,

447
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,557
<i>your time is up.</i>

448
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,079
<i>There's no place
for you to hide.</i>

449
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,349
No one will save you.

450
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,034
No mercy that will spare you.

451
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,352
You simply cannot run
from your sins.

452
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,878
And you cannot run from me.

453
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,400
What do you want from me?

454
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,390
(chuckles)

455
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,716
Let me let you in
on a little military secret.

456
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,637
It's called Special Order 386.

457
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,032
In the event that Gotham
is irretrievably lost,

458
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,916
a contingency plan
was put in place

459
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,079
to reduce the city to rubble.

460
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,719
No.

461
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,313
There are still
innocent people here.

462
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,314
You asked me what
I want from you.

463
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,717
I want you to suffer,
Bruce Wayne.

464
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,071
And then I want you to die.

465
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,158
Spend a little time
with that thought.

466
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,554
We'll be starting soon.

467
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,992
♪♪♪♪

468
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,633
- Who are those guys?
- No idea.

469
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,117
Exactly how many people
have you screwed over?

470
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,039
Present company
excluded.

471
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,352
There are 79 people
in this building.

472
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
Well, fortunately, they seem
to only be trying to kill one.

473
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,111
So, by all means,
let's gather 'round the target.

474
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,316
- All right.
- (groaning)

475
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,160
Maybe we can cut through
the abandoned wing

476
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,080
and we can get
to the ambulance bay that way.

477
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,256
Might take some time, but...

478
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,896
Oh, if only there were
two able-bodied men

479
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
who could buy us some.

480
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,350
And why, pray tell, should we
risk our necks for you?

481
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
(straining):
Chivalry?

482
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,954
(laughs)

483
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,112
But if that's too much,
remember, if I die,

484
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,078
you will never find
that sub part.

485
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Fine.

486
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,200
We'll keep them busy.

487
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,840
We'll meet you at the docks.

488
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,116
Thank you.

489
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,873
- What?
- Keep them busy?

490
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,549
I only brought enough ammunition
for a light firefight,

491

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,120
(grunting)

656
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,519
Dirty bastard.

657
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,317
(Alfred screams)

658
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,072
(grunting)

659
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
No!

660
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Alfred.

661
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,435
Alfred.

662
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,751
(whispers):
Alfred. No.

663
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,040
Somebody help!

664
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,994
(panting)

665
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,271
Somebody. Oh, no.

666
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,914
SOLDIER:
A-ten-hut!

667
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,790
<i>Welcome back, General.</i>

668
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,869
Get me a secure line
to the mainland now.

669
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,233
Jim! Hey.

670
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,516
Just got word from Lee.

671
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,431
She and Barbara made it
out of the clinic okay.

672
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,874
And your baby daughter, too.

673
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,155
- Congratulations.
- They're going to The Sirens.

674
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,514
- You just had a baby girl, brother. Say something.
- (laughs)

675
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,194
Just can't believe it.

676
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,439
We won, didn't we? It's over.

677
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,559
We did, and she's gonna have
a better world because of it.

678
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,956
She is. I promise.

679
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,639
Is Alfred with them?

680
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Didn't say.

681
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,199
This is General Wade.

682
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,116
I am authorizing
Special Order 386.

683
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,639
No!

684
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,871
Gotham City is lost.

685
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,838
Begin your bombing
run on my order.

686
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Arrest them.

687
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,994
You can't do this.

688
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
Take them away.

689
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,154
You can't do this!

690
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,349
THOMPKINS:
Okay, nice and slow.

691
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,232
(baby fussing)

692
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,670
(gasps)

693
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,797
- Barbara Kean.
- Run!

694
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,956
It's nice to finally meet you.

695
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,590
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

696
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,510
I believe you knew my father.

697
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,616
I don't understand how the
general could have been chipped.

698
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,720
I didn't see a scar on the
back of his neck. Did you?

699
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,434
No. Strange must've hidden it.

700
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,274
Nyssa let us escape. She knew
we'd bring the general here

701
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,840
and do her dirty work for her.

702
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
BULLOCK:
What now, Jim?

703
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,632
Son, if you're gonna stick a gun
in my face,

704
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,679
you should at least know
you're doing it wrong.

705
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,474
Come on, let's go.

706
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,552
(helicopter blades whirring)

707
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,918
(explosions)
