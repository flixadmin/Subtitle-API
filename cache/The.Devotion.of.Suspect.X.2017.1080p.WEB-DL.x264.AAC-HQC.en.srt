<i>[Tang Chuan, Sr. Consultant, Provincial Dept. of Public Security]</i>

30
00:05:25,147 --> 00:05:27,557
are changing people's lives and behaviors

31
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:31,657
and are also increasing more and more the levels of concealment and camouflage crimes.

32
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:36,287
So... does the perfect crime exist?

33
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,537
This murder was disguised as a car accident.

34
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:42,587
The murderer was a doctor in Physics.

35
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:45,647
When the murder happened, he didn't touch the victim.

36
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:47,357
How did he do it?

37
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:12,325
This device is called a "directional acoustic generator."
<i>[Criminal tool: directional acoustic generator]</i>

38
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:13,915
It emanates a violent acoustic wave

39
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,845
that can travel in straight lines in the direction given.

40
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:19,545
So, no one present can realize

41
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,525
<i>that the glass is broken by sound resonance.</i>

42
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:25,445
The killer used this method to distract the driver with a loud noise,

43
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:28,455
making him lose control and hit the guardrail.

44
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,945
In order to defeat these sorts of high-IQ offenders,

45
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:39,825
we have to solve problems using their ways of reasoning

46
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:42,315
and have the courage to challenge conventional thinking,

47
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:45,045
even if you are the only one raising objections.

48
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,755
In the game among intellects,

49
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:50,335
he who thinks wins.

50
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:58,285
Tell your captain to invite me to dinner next time.

51
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,085
Coming to me for such an easy case?

52
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,875
Come on, give me some time to research.

53
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,685
- Able men are always busy. You are a recognized genius.
 - What genius?

54
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,985
The clues are obvious. You just didn't review them seriously.

55
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:15,095
Tell your captain that your doubt in the case of the falling floor, last time, was correct.

56
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:17,365
The dead did commit suicide.

57
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:19,795
1. Based on the distance from the body to the building,

58
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:22,785
if the deceased fell from the balcony and had an initial velocity,

59
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:25,865
we can conclude she jumped after running.

60
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:29,605
2. The broken bones pierced the muscles and arteries

61
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:34,130
and the blood showed a splash shape, which means that her heart was still beating when she fell to the ground.

62
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,900
- And 3...
 - We got a new case.

63
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,170
- Have this.
 - Hey!

64
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,010
- And 3. If it's not hard enough, don't come and bother you. Right?
 - You...

65
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,050
I've lived here for over 20 years.

66
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,810
I'm familiar with everything in the area.

67
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,560
I haven't seen any stranger today.

68
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,140
- Captain.
 - What's going on here?

69
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,550
We found the body of a man on the scene.

70
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,010
The body is severely damaged.

71
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,550
Those are half-burned clothes.

72
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,160
There are coats, pants, and shoes.

73
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,970
The size fits the dead man.

74
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,350
We guess the killer intended to destroy the evidence.

75
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,070
Understood.

76
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,540
That old man reported it.

77
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,350
He found it here when he was doing physical exercises in the morning.

78
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,460
Captain,

79
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,750
the lower jaw and the teeth were smashed.

80
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,250
The murderer prepared tools like a hammer beforehand.

81
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,900
The deceased's fingers were burned.

82
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,690
The fingerprints have been completely destroyed.

83
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,090
Where is the mortal wound?

84
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,780
Here.

85
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,100
The marks of strangulation are deep.

86
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,800
- Have you found the rope?
 - Not yet.

87
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,500
Extend the range of the search, including the river.

88
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,110
Yes, Sir.

89
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,700
- Luo Miao.
 - Yeah.

90
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,490
What do you think of it?

91
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,920
The murderer's M.O. is extremely brutal and he is good at counter-detection.

92
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,890
It's not a normal homicide.

93
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,630
I guess this case will catch the attention of the media soon.

94
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,320
We have to solve it as soon as possible in order to avoid panic.

95
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,900
Yes, Sir.

96

What can I do for you?

00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,458
We found a body by the levee a few days ago.

It's your ex-husband, Fu Jian.

How could this happen?

- Have you seen your ex-husband recently?
 - No, I haven't.

125
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:34,848
When was the last time you saw him?

126
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:38,448
Last year? Or the year before last?

127
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,658
I don't remember. We haven't kept in touch since I moved here.

Could you tell us why you divorced?

129
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:48,958
He had a gambling addiction. He would have been a bad influence on my child.

130

Is there someone else at home?

Ms. Chen, we need to know, where were you on April 12th?

On April 12th...

134
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:16,888
As usual, I went to work before 7:00 a.m.

135
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:19,088
But that day, I saw a movie with my daughter after work.

136
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:22,588
Do you have any proof? For instance, ticket stubs?

137
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:26,208
I should have thrown them randomly.

138
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:30,818
Did you go back home directly after that?

139
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,828
No, we went to a noodle restaurant for dinner.

140
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:36,028
And then we went to a clothing store.

141
00:12:36,028 --> 00:12:38,308
We arrived home at about 11:00 o'clock.

142
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:40,490
Do you remember the names and the locations of the two shops?

143
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:42,332
Both of them are near the cinema.

144
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:44,512
I can't remember the names.

145
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,055
I've found this.

146
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:06,075
Thanks for your time.

147
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:18,695
Excuse me, I'd like to ask you about something.

148
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:24,465
Just one minute.

149
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:30,385
Have you ever seen this guy?

150
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,395
Nope.

151
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:37,175
- Are you familiar with your neighbor, Chen Jing?
 - Not really.

152
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:39,695
Were you at home at night on April 12?

153
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,375
I got home at almost 7:00 p.m.

154
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,685
Did you hear anything from your neighbor?

155
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:47,405
I don't remember anything.

156
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:30,535
Morning, Professor Tang.

157
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,455
You'd better not touch it.

158
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:43,155
If it's dangerous for it to be touched, you wouldn't have left it like that.

159
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:46,545
But the precondition is that the one who touches it has some knowledge in physics.

160
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,985
What brings you here today?

161
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:52,965
I just passed by and dropped in.

162
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:55,695
If you want some coffee, wash yourself a cup first.

163
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,885
When your assistant isn't here, you don't even wash mugs.

164
00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:03,965
If scientists liked to wash mugs, then penicillin wouldn't have been found.

165
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,708
Have you solved the case that happened by the levee?

166
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:10,828
How did you know that I'm on this case?

167
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:13,838
You were called away in the morning and the news came out in the evening.

168
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:17,328
Captain said that in the 30 years that he's been here,

169
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:20,158
he'd never seen such a brutal homicide.

170
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:24,838
- Any progress?
 - We have narrowed it down to three suspects.

171
00:15:24,838 --> 00:15:27,858
I feel there is something wrong with the ex-wife of the victim.

172
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:31,448
The murder happened on a workday and she brought her daughter out until 11:00 p.m.

173
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,318
That doesn't make sense.

174
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:36,358
She has an alibi, doesn't she?

175
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:41,378
When you were speaking of the ex-wife, your arms were crossed against your chest.

176
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:44,578
In behavioral science, that's a physical sign of being under great pressure.

177
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,458
The result of the investigation must be different from your expectations.

178
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,148
It's pretty exhausting chatting with you.

179
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:54,058
The ex-wife said she went to a movie on the night of the crime, which can be proved by the movie stubs.

180
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:56,088
And after the movie, she went to the clothing store.

181
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,278
Movie stubs? Where did she get that?

182
00:15:58,278 --> 00:15:59,848
I know what you're thinking about.

183
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:03,188
If she kept it on purpose, it could be suspected.

184
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:07,508
She said she just threw it away, but she found it in a brochure in a while.

185
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:12,688
If she really was the murderer and put the stubs into the brochure for the police to accidentally find them,

186
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,928
this woman is remarkable.

187
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:23,738
I met someone who had the same letter yesterday.

188
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,098
This is from the international association of mathematical physics.

189
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:28,728
It's a small circle. What's their name?

190
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:32,708
Shi Hong. And he's living next door to the ex-wife.

191
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:44,818
<i>Don't move!</i>

192
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:46,498
<i>What class is this?</i>

193
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:49,918
<i>Shi Hong? Where is he?</i>

194
00:16:57,648 --> 00:16:59,358
<i>You!</i>

195
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:01,548
<i>Are you muddleheaded?</i>

196
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:04,118
<i>Is this the exam for geography or art?</i>

197
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:06,448
<i>You shall take all the responsibility.</i>

198
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:17,538
<i>Has anyone ever told you that you aren't normal?</i>

199
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:20,828
<i>How could you solve a math problem in the geography exam?</i>

200
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,448
<i>You know what I was doing?</i>

201
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:25,638
<i>It's a four-color problem.</i>

202
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:29,748
<i>If you use different colors for adjacent areas,</i>

203
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,368
<i>any map can be filled with just four colors.</i>

204
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:36,878
<i>- The teacher doesn't understand it, but I'm not a fool.
 - You've done it before, too?</i>

205
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:41,148
<i>The four-color problem has been proved right. No need to waste my time anymore.</i>

206
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:44,808
<i>That proof was completed by the computer.</i>

207
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:46,998
<i>It can't be considered true mathematics.</i>

208
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:50,998
<i>I want to find out the simplest and the most elegant mathematical way to prove it.</i>

209
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,808
<i>Let me see!</i>

210
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,470
- Let me clean up first.
 - Sure.

211
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,400
What shall we have for dinner?

212
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,120
- Let's dine out.
 - Let's eat at home.

213
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,800
How long has it been since we last met?

214
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,520
Sixteen years?

215
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,610
Counting from the day we graduated,

216
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,840
it should be 15 years 9 months and 14 days.

217
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,700
You haven't changed a bit.

218
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,220
- Judging from your desk, I guess you are teaching junior high.
 - Yes.

219
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,240
It's a waste of your talent.

220
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,840
What about you?

221
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,440
I'm staying at a university and taking charge of a lab.

222
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,810
- You're a professor!
 - Associate professor.

223
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,210
And no way to get a promotion.

224
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,030
I'm not good at sucking up to anyone.

225
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,870
We should hang out more often.

226
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,820
Do you still play badminton?

227
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,640
Not really! But I will go climbing the mountain sometimes.

228
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,760
Mountain climbing is quite like studying math.

229
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,950
There's only one summit

230
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,240
with a lot of paths leading to it.

231
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,040
Finding out the most elegant path

232
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,870
is the dream for every mathematician.

233
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,780
Actually, after graduation, I thought about finding you several times, but I never reached you.

234
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,290
I moved several times and lost contact with many of our classmates.

235
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,000
How did you find me?

236
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,080
A friend met you here the other day.

237
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,910
A friend?

238
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,010
His surname is Luo; a police officer.

239
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:25,068
A man was killed.

240
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:27,918
He was the ex-husband of your neighbor.

241
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,098
I came to you

242
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:41,508
because of this.

243
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:47,908
You didn't forget about our competition, did you?

244
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:56,338
<i>Every time I go into a room,</i>

245
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,318
<i>I can tell who the smartest person is within 10 seconds.</i>

246
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:02,938
<i>You mean yourself, right?</i>

247
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:04,648
<i>I'm not so sure now.</i>

248
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:06,788
<i>Shall we have a competition?</i>

249
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:09,158
<i>Let's challenge each other in turn</i>

250
00:21:09,158 --> 00:21:12,358
<i>and the one with more right answers is the smarter one.</i>

251
00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:16,548
<i>You go first. I'll let you.</i>

252
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:33,468
<i>Use four continuous lines to link up the 9 dots.</i>

253
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:38,258
<i>You think too little of me!</i>

254
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:46,988
<i>It's just a warm-up.</i>

255
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:48,768
<i>Your turn.</i>

256
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:00,398
<i>[Disproof of Riemann Hypothesis]</i>

257
00:22:00,398 --> 00:22:02,768
Disproof of Riemann Hypothesis?

258
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:04,888
Does it work?

259
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:07,398
I just want you to try it.

260
00:22:07,398 --> 00:22:10,288
It was given by a math professor.

261
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,268
I wonder whether your ability is falling behind.

262
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:14,298
Will it be too hard for you?

263
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:29,528
Thank you for coming! See you next time!

264
00:22:31,508 --> 00:22:35,018
Don't even mention him to me! He kept harassing Chen Jing after they divorced.

265
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:36,408
He beat her when he didn't get money from her.

266
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:41,048
He even dared to come here to ask where Chen Jing had gone to.

267
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:44,928
Why would I tell him? Such a bastard!

268
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:48,218
Besides Fu Jian, who else kept in close contact with Chen Jing?

269
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:52,558
There was one who was a regular guest.

270
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:10,548
That's an interesting algorithm, but it's still wrong.

271
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:13,468
I didn't expect you to solve it over one night.

272
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:15,258
You've got a way for it.

273
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,688
The next-door neighbor got up so early.

274
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,948
She went out before 7:00 a.m.

275
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:22,078
Are you familiar with her?

276
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,988
We have very little contact.

277
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:27,448
But I often go to the snack bar owned by her.

278
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:30,478
I heard that she is a suspect.

279
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:33,468
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

280
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:36,608
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

281
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,108
Four, two, three, four,...

282
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:40,168
Such an interesting path!

283
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,588
Yes. But the scene stays the same every day.

284
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,508
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

285
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,818
Give me some money, please. Have some mercy on me.

286
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:53,888
- Thank you.
 - Four, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

287
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:56,488
They are like meaningless gears in a clock,

288
00:23:56,488 --> 00:23:59,678
repeating meaningless life every day.

289
00:24:05,598 --> 00:24:08,166
This is the snack bar that belongs to my neighbor.

290
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,210
I'll buy some food in it.

291
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,610
All right. You win this time.

292
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,900
And next time, it will be your turn to challenge me.

293
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,920
Bye.

294
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,820
Thanks.

295
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,630
Signature dish.

296
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,830
Signature dish.

297
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,840
On April 12, Chen Jing went to a movie with her daughter after work,

298
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,630
which can be proved by the movie stubs.

299
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,370
The movie ended at 9:30 p.m.

300
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,740
The time of death of Fu Jian is between 6 and 10 p.m.

301
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,150
It would take at least 40 minutes for her to get to the levee from the cinema.

302
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,340
So theoretically, Chen Jing didn't have the time to commit the crime.

303
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,280
The stubs cannot prove anything.

304
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,180
What's more, five days earlier,

305
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,480
Fu Jian went to the nightclub where Chen Jing worked to ask about her whereabouts.

306
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,680
I think she is still quite a suspect.

307
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,990
But judging from the M.O., the killer should be physically stronger than the victim.

308
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,970
Chen Jing is just a woman. It doesn't make sense.

309
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,060
- Luo Miao, check this out.
 - Yes, Sir.

310
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,660
- And what about the angle of money and debt?
 - On April 15, we found the suspect, Wu Daqing.

311
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,650
And he doesn't have an alibi at present.

312
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,400
Wu Daqing!

313
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,300
<i>That night, we found Hu Gang in an underground casino. </i>

314
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,900
- Stand still!
 - Don't move!

315
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,790
<i>He escaped and was listed as an escaped suspect. </i>

316
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:34,300
A witness said that three days before the murder, Hu Gang had a quarrel with Fu Jian in the casino.

317
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,480
I think Hu Gang is the top suspect as of now.

318
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,870
Okay then.

319
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,720
Go back to your room.

320
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,590
We need to have further confirmation.

321
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,130
On the night of April 12, which two stores did you go to with your daughter?

322
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,810
Please think it over and mark them on the map.

323
00:25:57,006 --> 00:25:59,996
We had noodles around here.

324
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:03,006
And we went here to look at some clothes.

325
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:11,496
Welcome! Come in, please.

326
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:17,046
Police. Did you see this person

327
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:18,826
on April 12?

328
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,726
I can't recall it.

329
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:32,156
<i>At noon on the 12th, Chen Xiaoxin told her classmates that she would go to the cinema after school.</i>

330
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:36,166
<i>The chef at the snack bar also gave witness that Chen Jing left around 7:00 p.m.</i>

331
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:40,666
At this point, we have no way to confirm, definitely, Chen Jing's movements during the time at the cinema.

332
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:45,276
The best we can do is ascertain where she was between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m.

333
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:54,246
Chen Jing. 9:50 p.m.

334
00:26:55,076 --> 00:26:58,076
Now the suspicions on Chen Jing are fewer and fewer.

335
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:11,306
Let him do it. You can go now.

336
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:12,776
Then, I'll record the previous result into the database.

337
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:14,406
Goodbye, Sir.

338
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:33,287
Your friend, Shi Hong, what kind of person is he?

339
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:34,787
Why are you asking about him?

340
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,407
I saw you talking to him that day

341
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,487
when I was keeping watch at Chen Jing's work place.

342
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:43,117
Were you watching her or me?

343
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:48,427
It is hard right now to continue the investigation against Chen Jing.

344
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:52,307
Besides, judging from the M.O., the murderer should be more like a male.

345
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:06,807
So your suspicion is that Shi Hong helped her?

346
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:09,217
Your friend goes to Chen Jing's snack bar almost every day.

347
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:11,837
Doesn't that mean anything?

348
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:17,137
Daily routine is his style.

349
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:19,156
There's nothing strange about it.

350
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:36,076
Are you so sure your friend has nothing fishy?

351
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:40,456
Math means everything to Shi Hong, while money and love are not important at all.

352
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:42,666
Therefore, it's impossible that he might have killed someone.

353
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:34,526
You still look so young.

354
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:36,216
I really envy you.

355
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,726
I'm getting old, too.

356
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:41,936
And I'm not as intelligent as before.

357
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:52,076
Your watch is fogging. I'll fix it for you.

358
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,606
Professor, do you need me to do the sample analysis for you?

359
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:12,015
No need. You can go.

360
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:35,225
Luo Miao, bring me all the files about the levee case.

361
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:36,935
I want to see them.

Why are you still here?

00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:33,175
I'd like to know what made you suddenly so interested in this case.

369
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:43,405
Today, Shi Hong said some words

370
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:46,225
that shouldn't have come out of his mouth.

371
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:49,835
He said

372
00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:52,325
that I still look so young that

373
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:54,045
he envies me.

374
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,855
What does it mean?

375
00:31:57,235 --> 00:32:01,045
Do you recall that you asked me before, what kind of person Shi Hong is?

376
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:05,055
The Shi Hong I knew based all his values on Mathematics.

377
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:07,565
He's never cared about appearances.

378
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:11,565
That something could make him say something like that...

379
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:14,325
unless...

380
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:19,975
Unless he has fallen in love.

381
00:32:19,975 --> 00:32:21,975
From what I know about him,

382
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:25,485
no matter the situation, he would never use murder,

383
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,865
such a foolish method, to solve matters.

384
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:31,085
If he is involved, the only possibility

385
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:34,645
is that when he intervened, the victim was already dead.

386
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:37,155
What could he do at that time?

387
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,695
All he could do was to propose any countermeasure

388
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:42,665
to help Chen Jing avoid the investigation.

389
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:46,005
If you also think Shi Hong is suspicious, I have confidence now.

390
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,605
He is just a math teacher. Committing a crime, he must have left clues.

391
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:51,295
You're wrong!

392
00:32:51,295 --> 00:32:53,485
If Shi Hong is really involved,

393
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:56,705
if he's really helping Chen Jing avoid the investigation,

394
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,210
you'll have a big problem!

 - I'm guilty, too. I committed murder, too.</i>

<i>If you haven't decided,</i>

461

<i>but I have never seen a cockroach.</i>

468
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:09,048
<i>I did it alone. It has nothing to do with her.</i>

469
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:10,618
<i>No, it was me who hit him first.</i>

470
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:13,328
<i>Stop talking! It has nothing to do with you.</i>

471
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,138
<i>You can't hide it.</i>

472
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:18,012
<i>He got the bite mark on his hand from Xiaoxin, right?</i>

473
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:20,122
<i>No, it was me.</i>

474
00:40:20,122 --> 00:40:22,312
<i>It's impossible for one person to strangle him from his back</i>

475
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:25,112
<i>and seize his left hand at the same time.</i>

476
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:26,532
<i>The police will find out.</i>

477
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:29,342
<i>My mom did nothing wrong. She wanted to save me.</i>

478
00:40:29,342 --> 00:40:32,142
<i>Otherwise, he'd have beaten us both to death.</i>

479
00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:36,762
<i>What can we do?</i>

480
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,362
<i>We need to take his clothes off.</i>

481
00:40:43,362 --> 00:40:45,732
<i>If we don't do it right now, the body will get stiff.</i>

482
00:40:45,732 --> 00:40:48,772
<i>Tell me everything about him.</i>

483
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:52,432
<i>Tidy up the whole place carefully.</i>

484
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:56,072
<i>I'll give you a new phone number, and try to reach you later.</i>

485
00:40:57,252 --> 00:40:59,342
<i>You both need an alibi.</i>

486
00:40:59,342 --> 00:41:01,642
<i>That's the key point.</i>

487
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:04,052
<i>But we don't have any.</i>

488
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,162
<i>That's why we need to create one.</i>

489
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,200
<i>- It's me.
 - The police came again.</i>

490
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,470
<i>They asked where we went after the movie.</i>

491
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,270
<i>We answered honestly.</i>

492
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,820
<i>Good.</i>

493
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,620
<i>Did they look for Xiaoxin?</i>

494
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,100
<i>Yeah.</i>

495
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,590
<i>They asked if somebody could prove that she'd gone to the movies.</i>

496
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,690
- How did she answer?
 - Just as you told us before.

497
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,710
<i>She mentioned a friend.</i>

498
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,810
<i>Good.</i>

499
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,600
<i>That cop seems to have seen through it.</i>

500
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,850
<i>He knows it was me.</i>

501
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,840
<i>I'm really scared.</i>

502
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,220
<i>Every single day, I think I should just turn myself in.</i>

503
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,720
<i>If they can't find any new evidence,</i>

504
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,440
<i>they will turn to new suspects.</i>

505
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,120
<i>Trust me!</i>

506
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,640
<i>Okay.</i>

507
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,190
The shared bike was found there.

508
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,110
Here we found Fu Jian's footprints.

509
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,810
Try to reconstruct the crime now.

510
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,710
On the morning of April 12, Fu Jian rented a bike.

511
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,620
In the evening, he rode here and met the killer.

512
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,910
The killer and Fu Jian knew each other.

513
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,720
He took advantage when Fu Jian wasn't expecting it and strangled him to death with a rope,

514
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,510
then smashed his face with the hammer he carried,

515
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,810
burned out his fingerprints, and also burned his clothes.

516
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,940
Why are you so sure that he got here by bike?

517
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,400
Fu Jian's fingerprints are on the bike.

518
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,230
Why did the killer take off Fu Jian's clothes and burn them up?

519
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,650
To cover his identity.

520
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:06,020
The same reason why he burned his face and fingerprints.

521
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,360
But why didn't he burn all the clothes?

522
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,730
Maybe he slipped in the hurry.

523
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,040
It only takes a few minutes to burn some clothes.

524
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,150
The killer had so much time to get rid of the body,

525
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,970
but he didn't have a few minutes to burn the clothes?

526
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,740
And as for what you mentioned before,

527
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,650
the killer was so careful in the crime,

528
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,050
but he just forgot to wipe the fingerprints on the bike?

529
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,740
Moreover,

530
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,770
if this murder was premeditated,

531
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,170
why did the killer choose to dump the body here?

532
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,770
He hoped the body would be found soon.

533
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,380
So it seems that this could all be a deliberate set-up by the killer.

534
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:55,133
Until we have checked out these clues,

535
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:57,333

With oranges, you have to pick the ones that bounce back when you pinch them.

Now there is no one around nagging me.

00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:28,606
Turns out, I find it uncomfortable.

581
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:32,716
I heard about what happened to Fu Jian.

582

00:58:15,914 --> 00:58:18,054
No, thank you.

634
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,814
Today, you went to the restaurant.

635
00:58:22,814 --> 00:58:25,274
Was that to help the police with the case, too?

636
00:58:28,264 --> 00:58:30,854
I wanted to see the suspect personally.

637
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,674
But she didn't look like a killer to me.

638
00:58:32,674 --> 00:58:34,254
She didn't?

639
00:58:35,174 --> 00:58:37,214
You can't judge a person by their appearance.

640
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:43,054
The body was found by the levee.

641
00:58:43,054 --> 00:58:45,364
The victim should have been killed at night.

642
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:47,864
The clues found until now are very limited.

643
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:52,174
Have you been to the levee lately?

644
00:58:53,694 --> 00:58:56,174
I go there for a run sometimes.

645
00:58:58,294 --> 00:58:59,784
I see.

646
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:02,174
I took apart your watch

647
00:59:02,174 --> 00:59:05,074
and checked the chemical components of the water fog.

648
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,604
Can I have my watch back?

649
00:59:07,604 --> 00:59:09,994
I'm afraid you have to wait until I fix it.

650
00:59:11,084 --> 00:59:13,204
It is such a coincidence that on that day,

651
00:59:13,204 --> 00:59:16,294
I was helping the police analyze the soil water by the levee.

652
00:59:16,823 --> 00:59:20,963
Two days before the homicide, the chemical plant poured some wastewater into the river.

653
00:59:20,963 --> 00:59:24,623
So, I found some residual components in the soil water.

654
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:31,303
The components in the soil water are identical to the components

655
00:59:31,303 --> 00:59:32,993
of the water fog in your watch.

656
00:59:34,843 --> 00:59:37,103
I did fall down in that area last time.

657
00:59:37,103 --> 00:59:39,203
Where did you fall? Was it serious?

658
00:59:39,203 --> 00:59:41,303
I'm fine now.

659
00:59:42,643 --> 00:59:44,923
Don't go to the levee these days.

660
00:59:44,923 --> 00:59:46,613
The murderer hasn't been caught yet.

661
00:59:46,613 --> 00:59:48,433
You need to be careful.

662
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:51,653
I will be.

663
01:00:06,243 --> 01:00:09,643
Right, one more question came to my mind.

664
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:14,553
To design a problem that nobody else can solve,

665
01:00:14,553 --> 01:00:16,833
or to solve the problem,

666
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,783
which one is more difficult?

667
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,473
Very interesting.

668
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:24,643
I'll think about it carefully.

669
01:00:35,963 --> 01:00:38,993
In this exam, there was a blind-point question.

670
01:00:38,993 --> 01:00:41,573
Nobody solved it.

671
01:00:51,813 --> 01:00:56,103
Answer me! What's a blind-point question?

672
01:01:01,593 --> 01:01:03,603
I don't know.

673
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:05,483
For instance:

674
01:01:05,483 --> 01:01:08,093
it seems to be a geometric problem,

675
01:01:08,093 --> 01:01:10,323
actually, it's a function problem.

676
01:01:10,323 --> 01:01:13,323
- Remember?
 - Yes.

677
01:01:18,113 --> 01:01:22,413
On the evening of April 12, you said you got home at 7:00 p.m. and then stayed at home all night.

678
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:25,403
- Do you have a witness?
 - I don't.

679
01:01:26,033 --> 01:01:30,633
Both on April 12 and 13 you asked for a half-day leave in the morning. What was the reason?

680
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:32,053
I got a cold. I took a rest at home.

681
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:35,353
Then in the afternoon, you came to class. You didn't go to the hospital?

682
01:01:35,353 --> 01:01:38,223
It wasn't that serious. I bought some medicine for the cold.

683
01:01:38,223 --> 01:01:41,733
Do you remember at what time you bought the medicine and the name of the pharmacy?

684
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:44,002
Please write them down.

685
01:01:53,432 --> 01:01:55,432
Do you know this man?

686
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:00,832
- I don't.
 - His name is Teng Kun.

687
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:04,152
He was a regular client in the nightclub where Chen Jing used to work.

688
01:02:04,152 --> 01:02:05,962
They've been meeting frequently in the last period.

689
01:02:05,962 --> 01:02:07,752
You live next door to Chen Jing, have you seen him?

690
01:02:07,752 --> 01:02:10,052
I don't pay attention to other people's business.

691
01:02:11,752 --> 01:02:13,732
The information you provided is very precious.

692
01:02:13,732 --> 01:02:15,452
Thank you!

693
01:02:19,052 --> 01:02:21,662
- Brother Miao, Teng Kun is also a suspect?
 - No.

694
01:02:21,662 --> 01:02:24,162
Yet you took Teng Kun's picture to provoke Shi Hong on purpose.

695
01:02:24,162 --> 01:02:27,472
- Was it Professor Tang's idea?
 - No. It was my idea.

696
01:02:27,472 --> 01:02:30,172
Professor Tang said that Shi Hong would never be moved by emotion.

697
01:02:30,172 --> 01:02:31,672
But I think it's the opposite.

698
01:02:31,672 --> 01:02:34,982
Emotion will be his only weakness.

699
01:02:36,182 --> 01:02:38,142
I hope Shi Hong will start making mistakes.

700
01:04:15,903 --> 01:04:19,983
Have I been bothering you with these dates?

701
01:04:19,983 --> 01:04:24,593
No, I just want to stay at home with Xiaoxin more.

702
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:27,603
It's so hard for you to raise Xiaoxin alone.

703
01:04:27,603 --> 01:04:30,013
Xiaoxin needs a complete family.

704
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:31,713
I do, too.

705
01:04:38,783 --> 01:04:42,013
<i>What is your relationship with this man?</i>

706
01:04:42,013 --> 01:04:46,023
<i>You're not considering what I've done for you, either.</i>

707
01:04:46,023 --> 01:04:48,033
<i>Break up with him immediately.</i>

708
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:51,913
<i>Otherwise, I can make him disappear, too.</i>

709
01:04:53,506 --> 01:04:56,246
<i>You should understand my words.</i>

710
01:05:06,856 --> 01:05:10,046
<i>Brother Kun, shall we still go to the south side?</i>

711
01:05:19,346 --> 01:05:23,666
<i>In the parking lot behind the Times Tower on Jianshe Road, somebody got hurt. Need an ambulance.</i>

712
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:25,256
<i>I'll send someone there immediately.</i>

713
01:05:25,256 --> 01:05:27,366
<i>Please leave your name and phone number.</i>

714
01:05:42,576 --> 01:05:43,776
Catch him!

715
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:46,586
Drop the weapon!

716
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:50,486
Who's behind you? Tell the truth.

717
01:05:50,486 --> 01:05:52,606
I really don't know who he is.

718
01:05:52,606 --> 01:05:54,416
He contacted me online.

719
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:59,206
<i>He just said he would pay the rest after I gave that guy a lesson.</i>

720
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:01,096
<i>Never seen him before?</i>

721
01:06:01,096 --> 01:06:03,496
Teng Kun received a blackmail letter.

722
01:06:04,306 --> 01:06:07,026
These photos were in it.

723
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:09,676
Is there anybody stalking or harassing you?

724
01:06:09,676 --> 01:06:11,106
Don't be afraid!

725
01:06:11,106 --> 01:06:15,026
Please believe the police will ensure you and your daughter's safety.

726
01:06:20,506 --> 01:06:22,036
No one.

727
01:06:26,806 --> 01:06:29,406
If it's just for revenge,

728
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:33,316
why would he call the police before murdering?

729
01:06:33,316 --> 01:06:35,416
This should only be a warning.

730
01:06:35,416 --> 01:06:38,026
He must have planned it all. We can't find a flaw.

731
01:06:38,026 --> 01:06:40,756
Sir! The voice print was tampered with.

732
01:06:40,756 --> 01:06:42,506
It can't be recognized.

733
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:56,026
<i>[Shi Hong: Climb the mountain together tomorrow?]</i>

734
01:07:25,576 --> 01:07:28,106
I thought we were just going out for one day.

735
01:07:28,106 --> 01:07:29,766
There are a lot of variable factors in the mountains.

736
01:07:29,766 --> 01:07:32,186
It doesn't hurt to bring something more and be prepared.

737
01:07:51,596 --> 01:07:55,896
When I meet problems that I can't solve, I come here and take a walk.

738
01:07:56,916 --> 01:08:00,016
It feels like this mountain is a part of me.

739
01:09:25,086 --> 01:09:27,406
All worn out?

740
01:09:27,406 --> 01:09:29,116
Not too bad.

741
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,216
Chop the wood!

742
01:09:49,046 --> 01:09:52,986
These trees seem very old.

743
01:09:53,966 --> 01:09:56,496
No matter how long they live,

744
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:59,306
in the end, the result will always be this.

745
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:06,196
I thought I knew you well.

746
01:10:07,106 --> 01:10:09,196
Little by little, I realized

747
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:12,986
you seem to be hiding many things that I don't know.

748
01:10:15,506 --> 01:10:17,586
I remember you once said

749
01:10:18,326 --> 01:10:20,796
that studying math is the same as climbing a mountain.

750
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:25,716
There was a time before

751
01:10:29,506 --> 01:10:31,826
when you understood that feeling?

752
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:37,326
There's a mountain in front of you.

753
01:10:38,636 --> 01:10:40,816
You have been climbing for a long time,

754
01:10:42,346 --> 01:10:45,406
but you can only wander back and forth in the mountain forest.

755
01:10:47,926 --> 01:10:49,936
You can't reach the peak.

756
01:10:51,356 --> 01:10:53,756
You can't find the way out, either.

757
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,235
Unexpectedly, you're caged.

758
01:11:06,465 --> 01:11:08,795
<i>The harder I struggled,</i>

759
01:11:10,345 --> 01:11:12,745
<i>the deeper I was trapped.</i>

760
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:16,625
<i>I completely felt like a meaningless gear.</i>

761
01:11:17,445 --> 01:11:20,335
<i>I couldn't tolerate myself like that.</i>

762
01:12:06,805 --> 01:12:09,305
I can imagine that despair.

763
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,775
But I also believe

764
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:16,665
that you can find a good way out.

765
01:12:19,565 --> 01:12:21,995
For me, the best way out

766
01:12:25,085 --> 01:12:27,195
isn't going out,

767
01:12:28,495 --> 01:12:30,825
but going down.

768
01:12:37,725 --> 01:12:39,335
Have some soup.

769
01:12:49,235 --> 01:12:51,535
I hadn't taken fresh air like this in a long time.

770
01:12:52,225 --> 01:12:54,645
When I finish this case,

771
01:12:54,645 --> 01:12:56,605
I'll take a long vacation.

772
01:12:58,355 --> 01:13:00,645
Cases will never be finished.

773
01:13:01,645 --> 01:13:04,525
Resting a while is best for you.

774
01:13:11,425 --> 01:13:13,445
I can't rest.

775
01:13:14,225 --> 01:13:16,745
Nowadays, murderers are harder and harder to deal with.

776
01:13:17,975 --> 01:13:20,625
Like that doctor in Physics.

777
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:23,375
His M.O. was practically flawless.

778
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:26,175
We only arrested him after much effort.

779
01:13:27,635 --> 01:13:29,965
Guess what he said in the interrogation room?

780
01:13:32,135 --> 01:13:34,285
He said,

781
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:38,785
even if he hadn't been caught by us, he would have chosen to turn himself in,

782
01:13:39,785 --> 01:13:42,885
because he couldn't bear the feeling of guilt in his heart.

783
01:13:57,785 --> 01:14:00,105
Thank you for telling me this.

784
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,105
Thank you for bringing me here.

785
01:14:03,925 --> 01:14:06,275
Don't forget to come back in winter and have a look.

786
01:14:09,595 --> 01:14:11,825
It will be another view.

787
01:14:22,903 --> 01:14:25,973
Mom, today I have to compete in a music contest.

788
01:14:32,713 --> 01:14:34,183
Mom!

789
01:14:35,613 --> 01:14:37,793
Come back home right after school, okay?

790
01:14:37,793 --> 01:14:39,493
Okay.

791
01:14:46,933 --> 01:14:50,023
Dig in! Don't be a picky eater.

792
01:14:55,506 --> 01:14:59,036
- Prosperity Eatery.
 <i>- Go fetch your mail in your mailbox.</i>

793
01:15:02,556 --> 01:15:05,556
This is the last time I will contact you.

794
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,276
<i>You ruined all I had, so I'll take what's yours.</i>

795
01:15:35,796 --> 01:15:39,976
Officer Luo, please save my daughter!

796
01:15:40,676 --> 01:15:42,976
Save my daughter!

797
01:15:49,696 --> 01:15:50,906
Chen Xiaoxin is not at school.

798
01:15:50,906 --> 01:15:54,706
She went on a trip to attend a competition with the school band. They departed a while ago.

799
01:16:35,646 --> 01:16:38,956
- Hello?
 - Shi Hong stole the directional acoustic generator.

800
01:16:38,956 --> 01:16:43,236
Damn it! Chen Jing just called me <i>and said Shi Hong threatened to hurt her daughter.</i>

801
01:16:43,236 --> 01:16:45,766
- Call the school now!
 - Chen Xiaoxin is not at school.

802
01:16:45,766 --> 01:16:48,936
She and her school band are on the way to a competition out of town. There are more than twenty students on the bus.

803
01:16:48,936 --> 01:16:52,936
If Shi Hong attacks the driver, the bus will be out of control. That will put all the students in danger.

804
01:16:52,936 --> 01:16:55,976
<i>- I'm driving there.</i>
 - I'll go right away.

The teacher isn't picking up!

811
01:18:12,036 --> 01:18:13,616
Look!

812
01:18:29,346 --> 01:18:31,066
It's them!

813
01:18:55,504 --> 01:18:58,214
Mom, I'm fine!

814
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:04,434
- Sit down, for now.
 - Please, students, sit down and be quiet.

815
01:19:05,934 --> 01:19:08,424
Luckily, we got ahead of Shi Hong.

816
01:19:05,934 --> 01:19:08,424
It's too simple. Too simple.

817
01:19:11,314 --> 01:19:13,244
It can't be this simple.

818
01:19:15,654 --> 01:19:18,014
<i>It seems to be a geometric problem,</i>

819
01:19:18,014 --> 01:19:20,554
<i>actually, it's a function problem.</i>

820
01:19:20,554 --> 01:19:23,644
What if Shi Hong's target is not Xiaoxin?

821
01:19:26,454 --> 01:19:28,744
- Professor Tang is in danger!
 - What do you mean?

822
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:31,834
Without him, nobody can prove Shi Hong is the murderer.

823
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,264
What?

824
01:19:59,364 --> 01:20:02,204

01:21:34,444 --> 01:21:37,054
You still owe me a bunch of sandwiches.

Captain said to do as you wish.

He'll let you rest for a few more days.

839
01:21:52,284 --> 01:21:54,254
The case is closed?

840
01:21:56,894 --> 01:21:58,874
Shi Hong has pleaded guilty.

841
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:04,684
<i>He confessed he murdered Fu Jian by the levee</i>

842
01:22:04,684 --> 01:22:08,954
<i>because he was obsessed with Chen Jing. He didn't want her to be entangled with her ex-husband.</i>

843
01:22:12,074 --> 01:22:13,694
<i>He took us to his home.</i>

844
01:22:13,694 --> 01:22:16,274
<i>In the cabinet we found the electric wires, the hammer,</i>

845
01:22:16,274 --> 01:22:18,684
<i>and the airbrush he used for the murder.</i>

846
01:22:24,294 --> 01:22:27,484
<i>We also found an audio monitor on the wall.</i>

847
01:22:29,394 --> 01:22:32,414
<i>He confessed he had been listening in to Chen Jing for a long time</i>

848
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:35,694
<i>and knew her every movement.</i>

849
01:22:38,414 --> 01:22:41,424
<i>When the murder happened, Chen Jing wasn't aware of it.</i>

850
01:22:41,424 --> 01:22:44,424
<i>And then, Shi Hong kept stalking her and harassing her.</i>

851
01:22:44,424 --> 01:22:47,814
<i>He also sent her a blackmailing letter. All of this checked out.</i>

852
01:22:47,814 --> 01:22:50,344
<i>I really never thought he was that kind of person.</i>

853
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:56,544
Shi Hong also confessed that he was the one who had Teng Kun beaten.

854
01:22:56,544 --> 01:22:59,014
And he's the one who made that call to the police, too.

855
01:22:59,704 --> 01:23:03,744
The evidence we hold now completely matches his confession.

856
01:23:05,254 --> 01:23:07,324
The case will be closed right away.

857
01:23:13,164 --> 01:23:17,134
<i>A few days ago, suspect Shi was transferred to the department of justice.</i>

858
01:23:17,134 --> 01:23:19,644
<i>What awaits him is the most severe penalty.</i>

859
01:23:19,644 --> 01:23:22,644
<i>That's the full report on the 413 Levee homicide.</i>

860
01:23:22,644 --> 01:23:24,754
<i>Thank you for watching.</i>

861
01:23:30,154 --> 01:23:33,784
Mom, why did they say that in the news?

862
01:23:34,944 --> 01:23:38,064
He is the same as that man. He's not good.

863
01:23:38,064 --> 01:23:40,944
Our neighbor is a good man. He is innocent!

864
01:23:40,944 --> 01:23:43,094
It's not him!

865
01:24:14,655 --> 01:24:17,705
You have solved such a big case. You will get a promotion.

866
01:24:17,705 --> 01:24:19,365
Why are you so downcast?

867
01:24:19,365 --> 01:24:21,665
I'm not in the mood.

868
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:24,965
Two days ago Chen Xiaoxin fainted at school.

869
01:24:24,965 --> 01:24:27,675
How could a child go through that?

870
01:24:27,675 --> 01:24:31,975
All the people involved in this case will need a while to get over it.

871
01:24:36,325 --> 01:24:38,825
I feel something wrong in this case.

872
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:43,205
That day, how did you guess that Shi Hong's real target was me?

873
01:24:43,205 --> 01:24:46,235
It suddenly occurred to me that he mentioned the blind-point question.

874
01:24:46,235 --> 01:24:50,305
"It seems to be a geometric problem, actually it's a function problem."

875
01:24:51,835 --> 01:24:53,815
Sounds like his style.

876
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:58,335
Back in the day, the first question he ever challenged me with was a blind-spot question.

877
01:25:02,035 --> 01:25:05,545
Try to link up the nine dots with four lines.

878
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:12,325
The key to solving this question is to avoid habitual thinking.

879
01:25:12,325 --> 01:25:15,055
You fell into the trap set by the designer;

880
01:25:15,055 --> 01:25:17,235
hence, you failed to solve it.

881
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:21,645
<i>If she kept it on purpose, it could be suspected.</i>

882
01:25:21,645 --> 01:25:23,465
<i>I did fall down in that area last time.</i>

883
01:25:23,465 --> 01:25:25,835
<i>He was on leave for two consecutive mornings when the crime happened.</i>

884
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:27,965
<i>I completely felt like a meaningless gear.</i>

885
01:25:27,965 --> 01:25:31,045
<i>I couldn't tolerate myself like that.</i>

886
01:25:36,145 --> 01:25:37,885
It can't be.

887
01:25:38,965 --> 01:25:41,135
The answer is too simple.

888
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:46,070
How could I have not seen even this?

889
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:47,670
What's wrong?

890
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,590
Maybe we were all wrong.

891
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:53,390
The truth is not at all as we think.

892
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:57,410
What do you mean? Isn't the case very clear now?

893
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:02,310
If uncovering the truth only brings more pain,

894
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,320
then all along...

895
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,190
what on earth have we been after?

896
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:11,310
And what is the meaning of truth?

897
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:52,190
I suppose you still remember who I am.

898
01:27:57,387 --> 01:28:01,257
Today, I'm not here to see you as a policeman.

899
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:05,797
What I am going to say is only my personal guess.

900
01:28:05,797 --> 01:28:07,597
You need not reply.

901
01:28:10,467 --> 01:28:12,807
Your alibi is real.

902
01:28:13,267 --> 01:28:17,327
On the night of April 12, you did see a movie with your daughter;

903
01:28:17,907 --> 01:28:20,507
hence, no matter how the police questioned,

904
01:28:20,507 --> 01:28:23,077
you and your daughter could always answer honestly.

905
01:28:23,077 --> 01:28:25,197
Because you didn't lie.

906
01:28:27,727 --> 01:28:29,777
But you must consider it strange.

907
01:28:30,317 --> 01:28:32,807
Why did you not need to lie?

908
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:35,827
Why did the police only ask about the matters of April 12?

909
01:28:36,607 --> 01:28:41,047
Because it was on the day before, April 11,

910
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:43,007
that you killed Fu Jian.

911
01:28:49,047 --> 01:28:53,647
In fact, you aren't willing to believe that Shi Hong is a psychopathic stalker either. Right?

912
01:28:53,647 --> 01:28:56,527
In your mind, he shouldn't be that kind of man. Right?

913
01:29:00,357 --> 01:29:02,847
You know nothing about the truth.

914
01:29:03,827 --> 01:29:06,657
You can't even imagine what he actually did

915
01:29:06,657 --> 01:29:08,857
to protect you two.

916
01:29:40,907 --> 01:29:43,897
<i>Shi Hong, someone is here for you.</i>

917
01:30:08,188 --> 01:30:11,108
<i>Give me a few minutes. Turn off the surveillance.</i>

918
01:30:19,908 --> 01:30:21,718
Are you still well?

919
01:30:22,978 --> 01:30:25,838
This place is very fitting to research mathematical problems.

920
01:30:29,338 --> 01:30:31,298
You didn't mean to kill me at all.

921
01:30:31,298 --> 01:30:35,818
The car windows were not shattered, which shows that you'd turned the power of the sonic waves to the lowest setting.

922
01:30:35,818 --> 01:30:37,798
Otherwise, I would have long been dead.

923
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,418
You pretended to be a psychopathic stalker

924
01:30:41,418 --> 01:30:43,618
just to protect her.

925
01:30:45,508 --> 01:30:47,528
The first step in solving a problem

926
01:30:47,528 --> 01:30:50,358
is to understand what the real problem is.

927
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,628
My detective friends thought that, in order to solve the case,

928
01:30:53,628 --> 01:30:56,068
they should first invalidate the alibi.

929
01:30:56,068 --> 01:30:58,638
That's how they fell into your trap.

930
01:30:59,658 --> 01:31:01,658
What do you want to say?

931
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:04,538
That body...

932
01:31:05,538 --> 01:31:07,658
is not Fu Jian's at all.

933
01:31:08,778 --> 01:31:12,168
Fu Jian died on the day before the levee homicide,

934
01:31:12,168 --> 01:31:14,548
<i>which was April 11th.</i>

935
01:31:15,078 --> 01:31:17,178
<i>When you intervened,</i>

936
01:31:17,758 --> 01:31:19,878
<i>Fu Jian had already died.</i>

937
01:31:21,268 --> 01:31:24,148
<i>You decided to create an alibi.</i>

938
01:31:24,648 --> 01:31:28,358
<i>On Fu Jian's body you probably found a motel key</i>

939
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:30,648
<i>and his bike-rental card.</i>

940
01:31:31,648 --> 01:31:35,988
<i>On the second day, you went to Fu Jian's motel room first,</i>

941
01:31:35,988 --> 01:31:38,578
<i>erased every trace he left.</i>

942
01:31:38,578 --> 01:31:43,398
<i>Then you found a vagrant with the same shape and size as Fu Jian,</i>

943
01:31:43,398 --> 01:31:46,988
<i>you made him wear Fu Jian's clothes and stay in that room.</i>

944
01:31:49,082 --> 01:31:51,262
<i>So, what was left in that room</i>

945
01:31:51,262 --> 01:31:54,472
<i>was only the vagrant's hair and fingerprints.</i>

946
01:31:57,382 --> 01:32:01,702
<i>You also used Fu Jian's bike-rental card to rent a public bike.</i>

947
01:32:01,702 --> 01:32:05,402
<i>At the set time, the vagrant left the room</i>

948
01:32:05,402 --> 01:32:07,482
<i>to go meet you at the given place.</i>

949
01:32:07,482 --> 01:32:11,412
<i>After you met him, you made him use the public bike you rented.</i>

950
01:32:11,412 --> 01:32:15,602
<i>On the bike, too, the fingerprints left belonged to the vagrant.</i>

951
01:32:16,922 --> 01:32:19,482
<i>You two rode bikes to the levee,</i>

952
01:32:19,482 --> 01:32:21,182
<i>then...</i>

953
01:32:21,912 --> 01:32:23,822
you strangled him.

954
01:32:29,602 --> 01:32:33,212
You smashed his face and made the body unidentifiable.

955
01:32:42,302 --> 01:32:44,442
<i>Then you deliberately burned his fingerprints,</i>

956
01:32:44,442 --> 01:32:46,942
<i>but left other clues of his fingerprints.</i>

957
01:32:46,942 --> 01:32:51,132
The aim was to lead the police into thinking that that corpse was Fu Jian's.

958
01:32:52,152 --> 01:32:54,462
You were on leave for 2 consecutive days.

959
01:32:54,462 --> 01:32:58,052
You used the time to dispose of Fu Jian's corpse.

960
01:32:58,052 --> 01:33:01,332
<i>All of this had been part of your sophisticated calculations,</i>

961
01:33:01,332 --> 01:33:04,852
<i>but you didn't expect that I would appear.</i>

962
01:33:08,872 --> 01:33:12,162
<i>You realized that the truth would be found out sooner or later,</i>

963
01:33:12,872 --> 01:33:16,332
<i>hence, you changed the plan.</i>

964
01:33:16,332 --> 01:33:18,862
You hired someone to attack Teng Kun.

965
01:33:20,552 --> 01:33:24,062
<i>You wrote the letter to intimidate Chen Jing threatening her daughter.</i>

966
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:27,952
While you were sure I would survive, you also attacked me.

967
01:33:29,272 --> 01:33:34,272
You let everyone believe that you were a psychopathic stalker and deserved the punishment.

968
01:33:34,272 --> 01:33:38,662
Because this was the only way that Chen Jing wouldn't turn herself in.

969
01:33:39,192 --> 01:33:43,192
Fu Jian's murder in truth happened on April 11.

970
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:45,862
Shi Hong,

971
01:33:46,782 --> 01:33:49,102
in order to cover all of this,

972
01:33:49,792 --> 01:33:52,372
you killed an innocent person with your hands.

973
01:33:52,372 --> 01:33:54,892
You can draw your own conclusion.

974
01:33:54,892 --> 01:33:56,882
You're free to do so.

975
01:33:57,482 --> 01:33:58,592
I don't understand.

976
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:00,532
On April 12,

977
01:34:00,909 --> 01:34:03,709
a vagrant who lived under the bridge went missing.

978
01:34:03,709 --> 01:34:05,609
His whereabouts are still unknown.

979
01:34:06,329 --> 01:34:07,919
If we can just find his family members,

980
01:34:07,919 --> 01:34:10,209
we can do a DNA test.

981
01:34:10,999 --> 01:34:13,909
Then the identity of the victim of the levee homicide

982
01:34:13,909 --> 01:34:16,299
will emerge.

983
01:34:24,849 --> 01:34:27,749
Even if your assumptions are correct,

984
01:34:27,749 --> 01:34:31,019
finding your so-called vagrant's family members

985
01:34:31,849 --> 01:34:34,229
would be like dredging for a needle in the sea.

986
01:34:36,519 --> 01:34:39,149
The case is almost settled.

987
01:34:39,939 --> 01:34:44,549
No matter what verdict the judge gives, I will not appeal.

988
01:34:44,549 --> 01:34:48,649
Fu Jian's homicide ends here.

989
01:34:57,549 --> 01:34:59,459
What a pity!

990
01:35:01,669 --> 01:35:03,839
Such a bright mind as yours,

991
01:35:04,579 --> 01:35:07,079
in fact, was used for this.

992

Everything started because of me. It's all my fault!

If anyone, they should have caught me.
