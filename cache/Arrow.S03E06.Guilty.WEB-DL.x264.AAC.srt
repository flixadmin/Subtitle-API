1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,660
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,100
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,940
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,670
To save my city.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,770
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,140
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,850
To the rest
of Starling city,

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,610
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,120
I am something else.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,750
Previously, on "arrow"...

11
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,020
My sister. She was murdered,
and I can't tell anyone.

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,720
See, before, Laurel,
you were swinging
at your sister's killer.

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,590
Don't train for
that. All right,
train for yourself.

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,030
Oliver: The serum that
you were exposed to,

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,860
It changes your body
but it also warps your mind.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,570
You're not moving
very quickly this morning.

17
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,070
I just didn't sleep
much last night.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,370
What are you doing here?

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,050
Oliver: Roy!

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,490
Where'd you go?

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,420
Sorry.

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,320
Get your head
in the game.

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,990
So is the culebra cartel
and their gajillion
pounds of heroin.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,700
They all showed up
about 30 minutes ago

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,000
And they haven't moved
from your location.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,300
Oliver:
Copy that.

27
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,630
No sentries
outside.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,940
If we're going
to do this, we need
to do it now.

29
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,310
I've got
north entrance,
dig's got south.

30
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,710
Roy...
East.

31
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,080
The roof.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,480
You're on
over watch.

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,850
The culebras
get their weapons
from the bratva.

34
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,880
All military grade.

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,380
I've got your backs.

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,120
Let's do this.

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,660
South is clear.

38
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,960
Nobody's home.

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Roof's clear.

40
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,270
North is empty, too.

41
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,800
That doesn't make sense.
They all showed up

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,170
Half an hour ago
and never left.

43
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,340
They are in there somewhere.
[beep]

44
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,990
Looks like somebody
beat us here.

45
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,990
There's at least
a few million dollars
worth of heroin.

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,370
[speaking spanish]

47
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,840
He took paco.

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,910
Whoever did this
ignored the drugs,

49
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,010
Took a gang member.

50
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,610
This was personal.

51
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,380
Yeah, more than that.

52
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,990
Whoever did this was
trying to send a message.

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,360
I think I know
what it is.

54
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,140
Guilty. Well, yeah.

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,810
The culebras
are the bloodiest
gang in Starling.

56
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,080
Who's the second bloodiest?

57
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,150
Culebras have
a long standing rivalry
with the los halcones.

58
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,510
Thought you said this was
personal, not business.

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,920
There are only 86,000
pacos in Starling,

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,450
Give or take 5,000
for a few nicknames.

61
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,990
Something tells me
that the culebra's

62
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,190
Long standing rivals will
narrow that down for us.

63
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,630
You know, when we find
paco, he'll be too
dead to say anything.

64
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm not looking
for him. I'm looking
for whoever did this.

65
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,400
I will handle this.

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
Take the rest of the night.
I'll back you up.

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,200
Not dead on your feet,
you won't.

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,270
I'm sorry. I know
I've been a little
out of it recently.

69
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,210
Don't be sorry.
Be rested.

70
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:39,310
If I let you get killed
because your reaction
time is slow, ok?

71
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,620
There are a lot of halcones
members in Starling city.

72
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,420
How about I take
the ones north
of tenth street.

73
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,900
Oliver: You know,
we've been waiting
here an hour.

74
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,270
After walking around
the block five times.

75
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,570
We need to work
on your patience.

76
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,070
Where is this guy?
And more importantly,

77
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,740
How is he going to help us
find out what this...

78
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,640
China white person is--

79
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,080
Chien na wei.
Whatever!

80
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,450
How is he going
to help us find out what
she's doing in Hong Kong?

81
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,450
Waller hasn't been
able to locate
chien na wei

82
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,420
Because she avoids
using any traceable
forms of communication.

83
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,990
So he's the target now?

84
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,820
He's her delivery guy.

85
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,830
Her courier. But
he's not a target.

86
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,590
Waller doesn't want
you to kill him.

87
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,360
That's refreshing.

88
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,970
They'll use
a dead drop.

89
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,700
Leave behind
information
for chien's network.

90
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,440
Information
waller intercepts.

91
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,340
I see him.

92
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,650
Stay on bluetooth.

93
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,250
I'll be right
behind you.

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Ahh!
What was that?

95
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,220
Did he make you?

96
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,390
Yeah, I think he did.

97
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,580
He's gone.
Where is it?

98
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,450
Where's what?
The envelope.

99
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,750
The message.
We need it!

100
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,620
He must have stashed it
somewhere while you were
chasing him.

101
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,080
I didn't see him
stash anything!

102
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,590
Yes, you did.
You just don't
know it yet.

103
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,560
That's not bad.

104
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,200
Yeah. It's better
than I thought.

105
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,340
What the hell
was that?!

106
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,840
Today's lesson.
Fighting's about

107
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,080
Being surprised
and not getting rattled.
You look rattled.

108
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,380
Try angry.

109
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,850
Another lesson, then.

110
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,510
It's not about you
getting knocked
to the mat.

111
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,950
It's if you get up.

112
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,320
Okay, fine.
Then let's go again.

113
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,520
Not tonight.
All right?

114
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,420
I got to
close up shop.

115
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,890
And you need to
get some rest.

116
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Let those
muscles recover.

117
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,300
Make sure you get
some protein within
the hour, all right?

118
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Yeah, egg whites.
They're my new bff.

119
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Oh, that's disgusting.

120
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,040
No, no, no,
two blocks from here--

121
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,140
Korean tacos.

122
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,840
Korean tacos?
Trust me.

123
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,150
They're heaven.
Come on, I'm buying.

124
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,750
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

125
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,180
You just did.

126
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,420
Kidding. What?

127
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,190
You know how to do
a blood test, right?

128
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,760
I know just enough
to make me dangerous.

129
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,460
And, well,
me holding a syringe,

130
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,060
Well, that makes me
more dangerous.

131
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,260
Why?

132
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,800
I need you
to test my blood.

133
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,270
For what?
And don't say stds,

134
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,800
Because that would
be crossing a line.

135
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,270
For Mirakuru.

136
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,870
I don't need
to check you for
traces of Mirakuru.

137
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,570
You were cured.

138
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,470
I know, I--

139
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,380
If this is about
your sleep problems,

140
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,980
Mirakuru makes people
crazy strong

141
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,350
And crazy crazy.
It doesn't make it hard
for them to get 8 hours.

142
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,850
Could you just...

143
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,150
Are you ok?

144
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,360
I mean, besides the whole
not sleeping thing.

145
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,790
Totally.
I'm fine.

146
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,200
I'm just looking
for reasons to help
me sleep, you know?

147
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,960
Ok.

148
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,440
I'm looking for
a crew member
named paco.

149
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,710
Emilio?
Paco!

150
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,250
That's what
they call him, ese!

151
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,710
Paco's his street name!
Who?!

152
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,350
Emilio.

153
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,520
Emilio ortega.

154
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,120
Thank you.

155
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,620
Felicity, I have a name.

156
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,760
Emilio ortega.

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,700
Pinging his cell's gps.

158
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,000
He's in the glades.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,130
Ninth and hasen.

160
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,330
Why'd you kill
all those men?

161
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,430
What the hell are
you talking about?

162
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,700
What are you doing?!

163
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,000
Get out of here.

164
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,670
Oh, my god.

165
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,940
Now, Laurel!

166
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,810
No!

167
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,280
Ted didn't do this.
Ted's been with me

168
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,780
For the past two hours.
He trained with me,

169
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,920
And then we went for dinner.

170
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,420
And that...

171
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,750
He wasn't here when we left.

172
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,230
Ok, that is ten minutes
of my life I am never
getting back.

173
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,470
I'm clean?

174
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,800
Your cholesterol
is a little high
for someone of your age,

175
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,300
But absolutely zero
Mirakuru serum.

176
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,800
Congratulations.

177
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,170
Ahh, thank god.

178
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,040
Ok, you're acting like
I just told you

179
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,710
That the biopsy
came back negative.

180
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,250
What is going on?

181
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,250
It's--it's stupid.

182
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,920
You just had me
test your blood

183
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,390
For a serum you were
cured of six months ago.

184
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,150
I already knew it was stupid.

185
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,690
The reason I haven't
been sleeping

186
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,790
Is 'cause I've been
having dreams,

187
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,430
And not normal ones.

188
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,770
It was like
I was remembering
the time I was out,

189
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,670
You know?

190
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,100
When slade oded me
on the Mirakuru.

191
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,300
What do you remember?

192
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,110
Nothing much.
Just a feeling.

193
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,810
A feeling
of being...

194
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,410
Not me.

195
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,320
And being strong
and out of control,

196
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,120
But here's the thing--

197
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,120
In those dreams...

198
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,290
I killed Sara.

199
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,690
This really had you worried?

200
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,500
Because the dreams,
they didn't feel
like dreams, Felicity.

201
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,130
They felt like memories.

202
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,200
I actually remembered
throwing arrows
into her.

203
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,970
Crazy, right?

204
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,140
[chuckles]

205
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,340
Yeah.

206
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,480
Crazy.

207
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,680
Quentin:
So that's it?

208
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,450
I was with him
the whole time.

209
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,990
You can put me on the box
if you'd like.

210
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,990
If I wanted to give my
daughter a polygraph,

211
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,360
I'd have done it
back when you
discovered beer.

212
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,430
So listen,
what's the story

213
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,300
With you
and this guy,
anyway?

214
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,630
He's just my trainer.

215
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,900
Who you went
to dinner with?
As friends.

216
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,470
But I know him,
and he would never
do something like this.

217
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,800
Well, we've got
to hold him here

218
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,370
Till the coroner's
official findings
come back,

219
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,140
And then if they're
consistent with
his story,

220
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,040
We'll cut him loose.

221
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,630
Well...
Well...

222
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,400
It's like I said.

223
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,460
He didn't do it.

224
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,160
Why would a mass murderer

225
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,570
String up a body in his gym?

226
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,630
Ted caters
to a pretty
rough clientele.

227
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,000
A lot of career
criminals,

228
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,300
Gangbangers.

229
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,210
He runs afoul of one
every now and again.

230
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,340
He thinks someone
was trying to send
him a message.

231
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,950
Who?
He says
he doesn't know.

232
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,610
I want to talk to him.

233
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,890
Two weeks ago, I said
I wouldn't train you to fight.

234
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,390
Now you have a trainer.

235
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,560
Who's training me
to box, to let off
some steam.

236
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,490
I think I have
a pretty good reason
to have some.

237
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,430
Keep your eyes open
with this guy.

238
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,930
He didn't do this.

239
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,630
Just the same.

240
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,350
Why are you sitting like that?

241
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,550
I'm concentrating.

242
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,220
Because I need
to remember something.
Why?

243
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,030
Try this.

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,870
Pay attention.

245
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,750
Remember where
the matching one is?

246
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,190
See, your memory's fine.

247
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,930
Maseo: He needs your help.

248
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,430
You need my help.

249
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,630
You know I don't
like your friend.

250
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,100
This gaijin,
he is trouble.

251
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Well, I need him
to remember what he saw.

252
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,970
When we capture chien na wei,
my debt is paid.

253
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,840
All I care about

254
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,080
Is us getting home.

255
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,150
Then help me.

256
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,020
I love you.

257
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,490
You know that, right?

258
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,690
Oh, come on,
you must be cheating.

259
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm just better
at this than you.

260
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,230
Akio.

261
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,430
[speaking Japanese]

262
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,640
We were just
playing a game.

263
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:37,080
I will house you,
feed you,
and clothe you.

264
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,250
But my son
is off limits.

265
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,190
Fine.

266
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,120
Stay!

267
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,760
What are you doing?

268
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,230
I'm helping you.

269
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,000
Now...

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do exactly
as I say.

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,740
You ever heard
of this ted grant?

272
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,870
Yeah, I saw his title
fight a few years
back on pay per view.

273
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,280
They call him wild cat.
He's the real deal.

274
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,440
Body in his gym
was strung up the same way

275
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,250
That the bodies
in the warehouse were.

276
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,850
Like punching bags.

277
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,320
What if Laurel
vouches for him?

278
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,380
I don't think that Laurel
is seeing clearly on this one.

279
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,420
If grant's our doer,
he's more than boxer.

280
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,760
I hacked csu's files
on the warehouse
murders.

281
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,230
The culebras were
armed to the teeth,

282
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,130
But the killer,
the psycho
mass murder guy,

283
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,200
Never fired a shot.

284
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,100
They were beaten
to death by
brass knuckles.

285
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,970
It's a pretty specific m.O.

286
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,500
It matches one murder
from six years ago.

287
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,800
Same as tonight,
culebra drug dealer.

288
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,640
Blunt force trauma,
consistent with
brass knuckles

289
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,840
Worn by a left-handed
assailant.

290
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,440
Let me guess--
ted "wild cat"
grant's a lefty.

291
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,280
They called him
the Starling southpaw.

292
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,410
Well, scpd never
put that together,

293
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,050
Because ted
was never arrested.

294
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,880
[beep]
he's moving.

295
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,220
You dinged him
with a tracer?

296
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,560
Just because Laurel trusts
him doesn't mean I have to.

297
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,520
Talk me in.

298
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,310
[both grunting]

299
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,890
Second time
I've found you
with a body!

300
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,630
I've never killed anybody.
I'm being set up.

301
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,790
Why should
I believe you?!

302
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,300
Because I used to be
a vigilante.

303
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,730
I used to be you.

304
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,440
This city's been hurting
long before you showed up.

305
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,140
I've never heard
of another vigilante
in Starling.

306
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,650
It was six years ago.

307
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,380
I wasn't news--
I stuck to the glades.

308
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,180
And these
are supposed
to convince me?

309
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,590
Masks are also
useful for
serial killers.

310
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,490
Says a guy currently
wearing one.

311
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,290
Who's that?

312
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,560
I don't know.
I've never seen him
before in my life.

313
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,830
But this was hung
around the body

314
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,330
That was found in my gym.

315
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,970
The key is
to the storage locker.

316
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,670
He's leaving me
a trail to follow.

317
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,140
Who is?

318
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,440
Whoever's setting me up.

319
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,110
Look, I've never
killed anyone.

320
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,380
Except for that drug
dealer that you beat
to death six years ago.

321
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,780
That was a mistake.

322
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,550
I may have
avoided jail,
but I have lived

323
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,190
With the guilt
of that man's death

324
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,790
Every single day
of my life.

325
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,490
I gave it all up
after that.

326
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,730
I locked this place up
and I swore I'd never
open it again.

327
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,800
Who else knows
about the locker?

328
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,970
No one.

329
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,500
This is where
I kept my supplies.

330
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,400
A safe place
separate
from my day job.

331
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,610
I'm sure you've got
one just like it.

332
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,710
Mine's bigger.

333
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,610
Look, we're both
trying to find out

334
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,510
Who the hell's
doing this.

335
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,780
We could help
each other.

336
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,210
Laurel: His name
is albert mancini.

337
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,020
No criminal record,
aside from a few
unpaid parking tickets.

338
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,720
Grant says he doesn't
know who this guy is.

339
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,020
Oh, and now you believe him?
I haven't decided yet!

340
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,490
Do you know that
you're training
with a vigilante?

341
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,260
Former, apparently.
And no, I didn't.

342
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,400
I didn't!
So you also didn't know

343
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,870
That six years
ago, he beat
someone to death?

344
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,230
How many more reasons

345
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,440
Am I going to have
to give you

346
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,400
Before you stay away
from this guy?

347
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,140
Ok, you know what,
are you guys
just about finished

348
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,310
With your little
private chat?

349
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,680
The guy from your storage unit,

350
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,950
He has no criminal record.

351
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,650
He was a magician.
Magician's assistant,

352
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,880
More accurately.
He worked with a local act

353
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,550
Before getting cut loose.

354
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,090
Mancini hasn't worked since.

355
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,560
Culebra cartel,
magician's assistant.

356
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,830
What's the connection?

357
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,390
Their act was
at the sansa bar.

358
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,960
The sansa bar's
where's the drug
dealer was murdered.

359
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,970
You mean the person
you beat to death?

360
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,040
Whoever's doing this
is leaving me
a trail to follow.

361
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,140
Then we follow it.

362
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,210
We need another minute.

363
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,140
How do you two
know each other?

364
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,510
We used to date.

365
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,320
You cannot be serious.

366
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,390
I am not on
your team.

367
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,390
I don't work for you.
Exactly. You're untrained.

368
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,990
Oh, who's fault is that?

369
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,460
[exhales]

370
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,700
Does he know?

371
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,100
What's driving you?

372
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,700
I told him...

373
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,440
That Sara's gone.

374
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,540
But does he know

375
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,310
That you want to follow
in her footsteps?

376
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,340
You're playing a very
dangerous game, Laurel.

377
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,140
I can handle it.

378
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,510
No, you can't.

379
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,110
Because you haven't realized

380
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,620
That it's not actually a game.

381
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,050
Let's go.

382
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
What about Laurel?

383
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,560
She's not coming.

384
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,930
Oliver has a 20
on our killer.

385
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,830
I thought Oliver
was tracking grant.

386
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,970
Looks like things
have changed.

387
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,070
Suit up, he wants us
to provide back-up.

388
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,870
Roy can't go.
What?

389
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,440
I need to talk
to you about
something important.

390
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,140
It can wait.
No, it can't. John?

391
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,110
I'll take care
of it.

392
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,750
What the hell is that about?

393
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,580
We need to talk.

394
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,320
Yeah, you made that
pretty clear.

395
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,250
Before we buried Sara,
I scanned her body

396
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,390
Using portable magnetic
resonance imaging.

397
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,420
Felicity, you're really
starting to freak me out.

398
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,490
I basically created
a virtual autopsy.

399
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,390
It's not as good as
a regular autopsy,

400
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,960
But like when I can use
it to determine things
an autopsy would,

401
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,900
Like angle of tack,
trajectory,

402
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,300
And the force
of the arrows.

403
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,770
Felicity, what are you saying?

404
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,310
There were certain
things about
the forensics

405
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,040
That I couldn't
reconcile with,

406
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,310
Specifically,
the angle

407
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,680
And the velocity
of the arrows
were not consistent

408
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,210
With a normal bow
or archer

409
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,180
But if the arrows
were thrown with
Mirakuru force...

410
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,420
What if there was
some residual Mirakuru
in your system?

411
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,560
It would explain
the forensics.

412
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,260
The angle
and the force
of the arrows.

413
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,560
But you said that
I tested negative
for Mirakuru.

414
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,200
There isn't any in
your blood today,

415
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,000
But if one last
Mirakuru episode

416
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,770
Burned down
any remnants
in your system...

417
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,470
"episode?"

418
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,140
You mean...

419
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,910
Me killing Sara.

420
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,420
I'm onsite.

421
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,760
Copy. Keep watching
the perimeter.

422
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,660
How many partners
do you have, anyway?

423
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,630
The culebras.
The body in your gym,

424
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,160
The body in your storage locker.

425
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,530
Someone's gone
to a lot of trouble

426
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,900
To frame you for murders
and bring you here.

427
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,670
Why? What does all this
have to do with one killing

428
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,540
Six years ago?

429
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,410
Hello, ted.

430
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,970
I see you got my messages.

431
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,510
Arrows.

432
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,420
I never knew why
we couldn't just use
a gun the way they did.

433
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,550
Because we're better
than they are.

434
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,920
At least we're
supposed to be.

435
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,790
That's almost ironic,
coming from you.

436
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,760
I trusted you!

437
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,970
[siren]
scpd!

438
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,800
Ted grant,
you are under arrest

439
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,640
For multiple counts
of homicide.

440
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,140
Officer: Don't move!

441
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,870
What are you
talkin' about?

442
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,580
I didn't do this.
Yeah?

443
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,280
Tell that to
the stiff we found
in your locker.

444
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,510
Let's go.

445
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,090
Sorry he got past me.
He knew an exit
out of the building

446
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,520
That wasn't on any
of the blueprints

447
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,690
That Felicity
hooked me up with.

448
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,430
You had ted grant
arrested?

449
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,160
Your father's men
found him at a crime scene.

450
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,860
Another body was found
at a storage locker
that he owns,

451
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,730
Along with evidence
of past vigilantism.

452
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,270
No. He's innocent.
I know.

453
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,500
I saw the person
who's doing this.

454
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,710
Who is it?
[exhales]

455
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,310
He was wearing
ted's old gear.
Full face mask.

456
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,480
Let's go.

457
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,450
Clearly grant knows
who's behind the mask.

458
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,250
Oliver.

459
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,050
Laurel.

460
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,120
What's up?

461
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,020
I have to--

462
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,290
Roy, don't. Let's just--

463
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,560
I need to tell you
something.

464
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,100
Ok?

465
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,260
I...

466
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,770
I killed Sara.

467
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,740
That doesn't...

468
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,310
You're not making any sense.

469
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,150
Why would you kill Sara?

470
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,080
It was the Mirakuru.

471
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,850
Roy had no memory
of the attack.

472
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,990
No real memory, at least.
But he's been recalling

473
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,290
Fragments of his Mirakuru
exposure last year.

474
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,390
That, and suppressed
memories

475
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,890
Often resurface in dreams.

476
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,330
This is insane.

477
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,830
Laurel, I am so
sorry. I'm really--

478
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,770
Don't!

479
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,710
Wait, Roy,
where do you think
you're going?

480
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,610
Let him go.

481
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,090
I thought he was cured.

482
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,760
What we know
about Mirakuru
is vastly outweighed

483
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
By the things
we don't know.

484
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,290
What does that even mean?

485
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,230
That Roy killed my sister
and it's not his fault?

486
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,800
The arrows that killed Sara,

487
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,200
We pulled dna off of them,
didn't we?

488
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,540
I tested it
against the sample
of Roy's blood.

489
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,140
It was the first
thing I did.

490
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,740
And?

491
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,040
The results
were inconclusive.

492
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,280
I can't process
this right now.

493
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,850
[sighs]

494
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,090
Hey.

495
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,290
Hey.

496
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,220
Look at me.

497
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,420
Focus on what you can process.

498
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,060
Ted knows
who we're coming after.

499
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,860
I need you
to find out who it is.

500
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,960
I can't. I can't. If Roy
killed Sara, then--

501
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,770
If Roy killed Sara, then...

502
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,970
We will deal with it.

503
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,710
For right now, I need you

504
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,510
To deal with ted.

505
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,180
Ok?

506
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,620
Ok.

507
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,560
How sure are you?

508
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,970
There's other
forensic evidence.

509
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,240
A virtual autopsy,
in light of what
Roy's described,

510
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,200
It sounds
incriminating.

511
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:18,340
That, and his trouble
sleeping started right
when Sara was killed.

512
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,950
My husband says you
are having problems

513
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,860
Remembering
what you saw
earlier today.

514
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,890
That's the problem.

515
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,830
I didn't see anything.

516
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,460
You see and hear far
more than you think.

517
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,100
Hidden truths,

518
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,200
Very deep in
your sub-conscious.

519
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,500
You saw something,
but your head
is too busy.

520
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,040
You need
to quiet it.

521
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,180
Close your eyes.

522
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,380
Take a deep breath.

523
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,290
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

524
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,460
In...

525
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,920
And out.

526
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,960
And again.

527
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,000
You're floating,
in nothingness.

528
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,430
All that exists
is your breath.

529
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,670
Any thoughts you
have are clouds.

530
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,440
They just
drift away.

531
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,610
I remember.

532
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,920
16 murders.

533
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,290
17, counting the one
from six years ago.

534
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,890
That's more than
the son of sam,
less than bundy.

535
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,030
Probably worth
a mini-series,
huh? Maybe a book?

536
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,670
You became
a defense attorney?

537
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,640
Can I talk to him
for a minute?

538
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,440
[exhales]

539
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,550
You sure can
pick 'em.

540
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,790
You ok?

541
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,260
I'm not the one facing
a lifetime in prison.

542
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,760
Who framed you?

543
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,730
I don't know.

544
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,430
I can't help you
if you're going
to keep lying to me.

545
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,010
The arrow saw you
with him. He knows
you know who it is.

546
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,110
If the d.A.'s office
refuses to seek
an indictment,

547
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,810
The police have
to release you.

548
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,420
But first...

549
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,620
I'm going
to need you to be
straight with me.

550
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,450
Who was the man
behind the mask?

551
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,030
His name's isaac Stanzler.

552
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,500
Six years ago,
the culebras
ran the glades.

553
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,630
I thought it would be
a good idea for families
to be able to live there

554
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,600
Without worrying
about their kids
getting shot.

555
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,340
So I decided to do
something about it.

556
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,810
You became
a vigilante.

557
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,540
Just like your friend
in the green hood--

558
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,480
Without the green hood.

559
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,680
And what about
Stanzler?

560
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,050
You know the guy
the arrow's been

561
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,820
Running around with lately?
The one in red?

562
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,450
Stanzler was my guy in red.

563
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,290
I guess you can call him
my apprentice.

564
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,090
And one night,
we decided to go after

565
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,830
This drug dealer that was
pushing crank near the school.

566
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,030
We tracked him all the way
to this nightclub.

567
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,370
And what happened?

568
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,270
That drug dealer...

569
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,110
Isaac got to him first.

570
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,280
That murder from
six years ago...

571
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,250
That wasn't you,
that was him.

572
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,290
[sighs] I hung it up after that.

573
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,390
What about Stanzler?

574
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,220
What happened
to isaac Stanzler?

575
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,130
I told him to get
the hell out of Starling.

576
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,700
That I never wanted
to see his face ever again.

577
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,100
I cut him loose.

578
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,070
That's why I've been
lying to you this
whole time, Laurel.

579
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,380
Everything
that's happening
is my fault.

580
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,980
No word from Laurel?

581
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,550
Not yet.

582
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,650
But according
to scpd email traffic,

583
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,090
Which I may or may not
have hacked into,

584
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,790
They are dropping
the charges
against ted grant.

585
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,860
Oliver, let me go after Roy.

586
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,630
If he's experiencing
Mirakuru side effects,

587
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,630
We can't leave him
running around.

588
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,600
So you bring him in.

589
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,730
Then what?

590
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,230
Oliver,
this crusade of ours,

591
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,600
It's supposed to be about
justice, right?

592
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,740
So if that's supposed
to mean something,

593
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,370
We can have two sets of rules--

594
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,040
One for the bad guys
and one for us.

595
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,780
I'm the one
who brought Roy
into this crusade.

596
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,480
And maybe it's time
for you to cut him loose.

597
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,350
Are you telling me
to abandon him?

598
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,150
Yes, Oliver.

599
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,320
If that's what it takes
to find justice for Sara.

600
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,830
So what do you think
Stanzler's next move is?

601
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,100
Well, framing me
didn't work.

602
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,670
I'm almost afraid
to think of what he
might try to do next.

603
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,500
What I should have
done from the start.

604
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,310
After you abandoned me,
the culebra family,

605
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,940
They wanted payback
for the man they lost.

606
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,180
They tortured me
for months
before I escaped.

607
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,750
Isaac, I'm so sorry.

608
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,180
I didn't know.

609
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,190
You have every
right to hate me.

610
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,350
But come on,
let's talk about this.

611
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,760
Oh, don't worry,
we will.

612
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,330
There's so much
I have to say
before I kill you.

613
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,340
Where are we going?

614
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,510
Just drive!

615
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,940
Hey, your beef is with me.

616
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,510
Ok, you got me. Let her go.

617
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,680
Taking innocent people hostage?

618
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,080
Man, I taught you better
than that.

619
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,690
They're not people,
they're criminals.

620
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,620
Albert mancini wasn't.
You still strung him up

621
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,920
In that nightclub.
You taught me that

622
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,460
There are no innocents
when you abandoned me
to the culebras.

623
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,100
You gave me
direction, purpose.

624
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,870
And then when things
got tough, when
I really needed you,

625
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,970
You weren't there.

626
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,200
[cell phone vibrating]
it's Laurel.

627
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,500
Put her on speaker.

628
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,410
Isaac: I hated you
so much for that.

629
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,670
That voice,
that's him.

630
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,410
I was just a kid.
You were supposed
to know better.

631
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,150
Call's coming
from Laurel's cell.

632
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,320
Moving fast,
45 miles an hour.
They're in her car.

633
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,280
They're headed north
on route 17.

634
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,020
Keep that line open.

635
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,650
Isaac, I'm sorry.

636
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,890
I had no idea!

637
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,530
Eyes on the road!

You're not

I wouldn't

I think you're helpless.

Why didn't you tell me?

747
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,950
Because you were
overdosed on Mirakuru,

You didn't remember,
and I was hoping
that you never would.

But then Felicity told
me you had the dream

That you killed Sara,
and I realized...

It was a memory.

752
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,600
I think because
of the way Sara
was murdered,

753
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,100
The fact
they used arrows...

00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,810
Brought it
to the surface.

755

So I didn't kill Sara.

It's the art
of concealing a message

In this case,

Yeah? And why
would I do that?

781
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,070
Because I just made sure
your past vigilantism

00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,270
Fell under the statute
of limitations.

No new charges will be filed.

But you still
shouldn't be here.

No, this is exactly
where I should be.

Last night when isaac
had me at gunpoint

788
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,350
And when he was shooting
at my friends,

789
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,950
I should have
been so scared.

Rattled.

00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,220
But I wasn't.

792
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,260
I saw what needed
to be done, and I did it.

793
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,830
I've just been
teaching you how
to throw a proper jab.

794

And your pal robin hood
doesn't want me
even doing that.

I want you
to give me the tools

To avenge my sister's death.

00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,410
I want you to teach me
to get justice outside
of a courtroom.

798
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,040
I took on
an apprentice once.

799
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,710
