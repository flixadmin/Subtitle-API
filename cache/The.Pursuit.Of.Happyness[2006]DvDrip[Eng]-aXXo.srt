1
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,081
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:39,201
-All right, Dad.
-Come on.

3
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,921
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,561
-I think I should make a list.
-What do mean?

5
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,161
-For your birthday gifts?
-Yeah.

6
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:43,881
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:48,161
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:51,321
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:53,721
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:57,521
-I think so.
-All right. That's good.

11
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:04,361
-How you doing in here, man?
-Okay.

12
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:14,561
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:18,841
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,601
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:23,401
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,481
Excuse me.

17
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:31,001
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:33,441
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:39,041
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:42,641
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an l.

21
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,801
I'm Chris Gardner.

22
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:50,321
I met my father for the first time
when I was 28 years old.

23
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:52,761
And I made up my mind
as a young kid...

24
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,521
...that when I had children...

25
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:58,041
...my children were gonna know
who their father was.

26
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:02,681
This is part of my life story.

27
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:06,841
This part is called "Riding the Bus. "

28
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:15,001
What's that?

29
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:17,841
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,241
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:23,521
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:24,921
This machine...

33
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:26,641
...this machine on my lap--

34
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:28,801
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:32,081
He travels in the past
with this machine and....

36
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:34,521
--it is not a time machine.

37
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,681
It's a portable
bone-density scanner.

38
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:41,161
A medical device I sell for a living.

39
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:43,841
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,161
-I appreciate it.
-We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,121
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,481
-Well, maybe next--
-Thank you.

43
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:56,641
It gave a slightly denser picture
than an x-ray for twice the money.

44
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,241
-Hey.
-Hey, baby.

45
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:03,121
-What happened?
-No, nothing.

46
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,881
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,601
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:09,561
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,921
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:15,721
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:18,041
-Yes.
-And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:21,801
-What are you gonna do about that?
-Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:30,321
You see that car? The one
with the pretty yellow shoe on it?

54
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:31,881
That's mine.

55
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:34,041
There's no parking near hospitals.

56
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:36,721
That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.

57
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,841
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,001
-Maybe next quarter.
-It's possible.

59
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:48,401
I needed to sell at least two scanners
a month for rent and daycare.

60
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,641
I'd have to sell one more...

61
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:54,601
...to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.

62
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,401
The problem is...

63
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,801
...I haven't sold any for a while.

64
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:11,161
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:13,921
Since birth?

66
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,401
-What's that?
-What?

67
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:21,721
-What is this?
-It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,401
-From who?
-Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:27,721
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:29,921
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:33,721
Make every side the same color.

72
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,321
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:40,721
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:45,681
-You already filed an extension.
-Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,761
That's-- It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,081
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,641
-And a penalty?
-Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:54,881 --> 00:08:00,481
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,881
-Come here. Calm down.
-I have to go back to work.

80
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:16,521
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:20,161
A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for...

82
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:24,081
...a comprehensive audit, if you will,
of our economic condition.

83
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:27,481
You won't like it. I didn't like it.

84
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,361
But we have to face the truth...

85
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:32,201
...and then go to work
to turn things around.

86
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:36,161
And make no mistake about it,
we can turn them around.

87
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:39,481
The federal budget is out of control.

88
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:43,041
And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion...

89
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:46,681
...for this budget year
that ends September 30th.

90
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:52,121
That deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1 957.

91
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:54,881
And so is the almost $80 billion...

92
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:59,401
... we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.

93
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,561
Twenty years ago, in 1 960...

94
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:06,921
...our federal government payroll
was less than $ 1 3 billion.

95
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:09,841
Today it is 75 billion.

96
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:15,601
During these 20 years, our population
has only increased by 23. 3 percent....

97
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:36,521
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:39,841
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,481
-I'm a stockbroker.
-Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:46,641
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:50,601
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:53,201
-That's it.
-Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,481
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:58,161
-But I need it back for Monday.
-Feed the meter.

105
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:07,721
I still remember that moment.

106
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:16,681
They all looked
so damn happy to me.

107
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:26,241
Why couldn't I look like that?

108
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,201
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:48,521
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:52,001
-For what?
-I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,841
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:57,361
You know, when l--

113
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:00,201
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:03,761
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:06,801
What job?

116
00:11:09,761 --> 00:11:11,481
Stockbroker.

117
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:17,001
-Stockbroker?
-Yeah.

118
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,401
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:37,881
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:42,801
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,721
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:47,641
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,041
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:54,001
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:56,081
Probably not.

126
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:58,761
We're already two months behind.

127
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,001
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:06,601
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:11,321
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:15,201
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:18,641
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:20,241
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,761
What's the matter with you?

134
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,641
Linda.

135
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:31,721
Linda.

136
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:03,841
This part of my life
is called "Being Stupid. "

137
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,161
Can I ask you a favor, miss?

138
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:11,241
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:13,921
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,161
...Iooking smalltime.

141
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:21,441
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:24,921
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:30,041
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right?

144
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:40,081
-Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
-Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:41,601
-Come with me.
-Yes, sir.

146
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:44,561
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:48,001
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:50,881
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,161
I mean, I'm-- You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:56,321
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so....

151
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:59,561
Normally I have a resume sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:03,161
-We....
-Thank you very much.

153
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:04,521
I need to go.

154
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:06,841
I'll bring this back.

155
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:10,201
-Thank you.
-Okay.

156
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:21,081
Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.
Why did I do that?

157
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,921
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:28,561
Like I said, this part of my life
is called "Being Stupid. "

159
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:36,441
Hey!. Hey!. Hey!. Don't move!.
Don't move!. Stay--!.

160
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,761
Stop!. Stop!.

161
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:50,161
Don't move!.
Stop this--!. Stop the train!

162
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,521
Stop! Stop!

163
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:12,161
The program took just 20 people
every six months.

164
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,441
One got the job.

165
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:21,361
There were three blank lines after
"high school" to list more education.

166
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,721
I didn't need that many lines.

167
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:33,761
T ry and sleep. It's late.

168
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:47,361
It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches
by 3 inches on each side...

169
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:50,001
...made up of multiple colors
that you twist and turn...

170
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,801
...and try to get
to a solid color on each side.

171
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:56,641
This little cube
is the gift sensation of 1 98 1.

172
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:58,241
Don't expect to solve it easily.

173
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:00,881
Although we did encounter
one math professor at USF...

174
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:03,561
... who took just 30 minutes on his.

175
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:06,001
This is as far as I've gotten
on mine.

176
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:09,601
As you can see,
I still have a long way to go.

177
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,401
This is Jim Finnerty reporting
for KJSF in Richmond.

178
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:15,321
Hey, wake up.

179
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,041
Eat.

180
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,641
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, baby.

181
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:23,841
-Come back without that, please.
-Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,961
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:29,601
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:31,761
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

185
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,041
Bye, Mom.

186
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,921
Bye.

187
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,721
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:43,041
-ls it an adjective?
-No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,001
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:48,801
-ls "fuck" spelled right?
-Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:52,121
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:57,241
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:16:57,441 --> 00:17:00,321
-But just don't use that one, okay?
-Okay.

194
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,681
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,961
My nickname.

196
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:06,761
We pick nicknames.

197
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:10,361
-Oh, yeah? What's it say?
-"Hot Rod."

198
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:15,361
-Did you have a nickname?
-Yep.

199
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,321
-What?
-"Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:21,441
-What's that?
-I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:26,241
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:30,041
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:32,761
-Hoss wears that hat.
-Hoss?

204
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,761
Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.

205
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:38,721
-How do you know Bonanza?
-We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:42,521
-You watch Bonanza at daycare?
-Yeah.

207
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:45,641
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:49,521
-After snack? After your nap?
-After Love Boat.

209
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,601
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:01,881
-Yeah, what'd you put on there?
-A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:09,761
-He says he's been watching TV.
-Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:13,081
-Love Boat?
-For history. Navy.

213
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,561
That's not the Navy.

214
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,881
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:22,441
We're paying you $1 50 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:25,041
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:29,041
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:36,121
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:41,441
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,121
Bye.

221
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:31,401
I was waiting for
Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...

222
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:37,121
...whose name sounded so delightful,
like he'd give me a job and a hug.

223
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:41,321
I just had to show him I was good
with numbers and good with people.

224
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:43,081
-Morning, Mr. Twistle.
-Good morning.

225
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:44,721
-Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
-Hi.

226
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:47,721
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

227
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:51,321
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:53,721
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

229
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,761
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

230
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:59,921
-Yes, sir. You have a great day.
-You too.

231
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:08,561
Hey, yeah, how you doing?

232
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:10,961
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:13,321
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

234
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:17,041
I was wondering if--
Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:19,801
Right. We can still--? Half an hour?

236
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:23,681
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:36,361
Hey! Hey!

238
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:38,841
Hey!

239
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,401
This part of my life...

240
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:43,281
-Wait!
-...this part here...

241
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:46,481
...it's called "Running. "

242
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:48,641
Hey! Hey!

243
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:50,401
Wait!

244
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:54,121
Hey! Wait!

245
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,721
That was my stolen machine.

246
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,961
Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.

247
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:01,761
Which was unlikely...

248
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,601
...because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.

249
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:07,481
I spent our entire life savings
on these things.

250
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:13,481
It was such
a revolutionary machine.

251
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,041
-Can you feel it, baby?
-Oh, yeah.

252
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:17,801
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:20,521
What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals...

254
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:24,601
...would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.

255
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:30,681
I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.

256
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:36,841
So if I lost one, it was like losing
a month's groceries.

257
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:42,721
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:48,281
Hey, get back here!

259
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:55,361
Hey, man, l--

260
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:59,521
-Who's he?
-He's that guy....

261
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:13,921
-Did you forget?
-Forget what?

262
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:17,361
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

263
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:20,801
-Yeah, I know.
-You have two now.

264
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:32,681
Hey.

265
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:37,281
Hey, Mom.

266
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:46,481
One, two, three!

267
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:50,681
-That's a basketball!
-Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:52,601
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

269
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,721
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

270
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,401
-No, it's not.
-There, there.

271
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:02,881
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:13,161
-That paper's a little heavy, huh?
-Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:26,961
You should've seen me
out there today.

274
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:29,681
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down--

275
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:31,481
Whatever.

276
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:36,161
-What?
-Whatever, Chris.

277
00:23:36,721 --> 00:23:38,561
What the hell
you got attitude about?

278
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:41,561
-"Whatever" what?
-Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:43,121
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:45,641
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

281
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,281
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:49,881
-I'm trying to keep a clean house.
-Hey, wait a second.

283
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:52,841
Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,401
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:01,401
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "lt'll be fine."

286
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:06,601
-So you don't trust me now?
-Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,001
-Taxi!
-Mr. Twistle.

288
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,881
-Yeah, hi.
-Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,921
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:32,201
I submitted an application for the
intern program about a month ago...

291
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:34,641
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly--

292
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,801
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:40,281
-Take care of yourself.
-Mr. Twistle.

294
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:42,881
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,801
How about we share a ride?

296
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,481
-All right, get in.
-All right.

297
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:57,321
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:24:57,521 --> 00:25:00,361
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:05,201
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,961
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:12,441
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and....

302
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:16,721
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important--

303
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:19,121
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,321
-I can do it.
-No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:26,201
-That's bullshit.
-No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:29,841
-No, you can't.
-Let me see it.

307
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:31,641
Give it here.

308
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:38,921
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,641
Sorry.

310
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:47,161
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the center pieces never move.

311
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:50,441
So if it's yellow in the center,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:53,161
If it's red in the center,
that's the red side.

313
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:57,001
-Okay.
-So.... You can slow down.

314
00:25:57,201 --> 00:26:00,281
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:26:00,481 --> 00:26:02,161
-Yeah, I can.
-No, you can't.

316
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:03,561
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

317
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:05,681
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,841
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:25,041
You almost have this side.

320
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:27,121
Holy cow.

321
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:41,121
-You almost had that one.
-I'm gonna get it.

322
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:50,441
Look at that.

323
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:14,921
You're almost there.

324
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:42,361
-1 7.1 0.
-This is me.

325
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:45,881
Good job.

326
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:50,801
-Goodbye.
-Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:54,961
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:58,161
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,241
Two-- A couple of blocks.

330
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:06,841
-Just flip around.
-Okay.

331
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:51,521
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:28:51,881 --> 00:28:53,441
-Where are you going? Come here!
-No!

333
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:56,481
-No, no, no!
-You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,001
-Give me my money.
-Please stop.

335
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:00,201
-Please, please, please!
-Son of a bitch.

336
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:03,001
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,721
-Come here!
-I'm sorry.

338
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,641
-I'm so sorry.
-I'll kick your ass!

339
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:10,281
-I'm sorry!
-ldiot.

340
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:22,401
I'll get you!

341
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:26,121
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,601
Hey!

343
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:46,721
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:49,081
Stop him!

345
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:55,001
Stop him!

346
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:01,961
The doors are closing.

347
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:05,001
Please stand clear of the doors.

348
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:16,041
No! No! No!

349
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:20,521
No!

350
00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:46,081
-Hello?
-Hey, yeah.

351
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:47,961
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

352
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:52,401
-Chris, I missed my shift.
-Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,921
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:58,481
I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.

355
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:00,681
-What?
-Did you hear what I said?

356
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:05,481
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

357
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,201
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,001
I'm gonna put the phone down.

359
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,721
-Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold--
-I'm going to leave. We are leaving.

360
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:21,841
It was right then that I started
thinking about Thomas Jefferson...

361
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:25,641
...the Declaration of Independence...

362
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:31,921
...and the part about our right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

363
00:31:32,161 --> 00:31:33,961
And I remember thinking:

364
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:38,561
How did he know
to put the "pursuit" part in there?

365
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:43,441
That maybe happiness is something
that we can only pursue.

366
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:46,681
And maybe we can actually
never have it...

367
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,681
...no matter what.

368
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:50,601
How did he know that?

369
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:58,641
Linda. Linda.

370
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:33,281
-Hello?
-Chris.

371
00:32:33,481 --> 00:32:36,081
-Who is this?
-Jay Twistle.

372
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:38,761
-Hey.
-Dean Witter.

373
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:41,681
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:32:41,881 --> 00:32:44,361
I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?

375
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:45,801
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:48,921
I'll tell you what. Come on by
day after tomorrow, in the morning.

377
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:52,881
We're interviewing for the internships.
You got a pen and paper?

378
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:54,641
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,401
-Hold on one second.
-All right.

380
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:06,401
Hello?

381
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:08,921
-Chris?
-Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,761
Write this number down so you can
call my secretary, Janice.

383
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:14,041
-She can give you all the specifics.
-Yep.

384
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,121
-Okay, 41 5.
-41 5.

385
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:18,001
-864.
-864.

386
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:20,241
-0256.
-0256.

387
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:23,441
-Yeah, extension 4796.
-4796.

388
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:27,921
-Right. Call her tomorrow.
-Yes, sir. 41 5-864-0256.

389
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:29,441
-Okay, buddy.
-All right, yes.

390
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,801
-Thank you very much.
-We'll see you soon.

391
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:35,721
864-0256.

392
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:39,121
4796. Janice.

393
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:44,001
-Chris.
-Hey.

394
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:46,481
Did you--? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

395
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:48,561
-No. You catch the game last night?
-No, no.

396
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,161
You didn't see that, 1 1 8, 1 --?

397
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,561
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

398
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:56,401
-No, I haven't see them.
-1 1 9-1 20. Double overtime.

399
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,761
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 1 7 seconds left.

400
00:33:58,961 --> 00:34:00,561
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:02,881
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

402
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:05,721
-What's your problem with numbers?
-864-2....

403
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,881
-And you owe me money.
-Yeah.

404
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:09,841
You owe me $1 4.

405
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,881
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,241
I need my money.
I need my money.

407
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:18,441
Fourteen's a number.

408
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:48,121
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

409
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:49,601
-You hear me?
-Leave me alone!

410
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,641
Don't take my son away
from me again.

411
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:53,601
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

412
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:57,121
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:58,841
-Do you wanna leave?
-Yeah.

414
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,881
-You wanna leave?
-Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,001
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

416
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:07,721
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:10,241
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

418
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,521
-You are so weak.
-No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:16,321
-I'm just not happy!
-Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:17,881
Just go get happy.

421
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:20,321
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:22,321
-Stop!
-Did you hear what I said?

423
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:25,001
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:54,121
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,641
-How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
-Hi.

426
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:02,881
-Where's Mom?
-Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:36:03,081 --> 00:36:06,521
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

428
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,761
Yeah, I know.

429
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:14,561
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:22,201
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:24,521
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

432
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:27,401
-Yeah.
-All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:31,081
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:32,801
-Yeah.
-All right.

435
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,041
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:39,921
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

437
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:56,041
Christopher.

438
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:16,401
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:37:16,641 --> 00:37:18,041
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:20,641
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

441
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:23,881
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission lnn motel?

442
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:25,641
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:29,281
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

444
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:32,801
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,201
I got painters coming in.

446
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:36,721
-All right, look. I need more time.
-No.

447
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,041
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:44,601
All right, but I just-- I gotta have some
more time-- I got my son up in here.

449
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:54,281
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

450
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:47,801
Chris Gardner?

451
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:51,121
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:55,201
-Payable to the City of San Francisco.
-Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:58,881
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:00,561
This is all I got.

455
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,721
You verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

456
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:12,281
-What?
-You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:16,041
No.

458
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:18,041
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:20,841
-I have to pick up my son.
-You verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:25,681
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 1 0:1 5 tomorrow morning.

461
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:27,561
-I cannot stay--
-9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:30,121
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

463
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:32,801
-ls there anyone else who can--?
-I take care of him.

464
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:36,001
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

465
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:43,761
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:49,201
-Hello.
-Hey.

467
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:51,121
What do you want?

468
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:56,921
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

469
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:01,761
Just keep him for the night and I'm--
And-- Just one night.

470
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:04,001
What happened?

471
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:07,681
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:09,641
I'm gonna go right--
You can just--

473
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:12,161
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

474
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:15,921
-No.
-Come on, Linda.

475
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:20,401
-Why you doing that?
-No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:24,921
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:28,321
-How is he?
-He's fine.

478
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:31,601
All right, just-- All right,
take him to the park...

479
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:35,601
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:38,801
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:41,641
Okay?

482
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:43,401
Linda?

483
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:45,481
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,521
All right, all right.

485
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:51,601
Thank you.

486
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,521
Bye.

487
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:22,041
I'm okay?

488
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:59,121
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:01,121
Yes, I did.

490
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:11,561
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:20,561
This way.

492
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,801
It'll be right this way.

493
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,361
What is the word on that one?

494
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:01,881
Chris Gardner.

495
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:06,081
Chris Gardner.

496
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:08,521
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:43:09,121 --> 00:43:13,001
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

498
00:43:13,201 --> 00:43:15,161
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:18,921
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

500
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:20,681
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:25,161
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

502
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:29,401
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:34,441
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:39,321
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:42,281
So the truth is...

506
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:45,121
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:47,161
Parking tickets?

508
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:51,241
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:53,441
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

510
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:56,681
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:43:56,881 --> 00:43:59,041
Is it dry now?

512
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:01,001
I hope so.

513
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:02,921
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:05,481
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

515
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:07,841
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

516
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:11,441
-He said you're smart.
-Well, I like to think so.

517
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:14,641
-And you want to learn this business?
-Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:16,881
Have you already started learning
on your own?

519
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:18,721
Absolutely.

520
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:21,281
-Jay?
-Yes, sir.

521
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:23,561
How many times
have you seen Chris?

522
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:26,441
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

523
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,401
-Was he ever dressed like this?
-No.

524
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:31,801
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:36,641
First in your class in school?

526
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,641
-High school?
-Yes, sir.

527
00:44:39,081 --> 00:44:42,081
-How many in the class?
-Twelve.

528
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:44,041
It was a small town.

529
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,841
-I'll say.
-But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:51,321
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

531
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:55,601
Can I say something?

532
00:44:56,801 --> 00:44:58,481
I'm the type of person...

533
00:44:58,681 --> 00:45:01,961
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

534
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:04,401
...I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

535
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:05,961
But I bet you what.

536
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:11,161
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

537
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,081
Is that fair enough?

538
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:16,521
Chris.

539
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,601
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:45:21,801 --> 00:45:23,801
...without a shirt on...

541
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:26,961
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

542
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:34,281
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

543
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:52,521
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:55,001
-...but you pulled it off.
-Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:57,601
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:00,721
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:03,841
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

548
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,001
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime--

549
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:08,361
What are you talking--?
You hounded me for this.

550
00:46:08,561 --> 00:46:11,321
-You stood here--
-Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:12,881
-No.
-I was not aware of that.

552
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:14,681
My circumstances
have changed some...

553
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:18,921
-...and I need to be certain that I'll be--
-All right. Okay.

554
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:23,641
Tonight.

555
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:27,361
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:30,561
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:33,761
Yes, an ass-- A-hole.

558
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,441
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:42,921
You are a piece of work.

560
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:45,521
Tonight.

561
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:55,761
There was no salary.

562
00:46:55,961 --> 00:46:59,121
Not even a reasonable promise
of a job.

563
00:47:05,801 --> 00:47:10,441
One intern was hired at the end
of the program from a pool of 20.

564
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:12,081
And if you weren't that guy...

565
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:14,641
...you couldn't even apply
the six months' training...

566
00:47:14,841 --> 00:47:16,681
... to another brokerage.

567
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:21,361
The only resource I would have
for six months...

568
00:47:21,561 --> 00:47:25,481
... would be my six scanners,
which I could still try to sell.

569
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:30,161
If I sold them all,
maybe we might get by.

570
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:20,281
-I got him. I got him.
-He's asleep.

571
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,001
All right.

572
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:30,281
Okay, baby.

573
00:48:42,841 --> 00:48:44,601
I got it.

574
00:48:49,561 --> 00:48:51,641
I'm going to New York.

575
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:23,401
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:27,481
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:30,761
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,641
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:45,401
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:47,681
He should be with his mom.

581
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:49,761
I should have him, right?

582
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:53,001
You know
you can't take care of him.

583
00:50:00,921 --> 00:50:02,441
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:10,201
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:50:10,401 --> 00:50:11,881
...and I got it.

586
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:14,641
So I'm gonna stand out
in my program.

587
00:50:16,321 --> 00:50:18,441
Salesman to intern's backwards.

588
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,561
No, it's not.

589
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:24,401
I gotta go.

590
00:50:57,961 --> 00:51:00,361
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:02,561
And....

592
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:10,841
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:12,761
I know that.

594
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,081
-Dean Witter.
-Yes, hi.

595
00:51:57,401 --> 00:52:01,121
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:04,881
-Your name?
-Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,241
The message is:

598
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:12,121
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the program.

599
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:18,201
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,241
Is that all?

601
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:22,081
Yes, that's it.

602
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:24,041
-Okay.
-Thank you.

603
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:25,801
Bye.

604
00:52:52,441 --> 00:52:53,721
-Be careful with that.
-What?

605
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,681
Be care-- Go ahead.

606
00:53:20,561 --> 00:53:23,481
-Are we there?
-Yep.

607
00:53:36,761 --> 00:53:39,321
-Hey, you know what today is?
-Yeah.

608
00:53:39,521 --> 00:53:41,201
-What?
-Saturday.

609
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:43,721
-You know what Saturday is, right?
-Yeah.

610
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:46,361
-What?
-Basketball.

611
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:49,441
-You wanna go play some basketball?
-Okay.

612
00:53:49,641 --> 00:53:52,201
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:53:52,401 --> 00:53:56,681
-How about that? Wanna do that?
-No.

614
00:53:57,881 --> 00:54:00,281
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:03,961
I'm going pro.

616
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,601
Okay.

617
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,601
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:54:10,321 --> 00:54:12,561
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

619
00:54:12,761 --> 00:54:15,881
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

620
00:54:16,241 --> 00:54:19,881
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

621
00:54:20,081 --> 00:54:22,721
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

622
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:25,761
...I really-- You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:28,401
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

624
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:30,161
-All right?
-All right.

625
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:32,201
Okay.

626
00:54:33,321 --> 00:54:34,961
All right, go ahead.

627
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:00,401
Hey.

628
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:05,921
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:55:06,121 --> 00:55:08,681
...you can't do something.

630
00:55:09,401 --> 00:55:11,481
Not even me.

631
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:16,041
-All right?
-All right.

632
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,881
You got a dream...

633
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:21,321
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:24,081
People can't do something
themselves...

635
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,761
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

636
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:34,881
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

637
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:44,481
Let's go.

638
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:47,481
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:50,121
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

640
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:52,801
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

641
00:55:54,081 --> 00:55:57,081
-You gotta trust me, all right?
-I trust you.

642
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,041
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

643
00:56:01,281 --> 00:56:04,241
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:06,961
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

645
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,401
I don't know, Christopher.

646
00:56:09,761 --> 00:56:11,681
Dad, listen to this.

647
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:15,361
One day, a man was drowning
in the water.

648
00:56:15,561 --> 00:56:18,041
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

649
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,561
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

650
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:23,961
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

651
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:26,521
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

652
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:28,881
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

653
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:32,321
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

654
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:36,001
And God said, "l sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

655
00:56:37,321 --> 00:56:38,761
Do you like it?

656
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:41,681
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

657
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:49,361
-Thank you very much, sir.
-Yes, sir.

658
00:56:49,561 --> 00:56:51,201
-You got the bill of sale here.
-Yes.

659
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:52,801
All the information you'll need.

660
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:54,641
Thank you very much
for your business.

661
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:56,321
Thank you.

662
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,761
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

663
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:03,601
...7, 8, 9, 1 0.

664
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:05,281
Thank you.

665
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:10,561
-Hey, you want one of those?
-No, it's okay.

666
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:13,081
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

667
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:17,521
-You like that one? How much?
-Twenty-five cents.

668
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:35,441
This part of my life
is called "Internship. "

669
00:57:36,721 --> 00:57:40,121
The 1 200 building is
Medley lndustrial and Sanko Oil.

670
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:42,561
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

671
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:44,681
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

672
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:46,721
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

673
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:50,041
...from every Fortune 500 company
in the financial district.

674
00:57:50,361 --> 00:57:53,041
You will be pooling
from 60 Fortune companies.

675
00:57:53,241 --> 00:57:56,001
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

676
00:57:56,241 --> 00:57:59,201
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

677
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:02,681
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

678
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:05,841
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

679
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:10,961
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

680
00:58:11,161 --> 00:58:13,281
...we'll cook the fish.

681
00:58:14,081 --> 00:58:16,081
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

682
00:58:16,321 --> 00:58:18,721
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

683
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:21,481
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

684
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:23,881
That person's gonna be the guy...

685
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:26,361
...who can turn this into this.

686
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:29,601
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

687
00:58:30,161 --> 00:58:32,001
You, you, help me hand these out.

688
00:58:32,841 --> 00:58:35,881
This is going to be your bible.

689
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:37,441
You'll eat with it.

690
00:58:37,641 --> 00:58:39,321
-You'll drink with it.
-It was simple.

691
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:42,521
X number of calls
equals X number of prospects.

692
00:58:42,721 --> 00:58:45,681
X number of prospects
equals X number of customers.

693
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:49,041
X number of customers
equals X number of dollars...

694
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:51,401
-...in the company's pocket.
-Your board exam.

695
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:57,481
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

696
00:58:57,681 --> 00:59:01,041
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass/fail.

697
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:04,641
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

698
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,241
Be safe, score a hundred.

699
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:11,361
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 1 0.

700
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:23,561
-Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
-Hi.

701
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:25,961
-Chris, how are you?
-I'm good. How you doing?

702
00:59:26,161 --> 00:59:30,281
-Fine, thank you for asking.
-First day in there. It was exciting.

703
00:59:30,481 --> 00:59:32,561
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

704
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:34,601
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

705
00:59:34,841 --> 00:59:37,601
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

706
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,521
Oh, man, I remember mine.

707
00:59:39,721 --> 00:59:42,241
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

708
00:59:42,481 --> 00:59:44,881
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

709
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,481
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

710
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:50,841
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

711
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:53,401
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so--

712
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:55,921
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

713
00:59:56,161 --> 00:59:58,921
-No, go ahead.
-Good talking to you, sir.

714
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:32,361
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

715
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:35,561
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

716
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:37,961
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

717
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:40,401
I'm trying to cross the street.

718
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:44,081
-Well, you're all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

719
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:46,001
-Where's my shoe?
-What?

720
01:00:46,201 --> 01:00:50,001
-You knocked off my shoe!
-I don't know where your shoe is.

721
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:54,321
-Where's my damn shoe?
-I don't know.

722
01:01:00,121 --> 01:01:01,601
Hey.

723
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:05,761
-Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
-No, I'm sorry.

724
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:09,361
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

725
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:12,441
-We should wait for the police.
-I gotta go to work.

726
01:01:13,161 --> 01:01:16,881
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

727
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:20,761
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

728
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,001
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

729
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:37,281
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

730
01:01:43,121 --> 01:01:44,521
Dad.

731
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:48,041
-You don't have a shoe.
-Yeah, I know.

732
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:51,321
-Wanna know what happened?
-Yeah.

733
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,561
I got hit by a car.

734
01:01:53,761 --> 01:01:56,441
-You got hit by a car?
-Yep.

735
01:01:56,641 --> 01:02:00,241
-Where?
-Just right by the office.

736
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:03,521
-No, where in your body?
-Like, the back of my legs.

737
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,561
-Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
-Goodbye.

738
01:02:05,761 --> 01:02:08,921
-Where you on the street?
-Yeah, I was running in the street.

739
01:02:09,161 --> 01:02:12,041
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

740
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,241
Yeah, thanks.

741
01:02:14,441 --> 01:02:16,161
I'll remember that next time.

742
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:19,881
And here I was again.

743
01:02:20,081 --> 01:02:22,681
-Show up early.
-While qualified persons...

744
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:26,841
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

745
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:28,921
-Now, Chris.
-Yes, sir.

746
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:31,161
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

747
01:02:31,361 --> 01:02:35,281
Favors for Frakesh,
our office manager. All day.

748
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:38,041
My name is Chris Gardner
calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.

749
01:02:38,241 --> 01:02:40,681
Yes, sir, we're having a lunch
actually this Thursday.

750
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:43,761
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

751
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:45,321
Okay, yes, thank you.

752
01:02:45,521 --> 01:02:46,881
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

753
01:02:47,081 --> 01:02:50,801
-Chris?
-Yes, sir.

754
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:55,361
Feeling underrated
and unappreciated.

755
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:57,161
Hello, Mr. Ronald Fryer.

756
01:02:57,401 --> 01:02:59,681
Good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner.

757
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:01,241
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

758
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:04,641
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax--

759
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,121
Okay, thank you, sir.

760
01:03:08,241 --> 01:03:12,921
Then catch the bus by 4 to the place
where they can't spell "happiness. "

761
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:14,921
Then the cross-town.

762
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:17,281
The 22 home.

763
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:21,161
-Hey, Chris!
-Hey. Hi, Ralph.

764
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:24,281
-I'm waiting.
-All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

765
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:26,561
I'm gonna get that for you.

766
01:03:34,721 --> 01:03:38,161
Whoever brought in the most money
after six months was usually hired.

767
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:40,441
Hello, Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Walter Hobb.

768
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:43,721
We were all working our way
up call sheets to sign clients.

769
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:46,241
-From the bottom to the top.
-Yes, sir.

770
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:49,121
-From the doorman to the CEO.
-Okay.

771
01:03:49,921 --> 01:03:52,521
They'd stay till 7,
but I had Christopher.

772
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:55,761
I had to do in six hours
what they do in nine.

773
01:03:56,001 --> 01:03:59,121
Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

774
01:03:59,321 --> 01:04:00,921
In order not to waste any time...

775
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:03,321
...I wasn't hanging up the phone
in between calls.

776
01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:05,601
Okay, thank you very much.

777
01:04:07,201 --> 01:04:09,361
I realized that
by not hanging up the phone...

778
01:04:09,561 --> 01:04:11,521
...I gained another eight minutes
a day.

779
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:13,961
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

780
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:16,681
-I'm calling from Dean Witter.
-I wasn't drinking water...

781
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:18,921
...so I didn't' waste any time
in the bathroom.

782
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,321
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity--

783
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:24,601
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

784
01:04:24,801 --> 01:04:26,161
But even doing all this...

785
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:30,441
...after two months, I still didn't have
time to work my way up a sheet.

786
01:04:43,681 --> 01:04:46,201
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

787
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:47,601
Walter Ribbon's office.

788
01:04:47,841 --> 01:04:51,001
Yes, hello, my name is Chris Gardner.
I'm calling for Mr. Walter Ribbon.

789
01:04:51,201 --> 01:04:52,361
-Concerning?
-Yes, ma'am.

790
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:53,921
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

791
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:55,801
Just a moment.

792
01:04:57,721 --> 01:04:59,441
-Hello?
-Mr. Ribbon.

793
01:04:59,641 --> 01:05:02,601
Hello, sir. My name's Chris Gardner.
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

794
01:05:02,801 --> 01:05:04,561
-Yeah, Chris.
-Yes, Mr. Ribbon...

795
01:05:04,761 --> 01:05:08,161
...I would love to have the opportunity
to discuss some of our products.

796
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:10,801
I'm certain that I could
be of some assistance to you.

797
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:12,841
Can you be here in 20 minutes?

798
01:05:14,121 --> 01:05:17,081
-Twenty minutes. Absolutely.
-Just had someone cancel.

799
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:19,361
I can give you a few minutes
before the 49ers.

800
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:22,681
-Monday Night Football, buddy.
-Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

801
01:05:22,921 --> 01:05:25,201
-See you soon.
-Bye-bye.

802
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,921
Excuse me. Thank you.

803
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:31,681
-Chris, what's up?
-Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

804
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:33,201
Hey, do you have five minutes?

805
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:35,121
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon--

806
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:38,361
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

807
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,841
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

808
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:45,241
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

809
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,001
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

810
01:05:48,241 --> 01:05:49,721
And you have to jimmy that.

811
01:05:49,921 --> 01:05:51,921
-Jimmy what?
-You have to jimmy the key.

812
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:56,801
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

813
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:14,721
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

814
01:06:17,961 --> 01:06:19,401
Oh, no!

815
01:06:20,721 --> 01:06:22,161
Come on.

816
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:37,241
-Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
-Thank you.

817
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:44,961
-Thanks a lot.
-Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

818
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:52,241
No, no, no!

819
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:05,081
Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone
for me, please.

820
01:07:53,601 --> 01:07:54,761
-Hi.
-Hi.

821
01:07:54,961 --> 01:07:57,561
I'm Chris Gardner. I have
an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

822
01:07:57,761 --> 01:07:59,161
Oh, you just missed him.

823
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:03,281
Thank you.

824
01:08:27,401 --> 01:08:31,281
-What's that?
-Just filling out a check...

825
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:34,001
...paying some bills...

826
01:08:34,201 --> 01:08:36,201
...and a parking ticket.

827
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:40,161
We don't have a car anymore.

828
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:42,601
Yep, I know.

829
01:08:46,121 --> 01:08:49,161
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

830
01:08:49,361 --> 01:08:51,641
A couple of doctors' offices.

831
01:08:52,081 --> 01:08:55,961
-On sales calls, okay?
-Okay.

832
01:08:58,841 --> 01:09:02,841
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

833
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:05,881
-Really?
-Possibly.

834
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:08,761
-All right?
-All right.

835
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,041
Come on, finish up.

836
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:14,521
-Are you sure?
-Possibly.

837
01:09:15,721 --> 01:09:17,321
Really?

838
01:09:47,281 --> 01:09:51,801
-Are you bringing it to the game?
-Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

839
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:54,961
And maybe
we're going to the game.

840
01:09:56,481 --> 01:10:00,441
-Where are we going now?
-To see someone about my job.

841
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:02,521
I don't understand.

842
01:10:02,721 --> 01:10:05,921
-You don't understand what?
-Are we going to the game?

843
01:10:06,121 --> 01:10:08,641
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

844
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:11,201
-You know what "possibly" means?
-Like probably.

845
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:14,041
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

846
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:17,001
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

847
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:20,241
-What does "probably" mean?
-lt means we have a good chance.

848
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:21,841
And what does "possibly" mean?

849
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:24,521
-I know what it means.
-What does it mean?

850
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:27,281
It means that we're not going
to the game.

851
01:10:28,961 --> 01:10:32,201
-How did you get so smart?
-Because you're smart.

852
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:40,041
-Are we there?
-Yeah.

853
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:47,121
-Mr. Ribbon.
-Yes?

854
01:10:47,321 --> 01:10:50,241
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

855
01:10:50,761 --> 01:10:53,201
-Oh, hi. Hi.
-This is my son, Christopher.

856
01:10:53,401 --> 01:10:54,921
-Hi.
-Hey, Christopher.

857
01:10:55,121 --> 01:10:57,521
-What are you doing up here?
-I came to apologize...

858
01:10:57,721 --> 01:11:00,401
-...for missing our appointment.
-You didn't need to come up.

859
01:11:00,601 --> 01:11:03,201
We were in the neighborhood
visiting a very close friend...

860
01:11:03,401 --> 01:11:06,921
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

861
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:09,961
-I know you probably waited for me.
-Little bit.

862
01:11:10,201 --> 01:11:12,721
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

863
01:11:12,921 --> 01:11:14,961
Oh, come on. What's that?

864
01:11:15,201 --> 01:11:18,641
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

865
01:11:19,481 --> 01:11:22,401
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

866
01:11:22,641 --> 01:11:25,241
-I have a meeting after the game.
-You're going to the game?

867
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,241
-Yeah.
-Possibly.

868
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:29,641
-Possibly.
-We're going too.

869
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:31,481
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 1 2-year-old.

870
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:32,841
We were just leaving. Tim!

871
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:35,041
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

872
01:11:35,241 --> 01:11:37,961
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

873
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:40,241
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

874
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:41,961
-You got it.
-Thank you very much.

875
01:11:42,201 --> 01:11:43,841
You take care. Here, come on.

876
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:45,361
-Say bye-bye, Chris.
-Bye.

877
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:47,201
Bye, Christopher.

878
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:48,961
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

879
01:11:49,161 --> 01:11:52,081
-What--? To Candlestick?
-We're going now. Come with us.

880
01:11:52,281 --> 01:11:55,441
-Where are your seats?
-We've-- We're upper deck.

881
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:56,881
We got a box. Come on.

882
01:11:57,081 --> 01:11:59,241
-You wanna sit in the box?
-No.

883
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:04,401
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

884
01:12:04,601 --> 01:12:07,081
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

885
01:12:07,721 --> 01:12:11,481
-Okay.
-Okay, kids in the back.

886
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:14,321
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

887
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:19,961
-Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
-We don't have a car.

888
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:23,041
-Oh, my--
-What happened?

889
01:12:23,241 --> 01:12:24,601
I think I got stung by a bee.

890
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,761
-You all right?
-Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

891
01:12:27,961 --> 01:12:30,561
-You're not allergic or anything?
-No, no, no.

892
01:12:30,761 --> 01:12:34,081
-Where'd he get you?
-Just right at the back of my head.

893
01:12:34,281 --> 01:12:36,721
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

894
01:12:36,921 --> 01:12:39,081
-Does it hurt?
-Christopher, I'm fine.

895
01:12:39,281 --> 01:12:43,121
-Let me see.
-Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

896
01:12:43,361 --> 01:12:45,721
Thomas Jefferson mentions
happiness a couple times...

897
01:12:45,921 --> 01:12:48,721
...in the Declaration
of Independence.

898
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:51,721
May seem like a strange word
to be in that document...

899
01:12:51,921 --> 01:12:56,841
...but he was sort of....
He was an artist.

900
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:01,641
He called the English
"the disturbers of our harmony. "

901
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,721
And I remember standing there
that day...

902
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:06,241
... thinking about
the disturbers of mine.

903
01:13:06,441 --> 01:13:10,681
Questions I had:
Whether all this was good.

904
01:13:11,081 --> 01:13:12,841
Whether I'd make it.

905
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:18,841
And Walter Ribbon
and his Pacific Bell pension money...

906
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:20,401
... which was millions.

907
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:22,241
Yeah!

908
01:13:22,681 --> 01:13:25,601
It was a way to another place.

909
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:28,481
Wow, this is....

910
01:13:28,841 --> 01:13:30,841
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

911
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:34,121
-Thank you very much for this, really.
-Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

912
01:13:34,321 --> 01:13:37,601
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

913
01:13:37,801 --> 01:13:40,681
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

914
01:13:40,961 --> 01:13:43,121
...which we believe
to be far superior...

915
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:45,921
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

916
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:47,961
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

917
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:53,201
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

918
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:55,961
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

919
01:13:56,201 --> 01:13:59,641
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

920
01:13:59,841 --> 01:14:01,961
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

921
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:05,281
So, you know, come on, relax.
Let's play the game. Go, go, go!

922
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:07,521
Yes!

923
01:14:10,521 --> 01:14:12,601
Yes! Yeah!

924
01:14:17,281 --> 01:14:18,321
-Here you go.
-All right.

925
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:20,281
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

926
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:23,081
-Chris, I'll talk to you later.
-I'm gonna give you a call.

927
01:14:23,281 --> 01:14:24,961
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

928
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:26,761
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

929
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:36,361
-Bye.
-Bye, Christopher.

930
01:15:05,841 --> 01:15:10,361
After four months, we had sold
all our scanners.

931
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:13,041
It seemed we were making it.

932
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:15,241
What's the...

933
01:15:15,601 --> 01:15:18,081
-...fastest animal in the world?
-Jackrabbit.

934
01:15:20,281 --> 01:15:23,721
It seemed we were doing good.

935
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:25,681
Till one day...

936
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,641
...that day...

937
01:15:28,201 --> 01:15:30,121
...that letter brought me
back to earth.

938
01:15:37,521 --> 01:15:40,121
This part of my life is called
"Paying Taxes. "

939
01:15:42,161 --> 01:15:43,481
If you didn't pay them...

940
01:15:43,681 --> 01:15:46,641
... the government could stick
their hands into your bank account...

941
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:48,521
...and take your money.

942
01:15:48,721 --> 01:15:49,681
Dad.

943
01:15:49,881 --> 01:15:51,881
No warning. Nothing.

944
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:55,241
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

945
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:58,561
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

946
01:15:58,881 --> 01:16:00,161
I was-- I was--

947
01:16:00,361 --> 01:16:03,721
Listen, l--
That's all the money that I have.

948
01:16:03,921 --> 01:16:08,201
You cannot go into my bank acc--
No--

949
01:16:08,401 --> 01:16:10,761
It was the 25th of September.

950
01:16:11,001 --> 01:16:12,681
I remember that day.

951
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:14,961
Because that's the day
that I found out...

952
01:16:15,201 --> 01:16:20,321
...there was only 21 dollars
and 33 cents left in my bank account.

953
01:16:20,521 --> 01:16:22,201
I was broke.

954
01:16:32,561 --> 01:16:34,921
-Dressed yet?
-No.

955
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:42,121
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

956
01:16:42,321 --> 01:16:45,081
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

957
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:48,841
-I need that money now, not later.
-When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

958
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:50,961
Now!

959
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:56,681
Hey, what's happening, man?

960
01:16:56,921 --> 01:16:59,801
Wayne, I need to get
that $1 4 from you.

961
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:03,321
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

962
01:17:03,521 --> 01:17:06,601
-What? Why?
-Why what?

963
01:17:06,801 --> 01:17:09,161
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

964
01:17:09,361 --> 01:17:11,361
I helped you move.

965
01:17:13,561 --> 01:17:16,481
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

966
01:17:16,681 --> 01:17:18,441
That's 200 yards.

967
01:17:18,641 --> 01:17:20,601
It's been four months, Wayne.

968
01:17:20,801 --> 01:17:24,401
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

969
01:17:24,601 --> 01:17:26,921
-I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
-Go get my money.

970
01:17:27,121 --> 01:17:29,361
-Wayne, get my mo--
-I really don't, man. It's $1 4.

971
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:31,241
It's my $1 4!
Go get my money!

972
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:34,041
-All of this for $1 4.
-Get my money, Wayne.

973
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,561
Dad, look at me!

974
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:56,721
Dad.

975
01:17:57,721 --> 01:18:01,241
-Should I go?
-Sure, man. Why not?

976
01:18:17,321 --> 01:18:18,361
-Stay here.
-Dad, look.

977
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:20,161
-No, no. Stay right here.
-Dad.

978
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:23,161
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

979
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:31,761
-Dad, where you going?
-Hey, what did I say?

980
01:18:34,801 --> 01:18:36,401
Dad!

981
01:18:36,641 --> 01:18:40,041
Dad, wait! Dad!

982
01:18:48,161 --> 01:18:50,241
-Dad.
-I gotta--

983
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:53,801
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

984
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:58,321
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

985
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:04,081
Bring back my time machine!

986
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:07,081
Bring my time machine back!

987
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:19,561
-Dad, where are we going?
-Just be quiet.

988
01:19:20,161 --> 01:19:22,921
Go get your things. Go.

989
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:47,801
-Chris?
-Yes.

990
01:19:48,001 --> 01:19:51,921
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

991
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:05,561
Where are we going now?

992
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:09,601
Gotta-- We gotta
see somebody else.

993
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:13,801
I'm tired.

994
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:17,441
I know.

995
01:20:24,841 --> 01:20:28,921
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

996
01:20:29,361 --> 01:20:31,681
-I have to go now, Chris.
-No, no, no.

997
01:20:31,881 --> 01:20:35,761
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

998
01:20:37,561 --> 01:20:39,841
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

999
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:42,881
-No, no. I have to fix it now.
-No.

1000
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:48,321
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

1001
01:20:48,521 --> 01:20:50,641
I really have to go, Chris.

1002
01:20:51,881 --> 01:20:53,561
Thank you. Thank you.

1003
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:55,641
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1004
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:57,521
I'll see you soon.

1005
01:21:49,521 --> 01:21:51,961
Why are our things here?

1006
01:21:52,961 --> 01:21:54,601
Dad.

1007
01:22:37,121 --> 01:22:39,841
-Let's go. Come on.
-Where?

1008
01:22:41,441 --> 01:22:43,761
-Just out of here.
-Why?

1009
01:22:43,961 --> 01:22:46,961
-We can't stay here tonight.
-Yes, we can. Open the door!

1010
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:50,161
-Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
-Open the door!

1011
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:55,721
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

1012
01:22:55,921 --> 01:22:57,401
Stop it.

1013
01:23:01,641 --> 01:23:03,121
Come on.

1014
01:23:12,201 --> 01:23:13,681
Come on.

1015
01:23:30,681 --> 01:23:32,361
Wayne!

1016
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,321
Wayne!

1017
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:44,841
Wayne!

1018
01:24:00,361 --> 01:24:04,081
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1019
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:21,961
Where are we going?

1020
01:24:24,161 --> 01:24:27,481
-Dad, where are we going?
-I don't know.

1021
01:24:42,961 --> 01:24:45,361
It's not a time machine.

1022
01:24:45,561 --> 01:24:47,001
Dad.

1023
01:24:47,361 --> 01:24:48,681
It's not a time machine.

1024
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:52,161
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1025
01:24:52,561 --> 01:24:54,921
-What guy?
-The guy. He was at the park.

1026
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:57,081
He said it was a time machine.

1027
01:25:03,401 --> 01:25:04,641
Yes, it is.

1028
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:08,001
No, it's not.

1029
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:12,001
-lt is.
-No, it's not.

1030
01:25:18,201 --> 01:25:22,721
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1031
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:27,081
Wanna push it?

1032
01:25:31,561 --> 01:25:33,241
Okay.

1033
01:25:34,801 --> 01:25:36,361
Come on.

1034
01:25:37,881 --> 01:25:39,521
Come on, man.

1035
01:25:45,201 --> 01:25:46,241
Right here.

1036
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,241
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1037
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:50,601
I don't know.
Some place from before.

1038
01:25:51,161 --> 01:25:52,401
You gotta close your eyes.

1039
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:54,561
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1040
01:25:56,721 --> 01:25:59,161
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1041
01:26:04,961 --> 01:26:06,761
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1042
01:26:07,481 --> 01:26:09,681
It takes a few seconds.

1043
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:14,001
Oh, my goodness.

1044
01:26:14,201 --> 01:26:16,361
Open, open, open!

1045
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:22,401
-What is it?
-Dinosaurs.

1046
01:26:22,641 --> 01:26:24,841
-Where?
-You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1047
01:26:26,201 --> 01:26:29,841
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1048
01:26:31,601 --> 01:26:34,001
-Can you see them?
-Yeah.

1049
01:26:34,201 --> 01:26:35,601
Wait. Come on, come on.

1050
01:26:35,801 --> 01:26:37,121
-Wait, watch out.
-What is it?

1051
01:26:37,361 --> 01:26:39,401
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

1052
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:42,001
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

1053
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:43,601
...and it's cold out here, okay?

1054
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:46,681
-Watch out!
-Whoa! Oh, my good-- A T. rex.

1055
01:26:46,881 --> 01:26:50,521
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

1056
01:26:51,481 --> 01:26:54,601
-We gotta find someplace safe.
-Like what?

1057
01:26:54,801 --> 01:26:56,761
We need a cave.

1058
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:58,041
A cave?

1059
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:00,281
-We gotta find a cave. Come on.
-Okay.

1060
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:02,281
Come on, come on.

1061
01:27:03,841 --> 01:27:05,241
Watch your back! Look out.

1062
01:27:05,441 --> 01:27:07,481
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1063
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:10,561
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1064
01:27:10,761 --> 01:27:12,001
Go ahead. Get in.

1065
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:14,081
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1066
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:21,441
-Are we safe?
-Yeah, I think so.

1067
01:28:29,401 --> 01:28:31,041
Hey.

1068
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:34,281
-How you doing, Jay?
-I'm doing good.

1069
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:35,921
How are you getting along?

1070
01:28:36,121 --> 01:28:38,321
-Good. I'm good.
-You doing good?

1071
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:41,041
-How you doing?
-I'm doing great.

1072
01:28:42,201 --> 01:28:43,841
Where you going?

1073
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:50,121
I-- Sacramento.

1074
01:28:50,801 --> 01:28:53,441
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from--

1075
01:28:53,641 --> 01:28:56,281
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over--

1076
01:28:56,481 --> 01:28:57,761
Get them over to us.

1077
01:28:57,961 --> 01:28:59,681
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1078
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:01,721
Awesome.

1079
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,881
Hey, let them win a round.

1080
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:11,041
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

1081
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:14,361
-Where?
-He's outside. Please come with me.

1082
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:23,761
Hi.

1083
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:29,641
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

1084
01:29:31,881 --> 01:29:33,521
We need a room.

1085
01:29:34,121 --> 01:29:37,081
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1086
01:29:37,281 --> 01:29:39,921
-There's just some glass work.
-Let me stop you right there.

1087
01:29:40,121 --> 01:29:42,601
-I wish I could help you--
-This is my son, Christopher.

1088
01:29:42,921 --> 01:29:44,921
-He's 5 years old.
-Hi, baby.

1089
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:48,201
-We need some place to stay.
-Okay, and I would love to help you...

1090
01:29:48,401 --> 01:29:51,281
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

1091
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:54,521
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

1092
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:56,121
We gotta stay together.

1093
01:29:56,321 --> 01:29:57,721
We got-- We're--

1094
01:29:57,921 --> 01:29:59,721
-Okay, listen.
-You gotta have some place--

1095
01:29:59,961 --> 01:30:02,801
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1096
01:30:03,001 --> 01:30:04,521
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1097
01:30:04,721 --> 01:30:08,121
-And where is it? Come on.
-Ellis and Jones.

1098
01:30:43,361 --> 01:30:49,001
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

1099
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:52,281
-Man.
-Hey, come on, man.

1100
01:30:52,481 --> 01:30:53,681
-Come on.
-Come on, what?

1101
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:55,481
-Hey, that's my spot.
-Back off.

1102
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:58,121
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't--

1103
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:02,081
Dad!

1104
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:04,561
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1105
01:31:04,761 --> 01:31:06,361
Stop! Stop!

1106
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:08,881
Get out of the line, both of you.
Both of you.

1107
01:31:09,081 --> 01:31:11,681
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

1108
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:13,921
I got here on time. I was in line.

1109
01:31:14,121 --> 01:31:15,881
I came from work, I got my son.

1110
01:31:16,081 --> 01:31:18,601
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1111
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:20,401
He sliced in front of him in line.

1112
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:22,921
-Who did?
-He did.

1113
01:31:23,201 --> 01:31:27,721
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1114
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:38,961
That's it. No more.

1115
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:48,961
-What's your favorite color?
-Green.

1116
01:31:49,161 --> 01:31:50,401
Green?

1117
01:31:50,641 --> 01:31:53,601
-What do you like that's green?
-Trees.

1118
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:56,801
Trees. What else?

1119
01:31:57,041 --> 01:31:58,481
Holly.

1120
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:04,241
-Holly. What's holly?
-The Christmas stuff.

1121
01:32:04,961 --> 01:32:06,961
Christmas stuff.

1122
01:32:07,761 --> 01:32:09,521
What's that?

1123
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:15,641
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1124
01:32:22,201 --> 01:32:27,201
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

1125
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:29,401
Can you breathe?

1126
01:32:29,601 --> 01:32:31,841
-You're good?
-Yeah.

1127
01:32:32,281 --> 01:32:34,281
-I gotta go work on the scanner--
-Don't go.

1128
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:37,681
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

1129
01:32:37,921 --> 01:32:42,041
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1130
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:45,201
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1131
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:47,881
I wanna go home.

1132
01:32:49,961 --> 01:32:53,761
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

1133
01:32:54,721 --> 01:32:56,481
All right?

1134
01:32:56,681 --> 01:32:58,641
I'm gonna go out there.

1135
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:02,201
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1136
01:33:03,281 --> 01:33:05,001
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1137
01:33:05,961 --> 01:33:08,081
-All right?
-All right.

1138
01:33:08,281 --> 01:33:10,641
You gotta trust me, okay?

1139
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:12,841
You gotta trust me.

1140
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,401
I trust you. I trust you.

1141
01:33:16,601 --> 01:33:18,041
I trust you.

1142
01:33:18,241 --> 01:33:21,241
-I can't hear you.
-I trust you. I trust you.

1143
01:33:25,041 --> 01:33:26,761
Give me a kiss.

1144
01:33:39,441 --> 01:33:42,401
-I'll just be a little while, okay?
-All right.

1145
01:33:42,881 --> 01:33:45,321
-I'll be right here.
-Okay.

1146
01:33:45,521 --> 01:33:47,721
-Can you still hear me?
-Yeah.

1147
01:33:47,921 --> 01:33:49,441
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

1148
01:33:49,681 --> 01:33:52,161
-Do you trust me?
-Yeah.

1149
01:34:39,361 --> 01:34:41,001
-Yeah.
-Like that?

1150
01:34:41,241 --> 01:34:44,881
-Yeah, put that....
-Then you go like that.

1151
01:34:45,081 --> 01:34:48,601
-ls that okay?
-I don't know. What do you think?

1152
01:34:48,801 --> 01:34:49,841
Good.

1153
01:34:51,201 --> 01:34:53,441
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1154
01:34:54,681 --> 01:34:57,641
-Hey, why don't you leave it?
-We can't.

1155
01:34:57,841 --> 01:34:59,961
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1156
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:01,721
Go.

1157
01:35:07,081 --> 01:35:08,441
Hey, Chris.

1158
01:35:08,641 --> 01:35:12,001
-Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
-What's up?

1159
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,201
Work trip.

1160
01:35:14,401 --> 01:35:16,641
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

1161
01:35:16,881 --> 01:35:18,641
-Yes, she does.
-And you guys are both...

1162
01:35:18,841 --> 01:35:20,481
...Iooking to retire at the same time?

1163
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:22,801
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

1164
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:24,441
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1165
01:35:24,641 --> 01:35:28,121
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1166
01:35:28,721 --> 01:35:30,641
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal...?

1167
01:35:30,841 --> 01:35:32,761
I learned to finish my work quickly.

1168
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,241
I had to finish quickly.

1169
01:35:35,561 --> 01:35:39,081
To get in line at Glide by 5.

1170
01:35:42,801 --> 01:35:44,721
Come on.

1171
01:35:45,201 --> 01:35:46,801
Come on.

1172
01:35:50,881 --> 01:35:53,641
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

1173
01:35:54,521 --> 01:35:56,281
My Captain America!

1174
01:35:56,521 --> 01:35:58,841
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1175
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:02,321
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

1176
01:36:04,641 --> 01:36:06,681
-Why don't you let the lady in?
-Hey, back up.

1177
01:36:06,881 --> 01:36:09,921
-Hey, man, that's not cool.
-Back up! Back up!

1178
01:36:18,241 --> 01:36:19,721
Come on.

1179
01:36:22,721 --> 01:36:24,961
Dad, we need to get it!

1180
01:36:27,561 --> 01:36:30,201
The important thing about
that freedom train...

1181
01:36:30,401 --> 01:36:32,561
...is it's got to climb mountains.

1182
01:36:32,761 --> 01:36:35,521
We all have to deal with mountains.

1183
01:36:35,721 --> 01:36:38,681
You know, mountains
that go way up high.

1184
01:36:39,081 --> 01:36:41,121
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1185
01:36:41,321 --> 01:36:42,561
-Amen, preacher!
-Yes.

1186
01:36:42,761 --> 01:36:45,081
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

1187
01:36:45,401 --> 01:36:47,521
We sing about them.

1188
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:53,801
Lord, don't move that mountain

1189
01:36:55,241 --> 01:37:01,641
Give me strength to climb it

1190
01:37:02,161 --> 01:37:08,841
Please don't move
That stumbling block

1191
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:15,601
But lead me, Lord, around it

1192
01:37:17,241 --> 01:37:22,281
My burdens, they get so heavy

1193
01:37:24,121 --> 01:37:29,761
Seems hard to bear

1194
01:37:30,681 --> 01:37:34,241
But I won't give up
No, no

1195
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:36,481
Because you promised me

1196
01:37:36,681 --> 01:37:43,441
You'd meet me at the altar of prayer

1197
01:37:43,641 --> 01:37:51,161
-Lord don't move that mountain
-Please don't move that mountain

1198
01:37:51,401 --> 01:37:56,641
But give me strength to climb it

1199
01:37:58,881 --> 01:38:00,881
When's your test?

1200
01:38:02,081 --> 01:38:03,601
T omorrow.

1201
01:38:07,961 --> 01:38:09,761
Are you ready?

1202
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:15,121
Of course.

1203
01:38:54,201 --> 01:38:55,521
Thank you, sir.

1204
01:39:04,881 --> 01:39:07,081
-Hey. How you doing?
-Hey.

1205
01:39:11,081 --> 01:39:14,081
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere...?

1206
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,761
I have to go somewhere.

1207
01:39:17,321 --> 01:39:20,161
-But I finished the whole thing too.
-Oh, good.

1208
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:22,321
-You?
-Yeah.

1209
01:39:22,801 --> 01:39:25,761
-How'd you feel about the graphs?
-Easy.

1210
01:39:26,761 --> 01:39:30,841
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

1211
01:39:31,041 --> 01:39:34,681
-Essay question?
-Yeah, on the back.

1212
01:39:44,601 --> 01:39:45,961
Hey, Chris.

1213
01:39:46,161 --> 01:39:49,441
-Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
-Yeah.

1214
01:39:49,641 --> 01:39:53,121
-Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
-I never actually got your number.

1215
01:39:54,881 --> 01:39:56,841
Here's my number. Call me, okay?

1216
01:39:57,041 --> 01:39:59,721
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1217
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:04,241
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

1218
01:40:04,441 --> 01:40:06,721
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

1219
01:40:06,921 --> 01:40:09,921
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

1220
01:40:15,281 --> 01:40:17,441
-I'll pay you back, honest.
-Five is good?

1221
01:40:17,681 --> 01:40:21,281
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

1222
01:40:34,641 --> 01:40:37,121
That's it. That's the room quota.

1223
01:40:37,521 --> 01:40:40,281
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1224
01:40:40,481 --> 01:40:43,401
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

1225
01:40:43,601 --> 01:40:46,561
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

1226
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:51,081
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

1227
01:41:26,081 --> 01:41:27,841
You like it?

1228
01:42:18,881 --> 01:42:22,561
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

1229
01:42:25,641 --> 01:42:29,241
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1230
01:42:29,441 --> 01:42:32,241
-How much?
-Eight dollars.

1231
01:42:33,361 --> 01:42:36,681
-What's that?
-It's to repair the light.

1232
01:42:36,881 --> 01:42:38,921
Can I see it?

1233
01:42:40,841 --> 01:42:43,881
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

1234
01:42:44,121 --> 01:42:48,601
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

1235
01:42:49,801 --> 01:42:51,681
I don't mind.

1236
01:42:52,161 --> 01:42:53,961
Yeah, you will.

1237
01:43:10,281 --> 01:43:12,641
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

1238
01:43:12,841 --> 01:43:14,001
Okay.

1239
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:17,281
-Warm enough?
-Yeah.

1240
01:43:17,561 --> 01:43:19,241
All right.

1241
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:24,241
Did Mom leave because of me?

1242
01:43:27,601 --> 01:43:31,801
-What?
-Did Mom leave because of me?

1243
01:43:36,361 --> 01:43:40,881
Don't-- Don't even think
something like that.

1244
01:43:41,961 --> 01:43:44,081
Mom left because of Mom.

1245
01:43:44,321 --> 01:43:46,561
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1246
01:43:47,281 --> 01:43:49,161
Okay.

1247
01:43:59,001 --> 01:44:01,081
You're a good papa.

1248
01:44:08,921 --> 01:44:10,921
All right, go to sleep.

1249
01:44:11,721 --> 01:44:14,681
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1250
01:45:11,121 --> 01:45:13,121
So far, so good, Chris.

1251
01:45:19,201 --> 01:45:21,761
-lt works.
-Thank you very much.

1252
01:45:21,961 --> 01:45:25,801
Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Four more weeks of oxygen.

1253
01:45:26,121 --> 01:45:30,361
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1254
01:45:30,561 --> 01:45:33,321
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1255
01:45:34,481 --> 01:45:36,121
-Anything else?
-No, sir.

1256
01:45:36,321 --> 01:45:37,641
Thank you. Thank you.

1257
01:45:37,841 --> 01:45:39,801
-You ready?
-Yep.

1258
01:45:41,721 --> 01:45:44,601
-Are we going to the church place?
-No.

1259
01:45:44,841 --> 01:45:46,801
Where are we going, then?

1260
01:45:47,601 --> 01:45:50,161
-Probably stay at a hotel.
-A hotel?

1261
01:45:50,361 --> 01:45:51,401
Just for the night.

1262
01:45:51,641 --> 01:45:54,401
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1263
01:45:54,601 --> 01:45:56,321
No, thank you.

1264
01:45:56,521 --> 01:45:59,041
-Ever?
-I hope not.

1265
01:45:59,281 --> 01:46:00,721
Why not?

1266
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:03,721
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

1267
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:06,281
...and then not so much the next.

1268
01:46:06,481 --> 01:46:09,361
-Like the bus?
-Yeah, like the bus.

1269
01:46:09,561 --> 01:46:12,761
I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh,
should I?

1270
01:46:25,801 --> 01:46:27,481
Sometimes when we're moving
at night...

1271
01:46:27,681 --> 01:46:30,441
...we pass houses with lights
and people.

1272
01:46:31,201 --> 01:46:33,081
Sometimes you can
hear them laugh.

1273
01:46:38,481 --> 01:46:41,841
The next day, after work...

1274
01:46:42,041 --> 01:46:44,281
... we just went to the beach.

1275
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:46,401
Far away from anything.

1276
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:47,961
Everything.

1277
01:46:48,161 --> 01:46:49,801
Just Christopher and me.

1278
01:46:51,441 --> 01:46:53,801
-Did you see me?
-Yeah.

1279
01:46:54,041 --> 01:46:57,121
Far away from buses and noise...

1280
01:46:57,321 --> 01:47:02,961
...and a constant disappointment
in my ten-gallon head...

1281
01:47:04,121 --> 01:47:06,001
...and myself.

1282
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:08,961
-Chris, thank you very much.
-Well, thank you, Dean.

1283
01:47:09,161 --> 01:47:11,001
-Take care.
-You made all the right moves.

1284
01:47:11,201 --> 01:47:12,721
Thanks, Chris.

1285
01:47:14,801 --> 01:47:16,161
Because when I was young...

1286
01:47:16,361 --> 01:47:20,121
...and I'd get an A on a history test
or whatever...

1287
01:47:20,321 --> 01:47:24,921
...I'd get this good feeling about
all the things that I could be.

1288
01:47:26,841 --> 01:47:30,441
And then I never became
any of them.

1289
01:47:37,961 --> 01:47:40,481
-Hey, Chris.
-Hey.

1290
01:47:40,721 --> 01:47:43,321
-How you doing, Jay?
-I'm doing fine.

1291
01:47:43,521 --> 01:47:47,681
Rumor has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

1292
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:49,321
Yeah, yeah.

1293
01:47:49,521 --> 01:47:53,321
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

1294
01:47:53,521 --> 01:47:55,161
I guess.

1295
01:47:58,121 --> 01:48:00,361
So one more day.

1296
01:48:00,561 --> 01:48:02,161
Getting nervous?

1297
01:48:02,721 --> 01:48:05,081
-No, I'm okay.
-Yeah?

1298
01:48:05,281 --> 01:48:07,241
Listen, whatever happens...

1299
01:48:07,441 --> 01:48:09,881
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

1300
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:11,641
I mean that.

1301
01:48:12,481 --> 01:48:14,281
Take care of yourself.

1302
01:48:29,281 --> 01:48:32,481
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1303
01:48:32,801 --> 01:48:34,881
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

1304
01:48:35,081 --> 01:48:37,601
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

1305
01:48:38,121 --> 01:48:39,801
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

1306
01:48:40,441 --> 01:48:42,041
Yes, sir.

1307
01:48:42,281 --> 01:48:43,641
No, sir, that's it.

1308
01:48:43,841 --> 01:48:46,321
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1309
01:48:47,921 --> 01:48:50,801
Chris. Come.

1310
01:49:18,201 --> 01:49:21,281
-Hi, Chris.
-Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

1311
01:49:22,441 --> 01:49:24,361
-Nice shirt.
-Thank you, sir.

1312
01:49:24,561 --> 01:49:25,761
-Chris.
-Hey, Jay.

1313
01:49:26,201 --> 01:49:30,481
-Chris.
-Chris, sit down, please.

1314
01:49:33,401 --> 01:49:37,481
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1315
01:49:37,681 --> 01:49:39,641
You know,
being the last day and all.

1316
01:49:39,841 --> 01:49:43,201
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1317
01:49:44,081 --> 01:49:45,841
But...

1318
01:49:46,081 --> 01:49:48,841
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1319
01:49:49,081 --> 01:49:52,001
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

1320
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:55,961
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

1321
01:49:57,321 --> 01:49:59,121
Would you like that, Chris?

1322
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:01,641
Yes, sir.

1323
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:05,201
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1324
01:50:06,201 --> 01:50:09,361
So welcome.

1325
01:50:11,241 --> 01:50:16,201
-Was it as easy as it looked?
-No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

1326
01:50:18,561 --> 01:50:20,961
-Good luck, Chris.
-Thank you. Thank you.

1327
01:50:27,361 --> 01:50:29,241
Oh, Chris.

1328
01:50:31,761 --> 01:50:33,841
I almost forgot.

1329
01:50:35,881 --> 01:50:37,441
Thank you.

1330
01:50:57,841 --> 01:51:00,041
This part of my life...

1331
01:51:00,921 --> 01:51:03,121
...this little part...

1332
01:51:06,481 --> 01:51:09,121
...is called "Happiness. "

1333
01:51:55,841 --> 01:51:59,441
Christopher. Christopher.
Come here.

1334
01:52:29,121 --> 01:52:31,521
So how many...

1335
01:52:31,721 --> 01:52:33,681
...planets are there?

1336
01:52:34,961 --> 01:52:36,761
-Seven.
-Seven?

1337
01:52:37,281 --> 01:52:39,081
Nine.

1338
01:52:41,481 --> 01:52:43,521
Who's the king of the jungle?

1339
01:52:43,921 --> 01:52:46,681
-Gorilla.
-The gorilla?

1340
01:52:46,961 --> 01:52:48,361
The gorilla?

1341
01:52:48,561 --> 01:52:50,241
No. Lion.

1342
01:52:50,441 --> 01:52:53,041
Oh, yeah. Lion, lion, lion.

1343
01:52:55,121 --> 01:52:58,121
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

1344
01:52:58,321 --> 01:53:00,241
-Who's there?
-Shelby.

1345
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:01,561
Shelby who?

1346
01:53:01,761 --> 01:53:05,561
Shelby coming around the mountain
When she comes

1347
01:53:06,401 --> 01:53:07,761
-Knock knock.
-Who's there?

1348
01:53:07,961 --> 01:53:10,441
-Nobody.
-Nobody who?

1349
01:53:11,321 --> 01:53:13,081
Nobody who?

1350
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:19,361
Now, that's funny. I like that one.
