Look the other way?

No, I'm not saying that...

And where do
they expect them to go?

No. No anything.

155
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,861
You know, Mom,
you can talk about it.

156
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:27,462
If you want.

157
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:30,569
Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.

158
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:34,166
I wanna live right now.

159
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Yep.

160
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:39,903
So, Cassie, did you make any new friends

161
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,475
in the slammer this time?

162
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:42,680
Grandpa.

163
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,577
"This time"?

164
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:45,780
Was there a last time?

165
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,850
I mean, last time barely counts.

166
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:49,948
I didn't know that.

167
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:51,049
Why didn't you call me?

168
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:52,505
'Cause I knew you'd be like this.

169
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,492
I would've just broken you out with ants.

170
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,097
All right, you know what?
Family meeting.

171
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:57,164
Can we have a family meeting?

172
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,308
Isn't that what we're doing?

173
00:08:58,364 --> 00:08:59,431
Yeah, I mean about this.

174
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,424
About everybody being so fine with this.

175
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:05,469
Look, you wanna help.
I get it.

176
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:07,132
I do, Cassie. I really do.

177
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:08,676
But I don't want you wasting your life.

178
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,840
At least I'm still trying
to do something with mine.

179
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:14,936
I literally saved the world.

180
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,108
Oh, did you?

181
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:17,963
Well, yeah, you never
mentioned that before.

182
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:19,745
Hey, everybody,
Scott saved the world.

183
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:21,078
How was that for you, Scott?

184
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:22,549
You should write a book about it.

185
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:24,116
Ha ha.
Hilarious.

186
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,190
Yeah, you're welcome
for all not being dust.

187
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:27,758
And what do you do now?

188
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:30,926
Sign books?

189
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:34,293
Aren't you the guy
who broke into VistaCorp?

190
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:35,977
Aren't you the guy who flew
all the way to Germany

191
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,966
just to fight Captain America
at the airport?

192
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:40,866
Fight with Captain America
at the airport.

193
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:43,074
Wouldn't fight Captain America.

194
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,737
Not insane.

195
00:09:44,873 --> 00:09:47,406
People still need help, Dad.

196
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,143
At least we're trying
to do something that matters.

197
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,586
Who's "we"?

198
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,918
Hmm?
What are you three up to?

199
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:00,021
Science.

200
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:03,420
With ants.

201
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:05,587
Ant science.

202
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,128
I don't believe you.

203
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:11,300
Let's just show him.

204
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,867
Whoa.
What are they building?

205
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:18,172
Are you doing this?

206
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:21,575
Actually, no,
they built their own tech.

207
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,172
Pretty smart ants.

208
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,112
Okay, so when you were all,

209
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:28,280
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

210
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:30,754
And I started reading
Grandpa Hank's old journals,

211
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,851
and I got really into
the Quantum Realm and...

212
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:35,023
Whoa.
The Quantum Realm?

213
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,858
I know we all have a history there,

214
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:38,070
and I didn't want to freak anyone out,

215
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:39,374
but we've been talking about it.

216
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:40,897
She had some questions, okay?

217
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:44,197
I can't help if people
are inspired by me.

218
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:49,367
So, you've been studying
the Quantum Realm?

219
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,037
Mm-hmm.

220
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,412
Why didn't you ask me about it?

221
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,573
I tried, Mom.

222
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,877
A lot.

223
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:57,711
You never wanted to talk about it.

224
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,142
Cassie's just been curious

225
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:00,983
and we gave her some pointers.

226
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:05,482
This isn't exactly
ant science, is it, Henry?

227
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:07,854
You know how dangerous
the Quantum Realm is.

228
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:09,069
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

229
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,657
Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.

230
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,094
That's why we made this.

231
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:16,163
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

232
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:18,829
But...

233
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:20,233
...Quantum.

234
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:24,334
We just need a map.

235
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,838
And then we can study
and explore

236
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:27,438
the entire Quantum Realm.

237
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,408
Never even have to go.

238
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:34,075
Your daughter built
a subatomic Hubble Telescope

239
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,413
in a basement.

240
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:39,699
You know,
if I had something like this

241
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:40,891
when you were gone...

242
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:45,225
then I could have found you.

243
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:49,735
It's amazing.

244
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:51,968
I'm blown away.

245
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:55,731
How does it work?

246
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:59,105
It's kinda like that
two-way radio we used to have.

247
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:00,869
You send a signal down from here,

248
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,887
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

249
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,443
Wait.
Wait a minute.

250
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:08,116
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

251
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:10,885
Yeah.

252
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,253
Shut it down now.
Janet...

253
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,118
Why would we shut it...
What's wrong?

254
00:12:15,254 --> 00:12:16,384
You have to turn it off!

255
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,060
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

256
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:22,927
Janet?

257
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:28,665
There's something I should have told...

258
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:05,142
Dad?

259
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,643
No!

260
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,337
No!
Mom!

261
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:11,179
No!

262
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:13,584
Damn it!

263
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,321
Dad?

264
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,515
Dad!

265
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:56,719
Dad!

266
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,047
Cassie.

267
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,824
Dad!

268
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,897
Oh, Dad. Come on.

269
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:33,563
Okay.

270
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,665
Are you okay?

271
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:36,224
Yeah.
I'm okay.

272
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:53,347
Where are we?

273
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:12,436
Mom!

274
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,100
Dad!

275
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:16,942
Hope. Over here.

276
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:20,611
Are you okay?

277
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:23,014
We should be dead.

278
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:25,075
Why aren't we?

279
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:26,413
I don't know.

280
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,955
Are we where I think we are?

281
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,320
I would say yes,

282
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:34,951
but, uh, it wasn't like this.

283
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,192
Janet!

284
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
Mom!

285
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:39,761
Janet!

286
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,433
Mom!

287
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:56,641
Do not move.

288
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:16,694
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

289
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:18,933
Right now.

290
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:23,711
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hope?</i></font>

291
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,906
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hope?</i></font>

292
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,968
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hank?
Can you hear me?</i></font>

293
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,543
<i><font color="#80ffff">Can anyone hear me?</i></font>
Oh, my God.

294
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,260
It's okay.
What are we gonna do?

295
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,117
It's okay. It's okay.
We're okay.

296
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,426
We're okay.
It's gonna be okay.

297
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,650
You're saying "okay" too much.

298
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:39,890
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

299
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:41,957
We're okay.
We are fine.

300
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:43,190
Hey, we're gonna find them,

301
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:45,052
and we're gonna go home.
Mm.

302
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:47,005
In the meantime, look around.

303
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:48,259
It's beautiful.

304
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:50,330
All right?
We're outside.

305
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,560
It's like we're camping.
We love camping.

306
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:53,863
We've never been camping.

307
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:56,701
But we've always talked about it.

308
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:03,246
Is that sun moving?

309
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,225
Get back!

310
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:20,889
Oh, my God.

311
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:23,431
I don't think this is a sun!

312
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,429
It's fine.

313
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:27,538
- Dad!
- Honey, it's okay.

314
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:28,673
Still okay.

315
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:39,012
Dad.
Oh, my God.

316
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:40,147
That was weird.

317
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:46,651
Run.

318
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:18,189
There's Quantum people in the Quantum Realm?

319
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:19,624
Yeah.

320
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:21,819
I didn't know that either.

321
00:18:26,098 --> 00:18:27,359
What was that back there, Mom?

322
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:29,162
What was that ship looking for?

323
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:31,025
Keep your voice down.

324
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,303
You said there was nothing down here.

325
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:34,845
Why didn't you tell us about all of this?

326
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,451
Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now,

327
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,603
I just need you to trust me.
Then make me trust you!

328
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,140
Let's just calm down, all right?

329
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:41,309
We can talk about this...

330
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:43,541
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

331
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:44,996
No, you need to tell us what's...

332
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,123
And why didn't you listen?

333
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:47,546
I told you to stay away from here.

334
00:18:48,217 --> 00:18:51,088
Janet, I... I'm so sorry.

335
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:52,592
I should have told you what we were doing.

336
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:53,856
I had no idea...

337
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:54,991
I know.
It's...

338
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,356
We'll talk later.

339
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:59,296
Right now, we stick together,

340
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,628
we find Scott and Cassie,

341
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:04,064
and we go home.
Okay?

342
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,428
Okay?
Okay?

343
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:06,564
Okay.
Okay.

344
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:07,700
Stay close.

345
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,048
This is incredible.

346
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:19,481
I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.

347
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,517
Why didn't I see any of this?

348
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:25,616
You weren't able to look deep enough.

349
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:28,193
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

350
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:31,323
There are worlds here,

351
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,154
worlds within worlds.

352
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:37,895
It's a place outside time and space.

353
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:42,068
It's a secret universe

354
00:19:42,203 --> 00:19:43,732
beneath ours.

355
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:06,891
Hey, get your hands off me!

356
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:14,873
Cassie?

357
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:18,639
Where's my daughter?

358
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:21,807
Where is she?

359
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:23,914
Cassie?

360
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:28,887
Where's my daughter?

361
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:33,516
Cassie!

362
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:37,191
Dad!

363
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:39,027
Cassie!

364
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,123
Drink the ooze.

365
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:43,565
What?

366
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,786
I'll handle this.

367
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:22,439
Mom.

368
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,154
Was that a... a good stab?

369
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,057
I got us a ride.

370
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:40,418
He's friendly.

371
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,443
Quite a ride.

372
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:45,481
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

373
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:46,654
I like ants.

374
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:49,053
And I love that you love them.
Here.

375
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:52,726
These will help us blend in.

376
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:55,797
Where exactly are we going on this?

377
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:57,692
We're not too far
from an old friend of mine.

378
00:22:57,769 --> 00:22:59,734
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are,

379
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:01,835
it'll be him.

380
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,705
After you.

381
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:07,069
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

382
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:14,276
Let me go!
Let me go!

383
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:26,959
I don't know what you're saying!

384
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,893
I don't know what you...

385
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:48,882
No!
No!

386
00:23:58,454 --> 00:24:00,174
Drink the ooze!

387
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:01,822
Drink the ooze!

388
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:03,660
Drink the ooze!

389
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:05,129
Drink the ooze!

390
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:07,897
Hello.
Whoa!

391
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:09,006
Hi.
Hi.

392
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:10,475
Did you drink the ooze?

393
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:13,309
Why can I understand you?

394
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:14,709
Oh. Great.
That's the ooze.

395
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:16,639
Hey, everybody, it worked!
Ooze worked!

396
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:21,809
We can finally be friends.

397
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:23,185
Hi. I am Veb.

398
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,350
You just drank me.

399
00:24:24,486 --> 00:24:25,522
I did... What?

400
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:27,062
Oh. Do you need some more ooze?
Here.

401
00:24:27,086 --> 00:24:28,136
I can pour some ooze into your hole...

402
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
No, I'm okay.

403
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:30,818
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Oh, wow!

404
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:32,394
A big hole.

405
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:34,794
How many holes do you have?

406
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:36,369
I'm sorry.
Is that a personal question?

407
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,104
I don't have any holes.

408
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:40,103
His name is Scott Lang.

409
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:42,499
He has seven holes.

410
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,644
Yeah, that's right.

411
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,543
How did you...
How did you know that?

412
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:52,642
He's Quaz.
He's a telepath.

413
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:56,078
You can read minds?

414
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:59,353
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

415
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:02,391
Everyone is disgusting.

416
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:04,218
Hmm.

417
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:05,794
Could you please stop thinking that?

418
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:07,121
Sorry.

419
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,625
Please, stop.
Thinking?

420
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:11,126
Thinking that.
I'm trying.

421
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,865
Well, not very hard.

422
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,531
And I think you look weird too.

423
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,382
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

424
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:17,567
I wish my head glowed.

425
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:19,940
No, no, you don't.

426
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:21,421
I know I don't. I just...
I'm nervous, okay?

427
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:22,445
And it just came out.

428
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:23,513
What are you doing here?

429
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:25,405
Are you a spy?
What? No. No, no.

430
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,755
We should torture him.

431
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:27,882
Guys.
No, it's okay.

432
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:30,449
We're not... We're not spies.
He's my dad.

433
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:32,047
Oh!

434
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:33,385
Oh... Thank you.

435
00:25:33,521 --> 00:25:34,591
Welcome.

436
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:38,254
Then who is San Francisco?

437
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:39,993
It's where we're from.
It's a place.

438
00:25:40,128 --> 00:25:42,091
Then what's Earth?
It's also where we're from.

439
00:25:42,227 --> 00:25:43,471
We should torture them.

440
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:44,576
Why are you always
trying to torture people?

441
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
We have other options.

442
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:47,137
Do things come out of your holes,

443
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:48,538
like milk, juice...

444
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,065
Veb, stop asking about his holes.

445
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,374
Some of us have holes.

446
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,935
What are you doing here?

447
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:55,677
Where are you from?

448
00:25:55,813 --> 00:25:57,745
Okay.
Up there. Up there.

449
00:25:57,881 --> 00:25:59,056
See, above this...
The Earth.

450
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,715
...it's a different universe.
Big Earth.

451
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,093
It's the same universe,
but it's bigger.

452
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:03,592
This is Earth,
but it's a very small Earth.

453
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:04,825
- Sometimes, I guess.
- I get big. I shrink.

454
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:05,849
And it's like...

455
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,441
But I wrote a book about it, actually.

456
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:08,793
- I don't know.
- This is the Quantum Realm.

457
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,002
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

458
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:10,789
We shrunk.
Right now, we're really small.

459
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:12,070
It's bigger where we're from.

460
00:26:12,094 --> 00:26:13,614
So, we're small right now.
It's bigger.

461
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:19,060
Okay, they're telling the truth.

462
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:20,297
It doesn't matter.

463
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,939
You come from above.

464
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,211
Like him.

465
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:32,076
So, he is hunting you.

466
00:26:32,212 --> 00:26:34,619
He will burn the world to find you.

467
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:36,549
Who?

468
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:39,817
The Conqueror.

469
00:27:42,282 --> 00:27:43,814
There are beings down here.

470
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,987
Intelligent beings.

471
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,056
I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here,

472
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:52,356
a subatomic universe.

473
00:27:52,492 --> 00:27:54,995
This changes everything
we know about life,

474
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,563
evolution, our place in the galaxy...

475
00:27:57,698 --> 00:27:59,799
Holy shit!

476
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:01,666
That guy looks like broccoli.

477
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:12,178
Keep your head down.

478
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,326
Follow me.

479
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:19,746
Drink those.

480
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:21,786
I'll be right back.

481
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,428
I'm here for Krylar.

482
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:40,970
Oh.

483
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:43,606
It's... It's you.

484
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:44,908
Let's keep that between us.

485
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:47,573
And Krylar.

486
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:48,708
Hello.

487
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,672
I don't know your ways or customs,

488
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,846
but I assume that you have a beverage

489
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:55,385
that can get me drunk?

490
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,546
Absolutely, sir.

491
00:29:58,517 --> 00:30:02,125
Hmm.
So, what's your story then?

492
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,492
God.

493
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:06,963
Move.

494
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:08,399
It's time.

495
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:09,928
Follow me.

496
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:17,875
Right this way.

497
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:21,538
Hmm.
Oh.

498
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,914
How exactly do you know this guy?

499
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,247
Old, uh, freedom fighter friend of mine.

500
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,453
Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?

501
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:32,654
Or terrorist.

502
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,855
Depends on who you ask.

503
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,295
But, trust me, he can help.

504
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:23,006
Janet Van Dyne?

505
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:27,038
I thought you were dead.

506
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:28,974
Been a long time, Krylar.

507
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,475
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

508
00:31:32,611 --> 00:31:35,376
I fought like hell against that.

509
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,119
It sounds so elitist.

510
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:41,418
You have got to be Hank.

511
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:44,990
I've heard so much
about you and your ants.

512
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,322
What are ants anyway?

513
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:48,894
Do we have 'em down here?

514
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:50,896
I don't think so.
No.

515
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:52,794
Oh. That's too bad.

516
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:55,038
Hope.

517
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:57,839
You have to be Hope.

518
00:31:57,975 --> 00:32:00,268
She talked about you every day.

519
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:02,175
That's strange,

520
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,080
she never said anything about you.

521
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:08,609
I don't think I would have
told my kid either.

522
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,313
Wild stuff.
Funny.

523
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:12,847
Hmm.
How wild?

524
00:32:14,254 --> 00:32:16,590
Very wild, Henry.
Yeah.

525
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,990
Uh...

526
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:21,329
Krylar, we need your help.

527
00:32:21,464 --> 00:32:25,435
Janet, after all
we've been through, together,

528
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,570
just ask me.

529
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:28,195
Tell me, how can I help?

530
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,664
But...

531
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,870
is anyone starving?
I'm starving.

532
00:32:33,006 --> 00:32:34,143
Boys...

533
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,475
Now.

534
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:45,621
They don't know anything.

535
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,551
About... anything.

536
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:49,967
Then get them out of here.

537
00:32:51,662 --> 00:32:52,855
Excuse me.

538
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,031
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

539
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,647
We're just trying to find our family.

540
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:57,800
Do you have a map?

541
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,965
All we wanna do is go... Whoa!

542
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:03,330
Wait, wait.
Don't shoot.

543
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:04,740
They're with us.

544
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:07,836
Is that building alive?

545
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:09,640
Yours are dead?

546
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:14,178
Look. Excuse me.

547
00:33:14,313 --> 00:33:15,811
We just wanna go home.

548
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:22,059
At least you still have a home.

549
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,825
What happened here?

550
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:34,665
The Conqueror burned our homes.

551
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:37,899
Our stories.

552
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:41,342
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

553
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,207
Some of us escaped,

554
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:45,874
found others on the run.

555
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,547
We gathered who we could to fight.

556
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:50,780
It was never enough.

557
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:53,288
I'm sorry.

558
00:33:54,186 --> 00:33:55,191
We can help.

559
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:03,095
Uh, Cassie...
Dad, you're an Avenger.

560
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:04,271
They need help.

561
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:06,703
No. What I need to do is get you home.

562
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,037
Why don't you wanna help?

563
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,515
We don't know anything about this place.

564
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:11,381
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

565
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:12,712
Have we been gone for 10 seconds?

566
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:13,889
Or have we been gone for 10 years?

567
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:15,122
Think about your mom right now.

568
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:16,220
Can you imagine what she must be...

569
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,408
Don't use Mom as an excuse.

570
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:19,639
You just don't care.
No, I do care.

571
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:21,476
I know you wanna help.
I do.

572
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:23,646
But this is not our fight.

573
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,199
Just 'cause it's not happening to you,

574
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:26,503
doesn't mean it's not happening.

575
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:28,954
Hey.

576
00:34:31,928 --> 00:34:33,295
Would you look at me?

577
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:37,134
She's disappointed in you.

578
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:39,769
I got that. Yeah. Thank you.
You're welcome.

579
00:34:39,905 --> 00:34:41,027
We'll talk about it later.

580
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,206
Right now, let's just find the others.

581
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,241
No one knows this place better than Janet.

582
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:48,537
What did you say?

583
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:50,139
What?

584
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:51,478
That name.

585
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,111
Janet Van Dyne.

586
00:34:54,247 --> 00:34:55,416
Where is she?

587
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,551
That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?

588
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:58,914
I know her.

589
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:01,488
She shouldn't be here.

590
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,261
Hey, bring a round
of the chasers, please.

591
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:06,996
Yes, thank you.

592
00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:10,593
If you haven't had this,
don't try it

593
00:35:10,729 --> 00:35:12,796
unless you want to change your life.

594
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:24,038
Mmm.

595
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:27,613
Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.

596
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:29,884
Two of them.

597
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,348
Human, like us.

598
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:33,157
Human, that's the word.

599
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:36,416
Totally forgot what you call
yourselves up there.

600
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,551
Human.

601
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:40,258
Are you not human?

602
00:35:40,394 --> 00:35:42,864
Not technically, but yes.

603
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,366
In the ways that matter.

604
00:35:49,003 --> 00:35:50,003
No!

605
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:54,871
Let us talk.

606
00:35:57,845 --> 00:36:02,076
So, what is it that brings you to us, Janet?

607
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:06,283
If I remember correctly, you left.

608
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:09,391
You left all of us.

609
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:11,294
With him.

610
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:14,792
Janet, what is he talking about?

611
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:19,566
You didn't tell them about him.

612
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:24,098
Did you say anything

613
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,243
about what you did here?

614
00:36:28,576 --> 00:36:30,742
How many people died because of you?

615
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:38,178
Does your family even know who you are?

616
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:43,018
Your mommy

617
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,355
is full of secrets.

618
00:36:46,491 --> 00:36:47,596
You're lying.

619
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:48,859
I lie.

620
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:51,191
A lot.

621
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:55,602
Not about this.

622
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:58,704
Let them go.

623
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,538
He just wants me.

624
00:37:02,674 --> 00:37:04,039
But you want them.

625
00:37:05,412 --> 00:37:06,976
So they're coming too.

626
00:37:08,244 --> 00:37:11,288
Along with those other friends of yours.

627
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:14,582
I heard about them.

628
00:37:14,717 --> 00:37:17,124
But he did too.

629
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,764
And, uh, he sent the Hunter.

630
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:23,098
What kind of hunter?

631
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:25,928
Uh, not a man.
Not a machine.

632
00:37:26,063 --> 00:37:29,969
A mechanized organism designed only

633
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:31,732
for killing.

634
00:37:33,945 --> 00:37:35,271
Where are they?

635
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:36,676
No clue.

636
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:39,079
Dead.

637
00:37:41,282 --> 00:37:42,550
Probably dead.

638
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:59,092
Oh, this is so sad when all of this

639
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:00,766
could have been avoided, Janet.

640
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:04,033
Just give him what he wants.

641
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:08,708
What happened to you?

642
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:14,516
We fought against him.

643
00:38:16,616 --> 00:38:18,487
He can be very persuasive.

644
00:38:20,784 --> 00:38:22,084
Let's pay him a visit.

645
00:38:26,163 --> 00:38:27,529
I think we're done here.

646
00:38:45,483 --> 00:38:46,803
Can that ship get us out of here?

647
00:38:49,484 --> 00:38:51,454
Cover me?
Always.

648
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:24,520
Henry, take the helm.

649
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:26,721
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

650
00:39:30,756 --> 00:39:32,753
Where are the controls?

651
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:34,093
Those are the controls.

652
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,060
What the hell?

653
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:41,064
You'll be great.
It's like flying a bike.

654
00:39:43,404 --> 00:39:45,409
Is the bike alive?

655
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:01,486
Hands, all the way in!

656
00:40:01,622 --> 00:40:02,756
Like stuffing a turkey.

657
00:40:03,092 --> 00:40:04,092
Ugh.

658
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,627
Really, him?
He used to be charming.

659
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:13,766
That guy?

660
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:15,799
I was down here for 30 years, Henry.

661
00:40:15,934 --> 00:40:17,702
I had needs.
Oh, my God.

662
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:19,634
Look, I get it.
I've got needs too.

663
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:20,806
Oh, my God!

664
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:23,474
I had dinner with someone a few times.

665
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,075
Her name was Linda.

666
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,082
It didn't work out.

667
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,777
What went wrong?

668
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:30,487
She wasn't you, baby.

669
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,749
Get everyone in the ships.
We're leaving.

670
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:36,884
All right.

671
00:40:36,955 --> 00:40:38,791
- And, Xolum.
- Right here.

672
00:40:38,926 --> 00:40:41,162
Take them as far away from here as you can.

673
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:42,455
Why?
What?

674
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,667
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

675
00:40:54,136 --> 00:40:55,839
You led them straight to us.

676
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:57,778
Come on, come on.

677
00:40:58,546 --> 00:40:59,906
Take as many as you can.

678
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,149
We'll hold them off.

679
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,470
Go!

680
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:29,036
Come on!
Hurry, hurry!

681
00:41:29,172 --> 00:41:30,673
We gotta go! We gotta go!

682
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:31,873
Get on.
Get on now!

683
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:33,275
We have to go now.
Now!

684
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:52,228
Oh, my God!

685
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:11,346
Cassie, let's go!

686
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,860
Get to the sanctuary.

687
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:21,763
Wait for my message.

688
00:42:21,899 --> 00:42:24,159
- Veb, we're leaving.
- No. No, wait!

689
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:26,328
- Move! Move!
- All my friends.

690
00:42:48,617 --> 00:42:49,869
<i><font color="#80ffff">Give up the travelers.</i></font>

691
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:51,253
<i><font color="#80ffff">The Conqueror will show you mercy.</i></font>

692
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,754
I know his mercy.

693
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,435
Stay here.
I'm...

694
00:43:08,706 --> 00:43:09,706
Cassie?

695
00:43:11,413 --> 00:43:12,413
Oh, no.

696
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,436
Okay.
I have a suit.

697
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:38,972
Yeah, I noticed.

698
00:43:39,674 --> 00:43:41,007
You okay?
Yes.

699
00:43:42,677 --> 00:43:44,041
Look, momentum, right?

700
00:43:44,176 --> 00:43:46,139
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

701
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:47,373
I know how to do it, Dad.

702
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:48,719
- Oh, do you? Really?
- Yes.

703
00:43:48,743 --> 00:43:49,993
'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.

704
00:43:50,017 --> 00:43:51,457
I just... I messed up on the timing.

705
00:43:51,486 --> 00:43:53,118
Jump...

706
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,992
Like that.

707
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:00,858
You see what I did?
You see what I did?

708
00:44:00,993 --> 00:44:02,828
No.
You're like this small.

709
00:44:02,963 --> 00:44:04,261
I jumped and tapped.

710
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,207
Jentorra, we have to go.

711
00:44:37,434 --> 00:44:38,497
Get to the ship!

712
00:45:26,378 --> 00:45:27,452
<i><font color="#80ffff">Welcome back</i></font>

713
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:29,842
<i><font color="#80ffff">to the Quantum Realm, Scott.</i></font>

714
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,547

a long time for this.</i></font>

715
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:34,351
What?

716
00:45:35,888 --> 00:45:37,087
Is someone in there?

717
00:45:37,222 --> 00:45:39,122
<i><font color="#80ffff">Oh, yes.</i></font>

718
00:45:39,257 --> 00:45:41,962

<i><font color="#80ffff">Our fates have always

720
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:49,171

721
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:51,669
Wow.

722
00:45:51,804 --> 00:45:53,276
Scott Lang.

723
00:45:53,411 --> 00:45:54,500
Get away from us!

724
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:56,102
<i><font color="#80ffff">The day you broke me.</i></font>

725
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:01,246
<i><font color="#80ffff">- Banished me down here.
- Wait.</i></font>

726
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:04,584
Darren?

727
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:07,890
Surprised to see me?

728
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:10,925
Yeah.

729
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,486
It's the bee guy?

730
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:14,430
- It's the bee guy?
- Cassie?

731
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:16,195
I almost didn't recognize you.

732
00:46:17,128 --> 00:46:18,798
How are you not dead?

733
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:20,837
I became the ultimate weapon.

734
00:46:22,104 --> 00:46:24,099
That... That...
That's what this is?

735
00:46:24,235 --> 00:46:26,201
Look, Darren.

736
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:31,738
Darren is dead!

737
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:35,412
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

738
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:38,616
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

739
00:46:38,752 --> 00:46:39,856
Not from me.

740
00:46:40,491 --> 00:46:42,122
And not from him.

741
00:46:43,153 --> 00:46:45,323
He's the future.

742
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:47,193
He's the past.

743
00:46:47,995 --> 00:46:51,230
And now all he needs is you.

744
00:46:57,538 --> 00:46:59,003
Mom?

745
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:00,844
What's after Scott and Cassie?

746
00:47:02,745 --> 00:47:04,177
We have to find them.

747
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,009
There's something I have to do first.

748
00:47:07,144 --> 00:47:08,614
They could be dead!

749
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:10,281
Hope, please.

750
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:12,016
And you're still hiding things from us.

751
00:47:12,151 --> 00:47:14,451
I am trying to protect you.

752
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:16,024
From what?

753
00:47:18,663 --> 00:47:20,523
Who are you so afraid of?

754
00:47:33,106 --> 00:47:34,471
Third time in jail?

755
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:37,639
Four.

756
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:48,419
<i><font color="#80ffff">And here we are again.</i></font>

757
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:51,059
Face to face.

758
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:55,063
That's a face.
It's a...

759
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,723
It's a big face.

760
00:47:57,859 --> 00:47:59,464
Why are you just a floating head?

761
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,729
Maybe you could
walk us through this, Darren.

762
00:48:01,865 --> 00:48:04,765
You left Darren to die
in the Quantum Realm.

763
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,443
<i><font color="#80ffff">But the Conqueror found me.</i></font>

764
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:10,178
<i><font color="#80ffff">Rebuilt me.</i></font>

765
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:12,873
<i><font color="#80ffff">Made me the ultimate weapon.</i></font>

766
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:15,846
<i><font color="#80ffff">A mechanized organism
designed only for...</i></font>

767
00:48:15,981 --> 00:48:16,981
Oh, M.O.D.O.K.?

768
00:48:18,222 --> 00:48:21,423
Oh, uh, MO... Oh, I get it.
It's an acronym.

769
00:48:21,558 --> 00:48:22,751
It's an acronym.

770
00:48:22,886 --> 00:48:25,885
Mechanized organism designed only for killing.

771
00:48:27,293 --> 00:48:28,954
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

772
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,064
I bet you thought
you'd seen the last of me.

773
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,496
Just now noticing the baby legs.

774
00:48:33,264 --> 00:48:34,295
They're not baby legs.

775
00:48:34,431 --> 00:48:35,868
A little bit like a Bjorn.

776
00:48:36,003 --> 00:48:37,535
You think you're so smart.

777
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,642
Scott Lang, the man
who took everything from me.

778
00:48:40,778 --> 00:48:42,301
Who stole my whole life.

779
00:48:42,437 --> 00:48:43,437
But I did it.

780
00:48:44,945 --> 00:48:46,649
I got you here.

781
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:48,815
I found your signal, Cassie.

782
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:50,116
Thanks for that, by the way.

783
00:48:50,252 --> 00:48:51,612
Couldn't have done it without you.

784
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:56,784
You're looking at a man set free.

785
00:48:57,795 --> 00:48:59,762
I've created so much more here

786
00:48:59,897 --> 00:49:01,459
than you could possibly imagine.

787
00:49:02,632 --> 00:49:05,932
All for him.

788
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:11,106
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

789
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:17,342
What is this place?

790
00:49:17,477 --> 00:49:19,509
<i><font color="#80ffff">He said he was a traveler.</i></font>

791
00:49:19,644 --> 00:49:22,546
A scientist who crashed off course.

792
00:49:30,287 --> 00:49:32,487
<i><font color="#80ffff">He had a ship</i></font>

793
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:35,725
beyond anything I had ever seen.

794
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,029
<i><font color="#80ffff">A ship that could travel the Multiverse.</i></font>

795
00:49:39,164 --> 00:49:40,366
The Multiverse?

796
00:49:41,399 --> 00:49:43,968
As in alternate dimensions?

797
00:49:44,103 --> 00:49:45,972
Parallel realities?

798
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,703
I didn't believe it at first.

799
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:50,943
But it's real.

800
00:49:52,707 --> 00:49:54,149
<i><font color="#80ffff">Just like we theorized.</i></font>

801
00:49:56,677 --> 00:49:59,385
Can this take us home?

802
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,750
It can take you anywhere.

803
00:50:07,832 --> 00:50:09,692
Yah!

804
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:22,837
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'd never met anyone like him.</i></font>

805
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,314
<i><font color="#80ffff">He felt so</i></font>

806
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,843
<i><font color="#80ffff">lost.</i></font>

807
00:50:30,514 --> 00:50:31,747
<i><font color="#80ffff">I guess we both were.</i></font>

808
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:34,090
<i><font color="#80ffff">But we had a way out.</i></font>

809
00:50:36,256 --> 00:50:38,522
<i><font color="#80ffff">We tried everything</i></font>

810
00:50:38,657 --> 00:50:41,427
<i><font color="#80ffff">to recharge his ship's energy core.</i></font>

811
00:50:47,035 --> 00:50:48,599
<i><font color="#80ffff">Nothing worked.</i></font>

812
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:54,803
<i><font color="#80ffff">But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.</i></font>

813
00:50:56,076 --> 00:50:57,542
I lied to Hope.

814
00:51:02,085 --> 00:51:03,746
I told her I was coming home.

815
00:51:07,892 --> 00:51:09,752
I can see her by the door.

816
00:51:12,257 --> 00:51:13,690
Waiting for me.

817
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:19,234
That's the last thing I did...

818
00:51:21,903 --> 00:51:23,062
was lie to her.

819
00:51:26,903 --> 00:51:28,903
I just thought I'd have more time.

820
00:51:33,785 --> 00:51:35,184
I can give that to you.

821
00:51:37,214 --> 00:51:38,214
Time.

822
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,456
It's not what you think it is.

823
00:51:47,764 --> 00:51:49,165
It's a cage.

824
00:51:50,594 --> 00:51:52,333
And it does everything it can

825
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:54,093
to break you.

826
00:51:57,298 --> 00:52:00,539
It's not until you free
yourself from it that you see

827
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:03,146
just how small

828
00:52:04,144 --> 00:52:05,346
it always was.

829
00:52:11,156 --> 00:52:12,984
We're going to get out of here.

830
00:52:16,283 --> 00:52:18,194
She's gonna open the door...

831
00:52:19,392 --> 00:52:20,823
...and you'll be there.

832
00:52:25,461 --> 00:52:26,631
I promise.

833
00:52:31,207 --> 00:52:33,033
Let's get to work.
Okay.

834
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:38,306
<i><font color="#80ffff">It took ages,
but we did it.</i></font>

835
00:52:40,677 --> 00:52:43,043
We brought it back to life.

836
00:52:45,185 --> 00:52:46,684
Let's go home.

837
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,119
<i><font color="#80ffff">His ship was neurokinetic.</i></font>

838
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,726
<i><font color="#80ffff">Connected to his thoughts.</i></font>

839
00:52:59,662 --> 00:53:00,662
<i><font color="#80ffff">When I touched it...</i></font>

840
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:04,268
I saw his mind.

841
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,700
<i><font color="#80ffff">I felt...</i></font>

842
00:53:08,508 --> 00:53:09,872
<i><font color="#80ffff">...what he had done.</i></font>

843
00:53:13,677 --> 00:53:15,482
<i><font color="#80ffff">Entire worlds,</i></font>

844
00:53:16,184 --> 00:53:18,419
<i><font color="#80ffff">entire timelines.</i></font>

845
00:53:18,555 --> 00:53:22,185
<i><font color="#80ffff">Gone, like they never even existed.</i></font>

846
00:53:41,008 --> 00:53:42,008
Janet?

847
00:53:46,818 --> 00:53:48,009
We can leave.

848
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:51,216
Right now.

849
00:53:56,222 --> 00:53:57,854
Who is Kang?

850
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:04,597
Who I need to be.

851
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:10,663
He didn't crash here.

852
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:12,473
He was exiled here.

853
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:16,741
Outside space and time.

854
00:54:17,948 --> 00:54:19,579
The only place

855
00:54:20,512 --> 00:54:22,109
that could hold him.

856
00:54:23,248 --> 00:54:24,617
Exiled?

857
00:54:25,284 --> 00:54:26,986
By who?

858
00:54:27,122 --> 00:54:28,122
I don't know.

859
00:54:30,622 --> 00:54:32,427
But they sabotaged his ship.

860
00:54:33,723 --> 00:54:35,463
And trapped him here.

861
00:54:37,935 --> 00:54:39,302
And because of me,

862
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,033
he was getting out.

863
00:54:42,168 --> 00:54:43,372
Janet?

864
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,442
Stay away.

865
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,746
You saved my life.

866
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:01,423
I made a promise.

867
00:55:08,363 --> 00:55:09,992
Just let me take you home.

868
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:12,830
And then?

869
00:55:14,996 --> 00:55:16,735
What are you going to do?

870
00:55:28,148 --> 00:55:29,347
Win.

871
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:51,198
I told you time isn't what you think.

872
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,004
I can make it...

873
00:55:55,805 --> 00:55:57,875
so you never left her.

874
00:55:59,217 --> 00:56:02,418
Hope is going to open the door

875
00:56:03,845 --> 00:56:05,179
and you'll be there.

876
00:56:06,182 --> 00:56:08,523
And how many worlds will die...

877
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:11,592
if you get out?

878
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:14,188
Not yours.

879
00:56:15,923 --> 00:56:17,565
She'll never know.

880
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:24,869
Don't you want
to see your daughter again?

881
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:28,741
I can't let you leave.

882
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:33,207
Why do you think you can stop me?

883
00:56:51,201 --> 00:56:52,567
Give it to me, Janet.

884
00:56:54,038 --> 00:56:55,471
Give it to me!

885
00:56:55,606 --> 00:56:58,573
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

886
00:56:59,439 --> 00:57:00,443
What did you do?

887
00:57:04,941 --> 00:57:06,449
I'm sorry, Hope.

888
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:09,980
No!

889
00:57:37,238 --> 00:57:39,004
<i><font color="#80ffff">I blew up his core.</i></font>

890
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:41,617
<i><font color="#80ffff">Cut him off from time.</i></font>

891
00:57:41,752 --> 00:57:44,652
<i><font color="#80ffff">And trapped us both
down here forever.</i></font>

892
00:57:46,686 --> 00:57:48,651
But I gave him back enough.

893
00:57:48,787 --> 00:57:50,456
Now that he had his suit back,

894
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,958
he became what he always was.

895
00:57:54,857 --> 00:57:56,597
<i><font color="#80ffff">A conqueror.</i></font>

896
00:57:56,733 --> 00:57:59,327
<i><font color="#80ffff">He's got weapons and technology</i></font>

897
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:03,836
<i><font color="#80ffff">centuries beyond anything
we can dream of.</i></font>

898
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:07,774
<i><font color="#80ffff">He took his prison
and made it his empire.</i></font>

899
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:12,073
I spent years fighting him,

900
00:58:12,209 --> 00:58:14,814
running from him,
hiding from him.

901
00:58:16,517 --> 00:58:17,916
And then you saved me.

902
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,291
You brought me home.

903
00:58:24,195 --> 00:58:25,220
But I didn't deserve it.

904
00:58:27,026 --> 00:58:30,658
I unleashed a monster on this place

905
00:58:30,794 --> 00:58:32,896
and ran away.

906
00:58:33,032 --> 00:58:36,462
Janet, you couldn't have known.

907
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:40,576
I'm sorry I never told you.

908
00:58:41,674 --> 00:58:43,546
I just wanted to forget.

909
00:58:45,044 --> 00:58:47,374
I just wanted to be your mom again.

910
00:58:52,748 --> 00:58:55,723
I'm so sorry you had to
go through all of that alone.

911
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,320
But you are not alone now.

912
00:59:02,992 --> 00:59:04,391
We'll stop him together.

913
00:59:05,467 --> 00:59:07,866
He's after the core.

914
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,438
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

915
00:59:10,573 --> 00:59:12,404
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,

916
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,969
he's got Pym Particles.

917
00:59:14,104 --> 00:59:15,972
And a head start.
Exactly.

918
00:59:16,108 --> 00:59:18,113
- We gotta get out of here.
- Hope.

919
00:59:18,248 --> 00:59:19,912
He cannot get out.

920
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:42,935
You're an interesting man...

921
00:59:46,605 --> 00:59:48,573
Scott Lang.

922
00:59:48,709 --> 00:59:50,910
Um, I don't know who you are,

923
00:59:52,273 --> 00:59:53,847
but you've made a big mistake.

924
00:59:54,481 --> 00:59:55,508
Okay?

925
00:59:56,484 --> 00:59:58,685
I'm an Avenger.

926
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:00,551
I've called the other Avengers...

927
01:00:00,686 --> 01:00:01,921
You're an Avenger?

928
01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:06,090
Have I killed you before?

929
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,762
What?

930
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,798
They all blur together after a while.

931
01:00:13,264 --> 01:00:14,730
You're not the one with the hammer?

932
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:16,166
No, that's Thor.

933
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:19,134
We get confused a lot.

934
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:21,501
Similar body types.
Who are you?

935
01:00:23,939 --> 01:00:25,043
Just a man

936
01:00:25,878 --> 01:00:27,775
who's lost a lot of time.

937
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,047
Like you.

938
01:00:31,448 --> 01:00:33,447
But we can help each other with that.

939
01:00:35,254 --> 01:00:37,492
M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.

940
01:00:37,627 --> 01:00:40,126
Yeah, he stole something from me.

941
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:43,827
Do not speak when I am in the room.

942
01:00:51,842 --> 01:00:54,303
Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

943
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:56,305
You know Janet too?

944
01:00:57,638 --> 01:00:59,814
Does everyone down here know Janet?

945
01:01:01,112 --> 01:01:02,718
She didn't tell you about me?

946
01:01:07,316 --> 01:01:08,988
I guess that's not a surprise.

947
01:01:11,628 --> 01:01:13,696
Janet stole something from me.

948
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:17,227
My ticket out of here.

949
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:23,095
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

950
01:01:23,231 --> 01:01:24,838
And why would I do that?

951
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:28,003
Because you want to get out of here.

952
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:32,209
And I need to get out of here.

953
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:36,714
Because I know how it ends.

954
01:01:36,849 --> 01:01:38,248
How what ends?

955
01:01:41,555 --> 01:01:42,989
All of it.

956
01:01:46,388 --> 01:01:49,523
I don't live in a straight line.

957
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:53,802
And with time,

958
01:01:54,765 --> 01:01:56,227
it's hard

959
01:01:56,363 --> 01:01:58,070
not to skip to the end.

960
01:01:59,844 --> 01:02:02,041
So, if you want to stop what's coming,

961
01:02:02,874 --> 01:02:05,113
and trust me,

962
01:02:05,248 --> 01:02:06,507
you do...

963
01:02:08,816 --> 01:02:10,918
I am the only shot you have.

964
01:02:11,652 --> 01:02:12,755
What's coming?

965
01:02:14,884 --> 01:02:15,890
Me.

966
01:02:17,888 --> 01:02:20,422
A lot of me.

967
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:28,430
They exiled me, down here.

968
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,336
They're afraid of me.

969
01:02:39,048 --> 01:02:42,246
But I'm the man who can get you home.

970
01:02:50,755 --> 01:02:52,091
So,

971
01:02:52,924 --> 01:02:54,423
do we have a deal?

972
01:02:57,798 --> 01:02:59,692
No, I don't think we do.

973
01:03:07,907 --> 01:03:09,973
Dad!

974
01:03:10,109 --> 01:03:12,580
Let me make this easy for you.

975
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:14,442
You will bring me what I need

976
01:03:14,577 --> 01:03:16,915
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you,

977
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:19,151
then make you relive that moment

978
01:03:19,286 --> 01:03:22,623
over and over again in time, endlessly,

979
01:03:22,759 --> 01:03:25,190
until you beg me to kill you.

980
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,830
Do we understand?

981
01:03:31,632 --> 01:03:32,632
Don't do this.

982
01:03:36,303 --> 01:03:38,599
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

983
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:42,944
Dad.

984
01:03:44,108 --> 01:03:45,309
Don't listen to him.

985
01:03:46,683 --> 01:03:48,681
No! No!

986
01:03:48,817 --> 01:03:49,977
Look, we can talk about this.

987
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:51,518
Don't do it!

988
01:03:51,654 --> 01:03:53,013
You really should do it.

989
01:03:53,148 --> 01:03:54,184
Please.

990
01:03:55,991 --> 01:03:58,190
That's my daughter, please.

991
01:03:58,325 --> 01:04:00,822
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

992
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:01,990
Please!

993
01:04:02,126 --> 01:04:03,264
You think I'm lying?

994
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:06,165
Do I look like a liar to you?

995
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:09,000
Stop!

996
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,670
Dad!
I'll do it. I'll do it.

997
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:12,363
I'll do it.
Just let her go.

998
01:04:12,499 --> 01:04:14,309
Let her go.
Let her go!

999
01:04:24,985 --> 01:04:26,218
You're out of your league.

1000
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:29,254
Ant-Man.

1001
01:04:35,522 --> 01:04:37,295
Just be glad I need you.

1002
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:54,340
Don't touch her again.

1003
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:56,050
Then give me what I need.

1004
01:04:57,784 --> 01:04:59,053
Where is it?

1005
01:05:40,597 --> 01:05:42,027
What is that?

1006
01:05:42,162 --> 01:05:44,560
It was a multiversal engine core.

1007
01:05:46,232 --> 01:05:47,602
A power source that can take you

1008
01:05:47,738 --> 01:05:49,664
anywhere in space and time.

1009
01:05:51,432 --> 01:05:53,008
Then Janet blew it up.

1010
01:05:57,372 --> 01:05:58,711
It's in that?

1011
01:05:58,846 --> 01:06:00,782
It is that.

1012
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:02,848
And we have to get to the center.

1013
01:06:02,984 --> 01:06:05,185
That's good to know.

1014
01:06:07,023 --> 01:06:08,398
You'll have to shrink down

1015
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:10,287
and pass through the eye of the storm.

1016
01:06:10,423 --> 01:06:13,056
Once you're inside, find the core

1017
01:06:13,191 --> 01:06:14,958
and size it back down.

1018
01:06:15,094 --> 01:06:16,597
What does it look like?

1019
01:06:16,733 --> 01:06:17,756
When I steal something,

1020
01:06:17,892 --> 01:06:19,077
I usually know what I'm stealing.

1021
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:20,759
You'll know it when you see it.

1022
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:23,199
Get in and out as fast as you can.

1023
01:06:23,334 --> 01:06:24,599
The longer you're in there,

1024
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:26,635
the more your mind will come undone.

1025
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,503
Better hurry.

1026
01:06:31,777 --> 01:06:32,971
Dad!

1027
01:06:35,216 --> 01:06:36,881
I'm sorry.

1028
01:06:37,016 --> 01:06:38,548
This is all my fault.

1029
01:06:39,283 --> 01:06:41,815
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1030
01:06:42,217 --> 01:06:43,223
No.

1031
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:46,061
I messed up.

1032
01:06:46,596 --> 01:06:48,393
Cassie.

1033
01:06:48,528 --> 01:06:50,725
My whole life happened
because I messed up.

1034
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,828
The only thing I didn't mess up is you.

1035
01:06:58,035 --> 01:06:59,206
Dad!

1036
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:00,940
It's okay.

1037
01:07:01,038 --> 01:07:02,176
It's okay.

1038
01:07:04,913 --> 01:07:06,780
I love you, Peanut.

1039
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:09,551
I love you too.

1040
01:07:53,521 --> 01:07:55,196
Okay.
I'm in.

1041
01:07:58,494 --> 01:08:00,534
Darren, can you hear me?

1042
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:01,670
Darren?

1043
01:08:02,539 --> 01:08:03,567
Darren?

1044
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:08,073
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

Why am I looking at another me?

I'm not another me.
You're another me.

You don't know?
Why would I know?

No.

Why are you dressed like that?

Come on!
<i><font color="#80ffff">Give him a boost!</i></font>

1139
01:11:52,794 --> 01:11:53,830
<i><font color="#80ffff">Give him a boost!</i></font>

1140
01:11:55,839 --> 01:11:58,368
<i><font color="#80ffff">Come on, we're doing it for Cassie!
Fellas, let's go!</i></font>

1141
01:11:58,503 --> 01:12:00,237
<i><font color="#80ffff">Everyone together!</i></font>

1142
01:12:00,372 --> 01:12:01,409
What are you doing?

1143
01:12:02,211 --> 01:12:03,671
How are you able to do that?

1144
01:12:03,806 --> 01:12:04,874
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'll tell you how.</i></font>

1145
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:08,141
We all want the same thing.

1146
01:12:10,053 --> 01:12:12,384
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1147
01:12:20,425 --> 01:12:22,528
Go get her, pal.

1148
01:12:27,169 --> 01:12:28,700
Everyone, let's go!

1149
01:12:31,104 --> 01:12:32,330
Come on!

1150
01:12:40,312 --> 01:12:41,312
Come on, closer.

1151
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,380
<i><font color="#80ffff">Get him higher!</i></font>

1152
01:12:42,515 --> 01:12:44,177
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hang on, guys, hang on.</i></font>

1153
01:12:45,485 --> 01:12:47,388
<i><font color="#80ffff">Careful.
Steady, steady.</i></font>

1154
01:12:49,983 --> 01:12:51,892
<i><font color="#80ffff">Steady.
That's it.</i></font>

1155
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:53,028
<i><font color="#80ffff">Let's go.</i></font>

1156
01:12:59,398 --> 01:13:00,398
<i><font color="#80ffff">What?</i></font>

1157
01:13:03,937 --> 01:13:05,603
<i><font color="#80ffff">No.
What happened? Did it work?</i></font>

1158
01:13:05,739 --> 01:13:07,466
Sorry, buddy!

1159
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:09,367
<i><font color="#80ffff">- No, no, no.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80ffff">- No, no, no.</i></font>

1160
01:13:19,486 --> 01:13:21,890
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hope, are you real?</i></font>

1161
01:13:22,025 --> 01:13:23,784
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'm real.</i></font>

1162
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,960
<i><font color="#80ffff">Then let's do this.</i></font>

1163
01:13:29,923 --> 01:13:31,262
<i><font color="#80ffff">You ready?</i></font>

1164
01:13:31,397 --> 01:13:32,397
<i><font color="#80ffff">Ready.</i></font>

1165
01:14:18,444 --> 01:14:19,513
Come on.

1166
01:14:19,648 --> 01:14:20,889
We gotta get that thing out of here.

1167
01:14:20,913 --> 01:14:23,415
No, no, no. Wait.
He's got Cassie.

1168
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,176
- What?
- Scott.

1169
01:14:25,312 --> 01:14:27,320
Janet.
Give that to me.

1170
01:14:27,456 --> 01:14:28,484
We have to go now.
No.

1171
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:29,914
He's got Cassie.

1172
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,049
We will save her.

1173
01:14:31,121 --> 01:14:32,659
I promise you we will save her,

1174
01:14:34,157 --> 01:14:36,329
but you cannot give that to him.

1175
01:14:36,464 --> 01:14:38,099
I wouldn't trust her.

1176
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,362
Janet has a way of...

1177
01:14:46,472 --> 01:14:47,872
changing her mind.

1178
01:14:54,711 --> 01:14:57,211
Hello, Jellybean.

1179
01:15:03,388 --> 01:15:04,482
So...

1180
01:15:08,298 --> 01:15:09,894
what's it gonna be, Scott?

1181
01:15:13,493 --> 01:15:15,735
<i><font color="#80ffff">Well, well.</i></font>

1182
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:19,739
<i><font color="#80ffff">If it isn't my old mentor.</i></font>

1183
01:15:24,146 --> 01:15:25,146
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hi, Hank.</i></font>

1184
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:29,716
Darren?

1185
01:15:30,384 --> 01:15:31,384
Didn't expect to see

1186
01:15:31,477 --> 01:15:32,845
your protege again after all...

1187
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,688
Holy shit, Darren.

1188
01:15:35,654 --> 01:15:37,017
What happened to you?

1189
01:15:37,152 --> 01:15:39,521
I'm the ultimate weapon!

1190
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:52,205
Do I need to take it?

1191
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,465
Where is my daughter?

1192
01:15:55,572 --> 01:15:56,578
Scott.

1193
01:15:57,904 --> 01:15:58,910
Don't.

1194
01:15:59,842 --> 01:16:02,547
We had a deal.

1195
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:04,047
She'll be fine without you.

1196
01:16:29,578 --> 01:16:31,206
<i><font color="#80ffff">So long, Hank.</i></font>

1197
01:16:38,747 --> 01:16:39,753
Henry.

1198
01:16:46,925 --> 01:16:49,224
You left me right here to die.

1199
01:16:53,402 --> 01:16:54,834
Let's see how they do.

1200
01:17:55,661 --> 01:17:57,094
What did you see?

1201
01:18:05,834 --> 01:18:09,205
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1202
01:18:11,205 --> 01:18:12,340
But I always wondered.

1203
01:18:16,145 --> 01:18:18,049
When you touched my mind...

1204
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:31,227
what did you see?

1205
01:18:32,059 --> 01:18:33,328
A monster

1206
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,528
who thinks he's a god.

1207
01:18:36,663 --> 01:18:39,101
When you can see time the way I do,

1208
01:18:39,237 --> 01:18:41,202
you don't get to close your eyes.

1209
01:18:41,338 --> 01:18:44,075
And you're the only one who sees?

1210
01:18:44,211 --> 01:18:49,073
I am the only one
that can see it's broken.

1211
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:50,378
And who broke it?

1212
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:54,052
I did.

1213
01:18:55,248 --> 01:18:58,254
Every version of me.

1214
01:18:59,427 --> 01:19:01,461
My variants.

1215
01:19:01,597 --> 01:19:02,962
Throughout the Multiverse.

1216
01:19:05,263 --> 01:19:08,462
Playing with time,
like children.

1217
01:19:10,869 --> 01:19:13,907
But I saw how it ends.

1218
01:19:15,202 --> 01:19:17,174
I saw their chaos

1219
01:19:17,976 --> 01:19:20,947
spreading across realities.

1220
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,346
Universes colliding.

1221
01:19:25,818 --> 01:19:27,085
Endless incursions.

1222
01:19:28,414 --> 01:19:30,385
I saw the Multiverse.

1223
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:32,959
And it was dying.

1224
01:19:34,695 --> 01:19:35,995
All because of them.

1225
01:19:37,533 --> 01:19:39,928
So, I took control.

1226
01:19:40,064 --> 01:19:41,902
You mean you started a war.

1227
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:43,934
And now you wanna wipe away

1228
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,972
any universe that's a threat to you.

1229
01:19:47,071 --> 01:19:48,640
That's what monsters do.

1230
01:19:48,776 --> 01:19:52,007
That's what conquerors do.

1231
01:19:52,142 --> 01:19:54,981
They burn the broken world.

1232
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,820
And they make a new one.

1233
01:19:58,955 --> 01:20:01,823
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

1234
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:06,289
You only want revenge
because they beat you.

1235
01:20:07,155 --> 01:20:08,155
Because you lost.

1236
01:20:08,254 --> 01:20:10,359
I have lost.

1237
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:16,167
You have no idea what I have lost.

1238
01:20:17,707 --> 01:20:21,640
And I will burn them out of time

1239
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:24,009
for what they've done to me.

1240
01:20:24,145 --> 01:20:28,681
You'll be wiping out entire timelines.

1241
01:20:28,817 --> 01:20:31,952
Murdering trillions of people.

1242
01:20:33,348 --> 01:20:35,857
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1243
01:20:57,838 --> 01:20:59,309
<i><font color="#80ffff">Oh, God.
What am I doing?</i></font>

1244
01:21:10,086 --> 01:21:11,255
<i><font color="#80ffff">What?</i></font>

1245
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:16,497
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hank!</i></font>

1246
01:21:20,097 --> 01:21:21,397
Are these your ants?

1247
01:21:22,098 --> 01:21:23,196
From the ant farm?

1248
01:21:23,332 --> 01:21:25,432
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1249
01:21:25,568 --> 01:21:26,974
How did you find them down here?

1250
01:21:28,575 --> 01:21:31,143
I've been picking up strange
signals ever since we crashed.

1251
01:21:33,381 --> 01:21:36,011
<i><font color="#80ffff">First I thought
maybe it was a malfunction.</i></font>

1252
01:21:36,147 --> 01:21:37,747
Some kind of interference.

1253
01:21:37,883 --> 01:21:39,782
What is that?

1254
01:21:39,918 --> 01:21:41,054
But it wasn't.

1255
01:21:42,415 --> 01:21:43,617
It was the ants.

1256
01:21:45,587 --> 01:21:48,457
They were reaching out the whole time.

1257
01:21:49,923 --> 01:21:51,457
<i><font color="#80ffff">Apparently, they passed through</i></font>

1258
01:21:51,592 --> 01:21:53,861
<i><font color="#80ffff">some sort of time dilation.</i></font>

1259
01:21:53,996 --> 01:21:57,236
<i><font color="#80ffff">They've lived thousands
of years in a single day,</i></font>

1260
01:21:57,371 --> 01:22:00,541
<i><font color="#80ffff">expanding their knowledge,
their science,</i></font>

1261

1262
01:22:01,902 --> 01:22:03,742
<i><font color="#80ffff">than I could have ever thought.</i></font>

1263
01:22:03,878 --> 01:22:05,276
<i><font color="#80ffff">I didn't find them.</i></font>

1264
01:22:06,142 --> 01:22:07,410
They found me.

1265
01:22:09,477 --> 01:22:11,117
I told you they were smart.

1266
01:22:13,581 --> 01:22:14,821
They've already built something

1267
01:22:14,915 --> 01:22:18,749
of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.

1268
01:22:18,885 --> 01:22:21,786
I mean, I know socialism
is a charged word,

1269
01:22:21,922 --> 01:22:23,857
but we could learn a lot from these...

1270
01:22:23,993 --> 01:22:25,098
Dad.

1271
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:27,166
Yeah, they're my ants.

1272
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,966
And ants don't give up.

1273
01:22:30,102 --> 01:22:31,297
I don't care who this guy is.

1274
01:22:31,433 --> 01:22:32,671
I don't care what he can do.

1275
01:22:32,806 --> 01:22:34,140
I'm getting Cassie.

1276
01:22:34,275 --> 01:22:36,442
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

1277
01:22:39,648 --> 01:22:41,109
We've got some ideas.

1278
01:22:41,244 --> 01:22:42,278
What are you thinking?

1279
01:22:42,414 --> 01:22:45,415
Well, as a great writer once said,

1280
01:22:46,383 --> 01:22:48,616
"There's always room to grow."

1281
01:22:50,989 --> 01:22:52,092
You read my book?

1282
01:22:52,827 --> 01:22:56,162
Every goddamn word.

1283
01:22:58,801 --> 01:23:00,166
Come on.
Let's go to work.

1284
01:23:13,112 --> 01:23:14,979
Hey! I'm sorry.

1285
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,979
That was probably terrifying.

1286
01:23:17,115 --> 01:23:18,382
What are you doing here?

1287
01:23:19,116 --> 01:23:20,252
I'm rescuing you.

1288
01:23:20,654 --> 01:23:21,654
How?

1289
01:23:23,221 --> 01:23:25,353
That's a good question.

1290
01:23:25,488 --> 01:23:28,194
Does this thing have like a key?

1291
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,356
Or a card? Like a room key?

1292
01:23:30,491 --> 01:23:31,760
Do you know, like a...

1293
01:23:33,667 --> 01:23:34,667
Shit!

1294
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:43,374
<i><font color="#80ffff">Jump and tap.</i></font>

1295
01:23:52,379 --> 01:23:53,417
Jentorra.

1296
01:23:54,849 --> 01:23:56,651
I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

1297
01:23:58,352 --> 01:23:59,357
How can I help?

1298
01:24:04,532 --> 01:24:05,599
Wow.

1299
01:24:05,735 --> 01:24:06,892
Let's hurt 'em back.

1300
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:09,334
Damn, you're cool.

1301
01:24:10,234 --> 01:24:11,301
Do you have a plan?

1302
01:24:11,437 --> 01:24:12,797
Freeing you was basically my plan.

1303
01:24:13,743 --> 01:24:15,066
Do you have a plan?

1304
01:24:15,202 --> 01:24:17,573
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1305
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:19,421
Then free our people
from the detention cells below

1306
01:24:19,445 --> 01:24:20,825
and launch a counteroffensive from within.

1307
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:21,849
Yeah, you have a plan.

1308
01:24:21,909 --> 01:24:23,189
So, how do we get a message out?

1309
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,548
Follow me.
Okay. Great.

1310
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:33,160
I built an empire down here, Janet.

1311
01:24:35,623 --> 01:24:37,164
And I'm taking it with me.

1312
01:24:53,345 --> 01:24:54,585
You really should've let me out

1313
01:24:54,707 --> 01:24:56,073
when you had the chance.

1314
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:08,459
History is not written.

Is this working?</i></font>

1322
01:25:34,249 --> 01:25:35,321
Cassie?

01:25:35,456 --> 01:25:37,290
<i><font color="#80ffff">I can't tell if this is working.</i></font>

1324
01:25:38,653 --> 01:25:40,194
Okay.
I think we're on.

1325
01:25:40,329 --> 01:25:41,889
I'll hold them off.
Get the message out.

1326
01:25:41,924 --> 01:25:43,604
I thought you were getting
the message out.

1327
01:25:45,259 --> 01:25:46,291
Now!

1328
01:25:47,598 --> 01:25:49,803
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

1329
01:25:49,938 --> 01:25:50,969
<i><font color="#80ffff">And I'm with Jentorra.</i></font>

1331
01:25:58,739 --> 01:26:00,714
I know it might feel like

they would too.</i></font>

for the little guy.</i></font>

1338
01:26:15,722 --> 01:26:17,494
My dad taught me that.

We need to move!

1343
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:29,335
Come to the tower!
Fight back!

1344

Cassie.

1348
01:26:37,081 --> 01:26:38,855
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1349
01:26:38,879 --> 01:26:40,381
Let's go.
I'll drive.

1350
01:26:46,654 --> 01:26:48,356
Find Lang's daughter.

1351
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:52,398
Kill her.

1352
01:27:11,516 --> 01:27:13,020
Let's go. Let's go!

Free the others. Go!

1356
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:31,796
He's gonna see us coming.

1357
01:27:31,931 --> 01:27:33,967
Yeah.
I'll make sure of it.

1358
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:36,068
Begin the launch.

Get down!

Just don't be a dick.

Citrus. It's weird. I know.
Citrus.

- No!
- Come on.

1450
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:22,814
<i><font color="#80ffff">You son of a...</i></font>

1451
01:39:26,053 --> 01:39:27,683
- Oh, God.
- Scott.

1452
01:39:27,819 --> 01:39:28,819
Come on.

1453
01:39:33,587 --> 01:39:36,194
You think this is new to me?

1454
01:39:37,562 --> 01:39:42,266
Do you know how many
rebellions I have put down?

1455
01:39:43,969 --> 01:39:45,464
No, no, no, no, no.

1456
01:39:45,599 --> 01:39:49,075
How many worlds I've conquered?

1457
01:39:49,976 --> 01:39:52,205
How many Avengers I've killed?

1458
01:39:52,341 --> 01:39:54,909
And you think you can beat me?

1459
01:39:55,044 --> 01:39:56,579
I am Kang!

1460
01:39:56,715 --> 01:39:57,743
You...

1461
01:39:58,818 --> 01:40:01,054
You talk to ants.

1462
01:41:20,933 --> 01:41:23,526
My name is Darren,

1463
01:41:23,662 --> 01:41:28,141
and I am not a dick!

1464
01:41:49,654 --> 01:41:50,922
Sorry I'm late.

1465
01:41:53,228 --> 01:41:54,464
Lotta ants.

1466
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:56,902
Oh, is this you?

1467
01:41:58,163 --> 01:41:59,683
Maybe you were right about me, Cassie.

1468
01:42:01,776 --> 01:42:02,776
Darren.

1469
01:42:04,569 --> 01:42:05,569
Are you okay?

1470
01:42:08,309 --> 01:42:09,545
Probably not.

1471
01:42:10,918 --> 01:42:12,548
Darren?
Hi, Hope.

1472
01:42:13,514 --> 01:42:14,951
You changed your hair.

1473
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:19,621
What the hell happened?

1474
01:42:20,388 --> 01:42:21,623
Yeah.
No, it's...

1475
01:42:21,758 --> 01:42:23,318
It's a whole thing.
I'll tell you later.

1476
01:42:23,996 --> 01:42:25,424
That was... I...

1477
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:26,958
I don't know what to say.

1478
01:42:27,593 --> 01:42:29,332
Thanks, Scott.

1479
01:42:29,468 --> 01:42:32,667
You always were a brother to me.

1480
01:42:34,807 --> 01:42:35,807
I was?

1481
01:42:43,684 --> 01:42:44,778
I was.

1482
01:42:58,899 --> 01:43:00,563
And at least I died

1483
01:43:02,132 --> 01:43:03,665
an Avenger.

1484
01:43:06,905 --> 01:43:07,933
Yeah.

1485
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,604
You did.
Yeah. No, it's...

1486
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:12,278
You're in.

1487
01:43:28,358 --> 01:43:29,955
A lot has happened today.

1488
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:31,924
<i><font color="#80ffff">Henry?</i></font>
Janet?

1489
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:33,925
- Mom, where are you?
<i><font color="#80ffff">- I'm in the tower.</i></font>

1490
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:36,099
I think I can give us one shot back.

1491
01:43:36,235 --> 01:43:38,101
But we don't have much time.

1492
01:43:38,236 --> 01:43:39,866
If we wanna go home...

1493
01:43:42,338 --> 01:43:43,738
we have to go now.

1494
01:43:44,373 --> 01:43:45,377
We'll finish this.

1495
01:43:47,682 --> 01:43:48,710
Thank you.

1496
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:51,113
Thank you.

1497
01:43:51,249 --> 01:43:52,609
Oh, wow!

1498
01:43:52,744 --> 01:43:54,315
Come on!
Let's go!

1499
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:55,920
All right.
Good luck.

1500
01:43:56,055 --> 01:43:57,951
Good luck.
Come on.

1501
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:28,888
Thanks, buddy.

1502
01:44:31,122 --> 01:44:32,122
You did it.

1503
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:37,055
Let's go home.

1504
01:44:58,919 --> 01:44:59,952
Where's Scott?

1505
01:45:00,088 --> 01:45:01,618
He was right behind me.

1506
01:45:44,695 --> 01:45:46,332
You should've looked the other way.

1507
01:45:46,468 --> 01:45:49,127
Yeah, well,
never been great at that.

1508
01:45:57,112 --> 01:45:58,543
And you're not getting out.

1509
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:10,555
I want you to remember.

1510
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:13,591
You could've gone home.

1511
01:46:28,741 --> 01:46:30,875
You could've seen your daughter again.

1512
01:46:44,555 --> 01:46:45,953
But you thought you could win.

1513
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,836
I don't have to win.

1514
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:04,268
We both just have to lose.

1515
01:47:54,791 --> 01:47:56,727
Dad!

1516
01:48:03,863 --> 01:48:05,037
Where...
Where...

1517
01:48:05,173 --> 01:48:06,295
Where is she?
Is she...

1518
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:07,669
No, she's okay.
Where is she?

1519
01:48:07,805 --> 01:48:09,507
She's okay.
She's okay. She's okay.

1520
01:48:09,643 --> 01:48:11,043
Scott, they're all okay.
She's safe?

1521
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,538
They're all okay.
You did it.

1522
01:48:12,673 --> 01:48:13,678
You did it.

1523
01:48:17,112 --> 01:48:19,044
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
No, no, no.

1524
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:20,586
No, don't let go.
Don't let go.

1525
01:48:21,221 --> 01:48:22,417
Don't let go.

1526
01:48:22,552 --> 01:48:23,820
Don't ever let go.

1527
01:48:25,455 --> 01:48:26,757
I got you.

1528
01:48:29,559 --> 01:48:30,728
You came back.

1529
01:48:41,133 --> 01:48:42,399
I love you, Hope.

1530
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:46,403
I love you, Scott.

1531
01:50:00,287 --> 01:50:01,621
Let's go home.

1532
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:05,482
Home's good.

You are the bug!

1544
01:50:38,749 --> 01:50:41,292
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

1545

You're the bug man.

1546
01:50:42,896 --> 01:50:45,994
You get big and get small like a big bug!

1547
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:48,793
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

1548
01:50:48,928 --> 01:50:50,034
Twelve dollar.

Oh.

Wow.

1556
01:51:06,114 --> 01:51:07,443
You... You made this yourself?

01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:09,058
Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes.

1558

I know.

This is the first one
I've made since 1997.

<i><font color="#80ffff">Happy Birthday to you</i></font>

Ah.
Thanks.

1591
01:52:38,436 --> 01:52:40,410
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1592
01:52:44,582 --> 01:52:45,977
Oh.

1593
01:55:18,333 --> 01:55:21,897
So, the exiled one is dead.

1594
01:55:24,204 --> 01:55:26,604
You sure he's dead?

1595
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:30,109
If it wasn't true,
I wouldn't call you.

1596
01:55:30,245 --> 01:55:31,511
Must really eat you up,

1597
01:55:31,646 --> 01:55:33,582
that you're not the one who killed him.

1598
01:55:33,717 --> 01:55:36,351
None of us

1599
01:55:37,216 --> 01:55:38,914
killed him.

1600
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:43,325
They did.

1601
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:48,000
They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.

1602
01:55:48,669 --> 01:55:50,469
And if we let them,

1603
01:55:50,604 --> 01:55:52,433
they will take...

1604
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:55,469
everything

1605
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,406
we've built.

1606
01:55:59,439 --> 01:56:01,981
So let's stop wasting time.

1607
01:56:05,618 --> 01:56:06,810
We're late.

1608
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:11,357
How many did you call?

1609
01:56:11,492 --> 01:56:13,916
All of us.

1610
02:03:36,829 --> 02:03:41,803
Time is everything.

1611
02:03:47,070 --> 02:03:51,243
It shapes our lives.

1612
02:03:51,379 --> 02:03:55,311
But, perhaps, we can shape...

1613
02:03:57,121 --> 02:03:58,182
...it.

1614
02:03:59,456 --> 02:04:00,852
It's him.

1615
02:04:00,988 --> 02:04:02,304
What?
You made him sound

1616
02:04:02,328 --> 02:04:04,287
like this terrifying figure.

1617
02:04:05,965 --> 02:04:07,026
He is.

1618
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:25,075
