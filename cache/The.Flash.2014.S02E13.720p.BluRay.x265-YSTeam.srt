1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:06,307
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,268
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:13,146
but secretly, with the help of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,559
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,818
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,775
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,443
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,827
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,621
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,125
I'm in full-on vibe mode right now.

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,832
I wasn't fast enough
to protect Iris.

12
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:37,996
- I felt slower.
- I did it.

13
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:41,133
I stole your speed. I gave it to Zoom.

14
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:42,459
Give me back my daughter.

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,880
Bring me the rest of Flash's speed.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,631
I told you we're a team.

17
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,517
We're going to help you save Jesse.
We're going to Earth-2.

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,762
Journal log entry one-fifteen.

19
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,274
My last entry on this earth.

20
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,104
We're closing the breaches. All of them.

21
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:08,403
Soon, every portal between this earth
and mine will no longer exist.

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,948
I've become distracted by this earth.

23
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,617
By its problems. Its people.

24
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,159
Twenty-nine.

25
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:17,828
Twenty-eight.

26
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,670
Twenty-seven.

27
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:20,960
Twenty-six.

28
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,673
But the one thing I never
lost track of was you, Jesse.

29
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,554
You are my conscience. My beating heart.

30
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,176
You're the reason I've made it this far
in my fight against Zoom.

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,015
And now, I Just need you to hang on,

32
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:37,646
hang on a little bit longer.

33
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:41,436
Because I'm coming to get you.

34
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,606
And this time,

35
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,525
I'm not coming alone.

36
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,837
Bam! Uh! That's how it's done.

37
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,123
Whoo!

38
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,628
He shoots. He scores.

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,543
- Not bad for a guy who got a C in gym.
- D plus.

40
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,383
Straight up F. Right here.

41
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,138
I can't believe it.
We closed all the breaches.

42
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,015
All except the one.
Our last way to Earth-2.

43
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,384
Ready?

44
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,724
Yeah. I just have a few things
to take care of first.

45
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,858
Just a reminder, Allen. Clock's ticking.

46
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:23,401
It always is.

47
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:30,074
You know, you haven't made lasagna
since I left for college.

48
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,572
Well, college is a hell of a lot closer
than another Earth.

49
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,658
- Ah.
- Hey. Did you tell Henry?

50
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:43,206
No. All right, look, if he knew,
he would just try to talk me out of it,

51
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,216
and he probably would so...

52
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,090
Dad, can you give us a minute?

53
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,176
Yeah. I'll make us some coffee.

54
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,730
Look, Iris, I know that this is...

55
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,810
Nuts is the only word
I can think of right now,

56
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:07,945
but it's not like I've never done
anything dangerous before.

57
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,651
Look, I, I get why you're doing this.

58
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,492
Innocent people are in danger.

59
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,620
That's always been the direction
that you've run in.

60
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,703
Even, even when you ran
a little bit slower.

61
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:24,209
I Just... I want to make sure
that you're not doing this

62
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,794
because you think that you don't have
anything left here anymore.

63
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,549
This isn't about Patty.

64
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,756
It's not.

65
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,012
I mean, of course,
you know, I miss her. A lot.

66
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:41,725
But I know what I have here.

67
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,140
I love my life.

68
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,269
I love myjob, being the Flash.

69
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,862
I love you and Joe.

70
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,490
I'm not trying to escape.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,947
I promise.

72
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:57,829
Go win, Barry.

73
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,326
And then come home.

74
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:03,876
I will.

75
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,788
All right, Barry, listen to me.

76
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,299
You're about to go through
the looking glass.

77
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,007
You're gonna see things that look
and feel familiar, but they're not.

78
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,466
Up is down, black is white.

79
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:15,847
And do not let yourself
get sucked in emotionally.

80
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,757
And good luck.

81
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,310
Yeah. Look,
ifwe're not back in forty-eight hours,

82
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,016
that means that Zoom has us.

83
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,807
If that happens,
you have to close the breach.

84
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,269
We're not gonna do that.

85
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,858
You get yourself back here
in one piece, all right?

86
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,694
- Don't make me come and get you.
- No.

87
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,360
I wrote this for my parents and Dante.

88
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:40,701
If I don't come back,
make sure you get it to them?

89
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,206
Cisco, you're coming back.

90
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,242
Caitlin, please.

91
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,459
- Okay, I will.
- Thank you.

92
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:54,052
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah.

93
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,886
- You too, Harry.
- Thanks, Snow.

94
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,684
I hope you get your daughter back.

95
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,220
I'll make sure you get your son back.

96
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,310
You don't have to do this.

97
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:11,899
Yeah, I do.

98
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,403
Is anybody else feeling panic right now?

99
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,238
I chickened out of bungee jumping
when I was eighteen.

100
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,119
But this is categorically a lot scarier.

101
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,745
Once I turn the speed cannon on,

102
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,533
the three of you will be
able to pass through unharmed.

103
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,326
But Barry, you need to make sure
you keep your speed up.

104
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,709
Mmm-hmm.

105
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,584
- I got no spit.
- Jaws.

106
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,795
And I'm not quoting Jaws. I mean
my mouth is really dry right now.

107
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,632
Do not get distracted by
anything you see along the way.

108
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:38,838
What are we going to see?

109
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,050
Everything.

110
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,634
Do it, Jay.

111
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,194
Okay. Let's go.

112
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,290
Caitlin, look out!

113
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,127
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

114
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,459
What happened?

115
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,636
With the rest
of the breaches closed,

116
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,473
the energy surge to this last remaining
breach must have destabilized it.

117
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:24,634
What does that mean?

118
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,646
As long as it's unstable, Barry and Cisco
will be trapped over there.

119
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,163
Holy 2001.

120
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,795
I feel like
I just opened my third eye.

121
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,340
Oh, my God.

122
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,838
Come on.

123
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,098
Wow.

124
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,824
Welcome to Earth-2.

125
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,713
Toto, I've got a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

126
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,423
This is amazing.

127
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,759
Half these things are
just ideas on our earth.

128
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,391
- Come here.
- I mean...

129
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,384
Oh, yeah.

130
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:49,886
Ah!

131
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,648
- Ramon.
- What?

132
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,103
Not a sight-seeing tour.

133
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,269
Speak for yourself. We want our grandkids
to know we did cool stuff.

134
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,730
- Doctor Wells. Welcome back.
- Henry.

135
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,899
- We weren't expecting you.
- Aah!

136
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,822
Yes, I didn't tell anyone
I was coming back.

137
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,540
Well, I thought you might've left town
with all that's been happening.

138
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,622
- Right.
- Are your friends okay?

139
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,418
Yes, they're...

140
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,413
They're fine. They're excitable.

141
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:21,418
- This is...
- Henry Hewitt. Lab assistant.

142
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,675
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

143
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,009
And, you. I'm Barry. This is Cisco.

144
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,346
I'm Cisco.
And you are just a nice, normal guy.

145
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,555
Okay. Um...

146
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,142
Doctor Wells, will you and your visitors
be needing the conference room?

147
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,440
Not necessary, Henry.
Our visit will be short.

148
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,567
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, sir.

149
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,941
He's a bad guy on Earth-1.

150
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,150
He looksjust like him.

151
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:50,705
A reminder that a
city-wide curfew has been issued.

152
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,743
No unauthorized person
is to be out after 9 p.m.

153
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,707
A recent increase in Zoom attacks
has led Mayor Snart to extend the curfew.

154
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,043
The curfew was first issued

155
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,582
after a series of terror attacks
throughout the city...

156
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,092
It's worse.

157
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,221
It's worse than when I left.
Zoom's turned up his reign of terror.

158
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,927
All right. Then let's find Zoom. Fast.
Cisco, do your thing.

159
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,511
All right, Zoom.

160
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,683
You can run, but you can't hide.

161
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,480
All right. You know what?

162
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:24,942
You guys are crowding
my space a little bit.

163
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,403
I can't perform like this
under pressure. Okay?

164
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,908
If you could you just step back
just a little bit?

165
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,193
- I need to do my thing.
- All right.

166
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,907
- My mojo. Thank you.
- Yes, all right.

167
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,495
Take two.

168
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,782
Hmm. Ha.

169
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,498
All right, Zoom.

170
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,957
You can run...

171
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,298
- Ramon! What's happening?
- You know, I don't know, okay?

172
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,802
I can't see anything.
I don't know what's wrong.

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,177
Maybe I lost my powers.

174
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,679
I didn't lose my powers.

175
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:50,215
Why would you lose your powers?

176
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,383
Here we go.
The wavelength trigger's not responding.

177
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:55,019
- But that only happens if...
- The frequency is imbalanced.

178
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,604
What?

179
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,644
Our earth vibrates
at a different frequency than yours.

180
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,024
Harry, without that frequency...

181
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,561
We're up a creek.

182
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,024
The latest attack
was orchestrated by Zoom.

183
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,783
And we understand that
citizens of Central City are scared

184
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,240
but I can assure you,
the CCPD has been working diligently

185
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,153
- That's me.
- On thwarting the meta-humans

186
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,494
- Yeah, it is.
- Under the leadership of Detective West.

187
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,788
We will stop Zoom. That's a promise.

188
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,625
The leadership of Detective West.

189
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,879
So Joe's still a cop here.

190
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,416
Yeah, but more importantly,
I'm still a CSI.

191
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:26,583
I have a plan.

192
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,552
Whatjust happened?

193
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,216
Doppelgénger!

194
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,936
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
How did I get here?

195
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,769
Who are, who are you?

196
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,399
How do you look like me?

197
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,558
Allen, what are you doing?

198
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,272
Harrison Wells.

199
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,648
The Harrison Wells!

200
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,817
Oh, my God, am I in S.T.A.R. Labs?

201
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,905
Okay, I have no idea
what is going on here,

202
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,076
but I've always wanted to meet you.

203
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,745
Your thesis on string phenomenology
was revolutionary to me.

204
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,957
Oh, man.

205
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,091
I had the magazine laminated
so I could keep it. I Just wanna emulate.

206
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,292
That's incredible.

207
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:08,835
I won an award for it. Right over there.
Do you see?

208
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,423
Oh, it's beauti...

209
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,548
What did you do? What's wrong with you?

210
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,761
Have you turned into an evil you?

211
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:17,143
Relax. I Just knocked him out.

212
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,475
Oh. But why'd you even
bring him over here?

213
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:21,309
So he could become him.

214
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,022
While you guys work on the goggles,
I will go to CCPD as him,

215
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,109
see if I can figure out what information
they have on Zoom's previous sightings.

216
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,318
We can use those sightings
to triangulate Zoom's hideout.

217
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,323
Okay, that's a good plan.
Just remember what Jay said, okay?

218
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,110
Things here are all sorts of trippy.

219
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,745
Look, I'll be fine.

220
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:41,326
I can handle it.

221
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,544
Easy.

222
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,255
Whoa!

223
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,522
Whoa.

224
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,808
This is crazy.

225
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,186
Get your hands off me!

226
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,195
Captain?

227
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:15,408
Look, I don't know nothin'
so I ain't sayin' nothin'!

228
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,653
- Okay.
- Deadshot, wh...

229
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,325
That's not funny, Allen.
I hate that nickname.

230
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:26,793
Okay, look, I know I'm not, I'm not
the best shot in the department but...

231
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:31,255
Not the best? Lawton, you are
the worst shot in the entire department.

232
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,715
Hey, why don't you book Singh here
and I'll be in there in a moment.

233
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,504
- Whatever you say, partner.
- Mm.

234
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,719
Come on.

235
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,596
Oh, and, just for the record,

236
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:44,188
My marksmanship proficiency ratings
went up by two points last month.

237
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,682
All right?

238
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:47,850
Two points! Whoo!

239
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,018
Iris.

240
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,115
You're Detective West?

241
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,528
The one, the only.

242
00:12:56,234 --> 00:13:00,614
- Yeah.
- Can I see you for a second CSI Allen?

243
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,865
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

244
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:05,743
Mm.

245
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,202
What are you doing?

246
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,370
What?

247
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:12,082
I think a little office PDA between
a husband and wife is okay.

248
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,384
Husband and wife.

249
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,591
Yeah, that's what happens
when you do the vows, exchange the rings.

250
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,599
- Where is your ring?
- I...

251
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:24,312
People should know
that you're a taken man.

252
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,889
That's so weird.

253
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,058
- What's that?
- My meta-human alert app.

254
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:31,727
It thinks that you're a meta-human.

255
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,361
That is so weird.

256
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,740
Yeah. Must be on the fritz.

257
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,241
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

258
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:39,943
Home.

259
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,029
Come on.

260
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:56,344
Where do you people get off
robbing Central City's Royal Bank?

261
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,630
This town belongs to Zoom.

262
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,802
And those of us he deems worthy enough
to enforce his will.

263
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,475
Here! Take it!

264
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,434
Thanks a million.

265
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,942
Or should I say two?

266
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,291
No. Wait.

267
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,789
Please don't hurt me.

268
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:32,796
Hurt you? I Just want to give you a kiss.

269
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,389
Now, what did I tell you about
watching that behind?

270
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,019
I thought that was your job.

271
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,243
Good thing, the only man I can kiss
is the only one I want to.

272
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,075
Just got word.
Some breachers came through.

273
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,581
Ooh, you know my favorite thing
to do is kill people from other Earths.

274
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,663
Today's your lucky day.

275
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,923
Oh, my gosh.

276
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,346
This is nice.

277
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,558
Our home, I mean. I forgot, I guess.

278
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,616
What is wrong with you?
You've been acting weird all day.

279
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,030
Um,

280
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,077
I'm just not myself, I guess.

281
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,297
Your mom called.

282
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,022
Allen residence.

283
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,528
Hello?

284
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,942
Uh, hello?

285
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,280
Mom.

286
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,616
Well, you certainly took your time
calling back.

287
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,370
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

288
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,090
Thank you so much for
the anniversary tickets to Atlantis.

289
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,922
Your dad and I have always wanted to go.

290
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,679
I'm really glad you liked them.

291
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,264
Are you okay?

292
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,924
You sound kind of strange.

293
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:53,312
I'm fine. I'm...

294
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,941
Hey, lknow. Maybe Ishould give
the plane tickets to you and Iris.

295
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,772
A nice little romantic getaway.

296
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,904
You two could get started on
giving me a grandchild.

297
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:04,240
No, I want you to use them.

298
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,948
I'm really glad to hear you happy, Mom.

299
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,955
Aw. I love you, Barry.

300
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,037
I love you, too.

301
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,000
Okay. Bye-bye, honey-

302
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,010
Baby, what's wrong?

303
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,171
Um, nothing.

304
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,932
I was just, uh... I mean,
it was just good to talk to my mom.

305
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,641
We should get ready, yeah?

306
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,431
Yeah. All right.

307
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,234
Where is he? Where is he?

308
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,653
I don't know. I can't find him anywhere.

309
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,164
Yeah, well, he better show up soon
because he's been gone for hours.

310
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,372
We only have so many of those left
before Zoom needs the speed.

311
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,663
You're talking about Barry.

312
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

313
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,836
Yeah, don't worry about him.
He'll be fine.

314
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,298
Who'd you think I was talking about?

315
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,925
- I thought you were talking about me.
- You?

316
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,176
Yeah. 'Cause we found Barry's double,

317
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,587
so where the hell am I?

318
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,507
You know, I always thought,
in another life, I was, like,

319
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:15,429
I don't know, like, a really wealthy,
famous inventor.

320
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,939
You know, sort of
like the Earth-2 Elon Musk.

321
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:20,519
Only with less RBF, obviously.

322
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,184
Well, here's some advice for you.

323
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,228
How about spending
more time looking for Zoom

324
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,865
and less time worrying about what someone,
who is not you, is doing with their life.

325
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:40,203
Some things that happened
for the first time

326
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:45,548
Seem to be happening again

327
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,636
And so it seems that we have met before

328
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,516
And laughed before

329
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,604
And loved before

330
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,059
Whoa. Joe can sing.

331
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,857
- He's the best.
- Right.

332
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,065
But who knows, baby now, who knows

333
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,945
Yeah, who knows

334
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,575
Where or when

335
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,489
Whoo.

336
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,541
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

337
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,585
Mm. Oh, yeah.

338
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,623
- Joe, hey!
- Lt's Joseph, Bartholomew.

339
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,292
Pop, be nice. You too, babe.
I'll be right back.

340
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,925
Yeah.

341
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,221
So you're a singer!

342
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,806
So you're still an idiot.

343
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,480
Are you upset with me?

344
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,104
Or you just don't like me.

345
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,896
Have you lost your mind?

346
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,486
Central City is going to
hell-in-a-hand basket

347
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,867
because this lunatic, Zoom,
is running around, killing folks,

348
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,242
and you got my daughter
on the front lines.

349
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,154
Wait, wha... Me?

350
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,451
It is always been about you, Bartholomew.

351
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,496
You're the most selfish person
I've ever met, and I'm a musician.

352
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,959
We're all selfish.

353
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,796
You wanted to get your PhD
so you could further your career,

354
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,632
she had to become a police officer
to pay your tuition.

355
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:15,515
We both know that she'd be safer
going back to write at the newspaper.

356
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,266
Oh, Dad, please stop.

357
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,685
CCPN was an internship.

358
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,394
All I did was get coffee for real writers.

359
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,067
Being a cop, like Grandpa, is what I love.

360
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,523
You raised me to be tough, and I am.

361
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,403
Everything's fine.

362
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,817
I mean, we're here to have fun, right?

363
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,534
Right. Everything's great.

364
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,164
How's it going?

365
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,801
Uh, slow. Which is not a good adjective
when it comes to a speed cannon.

366
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,677
Well, we got another problem.

367
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,513
Why do we always have to have
another problem?

368
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,179
You've gotta see this!

369
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,394
Somebody call the Flash!

370
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,692
His name is Adam Fells

371
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,365
but he calls himself Geomancer.

372
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,317
So this meta-human is a breacher?

373
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,862
No. Fells died on my Earth.

374
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,826
This must be his Earth-1 doppelganger.

375
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,911
Well, at least now that we know his name.

376
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,034
Might be a little easier
to track him down.

377
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,373
Yeah, but with Barry gone,

378
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,878
how are we gonna stop him
even if we do find him?

379
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,634
Jay, if you could shoot yourself up
with that stuff, or was it Velocity...

380
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,046
- Velocity-Six?
- I cannot take V-Six.

381
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,509
But it gave you your speed back

382
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,423
long enough to get that bullet
out of Wells. Saved his life.

383
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,549
Joe, don't ask me
to take Velocity-Six again.

384
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,719
Look, Jay, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do.

385
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,387
But Barry is protecting your world,

386
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,227
and our world needs
a Flash right about now.

387
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:57,615
Jay.

388
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,785
Caitlin, I like the way
you look at me.

389
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:04,039
With warmth and pride.
And I'm not, I'm not worthy of those.

390
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,326
- Yes, you are.
- No. I did a terrible thing, Caitlin.

391
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,584
When my world's
Particle Accelerator went off,

392
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,248
I became a speedster.

393
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:14,040
I became the Fastest Man Alive.

394
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,553
Only, only it wasn't enough for me.

395
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,963
I wasn't fast enough.

396
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,761
So I figured
with my scientific background,

397
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,471
I could increase my powers.

398
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,061
I did.

399
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,482
So you've taken Velocity-Six before.

400
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,642
Yes.

401
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:37,067
But there were some
unforeseen side effects.

402
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,403
This is why
you didn't want Barry to take it.

403
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,193
Or even know about it.

404
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,997
Zoom never stole your speed.

405
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:47,031
This is what's making you sick.

406
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,911
Velocity-Six is killing you.

407
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,421
I wasn't lying when I said
that stuff was dangerous.

408
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,125
I've made so many mistakes.

409
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,430
You have something now
that you've never had before.

410
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:03,681
Me.

411
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,805
And I'm going to figure this out.

412
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:15,273
My funny valentine

413
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:21,157
Sweet comic valentine

414
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:28,708
Can we talk some more about
why Joseph doesn't like me?

415
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,415
What's there to talk about?

416
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,787
I mean, you can't stand him either.

417
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,164
- Right.
- Look...

418
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:39,544
I can love you both
even if you don't love each other.

419
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,848
My meta-human warning app.

420
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:52,935
Don't stop singing, old man.

421
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,811
That's our song.

422
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,862
So,

423
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:08,781
which one of you lounge lizards
is in the wrong universe?

424
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,458
Hmm? Show of hands.

425
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,876
Don't be shy.

426
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:17,544
Hey, no, no. Hey, no, no, don't.

427
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,333
Hey, handsome.

428
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,463
You got something you want to tell me?

429
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,846
- No.
- No?

430
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,807
Baby, no one's talking to me.

431
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,143
What if I make them scream?

432
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,057
CCPD! Everyone get out of here!

433
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,104
- All right, go, go.
- You are both under arrest!

434
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:40,903
Ladies first.

435
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,232
Caitlin.

436
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,244
I haven't heard that name in a long time.

437
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,076
But that is your name, isn't it?

438
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,742
Your real name. Please.

439
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,127
I know you. Don't do this.

440
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,540
If you knew me at all,

441
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,836
you would know
that I hate the name "Caitlin."

442
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,884
I'm Killer Frost.

443
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,550
Go, all right. Go, go!

444
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,429
Iris, look out!

445
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,276
Dad! Oh, my God.

446
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,113
Well, hello, breacher.

447
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,028
He's a speedster, babe.

448
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:31,616
Oh, I'm shivering.
I've been dying to kill the Flash.

449
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:33,664
I don't want to hurt you.

450
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,872
Trust me. You won't.

451
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,501
Kill him!

452
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,349
Come on.

453
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,557
God, this is making me so hot!

454
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,126
This ain't over, breacher.

455
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,383
Barry!

456
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,257
Oh, my God.

457
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,673
Dad. Barry.

458
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,727
- Killer Frost and Deathstorm.
- You know them?

459
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,183
More importantly, they know you now.
They know that you're here.

460
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,354
So Caitlin and Ronnie's
doppelgangers are evil?

461
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,359
Those are some dope names, though.

462
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,520
This was supposed to be
a surgical mission, Allen.

463
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:49,407
Find Zoom's lair. Rescue Jesse.
Get in, get out. Not get involved.

464
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,943
All right, well look, I am involved, okay?

465
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,034
Joe is in the hospital.
They nearly killed him.

466
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:59,123
No, he isn't. Joe West, your Joe West,
is alive and safe on your earth.

467
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,751
So is Caitlin, so is Iris.

468
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,209
These people, Barry,
they're mere reflections.

469
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,750
As far as your life is concerned,
they don't exist.

470
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,594
Killer Frost, Deathstorm,
they know that you're here,

471
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:11,425
and it's not long before Zoom does too

472
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:12,588
and then my daughter's dead.

473
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,965
And that's on you.

474
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:17,973
Jesse still has time, okay?
Iris and Joe need me now.

475
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,730
- She is not Iris!
- I have to get back to them.

476
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:22,016
She is Iris! Okay? She is to me.

477
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,435
No matter what Universe I am in,
they are my family.

478
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,401
I would think by now, you should get
how important family is.

479
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,656
I'm going, Wells. I have to.

480
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,863
Find Zoom.

481
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,756
Iran Adam Fells through BCI.

482
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:48,712
Not exactly a model citizen
before he was a meta-human.

483
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,673
Multiple counts of robbery and assault.

484
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,462
Well, if he thinks he's gonna use my city

485
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:54,882
for a steel cage death match
with the Flash,

486
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,096
he's got another thing coming.

487
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,269
Hey, what are you doing here? Wait.

488
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,726
Were we supposed to meet up or something?

489
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,766
Nah, I was just nearby.

490
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,903
Everybody Okay?

491
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,160
Fells has been spotted.
Pasko and fourth. Go.

492
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,497
I got to go, son.

493
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,615
Joe...

494
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,298
Mm.

495
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,180
Dad, are you okay?

496
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,052
Mm.

497
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,226
Damn meta-humans.

498
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,646
Only thing I hate more...

499
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,817
Is hospitals.

500
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,068
Are you okay?

501
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:58,700
Yeah.

502
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,742
I'm just worried about you.

503
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,835
There's a first.

504
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,122
Baby...

505
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,584
Yeah, yeah.

506
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:19,432
You ever notice every time,
just before I do a number,

507
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,136
I close my eyes for a hot second,
and I take a deep breath.

508
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,646
You ever wonder what I was doing?

509
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,692
Trying to remember the lyrics?

510
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,570
I say a little mantra to myself
every time before I sing.

511
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,496
"This one is for Iris."

512
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,700
"My baby girl."

513
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,044
Every song's for you, baby.

514
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,711
Every single one.

515
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,384
Dad, don't talk like this, okay?

516
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,799
Barth... Barry.

517
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,967
Yeah.

518
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,388
You take care of her.

519
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,944
Dad!

520
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,105
Dad!

521
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,273
Dad! Nurse!

522
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:19,070
Doctor! Nurse! Dad!

523
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,243
Iris.

524
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,740
No! No! No!

525
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,252
No! No!

526
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,628
It's okay.

527
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,761
Oh, damn it. Ugh.

528
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,271
You don't have to do this, Lawton.

529
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,939
We're partners, right?
You've always had my back.

530
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,769
And I've got yours.

531
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,903
Oh, Iris.

532
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:01,484
- Do I know you?
- Does she know me?

533
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,121
Uh, this is my good friend, Cisco Ramon.

534
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:07,039
- "Good friend"?
- Yeah.

535
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,785
Cisco works at S.T.A.R. Labs,

536
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,952
and he has built a weapon that he believes

537
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:15,249
we can use to neutralize, um,
Killer Frost's powers.

538
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,424
Great. Thanks. I'll take it.

539
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,962
Uh, please, I should really take this.

540
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,883
All right.

541
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,682
One of my snitches gave me a lead
on Killer Frost and Deathstorm's location.

542
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,845
We're going to bring them in.

543
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:30,980
Okay. I'm coming with you, Iris.

544
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:35,109
No, Barry. I Just lost my father.
I cannot lose my husband too.

545
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:38,313
All right. Well, Cisco is the only one
that knows how to operate the device.

546
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,605
So you have to take him.

547
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,820
I can't put a civilian in harm's way.

548
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:43,529
Look, I've seen fire and I've seen rain.

549
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:47,913
I can handle myself, okay?
Mrs. West Allen.

550
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:56,832
I love you.

551
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,840
I love you too.

552
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,637
- Lawton, let's move!
- Yeah.

553
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,765
Uh...

554
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,721
We got to work on finding Jesse.

555
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:13,140
Are you sure this is
what you want to be doing?

556
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,307
Iam, all right?

557
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:16,226
Right now, we have to help Iris.

558
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,612
Just make sure no one else gets hurt.

559
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,965
CCPD! It's over, Fells.

560
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:44,255
No offense to you boys in blue
but I'm waiting on the man in red.

561
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,548
You better hope the Flash doesn't show up,
or you're finished.

562
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,057
See, that's funny.

563
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:50,013
I don't think he will show.

564
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,478
I've been causing tremors for days
and no sign of him.

565
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:56,892
I think he's gone.

566
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:58,526
What is it they say in boxing?

567
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:02,780
Let's get ready to rumble!

568
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,701
What the...

569
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,327
I heard you were looking for the Flash.

570
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,247
Looks like the Velocity-Seven is working.

571
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,131
Now go get him!

572
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,132
- That's a new one.
- Is that all you have?

573
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,728
You don't ever want to see all I have.

574
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,314
The Velocity-Seven's wearing off!

575
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,699
You've heard what an eight
on the Richter scale can do to a city.

576
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:49,611
Imagine what it's going to do
to your skull.

577
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,752
Are you hurt?

578
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,337
Only my pride.

579
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,377
And my body.

580
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,257
Pride and my body.

581
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,320
Are you really sure this is the place?

582
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:28,065
Maybe you should stay in the car, Lawton.

583
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,237
Look alive, gents.

584
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,217
Hey, maybe, maybe your snitch was wrong.

585
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,632
I mean, maybe they're not even here.

586
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,851
No, they're here.

587
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:03,893
You didn't knock.

588
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,396
How rude.

589
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,030
Drop them.

590
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:23,204
Ronnie?

591
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,005
Is Martin Stein in there?

592
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,708
Oh, I haven't let him out in years.

593
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,378
He doesn't talk much anymore.

594
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,639
You killed my father, you evil bitch.

595
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,266
He shouldn't have pal-ed
around with a breacher.

596
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,518
That's a big no-no
as far as Zoom's concerned.

597
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,394
I can't believe you two work for Zoom.

598
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,557
No, they work for me.

599
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:45,231
Iwork for Zoom.

600
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:50,693
Who the hell are you?

601
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:56,829
Well, that's funny.

602
00:35:56,987 --> 00:36:00,161
I wasjust going to ask you
the same thing.

603
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,380
D0ppel... '... 93r1ger.

604
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,134
What the hell is going on here?

605
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:14,422
Are you two related to each other?

606
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:16,431
Oh, I knew there was another "me" here!

607
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,264
And I knew you were coming, Cisco.

608
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:19,893
Even before you entered the breach

609
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,726
and set foot on this world.

610
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:27,143
See, we're all connected, Francisco.

611
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:29,103
The name is Vibe.

612
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,773
Reverb.

613
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,909
Actually not the worst name
you could've come up with.

614
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,782
But not the best.

615
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:40,456
I've been watching you, Vibe.

616
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,039
And I have to say,
I am extremely disappointed.

617
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,211
Yeah? I know the feeling.

618
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,496
I'm not sure what's worse.

619
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,166
The fact that you're part of Zoom's gang

620
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:52,802
or that weird samurai situation you got
going on on the top of your head there.

621
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,467
Listen to this.

622
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,056
What if Zoom wasn't
running the show anymore?

623
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,599
- What do you mean?
- You don't even know how powerful you are.

624
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,485
All you use your powers for
are these cheap parlor tricks,

625
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,817
when you, you could be a God.

626
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,449
We could be Gods.

627
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,666
Are you Cloud City Vadering me right now?

628
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,494
Are you out ofyour mind?

629
00:37:27,494 --> 00:37:29,838
Let's turn them over to Zoom.

630
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,170
Speak to me like that again

631
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,257
and I will shatter your entire nervous
system without breaking a sweat.

632
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,007
So...

633
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,184
Vibe...

634
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,063
D0 you wanna run Central City?

635
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,023
What do you say?

636
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,235
I say...

637
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,693
Flash save us!

638
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,369
Hey. That didn't hurt you, did it?

639
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,199
- No. Why would it?
- I don't know.

640
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,362
And who the hell are you?

641
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,373
Look, Detective,
just get out of here, all right?

642
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,623
No. Not without them!

643
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,003
Stay here!

644
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,141
Round two.

645
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,559
Look, Mirror Mirror, I already told you.
I'm not going to the dark side with you.

646
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,565
You're a rotten shot.

647
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:43,079
I'm not.

648
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,536
Are you telling me I can do that?

649
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,579
I can show you.

650
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,505
No!

651
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,389
Stop! The both of you!

652
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,351
Zoom wanted him alive!

653
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,891
You know what Zoom will do
if you don't obey him!

654
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:15,568
No!

655
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,235
That.

656
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,822
What did I say you should do

657
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,784
if you encountered a speedster?

658
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,706
Leave him unharmed.

659
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:37,132
Does this look unharmed to you?

660
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,556
I'm happy to see

661
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:58,063
at least one of you knows their place.

662
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,862
Barry!

663
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,996
No.

664
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,786
No.

665
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,141
Sorry. Did I forget to say
this might sting?

666
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,190
It's not my first road rash.
I'm a speedster, remember?

667
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,568
You made sure
no one will forget that tonight.

668
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,226
Thanks to you.

669
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,480
Velocity-Seven held up pretty well.

670
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,193
Moving on to Velocity-Eight.

671
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,699
I'm gonna figure it out. I swear.

672
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:47,862
I just need you to figure out
how to restabilize the breach.

673
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:51,202
Barry, Cisco, and Wells
still have twenty-four hours to go.

674
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,541
So we have one day,

675
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,373
or they could be stuck there forever.

676
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,077
Jesse.Jesse.

677
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,572
Hey. I'm here with your dad.

678
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,909
We're gonna get you out of here,
all right? I promise.

679
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:41,128
It's not wise to make promises

680
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:44,760
you can't keep, Flash.

681
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,222
Look around.

682
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,891
This is the last place

683
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,014
you'll ever see.
