1
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,375
<i>Couldn't look you in the eye</i>

2
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,542
<i>You're just like an angel</i>

3
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,709
<i>Your skin makes me cry</i>

4
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,125
Come on, Drax. Dance.

5
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,750
Only idiots dance.

6
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,000
<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

7
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,667
<i>I want to have control</i>

8
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:18,333
<i>I want a perfect body</i>

9
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:51,709
Hey!

10
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,083
I told you a million times...

11
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,291
you keep your grimy raccoon hands
off my Zune.

12
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,375
I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

13
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:27,834
Again?

14
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,125
I love you, Gamora.

15
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,792
So, what are you gonna do about Quill?

16
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,750
Me? Why not you?

17
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,000
I got emotionalistical issues.
What am I gonna do?

18
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,333
Why are you on the ceiling?

19
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,375
I wanted to see if these new gravity boots
worked on a slope.

20
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,583
Here we go.

21
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,750
Sorry.

22
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,667
<i>Bozhe moi,</i> Kraglin.

23
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,458
You must know you will never learn.

24
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,166
You think you could do better?

25
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,875
Telekinesis is cheating!

26
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,000
That's a stupid little pebble!

27
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,083
I could do that with my dang finger!

28
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:03,917
You're a bad dog.

29
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,667
Do not say that to me.

30
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,375
You are. You're a bad dog.

31
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,917
Take that back.

32
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,333
Come on, that's not cool.

33
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,583
Nebula, did you hear?

34
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,709
He called me a bad dog,
and he refused to take it back.

35
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,417
I don't care, Cosmo.

36
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,500
- Is Peter okay?
- I don't know.

37
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:21,500
What are you going to do?

38
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,834
Me? He's your brother.

39
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,125
It doesn't matter,
he still doesn't listen to me.

40
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

41
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,375
She's not dead.

42
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:33,125
She just doesn't remember anything
from the past few years.

43
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,500
Nobody tells me nothing.

44
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,875
Mantis, why don't you just touch him
and, you know, make him happy?

45
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,875
I am Groot?

46
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
- Dude!
- Gross!

47
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,875
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

48
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,458
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

49
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,750
'Bout that time
you made me fall in love with my sock?

50
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,291
Well, that was funny.

51
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,834
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

52
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,125
Maybe we should draw straws.

53
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,125
No one ever meant that, Drax.

54
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:54,768
- What was that?
- What was that?

55
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:55,792
What the hell?

56
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:56,959
Oh, my God!

57
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,166
Is he okay?

58
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,291
Hey!

59
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,125
Where did you go, squirrel?

60
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,125
On the ground!

61
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,500
No, stop! Don't!

62
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,125
Stop, please! No! Stop, please!

63
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,291
Please!

64
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,000
Who is that maniac?

65
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:26,041
Some super douche with ray gun hands,
I don't frickin' know.

66
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,830
Who threw this thing at me?

67
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:06,500
Shut up.

68
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,208
Baby.

69
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,834
Pick on someone your own size.

70
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,375
Peter!

71
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,667
Peter!

72
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,208
We need Med-Paks!

73
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,750
Nebula!

74
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:14,917
Piss off.

75
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,000
Rocket.

76
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,375
That hurts.

77
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,458
What a pity.

78
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,458
No!

79
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,875
All I did was activate the Med-Paks!

80
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,625
Get them off! Now!

81
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,417
Oh, hell.

82
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,393
We need to get him to the Med-Bay!

83
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,250
It was destroyed. There's one on the ship.

84
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,250
Lill ol od for today.

85
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,166
Stitch him up and transfer him in
with the rest of Batch 89.

86
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,542
It's okay.

87
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,542
You're here with us now.

88
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,917
Hey! It's a new guy.

89
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,750
What kind of thing are you?

90
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,583
You've got, like, a mask on your face.

91
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,500
Mask, eyes, face, mouth...

92
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,291
does it words?

93
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:27,041
It's okay, friend.
Don't let them scare you.

94
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,083
Hurts.

95
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,709
It's okay.

96
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,250
You're gonna be okay.

97
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,542
A kill switch?

98
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,667
A device set to destruct
if anyone goes poking around inside him...

99
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:14,074
or even if we use the Med-Paks.

100
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,917
And why would Rocket have a kill switch?

101
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,403
Apparently, someone considers him
proprietary technology...

102
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,750
and sent that golden lunatic to get him.

103
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,417
So, he'll die if we operate on him?

104
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,417
And he'll die if we don't.

105
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,976
There has to be some way to bypass it.

106
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,680
It looks like there's a passkey
that could override the kill switch.

107
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,959
What do we know
about where Rocket came from?

108
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,125
He won't talk about it.

109
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,709
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called OrgoCorp.

110
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,917
And there's a code on all of it...

111
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,667
89P13.

112
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,750
He's got maybe 48 hours.

113
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,458
Where are you going?

114
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,105
OrgoCorp have to have records, right?

115
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,250
Maybe they'll have a way for us to
override the kill switch and save Rocket.

116
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,851
They won't just give us that information.

117
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,351
Well, that's why we're gonna break in.

118
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,291
We kill anyone who gets in our way!

119
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,041
- Not kill anyone.
- Kill a few people.

120
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,125
Kill no people.

121
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,792
Kill one guy,
one stupid guy who no one loves.

122
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,667
Now you're just making it sad.

123
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,000
Kraglin, Cosmo,
I need you to keep watch...

124
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,976
<i>over Knowhere till we're back.
Couple of days, tops.</i>

125
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,417
- Aye, Cap'n.
- Aye, comrade.

126
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,208
Take back what you said,
that I'm a bad dog.

127
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,375
Nope.

128
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,500
I know you don't really think
I am a bad dog.

129
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:20,787
Can you please take it back?

130
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:21,834
I will not.

131
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,834
I located the coordinates for OrgoCorp.

132
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,640
I think I have a contact near there.
Maybe they can help us get in.

133
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:29,792
Contact him.

134
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,458
Let's go save our friend.

135
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:14,875
No, no, no.

136
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,458
It's good to have friends.

137
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,417
Oh, my poor baby.

138
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:49,917
It hurts.

139
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:52,875
Do you have it?

140
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:53,917
He does not, sire.

141
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,875
I tried to warn you, High Evolutionary.

142
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,337
These Guardians are more powerful
than you think.

143
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,166
Or perhaps you simply overestimate
your own value, High Priestess.

144
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,875
No doubt a flaw of some type
in my own design.

145
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,834
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

146
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,875
Beautiful numbskulls.

147
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,083
But your egos have run wild. Say, "Ah."

148
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,125
And this one
was meant to be the Warlock...

149
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,792
the apogee of their people.

150
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,250
You removed Adam from his cocoon early...

151
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:25,500
my liege.

152
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,125
He's still a child.

153
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,959
No, there's something wrong with him
even outside all that.

154
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,667
Yes, there's something wrong with me!

155
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:34,041
I was stabbed, you extraordinary phallus!

156
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,768
He doesn't know any better.
We shall do whatever you require, my liege.

157
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:42,208
You knew of 89P13's existence for years
without alerting me.

158
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,291
That's not what I require!

159
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,291
I'm sorry, my liege.

160
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,458
Find 89P13 and return it to me...

161
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:57,625
or I will destroy your entire civilization,
as is my right as your maker.

162
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:59,583
Do you understand?

163
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,750
Do you understand?

164
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,250
Yes, sire.

165
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,834
Toodle-do.

166
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:17,166
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

167
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,083
It was always clever, sire.

168
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,458
- Yes, that's exactly why I want it now.
- Of course.

169
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,291
- Its brain.
- That is the only reason, sire.

170
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,625
But are you really trusting the Sovereign
to retrieve it?

171
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,333
They're merely a backup.
I believe I know where they're going.

172
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,917
It's bio-formed.

173
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,625
Instead of being built,
it's grown from living matter.

174
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:15,125
The structure is surrounded by three
impenetrable plasmic security shields.

175
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,731
It's not going to be easy
to break into this place, Star-Lord.

176
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,667
Doesn't have to be easy.
I was a professional thief, remember?

177
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,250
I'll jam the signals one at a time.

178
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,166
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

179
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,500
She's always mad...

180
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,917
at everyone.

181
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,250
It's because I was drunk.

182
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,542
She's right.

183
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,829
If I hadn't been drinking...

184
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,875
maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

185
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,291
It's okay. He's your best friend.

186
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,792
Second best friend.

187
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:48,667
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu, Gamora.

188
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:49,834
Gamora isn't dead.

189
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,041
She is to us.
You want a Zarg-Nut?

190
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,250
Thank you.

191
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,917
First shield set.

192
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:03,250
Three, two...

193
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,083
one.

194
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:12,792
- Peter.
- What?

195
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,000
You had family on Earth...

196
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,083
and you never wanted
to go back to see them?

197
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,834
No, you're my sister.
That's all the family I want or need.

198
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,500
Besides, it was really just my grandpa,
okay? He was a pretty hard guy.

199
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,500
Still. Don't you think he...

200
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,250
What?

201
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:31,959
You were abducted by Ravagers
the same day he lost his daughter.

202
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,500
Oh, yeah, he was upset.

203
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:36,184
My mom died, he screamed in my face,
he pushed me out of the room!

204
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,458
He was probably
just trying to protect you.

205
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,250
- What are you talking about?
- What?

206
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,810
I'm talking about the people in my life
who died, and you're talking about this?

207
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:43,667
Second shield set.

208
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,375
<i>Three, two...</i>

209
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,583
<i>one.</i>

210
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,625
I'm only saying...

211
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,125
you've never even gone
to see if he's okay.

212
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,667
He could still be alive.

213
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,500
My grandpa, he'd be, like,
90-something years old.

214
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,083
So he could still be alive.

215
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,041
People on Earth die when they're, like, 50.

216
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,792
They die when they're 50?

217
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,542
I don't know. Something like that.

218
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,333
What's even the point of being born?

219
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Exactly!

220
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,250
Are you about to die?

221
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,208
I'm not 50!

222
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,417
The point is...

223
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,750
I wasn't talking about any of this.

224
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,709
Third shield set.

225
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,709
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

226
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,375
Well, not everything
is about what you are talking about.

227
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,875
And I'm only saying...

228
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:35,625
you are upset because so many of the people
you cared about have left you...

229
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,792
but you also left someone.

230
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,125
And maybe I wanted a Zarg-Nut!

231
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,208
It's too late. They're all gone.

232
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,375
Why didn't we go through?

233
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:02,458
We did. It's not the shield.

234
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,041
Oh, hell.

235
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,500
Ravagers.

236
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,375
<i>Hey, guys...</i>

237
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,917
<i>you're about to be boarded
by the United Ravagers.</i>

238
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,917
<i>You can surrender and turn over
any stuff worth anything and live...</i>

239
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,625
<i>or you can die.</i>

240
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:23,041
<i>Totes up to you.</i>

241
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,709
Drax, no, no, no, Drax!

242
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:43,000
Guys, it's me, Peter Quill,
I'm one of you, remember?

243
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,166
Hold on!

244
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,208
We have an appointment!

245
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,125
We have an appointment.

246
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,041
With who?

247
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,166
- With Gamora.
- With Gamora.

248
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,166
What?

249
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,667
You're early.

250
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,166
What are these?

251
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,667
OrgoCorp uniforms.

252
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,959
You're gonna have to wear these
to move through the Orgo...

253
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,250
without attracting attention.

254
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,667
This isn't my color.

255
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,333
What did you say?

256
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,208
It clashes with my eyes.

257
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:30,959
Put it on!

258
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:36,250
Nebula, why would you not tell me
that you've been in contact with Gamora?

259
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:37,976
Because I didn't want
you to get freaked out.

260
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Freaked out how?

261
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,291
Like that.

262
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:41,792
Let me in there.

263
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,760
I don't wanna be trapped out here,
I can't...

264
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,083
Gamora, we are grateful for your help.

265
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,709
Oh, I'm not doing this
out of the kindness of my heart.

266
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,583
I'm doing this for the hundred thousand
units my sister promised.

267
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,208
So, you're a Ravager now?

268
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:56,709
Put on the uniform.

269
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,542
Never pictured you as the Ravager type.

270
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,083
Who are you again?

271
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:02,709
Oh, man.

272
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:06,000
OrgoCorp is in possession
of some of the most advanced...

273
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,959
cybergenetic IP in the galaxy...

274
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:14,083
<i>so they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.</i>

275
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,625
<i>Now, I know you don't have
documentation to dock...</i>

276
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:20,083
so you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

277
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:24,875
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records...

278
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,250
where maybe you can find the passkey...

279
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,709
to override the kill switch...

280
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,875
and help you save the hedgehog.

281
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:34,208
But if you get into trouble...

282
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,750
we will not be able to bail you out.

283
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,959
Yes.

284
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,125
Yes, of course. Brilliant.

285
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,750
His functioning has skyrocketed.

286
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,041
That's correct, P13.

287
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,542
Very good.

288
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,166
That's the new world.

289
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,709
Counter-Earth.

290
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,709
Where the experiments will go
once they're ready.

291
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,166
It blue.

292
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,333
That's the sky.

293
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,834
Sky.

294
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,041
Rocket.

295
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,709
Yes, it is.

296
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,208
What sounds?

297
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,291
That's music.

298
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,583
We like it?

299
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,083
We do.

300
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:45,208
This recording is over 5,000 years old.

301
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:50,000
"Mo Ergastee Förn, Mo Ergalone Förn Nort."

302
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:52,208
Which, translated, is...

303
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:55,834
"Be not as you are, but as you should be."

304
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,000
It's our sacred mission...

305
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:01,000
to take the cacophony
of sounds around us...

306
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:04,250
and turn it into a song.

307
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,542
To take an imperfect clump...

308
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:11,500
of biological matter such as you...

309
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,583
and transform it into something...

310
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,250
perfect.

311
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,709
And we're halfway there, aren't we?

312
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,542
Come with me, P13.

313
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,709
I'd like to show you something.

314
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,000
<i>We have but a single quest...</i>

315
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,834
to create the perfect species...

316
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and the perfect society.

317
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,667
You, P13...

318
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:46,083
are part of Batch 89.

319
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,625
But here with Batch 90...

320
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:52,125
I've developed a process
by which I can guide...

321
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,750
any organism through millions of years...

322
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:57,500
of programmed evolutionary changes...

323
00:28:58,542 --> 00:28:59,542
in a moment.

324
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,250
See, now, there's the rub.

325
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:36,709
For some reason...

326
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,041
these specimens are also over-producing...

327
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,917
loligo beta-microseminoprotein
in their systems...

328
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,667
causing them to be, well...

329
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:48,000
Violent. We don't like it.

330
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:51,917
A utopia can't have its denizens
murdering one another, can it?

331
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,250
It can'ts.

332
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,166
Can't.

333
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,458
Can't.

334
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:57,834
Theel.

335
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,875
They're programmed to be peaceful.
Like you.

336
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,417
But for some reason, it's not catching.

337
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,125
Hyptonic filters.

338
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,291
What?

339
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:16,375
They's suppressaliting
the glycosylated saltses.

340
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:20,917
And then boop-boop-boop,
halfcystine residual be formin'...

341
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,583
and then, they make...

342
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,083
What do you say?

343
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,291
Loligo beta-microseminoproteins.

344
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:28,917
Yeah, thems.

345
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,750
And then, angry turtleses.

346
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:23,417
<i>There. That's the decompression chamber.</i>

347
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,166
<i>Lock in.</i>

348
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,417
<i>Go.</i>

349
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,458
<i>Activate gravity boots and gloves.</i>

350
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:18,250
<i>Nebula, go.</i>

351
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,709
<i>So, you really don't remember anything?</i>

352
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:56,875
<i>Like what?</i>

353
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:58,792
<i>'Bout your time with us.</i>

354
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:00,917
<i>No.</i>

355
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:02,208
<i>We were...</i>

356
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,250
<i>We weren't anything.</i>

357
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:05,417
<i>You and me...</i>

358
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:09,291
<i>That person was
some alternate future version of me.</i>

359
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,667
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

360
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,458
<i>We loved each other.</i>

361
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:17,917
<i>I don't think so.</i>

362
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,440
<i>I know you don't remember any of it.</i>

363
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,041
<i>You were everything to me.</i>

364
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,291
<i>And I miss you...</i>

365
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:33,125
<i>so much.</i>

366
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,542
<i>And, maybe...</i>

367
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,000
<i>maybe, if you open yourself up to it...</i>

368
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:41,875
<i>there's a possibility...</i>

369
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:43,625
<i>I don't think so, Quinn.</i>

370
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,750
<i>Quill.</i>

371
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,000
<i>Quill.</i>

372
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,125
<i>I don't think so.</i>

373
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:51,476
<i>Well, what I'm trying to say...</i>

374
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,667
<i>Peter, you know
this is an open line, right?</i>

375
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:54,875
<i>What?</i>

376
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,643
<i>We're listening
to everything you're saying.</i>

377
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,583
<i>And it is painful.</i>

378
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,990
<i>And you're just telling me now?</i>

379
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,641
<i>We were hoping it would stop on its own.</i>

380
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:02,768
<i>But I switched it over to private!</i>

381
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,083
<i>What color button did you push?</i>

382
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,291
<i>Blue, for the blue suit!</i>

383
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,458
<i>Oh, no!</i>

384
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:08,166
<i>Blue is the open line for everyone.</i>

385
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,000
<i>- Orange is for blue.
- What?</i>

386
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,250
<i>Black is for orange...</i>

387
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:15,166
<i>yellow is for green, green is for red,
and red is for yellow.</i>

388
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,709
<i>No. Yellow is for yellow...</i>

389
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,500
<i>green is for red, red is for green.</i>

390
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,250
<i>- I don't think so.
- Try it then.</i>

391
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
<i>Hello!</i>

392
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,125
<i>You were right.</i>

393
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,131
<i>How the hell am I supposed to
know all of that?</i>

394
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,250
<i>Seems intuitive.</i>

395
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
<i>Can we get back to saving our friend?</i>

396
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,458
<i>Get that jammer ready to change the shield.</i>

397
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:10,834
<i>Guys?</i>

398
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,959
I mean, you wanna talk about a sweet ride?
The acceleration will crush your spine.

399
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:17,643
It's got that brand-new fusalix core.
You know what I'm talking about?

400
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:18,709
Yeah.

401
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,275
Really? 'Cause I just made that up.

402
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,818
I thought you said somethin' else.

403
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,792
Master Karja.

404
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,458
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

405
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,166
Master Karja, there appears to be
a physical breach...

406
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,453
<i>in the white wing somewhere.</i>

407
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,125
- Could it be a glitch?
<i>- Maybe.</i>

408
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,917
I'm accessing the eye.

409
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,583
I'll see if I can locate it.

410
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:18,333
There's some sort of anomaly
in the decompression chamber.

411
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,166
<i>- Best you check it out, Master.</i>
- On it.

412
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:22,709
Hurry.

413
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:35,667
Where do we put these?

414
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,208
Here! Hide them in this locker
until we leave.

415
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,458
Hurry!

416
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,875
What the hell was that, guys?

417
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:10,625
What, are you kidding me?

418
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:11,959
What?

419
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,291
A neutro-quark just hit the satellite.

420
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,393
It's burning a hole through the wall.
You geniuses...

421
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:21,208
you just throw the door open without
any proper precautionary procedure?

422
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,792
What procedure, bro?

423
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:26,291
You want us to read the manual
for you too, bro?

424
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,500
You could have killed everyone in the wing!

425
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,917
Exactly! You idiots!

426
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,458
I'm angry too!

427
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,625
Oh, no.

428
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,834
I mean, can't you see...

429
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,041
these authentic mechanic uniforms
that we're wearing on our bodies?

430
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:40,817
That blend in with some of our skin-tones
better than others?

431
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,417
Excuse my friend.

432
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,667
He is the boss' nephew. He's a little...

433
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:53,166
Yeah. I got one of those too.

434
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:56,000
I mean, this one? This one I love.

435
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,208
I'm so proud.

436
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,834
You're doing great. So proud of you.

437
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:00,750
But this one, I just...

438
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,208
- Everything he does drives me crazy.
- Yeah.

439
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,667
- I thought you said something else.
- Shut up.

440
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,685
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

441
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,083
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.
I am.

442
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,625
How'd you guys get here so fast?

443
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,518
I'll be honest with you,
we just happened in...

444
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,875
before it burned
all the way through, thankfully.

445
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,417
Good thing you were here.

446
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:26,458
All right, guys, wrap it up.

447
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:28,667
Looks like we're all clear here.

448
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:34,667
Our spacesuits!

449
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:40,333
You threw them in the contamination bin.

450
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,083
It expels stuff into space
the moment you shut the door.

451
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,917
That would have been helpful information
three minutes ago.

452
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,041
Damn it, Mantis, why don't you ever think?

453
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:50,250
Are we pretending to be angry again?

454
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:51,542
Mantis, you asshole!

455
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:54,208
Guys, just focus for two seconds.

456
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,726
We'll find another way out of here.

457
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,792
Right now, we need to save Rocket's life.

458
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:03,417
Nebula, Quinn, and I will get to
the records and get the passkey.

459
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:06,083
Bug and Doofus, access the spaceport
through the elevator...

460
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,500
so Tree can land and get us out of here.

461
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,083
Apologies.

462
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,250
No problem.

463
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,458
Go.

464
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:29,041
Not my fault I don't know something...

465
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,625
if no one ever tells me.

466
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,250
I didn't even wanna come here.

467
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,875
I'm gonna need to see your...

468
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,083
You're hopelessly in love...

469
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,750
with him.

470
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,291
Oh, no.

471
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,083
Hey.

472
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,250
Hey.

473
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:44,667
How you doin' today?

474
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm all right.

475
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,417
What was your name again?

476
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,166
Drax the Destroyer.

477
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,542
That is such a lovely name.

478
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,125
I'll get the door for you.

479
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:03,834
- I'll be here when you come back out, okay?
- Sure.

480
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,500
Every single time.

481
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,291
My name is Bletelsnort.

482
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,917
<i>Welcome to OrgoCorp headquarters.</i>

483
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,750
<i>For over 300 years...</i>

484
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,542
<i>OrgoCorp has been producing
cybernetic implants...</i>

485
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,166
<i>and genetic upgrades across the universe...</i>

486
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:24,750
<i>under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.</i>

487
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,083
That warning we got today,
don't those two match the description?

488
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,625
Attention, all Orgosentries...

489
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,125
That manager should have access
to the records.

490
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:39,834
If the passkey is here,
she can get it for us.

491
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:42,250
All right. I'll handle this one.

492
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:43,458
How?

493
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,834
Pure Star-Lord charm.

494
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,166
I'm excited for you that you get to
see this again for the first time.

495
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:57,875
Hi, Yura.

496
00:40:58,417 --> 00:40:59,458
Ura.

497
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
- Ura.
- Hi.

498
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,208
Hi, my name's Patrick Swayze.

499
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,875
I've been noticing you for quite a while...

500
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,792
and the way that you smile to yourself...

501
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,834
when you think nobody is looking...

502
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,959
it makes my every day a bit brighter.

503
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,000
We need your hand.
And it's your choice...

504
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,500
whether it's on your body or not.

505
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,867
- What are you doing?
- She was never gonna fall for that.

506
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:20,935
Dude, she was totally into me, man!

507
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:23,166
- I kind of thought you were a douchebag.
- Come on.

508
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,625
- We need a file.
- What file?

509
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:26,917
89P13. Could that be something?

510
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,208
- No.
- Then your use to us...

511
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,083
- is over.
- Wait, wait, wait!

512
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,458
It sounds like a species tag.

513
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:34,792
Show us!

514
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:42,625
<i>All of our research supports the
High Evolutionary's altruistic objective...</i>

515
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,458
<i>of creating a utopian society.</i>

516
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:47,208
That must be the spaceport.

517
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,125
What is all this?

518
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:59,667
Species patented over the years
using OrgoCorp tech.

519
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:04,041
Every species OrgoCorp has created
has its own individual file.

520
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:05,709
I'm so sorry about this.

521
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,835
Listen to me,
this is not the kind of thing we do.

522
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,041
Please, stop it with the subtle jabs!

523
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:13,168
Old you would have never done this.
You had a purpose higher than yourself.

524
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:14,393
- A calling to help people.
- Give me a break.

525
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:16,142
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

526
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,208
Except, I didn't form the Guardians.

527
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:19,917
And I barely left Thanos.

528
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,667
Whoever it was that you
were in love with...

529
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:24,917
it wasn't me.

530
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:26,917
It sounds more like her.

531
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:28,083
- Her?
- What?

532
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,959
- That's ridiculous! Don't even...
- Do not bring me into this.

533
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,458
- Knock it off!
- What?

534
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:40,166
Don't look at me like a lost puppy
needing a soft place...

535
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,773
- to lie down.
- I didn't say anything!

536
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:47,750
I just never noticed
how black your eyes were.

537
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:52,834
They were replaced by my father...

538
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:54,959
as a method of torture.

539
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:57,625
He picked a pretty set.

540
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,417
There.

541
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:05,083
That's the file for 89P13.

542
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,083
Heads up, heads up!

543
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,625
Okay.

544
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:16,709
What?

545
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,917
Oh, no.

546
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:35,375
Walk!

547
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:38,917
Move it, move it!

548
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:46,917
Stand down!

549
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,125
Drax, we should make a run for it.

550
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:50,291
Or we could fight.

551
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:51,458
- Run.
- Fight.

552
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:53,000
- Run!
- Fight!

553
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,166
Take 'em!

554
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:00,583
What are we gonna do?

555
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,417
- I got a plan.
- What is it?

556
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:04,663
All of you, come with me...

557
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,875
Everybody, lower your weapons...

558
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:09,542
or I blow this woman's brains out!

559
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:10,834
That's the plan?

560
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:13,917
- You're a kitty cat.
- Meow.

561
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,041
You feel like dancing.

562
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,542
Violent rage.

563
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,834
Lower your weapons!

564
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,917
Let's kill that one that looks like
a carrot to show we mean business.

565
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,542
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

566
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,667
She was always like that,
and yet, I was the bad guy.

567
00:44:41,834 --> 00:44:43,583
We are not killing anyone!

568
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,750
Back off!

569
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,875
Groot, bring the <i>Bowie</i> to us.

570
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,041
Now.

571
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,500
I'm so sorry about this, Ura.

572
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:03,750
Oh, please.

573
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:07,333
We're here to save the life of our friend,
that is all.

574
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:11,083
We paid her to help us get in and get out.

575
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,976
You'd think that'd mean,
"Oh, I'm gonna help you do it in a way...

576
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,309
"that no one knows it's happening."

577
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,667
But no, what she means is,
"I'm gonna shoot people.

578
00:45:16,834 --> 00:45:18,458
- "Threaten people's lives."
- Shut up!

579
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,041
And I know you're probably asking,
why would I trust her?

580
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:24,041
Well, that's a good question.

581
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,500
The answer is, we used to be in love.

582
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,583
Yeah. She was my girlfriend...

583
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,790
only she doesn't remember it,
because it wasn't her.

584
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:33,851
Because her dad threw her off a magic cliff
and she died...

585
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:36,750
and then I lost my temper
and nearly destroyed half the universe.

586
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:40,083
Then she came back, out of the past.
And there she is.

587
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,184
Everyone else who died in the past
stayed dead, not her.

588
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,375
Why? Was it the magic cliff? I don't know.

589
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,917
I'm not some
fricking Infinity Stone scientist.

590
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:51,458
Just some dumbass Earth dude
who met a girl, fell in love...

591
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,458
that girl died...

592
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,125
and then came back a total dick.

593
00:45:58,709 --> 00:46:01,208
He left out some important information...

594
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,542
but that is the gist of it.

595
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:11,542
Get to the security hub!

596
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:12,709
Okay!

597
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,250
Everybody, down on the floor,
or we blow your brains out!

598
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:26,083
Hey, hey, hey, we don't want any...

599
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:28,834
No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No!

600
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,667
Come on! Would you please stop doing that?

601
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:58,291
Yeah!

602
00:46:58,458 --> 00:46:59,583
Hey!

603
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:15,834
Run.

604
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,583
Drax!

605
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:54,041
Get on the ground and
show me your hands now.

606
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:04,583
Ura?

607
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,458
Please listen to me.

608
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:08,834
We need to get out of here with this...

609
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,291
to save my best friend's life.

610
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,267
If you could get us into
the system of those sentries out there...

611
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,000
they are good people, like you.

612
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:16,333
I'm certain of it.

613
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,540
And if I just had an opportunity
to speak to them...

614
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:21,387
They're corporate shills, you idiot.
They're not gonna listen to you.

615
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:23,502
They will listen
if I speak to them from my heart.

616
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:25,375
Ura.

617
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:27,417
Please.

618
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,333
Hey!

619
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,750
Come out now!

620
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:45,083
Damn it!

621
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,500
You are in.

622
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:55,875
Tell them your truth.

623
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,458
Yeah, I'm not that big of an idiot.

624
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,105
I just needed to get into the system.

625
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:01,959
Move it.

626
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,834
Told you she was into me.

627
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,208
I am Groot?

628
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,333
Yeah, that looked cool.

629
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:51,875
Is sky?

630
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:53,291
No.

631
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,041
That's not sky, that's a ceiling.

632
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:01,041
But sire's making a new world
for all of us...

633
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,208
and when we get there...

634
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,166
there will be sky...

635
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:09,041
and it will be beautiful and forever.

636
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:10,458
Wow.

637
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:12,417
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

638
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:15,917
I have been thinking.

639
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:17,709
'Bout what?

640
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,166
Nothing in particular.

641
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:24,208
But I thought,
since you guys are my closest friends...

642
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:26,125
and my only friends...

643
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:30,709
you might be interested in knowing
that I have been thinking.

644
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:32,333
That's cool.

645
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:34,834
I've been thinking, too...

646
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,542
about something more singular.

647
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:40,792
When sire moves us to the new world...

648
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,834
we're gonna need names.

649
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:44,709
I mean...

650
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,750
89Q12...

651
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:48,333
it's not really a name...

652
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:53,834
so I would like my name to be...

653
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,166
Lylla.

654
00:50:56,917 --> 00:50:58,083
Lylla.

655
00:50:58,583 --> 00:50:59,709
Lylla.

656
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,417
Lylla.

657
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:03,625
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

658
00:51:04,959 --> 00:51:06,083
Thank you.

659
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:10,542
I think my name shall be Teefs...

660
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:13,834
because, although we all do have them...

661
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:16,667
mine are definitely the most prominent.

662
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,000
- Teefs.
- Teefs.

663
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:21,959
- Lylla.
- Teefs.

664
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:27,333
Me be called Floor,
because me is lying on floor.

665
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,542
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

666
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:33,333
Yes!

667
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:36,625
- Floor.
- Floor.

668
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:38,333
What about you, friend?

669
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:45,125
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly...

670
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:49,000
and me and my friends
are gonna go flyin' together...

671
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:52,333
into the forever and beautiful sky.

672
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,500
Lylla, and Teefs...

673
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:58,750
and Floor, and me...

674
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,417
Rocket.

675
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:05,250
Rocket.

676
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,750
It really is good to have friends.

677
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:10,750
Yeah.

678
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:17,625
<i>Start the incision here.</i>

679
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:21,750
<i>Keep calm.</i>

680
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:26,625
<i>- Hold it still.
- I can't!</i>

681
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:29,375
<i>It won't stop moving.</i>

682
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,792
Why did he never tell us about any of this?

683
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,667
This is worse than what Thanos did to me.

684
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,667
Well, what about the passkey? Is it there?

685
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,291
No. But a file was removed today.

686
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,917
Downloaded and deleted,
a million characters in length.

687
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:53,542
The biometrics say it was this man.
Recorder B2H6.

688
00:52:53,709 --> 00:52:55,309
I saw this guy outside of records today.

689
00:52:57,792 --> 00:52:59,917
Looks like one of
the High Evolutionary's recorders.

690
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:01,917
The High Evolutionary?

691
00:53:02,959 --> 00:53:04,208
The founder of OrgoCorp?

692
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:06,295
OrgoCorp is just a way
to fund his experiments...

693
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,166
that lie outside intergalactic laws.

694
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:10,375
He's created whole societies.

695
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,917
Xeronians, the Ani-Men...

696
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,375
- the Sovereign.
- The Sovereign?

697
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:16,583
Corners of the universe consider him God.

698
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,500
I am Groot.

699
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:20,667
Yes.

700
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:21,917
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

701
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:25,458
He said maybe this man downloaded the
passkey into the computer on his head.

702
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,125
That could store the passkey.

703
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,041
We find him, we save Rocket.

704
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,750
The High Evolutionary's coordinates.

705
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:36,657
Put the coordinates in the nav.

706
00:53:36,709 --> 00:53:37,709
Wait a minute.

707
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:39,917
Are you kidding me?

708
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:43,291
What he wants
is that gutted badger in the Med-Bay...

709
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,250
and you're gonna bring it straight to him?

710
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:47,077
It's almost certainly a trap.

711
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:50,726
Trap isn't a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you. It's a face-off.

712
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,083
A face-off is a trap
if you're facing off...

713
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,083
against a guy a thousand times
more powerful than you.

714
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:59,083
Do you know who the High Evolutionary is?

715
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,417
Yeah, he's some dickhead
who dissected my best friend.

716
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:04,458
- Second best.
- The High Evolutionary...

717
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:06,545
isn't someone you wanna
think about messing with.

718
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:08,500
We won't think about it when we do it.

719
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:10,625
You know what? I don't care!

720
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:11,976
Just drop me off with the Ravagers...

721
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,959
and you go do
whatever it is that you wanna do.

722
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,245
We don't have time for this.

723
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,917
I'm not asking you.
Drop me off with my people now!

724
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:20,917
"Your people"?
The Ravagers aren't your people.

725
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,917
I'm a damn Ravager. You aren't.

726
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:27,000
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family. Okay?

727
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:28,667
But my Gamora, the one I loved...

728
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,267
she didn't find it
with a group of criminals...

729
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,417
she found it with us.

730
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,792
People who care about you.

731
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:36,208
I know that's who you still are.

732
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:38,709
Somewhere inside of you...

733
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:46,375
What are you so afraid of in your self
that I need to be something for you?

734
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,542
I don't give a shit about your Gamora.

735
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:51,083
Life made me me!

736
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:56,709
I have a few upgrades courtesy of
that gutted badger in the Med-Bay...

737
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,583
and we are not risking his life
to make yours more convenient.

738
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,875
I'm family.

739
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,542
So is he.

740
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,250
Screw you.

741
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:12,542
Screw all of you.

742
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,667
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield...

743
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:28,917
pirating supply ships.

744
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,041
I do appreciate this, good sir.

745
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:35,250
And I appreciate your generous contribution
to the Orgosentry retirement fund.

746
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:36,667
Your associate...

747
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,875
a Zehoberei named Gamora,
where is she now?

748
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,401
You ain't getting nothing from me.

749
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:45,083
Oh, we'll see about that,
won't we?

750
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,083
Adam.

751
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:49,500
Adam.

752
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:50,667
Yes, Mother?

753
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:52,125
Show him we mean business.

754
00:56:13,959 --> 00:56:17,208
I said show him we mean business,
not disintegrate him!

755
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:18,935
What more business could we have shown him?

756
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,417
But now he's of no use to us!

757
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:21,768
Well, let's just question
the man's friend.

758
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,417
Friend? You think that's a friend?

759
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:24,750
It's an animal!

760
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,500
He looks sad.

761
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,573
I really don't enjoy
how that's making me feel, actually.

762
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,125
Your friend's a moron.

763
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:38,333
I got one of those too. I get it.

764
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40,166
<i>Outpost?</i>

765
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:41,542
<i>This is Gamora, you there?</i>

766
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:45,291
<i>Fitz-Gibbonok.</i>

767
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:46,458
Come in.

768
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:53,291
<i>Outpost, come in.</i>

769
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:55,917
Yes, Gamora.

770
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:57,917
Salutations.

771
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,417
<i>May I help?</i>

772
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,098
Well, I need you guys to come pick me up.

773
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:04,834
<i>I'm gonna upload the location-link
to the craft I'm on.</i>

774
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:07,417
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

775
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,250
You need to say to him
exactly what I told you to say.

776
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:09,081
Why don't you just say it?

777
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:11,500
No one ever listens to me.

778
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:27,792
Quill...

779
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:29,875
life is a pond...

780
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:34,125
and you've spent your entire life
leaping from woman to woman...

781
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:36,500
as if they're lily pads
upon this great pond.

782
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,500
Perhaps, what you need to do, Quill...

783
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,500
is learn to swim.

784
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,333
That actually made sense.

785
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,500
Yes, it made sense.

786
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,834
No, I mean, that's sort of an analogy.

787
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:54,792
And I didn't know that you were capable
of that type of thought.

788
00:58:54,959 --> 00:58:56,500
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

789
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:59,166
Analogies, metaphors, et cetera.

790
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:01,417
For instance...

791
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:06,250
Gamora's head is like a lily pad
because it is green.

792
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:08,917
Analogy.

793
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:11,000
And also stupid-looking...

794
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:12,417
- and flappy.
- Flappy?

795
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:15,041
Because her skin is made of a leaf.

796
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,500
Metaphor.

797
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:17,959
Is it?

798
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:21,291
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

799
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:25,250
Even my butt is capable
of making an analogy.

800
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:36,375
What's happening?

801
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,792
The fluid is in his lungs.

802
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:41,458
P13?

803
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,208
P13.

804
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:47,083
Sire.

805
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:49,417
P13!

806
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:52,063
- My lord, might I suggest that we...
- Where is it? I passed it.

807
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:53,667
Must...

808
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:59,417
Sire was in the middle of his treatments
when we had a breakthrough with Batch 92.

809
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:01,375
Perhaps then we should
resume tomorrow, yes?

810
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:03,458
"We shall resume tomorrow," no!

811
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:04,875
P13!

812
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:09,166
There you are.

813
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:20,208
Hello.

814
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,333
How did you know...

815
01:00:32,917 --> 01:00:36,458
about the microseminoproteins, P13?

816
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:02,166
What happened in there?

817
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:04,083
Why?

818
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:07,375
How did you know, P13?

819
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:09,458
It was too little filtration...

820
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,166
In the hypotonic, yes, we know,
we fixed that.

821
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,959
But how did you know?

822
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:17,000
I made you!

823
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:19,333
How did you know?

824
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,625
Because it worked.

825
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:33,041
It worked.

826
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,875
Their rage is gone.

827
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:41,500
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought...

828
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:44,250
ready to inhabit the new world.

829
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,834
We're going to the new world?

830
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,458
We?

831
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,250
Look at you.

832
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,709
As if you were...

833
01:01:57,875 --> 01:02:00,500
cobbled together by fat-fingered children.

834
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:03,583
How could you be part of a perfect species?

835
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:07,750
You're simply a medley of mistakes
we could learn from...

836
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:10,583
and apply to the creatures
that truly mattered.

837
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,125
Batch 89 was never meant
for the new world, P13.

838
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:18,792
You could figure out...

839
01:02:18,959 --> 01:02:22,667
the complex workings
of cytoplasmic filtration systems...

840
01:02:22,834 --> 01:02:24,709
but you couldn't figure out that?

841
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:30,291
But that brain.

842
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:33,667
That, I'd like to study further.

843
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:41,500
Prep it for surgery and removal
in the morning.

844
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:44,458
What about the rest of Batch 89, sire?

845
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,625
Incinerate them.

846
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,083
He's dying.
We need that passkey.

847
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,250
We don't have long.

848
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,041
<i>We've arrived.</i>

849
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,709
That looks just like...

850
01:03:22,959 --> 01:03:23,959
home.

851
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:38,375
It's like a replica of Earth.

852
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:39,750
It makes no sense.

853
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:42,959
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity's Xandar minus one.

854
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:36,625
Hello.

855
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:39,208
We mean you no harm.

856
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:52,818
Listen to me, he was just trying
to throw her back her ball.

857
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:56,417
Hey!

858
01:04:57,875 --> 01:04:59,500
Come on! There's no reason...

859
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:02,291
Hey, hey.

860
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:04,208
Groot, full Kaiju!

861
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,792
- Not full Kaiju!
- I am...

862
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,166
- Groot!
- Back up.

863
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:09,709
No, not Kaiju!

864
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:11,041
Groot, down!

865
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:12,792
There's no reason to be afraid.

866
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:16,792
Get down, Groot!

867
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,875
Everybody, it's okay.
It's okay.

868
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,083
Hey. Hey, hi.

869
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,917
We're not here to harm you.

870
01:05:22,834 --> 01:05:23,834
Okay.

871
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:25,792
See? Here.

872
01:05:26,917 --> 01:05:28,166
For your knee.

873
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:32,166
We just need to save our friend.

874
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:39,208
Filthy. It doesn't belong here.

875
01:05:40,834 --> 01:05:43,041
I will train it in the
ways of the Sovereign.

876
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,405
I will train him not to do that.

877
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,792
It's an act of blasphemy
even having it here.

878
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,250
Kill it. Now.

879
01:05:52,959 --> 01:05:56,792
I am the Warlock, Mum,
and I am done with being ordered around.

880
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,375
Gamora is here.

881
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:03,250
Which means the squirrel is also.

882
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,685
To save ourselves, we must bring
it to the High Evolutionary...

883
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:07,458
before his own people do.

884
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:33,000
Yeah, yeah, sit.

885
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:34,834
Let's sit. Okay.

886
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,709
I am Groot.

887
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,667
It's not rude. It's what it's here for.

888
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:49,166
Drax, sit up!

889
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,333
Idiot.

890
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:53,542
Thank you.

891
01:06:57,959 --> 01:06:59,041
Thank you.

892
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,542
Our friend...

893
01:07:03,834 --> 01:07:05,041
He's dying.

894
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:14,291
We love our friend.

895
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:17,208
But he is dying.

896
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:22,417
That's not dying, that's already dead.

897
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:23,959
They'll think he's already dead.

898
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,041
They'll think we're here
on a quest for revenge.

899
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,875
Drax, sit up.

900
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:29,081
That's what it's here for!

901
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:30,291
Drax, it isn't.

902
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,142
It's made for people
to sit shoulder to shoulder...

903
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:34,226
right next to each other.
Get your boots off her pillows.

904
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,709
I find it hard to believe
it doesn't have multiple purposes!

905
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:38,166
I'm sorry. My friend...

906
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:39,583
is a dumbass.

907
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,291
That's the same as your dying.

908
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,125
Why do you criticize everything?

909
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:45,542
Well, why is it oblong then?

910
01:07:45,709 --> 01:07:47,029
It was a totally different sound.

911
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:50,083
No, it wasn't. Dying. Dumbass. See?
It's the same.

912
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,291
All right, guys!

913
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,917
Can I proceed, please,
to try to save our friend?

914
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,458
Drax, I see you!

915
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:01,208
I understand that none of this
makes any sense to you right now.

916
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:03,875
We need your help...

917
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,709
in finding a man.

918
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:08,917
I'm gonna draw.

919
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,250
I'm gonna draw the man
that we're looking for.

920
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:14,667
Like this.

921
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,875
You see the thing on her head?

922
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:20,417
- He has a thing like this.
- That is delightful.

923
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:22,041
There you go.

924
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:25,291
Have you seen this man?

925
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,458
That's very good.

926
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,745
Can I have that later
to hang in my apartment, please?

927
01:08:30,834 --> 01:08:32,625
Yeah.
Thank you.

928
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:36,000
His name is <i>"Mowtio"?</i>

929
01:08:54,834 --> 01:08:57,083
Many <i>mowtios.</i> There?

930
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,417
At the pyramid.

931
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,792
Is that your car in the driveway?

932
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:12,750
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

933
01:09:12,917 --> 01:09:14,184
Watch him. That's who they're coming for.

934
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:15,458
- I wanna come.
- No.

935
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:17,500
Mantis, watch Drax.

936
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,834
Groot, you know what to do with these.

937
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,291
- Push down on it.
- What?

938
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:31,500
- Push it down.
- I am pushing down on it.

939
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,667
Push the button.

940
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:35,872
- It looks like you're pushing the keyhole.
- The what?

941
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:39,000
There's a button under the handle,
press that in.

942
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:41,917
Okay. Now what?

943
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:43,542
Open the fucking door.

944
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:47,667
That is a stupid design...

945
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:50,625
and your instructions were very unclear.

946
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:53,500
Let's get that passkey and save our friend.

947
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:01,726
I was eight years old
when I left Earth, okay?

948
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,017
Why would I know any more about
driving one of these things than you do?

949
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:05,101
Don't see you volunteering.

950
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:06,165
- You want me to drive?
- No.

951
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:07,810
- I'll drive.
- I don't want you to drive.

952
01:10:07,834 --> 01:10:08,834
I got this.

953
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:56,291
You must be a really loyal pet...

954
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:59,750
if they're willing to do all this for you.

955
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:10,834
This is the perfect society?

956
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,500
Sire.

957
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:34,792
This one has been running for two hours...

958
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:36,500
without breaking a sweat.

959
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,227
- It's incredible...
- They can survive...

960
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:39,542
on thirty calories a day...

961
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:42,542
an hour's sleep a week,
they're always happy...

962
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:44,709
and they can rewire a carbenetrix core...

963
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,792
in under two minutes.

964
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:49,875
But will she be ready for the new colony?

965
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,500
Sire, they're here.

966
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,250
Here we go.

967
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:09,291
We're here to see...

968
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:11,959
The High Evolutionary is expecting you.

969
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:13,208
Which means it is a trap.

970
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:14,417
It's a face-off.

971
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:16,834
- She stays here.
- Why?

972
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,083
Policy against weaponry...

973
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,667
and your arm is a gun.

974
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,458
- He's clean.
- Let's go.

975
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:28,083
Hey.

976
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:30,667
It'll be okay.

977
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:52,875
Move it!

978
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,542
Are you okay, Rocket?

979
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:33,125
Me Rocket play now?

980
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:34,291
I can't right now, Floor.

981
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
What are you doing?

982
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:44,792
They ain't gonna set us free.

983
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:46,834
Yes, they are, Rocket.

984
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,917
We're going to the new world any day now.

985
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,792
No, that can't be true.

986
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:54,959
It is.

987
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,458
They wanna kill us all in the morning.

988
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:58,458
What?

989
01:14:58,625 --> 01:14:59,834
What?

990
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,375
But I'm gonna fix it.

991
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:08,333
What is that?

992
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,917
It's a key.

993
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:12,792
I'm gonna use it to get us all out of here.

994
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:15,875
I don't know if that's wise, Rocket.

995
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:18,125
Me Rocket leave!

996
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:20,667
Hooray time forever!

997
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:24,333
Just down that hall, there are ships.

998
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:27,709
I know. And if we can get to one...

999
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:29,083
I can pilot it.

1000
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:32,792
And then we'll all fly away together,
the four of us...

1001
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:35,208
just like we always said, okay?

1002
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,041
Okay?

1003
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:47,125
Yippee! Rocket! Sky, sky, sky!

1004
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,750
- You did it!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1005
01:16:11,917 --> 01:16:12,917
You did it!

1006
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:15,166
You did it, you did it, you did it!

1007
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:37,083
You did it!

1008
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:39,375
You did it.

1009
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:42,542
It really is good to have...

1010
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:02,750
Yes, I imagined you'd
do something like this.

1011
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:05,500
Back in the cage, P13.

1012
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:13,000
Sky.

1013
01:17:26,959 --> 01:17:30,458
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1014
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:34,125
- Q12 and P13 escaped from their pens.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1015
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:36,375
- Q12 is neutralized...
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1016
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:38,643
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
- but P13 is still out...

1017
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:41,417
- so I'll need assistance.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1018
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:43,709
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1019
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:45,959
Remember not to bruise its brain.

1020
01:17:53,291 --> 01:17:55,208
All right, P13!

1021
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:58,333
You win the crying contest.
Now, back in the cage.

1022
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:02,578
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1023
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:04,267
- Rocket, let's go!
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1024
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,351
- Let's go! Rocket, please!
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1025
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:07,375
Rocket!

1026
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,000
Rocket!

1027
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:12,709
Down here. Hurry.

1028
01:19:10,834 --> 01:19:11,914
- Hey, there it is!
- Get him!

1029
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,125
- Get back here!
- Get it!

1030
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:00,625
What are you doing?

1031
01:20:00,792 --> 01:20:02,083
I got a bad feeling about this.

1032
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,083
Peter just told you to stay here.

1033
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,393
Yeah, well, that's his fault.

1034
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:08,583
He should know by now that I never
do anything that anyone ever tells me.

1035
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,542
We need to protect Rocket.

1036
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,125
Yeah, that's right.

1037
01:20:12,917 --> 01:20:15,417
So, hop on and we'll ride back to the ship.

1038
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,250
Just right over there?

1039
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:18,875
Yeah.

1040
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:32,375
Drax! Hey! Stop being a jerk!

1041
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:42,542
You!

1042
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,333
Hey, yeah, you!

1043
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,208
I take it the passkey,
it's in that thing on your head.

1044
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:50,834
I would advise against aggression.

1045
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:53,542
Got time for me now?

1046
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:57,208
Your friend once took advantage.

1047
01:20:57,792 --> 01:20:59,125
I learn my lessons.

1048
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:03,208
I aim some small part
of my mental capacity...

1049
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:05,083
back in my own direction...

1050
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:08,333
and now, gravity itself serves my whims.

1051
01:21:09,834 --> 01:21:10,834
War Pig.

1052
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,125
<i>Now.</i>

1053
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,750
You must find Counter-Earth familiar.

1054
01:21:17,917 --> 01:21:18,917
Counter-Earth?

1055
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:21,125
I visited your planet many years ago.

1056
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:23,011
Earth hasn't been my planet in a long time.

1057
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,250
Your people had...

1058
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:26,208
wonderful spirit.

1059
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:31,208
The art and music and literature
were some of the finest in the universe.

1060
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:36,583
Earth would be a fabulous place,
were it not for the ignorance and bigotry.

1061
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,750
- Okay.
- It inspired me to create Counter-Earth.

1062
01:21:38,917 --> 01:21:40,417
I don't care.

1063
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,083
All of the good and none of the bad.

1064
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:45,208
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob...

1065
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:46,625
whose mother didn't love him...

1066
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:49,250
rationalizing why he needs
to conquer the universe.

1067
01:21:49,417 --> 01:21:52,208
I'm not trying to conquer the universe...

1068
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:53,959
I'm perfecting it.

1069
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,500
What the...

1070
01:22:20,834 --> 01:22:21,834
Hey!

1071
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:23,792
Drop the badger.

1072
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:32,000
- I just want the passkey.
- Then bring me 89P13.

1073
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:33,417
I am Groot.

1074
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:35,834
He says, "Suck my..."

1075
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,208
Why are you so angry?

1076
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:39,208
Because I know what you did to our friend.

1077
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:43,041
Anything I've done, I've done for
the betterment of the universe.

1078
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,583
Newsflash, Einstein.

1079
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:47,790
Better universes generally don't include
a bunch of octopuses selling meth...

1080
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,625
to guys with cockroach heads.

1081
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
They do not.

1082
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,500
Which is why...

1083
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:57,834
as I have done many times before...

1084
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:00,125
I'm going to have to raze it all...

1085
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:01,959
and start again.

1086
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:03,166
What?

1087
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,583
I got 89P13...

1088
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,125
<i>and I'm on my way.</i>

1089
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:16,691
We're in possession of the subject.

1090
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,625
Oh, my God.

1091
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,333
I am Groot?

1092
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,583
Kill 'em all.

1093
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:01,709
Stay.

1094
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:05,166
I said "stay."

1095
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:09,297
What, did you want me to leave you back,
so that Mother could fillet you?

1096
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:11,333
Stay.

1097
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,500
What the hell?

1098
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:15,375
- We're working for the same boss.
- Yes...

1099
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,200
but I need the credit, chum...

1100
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:19,166
to save my entire civilization.

1101
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:23,208
So be a good creepy thing...

1102
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:24,375
and back off.

1103
01:24:33,834 --> 01:24:34,875
No.

1104
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:16,583
Mother.

1105
01:25:40,917 --> 01:25:42,709
Mother!

1106
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,917
Mantis and Drax, come in.

1107
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:51,083
Mantis?
Drax?

1108
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:52,792
<i>Hey.</i>

1109
01:25:52,959 --> 01:25:55,166
I need you to bring the ship here now!

1110
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:59,625
<i>Well, we can't do that exactly
because we're not at the ship.</i>

1111
01:25:59,792 --> 01:26:00,875
Then where the hell are...

1112
01:26:29,709 --> 01:26:30,709
Nebula, come in.

1113
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:34,709
Gamora! Take off now!
Get yourself and Rocket off the planet.

1114
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:41,583
What kinda ship is this?

1115
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:46,542
It's amusing, really.

1116
01:26:46,709 --> 01:26:48,083
How stupid are you, hmm?

1117
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:50,000
It was so obviously a trap.

1118
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:53,041
It's not a trap. It's a face-off.

1119
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,291
Now kill them all.

1120
01:26:56,709 --> 01:26:57,909
What do you have in your hand?

1121
01:27:01,917 --> 01:27:02,917
Grenade!

1122
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:44,417
I am Groot!

1123
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,542
No! Don't!

1124
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:20,959
Don't! No, no, no! No, please!
Please, spare me!

1125
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,917
Please, spare me, please.

1126
01:28:26,875 --> 01:28:29,375
Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

1127
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:30,750
That'd be premature.

1128
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:33,333
No, no, no...

1129
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:48,709
Quite a novel escape plan,
jumping headfirst into an exploding planet.

1130
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,500
You'll kill us both!

1131
01:28:55,667 --> 01:28:57,041
Not both.

1132
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:14,166
Why are we doing this?

1133
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:16,750
Quill and Groot are inside.
We have to get them out.

1134
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:46,667
Groot.

1135
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,500
Whoever's in the cockpit,
activate the brake.

1136
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:07,417
The steering mechanism is stuck.

1137
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:09,083
Well, pull harder!

1138
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:16,125
Let's go. Come on.

1139
01:30:36,709 --> 01:30:38,041
It's hard to breathe.

1140
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:47,875
We're entering space.

1141
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,625
Oh, piss off.

1142
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:27,458
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1143
01:31:27,959 --> 01:31:28,999
Where are Mantis and Drax?

1144
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:30,125
I don't know!

1145
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:35,583
- Gimme.
- Here.

1146
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:39,119
You're lucky I was able to...

1147
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:41,476
- knock down that door...
- Rocket and Gamora are probably dead...

1148
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,500
because of you!

1149
01:31:42,667 --> 01:31:44,500
- I didn't know.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1150
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,467
When are you gonna
stop using the excuse of...

1151
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,166
being some big dumb clown
for contributing nothing...

1152
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:51,500
and the rest of us having to
carry your slack!

1153
01:31:51,667 --> 01:31:52,875
Don't push him!

1154
01:31:53,041 --> 01:31:54,309
You don't have the right to push him.

1155
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:56,041
And you! You're no better.

1156
01:31:56,208 --> 01:31:57,917
The only thing we can count on you for...

1157
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:01,000
is when someone shows weakness,
you'll be right there to support it.

1158
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:02,458
Fine, I don't care.

1159
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:06,333
I know you need to find fault in
everyone else to make yourself feel okay...

1160
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,959
- so find it in me.
- Oh, go to hell, Mant!

1161
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:10,917
But you don't have the right to push him!

1162
01:32:11,417 --> 01:32:13,291
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1163
01:32:13,667 --> 01:32:14,500
He's a liability.

1164
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:18,709
He makes us laugh and he loves us.
How is that a liability?

1165
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,917
All you care about is
intelligence and competence.

1166
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:25,041
Not sure I appreciate this defense.

1167
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:26,542
He has sadness...

1168
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:29,458
but he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1169
01:32:29,959 --> 01:32:31,834
So I don't care if he's stupid.

1170
01:32:32,792 --> 01:32:34,083
You think I'm stupid?

1171
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:36,458
Yes.

1172
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:41,041
Forget.

1173
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:47,417
You're lucky I was able to knock down
that door with my incredible strength.

1174
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:49,667
Quill?

1175
01:32:49,834 --> 01:32:51,709
Quill? Quill, are you there?

1176
01:32:55,834 --> 01:32:58,208
That language isn't in my translator.

1177
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,041
Okay. Here we go.

1178
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:33,875
Okay. All right, Rocket.

1179
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:35,709
Go.

1180
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:54,458
Lylla?

1181
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:58,375
Friend.

1182
01:34:01,417 --> 01:34:02,959
Okay, okay.

1183
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,125
Okay, here we go.

1184
01:34:07,959 --> 01:34:08,959
This isn't right.

1185
01:34:09,834 --> 01:34:12,208
Yeah, no, no, no, it's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1186
01:34:12,375 --> 01:34:13,583
It needs to be faster.

1187
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:18,875
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1188
01:34:21,083 --> 01:34:22,083
Rocket.

1189
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:23,542
I let you down.

1190
01:34:24,417 --> 01:34:28,083
I got you killed.
I got everybody killed.

1191
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:29,959
We were right.

1192
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:34,250
The sky is beautiful, and it is forever.

1193
01:34:34,834 --> 01:34:37,667
And I've been flying with our friends.

1194
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:52,333
Can I come?

1195
01:34:52,875 --> 01:34:54,083
Yes.

1196
01:35:03,667 --> 01:35:04,667
No, no, no!

1197
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:06,166
No!

1198
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,333
Come on.

1199
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:09,625
- Come on!
- Quill.

1200
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:13,959
No!

1201
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,417
No!

1202
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:19,667
- Quill.
- No!

1203
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:21,959
- Quill.
- I'm not gonna lose him.

1204
01:35:22,125 --> 01:35:23,125
He's gone.

1205
01:35:23,291 --> 01:35:26,000
I'm not letting him go!

1206
01:35:28,417 --> 01:35:29,417
Come on.

1207
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,500
But not yet.

1208
01:35:44,625 --> 01:35:46,500
You still have a purpose here.

1209
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:48,959
A purpose for what?

1210
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:50,959
They made us for nothing.

1211
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:53,709
Stupid experiments to be thrown away.

1212
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:56,834
There are the hands that made us...

1213
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
and then there are the hands
that guide the hands.

1214
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:09,333
My beloved raccoon.

1215
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:13,875
This story has been yours all along,
you just didn't know it.

1216
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,041
I'm not a raccoon.

1217
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:28,166
The passkey's going through!

1218
01:36:45,792 --> 01:36:46,792
Quill?

1219
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:07,542
Where's Nebula?

1220
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,041
She's...

1221
01:37:15,959 --> 01:37:18,250
Because her code is on the comm behind you.

1222
01:37:23,709 --> 01:37:24,959
What?
Nebula?

1223
01:37:25,125 --> 01:37:27,000
- Where are you?
- Thank God!

1224
01:37:27,166 --> 01:37:28,518
We're here to get you out of here.

1225
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,226
- Out of where?
<i>- The High Evolutionary's ship.</i>

1226
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,709
No, I got off the ship.

1227
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:33,125
- You what?
<i>- Wait, where are you?</i>

1228
01:37:33,291 --> 01:37:34,291
On the ship!

1229
01:37:34,458 --> 01:37:35,792
- On the ship?
<i>- I didn't lie.</i>

1230
01:37:35,959 --> 01:37:37,208
Why are you on the ship?

1231
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:38,583
To save you, obviously.

1232
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:39,790
<i>No, I told you to go back.</i>

1233
01:37:39,917 --> 01:37:43,417
You gotta know by now I always figure out an
incredibly clever way to get out of a fix.

1234
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:44,667
Tell him I said hi.

1235
01:37:44,834 --> 01:37:47,000
- Really?
- Tell him we're coming to save him.

1236
01:37:47,166 --> 01:37:48,875
Pay attention or play with the kids.

1237
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:50,125
<i>One or the other.</i>

1238
01:37:50,291 --> 01:37:51,333
"Play with the kids"?

1239
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,667
How did you get out?

1240
01:37:52,834 --> 01:37:53,935
That's not really important.

1241
01:37:53,959 --> 01:37:55,250
I am Groot.

1242
01:37:55,417 --> 01:37:57,792
Jumping a thousand feet to your death
without a parachute...

1243
01:37:57,959 --> 01:37:58,959
is a clever way...

1244
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,625
<i>of getting out of a fix?</i>

1245
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,200
You're all just makin' up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1246
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:04,542
The important thing is...

1247
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:06,125
<i>we're all okay.</i>

1248
01:38:09,375 --> 01:38:10,375
Rocket?

1249
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:12,875
Yeah, he's here.

1250
01:38:13,041 --> 01:38:14,166
And he's okay.

1251
01:38:20,417 --> 01:38:24,500
Rocket, we love you very much,
and we're happy you're alive.

1252
01:38:25,125 --> 01:38:26,625
Well, that makes you the idiots then.

1253
01:38:26,792 --> 01:38:27,917
<i>He's right about that.</i>

1254
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:31,458
Back in your cages!

1255
01:38:35,834 --> 01:38:36,834
Nebula?

1256
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:39,500
Nebula, come in!

1257
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:47,917
So, you'd like to joust, would you?

1258
01:38:49,917 --> 01:38:50,917
Go to hell...

1259
01:38:51,083 --> 01:38:52,417
you sick son of a bitch.

1260
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:54,041
<i>You killed all of those people.</i>

1261
01:38:54,208 --> 01:38:56,041
As I will your friends.

1262
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:58,667
<i>I'm sending you the coordinates.</i>

1263
01:38:58,834 --> 01:39:01,333
They will die unless you bring me...

1264
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,500
<i>what is mine!</i>

1265
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:06,583
Screw you,
you stretch-faced, RoboCop-looking...

1266
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,125
Skeletor wannabe...

1267
01:39:08,291 --> 01:39:10,291
purple-nurple piece of...

1268
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:14,542
He hung up.

1269
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:18,458
You think?

1270
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:23,333
1966.

1271
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:26,083
The Soviet put me on a rocket...

1272
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:29,208
knowing full well I'm never to return
and I will die...

1273
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:31,166
in a fiery ball of death.

1274
01:39:31,667 --> 01:39:34,375
But one thing even <i>mudak</i>
Soviets never do...

1275
01:39:34,542 --> 01:39:36,667
is call me bad dog.

1276
01:39:36,834 --> 01:39:39,166
Oh, my God! Could you just let it go?

1277
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:43,333
Kraglin, please, just take it back.
This is killing us.

1278
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,291
I can't take it back if she is, in fact...

1279
01:39:46,792 --> 01:39:47,792
a bad dog.

1280
01:39:48,834 --> 01:39:51,333
- Kraglin!
- It never stops hurting.

1281
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:52,959
<i>Kraglin.</i>

1282
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:54,709
Oh, hey, Pete.

1283
01:39:54,875 --> 01:39:58,500
We need to save Nebula, Mantis, and Drax,
and we need your help.

1284
01:39:58,667 --> 01:39:59,834
Me?

1285
01:40:03,291 --> 01:40:05,083
You're the one who lost it, you twit.

1286
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,291
The Hellspawn had it, sire, but...

1287
01:40:07,458 --> 01:40:08,458
But, but, but!

1288
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:09,834
But!

1289
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:13,500
That rancid word.

1290
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:19,166
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser...

1291
01:40:19,333 --> 01:40:22,333
to go directly to the new colony
and not engage in unnecessary conflict.

1292
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:26,250
They can rewire a carbenetrix core
in under two minutes...

1293
01:40:26,417 --> 01:40:27,667
but what is that, Vim?

1294
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,500
Rote memorization.

1295
01:40:29,667 --> 01:40:31,417
Rote memorization!

1296
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:34,208
In hundreds of years of our creations...

1297
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:37,458
only one has known true invention.

1298
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:38,625
One.

1299
01:40:40,417 --> 01:40:45,375
Putrid in every other way,
but 89P13 had that.

1300
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,291
Yes, sire.

1301
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:54,500
A populace unable to think
what hasn't yet been thought...

1302
01:40:54,667 --> 01:40:56,208
will die on the vine.

1303
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:59,667
We need 89P13's brain...

1304
01:40:59,834 --> 01:41:03,208
so we can transfer that trait
into these creatures...

1305
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:05,291
before we go to the new colony.

1306
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:07,500
Nothing else matters.

1307
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:29,083
How did they get down here?

1308
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,250
Peter will be trying to
get to the spaceport.

1309
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,375
He doesn't know about the children.

1310
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:37,917
You!

1311
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:41,625
We need you to let all the other children
on board know...

1312
01:41:41,792 --> 01:41:43,417
to stay away from the starboard walls.

1313
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:47,476
They know three frickin' words...

1314
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:48,917
and two of them are <i>"joob."</i>

1315
01:41:50,166 --> 01:41:52,125
No! Listen to me!

1316
01:41:52,834 --> 01:41:55,125
You need to talk to the other children...

1317
01:41:55,291 --> 01:41:57,917
all of them here, and tell them...

1318
01:41:58,083 --> 01:42:00,041
to stay away from the freaking...

1319
01:42:00,208 --> 01:42:01,709
What the hell are you doing, Mantis?

1320
01:42:01,875 --> 01:42:04,458
Explaining it, dickhead!

1321
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:16,875
You're scaring them.

1322
01:42:22,917 --> 01:42:24,291
Hello, dumb idiots.

1323
01:42:28,834 --> 01:42:30,166
I had a little girl like you.

1324
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:32,583
You know what she used to like?

1325
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
She liked when I made monkey noises.

1326
01:42:45,667 --> 01:42:47,041
How is that a monkey?

1327
01:42:48,125 --> 01:42:49,250
Beats me.

1328
01:43:24,834 --> 01:43:25,834
Yeah.

1329
01:43:27,083 --> 01:43:28,166
Yeah.

1330
01:43:30,834 --> 01:43:33,184
They're gonna tell the other kids
to stay away from the starboard wall.

1331
01:43:33,208 --> 01:43:36,083
Why didn't you tell us
you knew their language this whole time?

1332
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:37,917
Why didn't you ask?

1333
01:43:40,375 --> 01:43:43,917
This could be futile, Quill.
He's too powerful.

1334
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:45,792
Well, then I guess we'll die trying.

1335
01:43:45,959 --> 01:43:48,458
What is "dying trying" gonna accomplish?

1336
01:43:48,625 --> 01:43:50,083
Or we can just give him the badger?

1337
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:52,792
Our thing is dying trying.

1338
01:43:52,959 --> 01:43:53,959
I am Groot.

1339
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:55,709
I know who you are already!

1340
01:43:56,291 --> 01:43:58,500
Feel free to stay behind in the cargo area.

1341
01:43:58,667 --> 01:44:01,542
I'm not leaving my
sister with that jackass.

1342
01:44:01,709 --> 01:44:02,917
This you?

1343
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:04,625
Fell out of your bag.

1344
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:07,959
Let's do this.

1345
01:44:44,917 --> 01:44:46,250
Wait.

1346
01:44:47,959 --> 01:44:48,959
Wait.

1347
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:52,542
<i>Reading some old letters
You smile...</i>

1348
01:44:55,208 --> 01:44:57,417
You almost have to admire their pluck.

1349
01:44:58,542 --> 01:44:59,542
Sire.

1350
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,583
Howdy there, you freakin' creep.

1351
01:45:17,125 --> 01:45:18,875
- Back up!
- Yes, sire.

1352
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:22,667
You're on, Steemie.

1353
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:24,625
First barrel.

1354
01:45:26,583 --> 01:45:27,792
Second barrel.

1355
01:45:28,917 --> 01:45:30,208
Third barrel.

1356
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:31,542
Fourth barrel.

1357
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:41,667
Hard starboard.

1358
01:45:41,834 --> 01:45:42,834
Hard starboard.

1359
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,625
And fire!

1360
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:00,281
They've breached the spaceport.

1361
01:46:00,417 --> 01:46:02,875
One of them holds subject 89P13.

1362
01:46:03,041 --> 01:46:04,583
Release the Hellspawn.
All of them.

1363
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:07,542
Sire, the Hellspawn were created
solely to defend the new colony...

1364
01:46:07,709 --> 01:46:09,125
Do it now!

1365
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:10,792
Get me 89P13...

1366
01:46:10,959 --> 01:46:14,208
and kill everyone
in the head of that dead god.

1367
01:46:52,458 --> 01:46:54,083
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n...

1368
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:55,834
<i>but that old missile's all we had.</i>

1369
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,458
Rocket, Groot, go, go!
Get inside that spaceport.

1370
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:14,458
What the hell?

1371
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:30,917
Aw, come on!

1372
01:48:00,542 --> 01:48:02,834
Kraglin, we have been infiltrated.

1373
01:48:05,208 --> 01:48:06,458
Open the pit.

1374
01:48:06,625 --> 01:48:09,250
Sire, our bargaining power will be gone.

1375
01:48:34,458 --> 01:48:35,458
Abilisks!

1376
01:48:43,208 --> 01:48:44,417
Good God!

1377
01:48:50,959 --> 01:48:52,041
This way!

1378
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,959
One more step and this weird thing gets it!

1379
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:01,125
Don't be rash.

1380
01:50:19,917 --> 01:50:21,375
What were you programming?

1381
01:50:21,542 --> 01:50:22,792
A self-destruction code.

1382
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:42,041
What are you doing?

1383
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:46,333
It's okay.

1384
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,667
Mantis, stop!

1385
01:50:50,041 --> 01:50:51,166
They eat batteries...

1386
01:50:51,333 --> 01:50:52,583
not people.

1387
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:57,542
Maybe they're just scared
of what we are gonna do to them.

1388
01:51:04,417 --> 01:51:06,083
We're not gonna hurt you.

1389
01:51:09,208 --> 01:51:11,208
Everything is going to be okay.

1390
01:52:06,834 --> 01:52:08,166
Use your heart, boy.

1391
01:52:59,542 --> 01:53:00,583
A dog!

1392
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:01,959
Yeah.

1393
01:53:10,333 --> 01:53:12,375
She's a good dog.

1394
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:18,875
I knew you believe I am good dog.

1395
01:53:19,041 --> 01:53:20,875
All right, all right,
get off me, you idiot!

1396
01:53:24,792 --> 01:53:27,500
Sire, we must retreat.
The ship is going down.

1397
01:53:27,667 --> 01:53:29,250
The spaceport has intruders.

1398
01:53:29,542 --> 01:53:32,208
Go! See if one of them is 89P13.

1399
01:53:32,375 --> 01:53:34,575
Sire, you have an irrational obsession
with this animal.

1400
01:53:34,625 --> 01:53:35,917
You must stop, for God's sake!

1401
01:53:36,083 --> 01:53:37,792
There is no God!

1402
01:53:37,959 --> 01:53:40,125
That's why I stepped in!

1403
01:54:08,709 --> 01:54:13,041
Controller, I am taking
command of the A<i>rête.</i>

1404
01:54:13,208 --> 01:54:17,625
Disengage all damaged
sectors of the ship...

1405
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,875
and retreat.

1406
01:54:45,125 --> 01:54:46,125
Attention...

1407
01:54:46,291 --> 01:54:47,625
<i>all personnel.</i>

1408
01:54:48,917 --> 01:54:51,959
<i>Intruders have boarded the ship.</i>

1409
01:54:52,583 --> 01:54:55,083
<i>Head to the starboard spaceport.</i>

1410
01:54:57,542 --> 01:54:59,959
<i>Get me 89P13...</i>

1411
01:55:01,166 --> 01:55:02,625
and kill the rest.

1412
01:55:12,083 --> 01:55:13,583
We go in there, we get Mantis...

1413
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:15,125
Nebula, and Drax.

1414
01:55:15,291 --> 01:55:18,208
We move in, we get 'em, and we get out.

1415
01:55:37,709 --> 01:55:39,083
Did that look cool?

1416
01:55:39,792 --> 01:55:43,500
Okay, new game plan.
We get the hell out of here now.

1417
01:55:43,667 --> 01:55:45,226
There are thousands of
creatures on the ship.

1418
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:46,625
Many of them are children.

1419
01:55:46,792 --> 01:55:48,112
And we need to be good <i>joob joob.</i>

1420
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:50,959
It means friends.

1421
01:55:51,875 --> 01:55:54,291
If we wanna live, we have to leave now.

1422
01:55:54,834 --> 01:55:57,166
This whole rig is gonna go down any second.

1423
01:55:57,333 --> 01:55:59,709
They will all die if we don't help them.

1424
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,792
I'm done runnin'.

1425
01:59:11,917 --> 01:59:13,375
There's a big hole up in the deck.

1426
01:59:13,542 --> 01:59:16,542
If we can connect that to Knowhere,
we can lead the survivors to safety.

1427
01:59:16,709 --> 01:59:20,667
Nebs and me will pilot the ship.
You guys save all the higher life forms.

1428
01:59:31,208 --> 01:59:32,208
Hello, moron.

1429
01:59:35,333 --> 01:59:36,333
Come on!

1430
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:39,709
Follow me, come on! Come on!

1431
01:59:41,208 --> 01:59:42,208
Come on!

1432
01:59:43,166 --> 01:59:44,709
Go, go, go!

1433
01:59:46,458 --> 01:59:47,583
I am Groot!

1434
02:00:05,542 --> 02:00:07,000
This way to...

1435
02:00:07,792 --> 02:00:09,208
Thank you.

1436
02:00:09,375 --> 02:00:11,500
Yes, you're welcome. I was screaming at...

1437
02:00:11,667 --> 02:00:13,125
something scary behind you, not you.

1438
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:15,625
You look really cool.

1439
02:00:20,542 --> 02:00:22,902
Kill me if you want,
but then good luck gettin' out of here.

1440
02:00:27,041 --> 02:00:28,184
- Wait!
- Let him go, Flecktick...

1441
02:00:28,208 --> 02:00:29,208
it's our only chance.

1442
02:00:29,291 --> 02:00:30,601
I got a space big enough to get through.

1443
02:00:30,625 --> 02:00:33,458
I gotta find out if I can change it
to a permeable shield.

1444
02:00:39,834 --> 02:00:41,208
I can't fly this frickin' thing...

1445
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:43,125
the flight controls are all screwed.

1446
02:00:43,291 --> 02:00:44,417
I'll do it.

1447
02:00:44,583 --> 02:00:46,667
Go help the others.
Wait, give me your comm.

1448
02:00:55,041 --> 02:00:57,709
<i>Kraglin, I'll pilot from this side.</i>

1449
02:00:58,625 --> 02:00:59,625
Kragula...

1450
02:00:59,792 --> 02:01:01,750
<i>back in action!</i>

1451
02:01:27,875 --> 02:01:29,291
Come on, come on, come on!

1452
02:01:29,458 --> 02:01:30,458
Go, go!

1453
02:01:30,625 --> 02:01:32,041
Go, go, go!

1454
02:01:33,458 --> 02:01:34,458
Wait, wait, wait!

1455
02:01:34,625 --> 02:01:35,750
Stop, stop!

1456
02:01:35,917 --> 02:01:37,542
Are those kids?

1457
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:55,750
Okay, Cosmo, stitch it up!

1458
02:01:55,917 --> 02:01:58,208
<i>It needs to be airtight
for the kids to make it across.</i>

1459
02:01:58,375 --> 02:02:00,083
Locking up, <i>Kapitan.</i>

1460
02:02:09,041 --> 02:02:10,667
Go, now, go!

1461
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:17,125
One by one, one by one!

1462
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:18,583
Okay.

1463
02:02:24,625 --> 02:02:26,959
Locking in and headed down.

1464
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:35,000
This way. This way.

1465
02:02:38,709 --> 02:02:39,709
Why?

1466
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:44,083
Why are you doing this?
I tried to kill you.

1467
02:02:44,959 --> 02:02:47,125
I am Groot.

1468
02:02:47,959 --> 02:02:49,041
He says...

1469
02:02:49,208 --> 02:02:51,250
"everyone deserves a second chance."

1470
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:04,625
You are so strong.

1471
02:03:09,333 --> 02:03:11,458
Why are you so slow? Hurry!

1472
02:03:12,625 --> 02:03:13,875
Where's Rocket?

1473
02:05:43,458 --> 02:05:44,458
You!

1474
02:05:46,041 --> 02:05:48,000
You thought you could escape me!

1475
02:05:48,834 --> 02:05:49,834
No!

1476
02:05:52,125 --> 02:05:55,875
You think you have some worth
in and of yourself, without me?

1477
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:57,041
No!

1478
02:05:58,875 --> 02:06:00,417
You are an abomination!

1479
02:06:00,583 --> 02:06:03,750
Nothing more than a step on my path...

1480
02:06:03,917 --> 02:06:06,208
you freakish little monster!

1481
02:06:06,375 --> 02:06:08,458
How dare you think you are more...

1482
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:13,083
89P13?

1483
02:06:16,542 --> 02:06:17,750
The name's Rocket.

1484
02:06:18,667 --> 02:06:21,041
Rocket Raccoon.

1485
02:07:01,208 --> 02:07:02,333
His face came off!

1486
02:07:02,834 --> 02:07:03,834
It's a mask.

1487
02:07:04,625 --> 02:07:05,667
Look...

1488
02:07:05,834 --> 02:07:08,125
what you did to me.

1489
02:07:08,959 --> 02:07:10,375
For what?

1490
02:07:10,542 --> 02:07:12,625
All I wanted to do...

1491
02:07:13,083 --> 02:07:14,750
was to make things...

1492
02:07:15,417 --> 02:07:16,500
perfect.

1493
02:07:17,375 --> 02:07:19,500
You didn't wanna make things perfect.

1494
02:07:19,667 --> 02:07:22,041
You just hated things the way they are.

1495
02:07:22,458 --> 02:07:23,542
Kill him.

1496
02:07:30,208 --> 02:07:31,208
Why?

1497
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,959
Because I'm a freaking
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1498
02:07:36,166 --> 02:07:38,500
We have to get outta here now.

1499
02:07:38,667 --> 02:07:39,667
We have to save them.

1500
02:07:39,792 --> 02:07:41,059
We've got all the kids on board.

1501
02:07:41,083 --> 02:07:42,083
No, Pete.

1502
02:07:42,750 --> 02:07:44,375
The rest of them.

1503
02:07:50,208 --> 02:07:52,333
Come on! Come on. Whoa!

1504
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:53,834
Move!

1505
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,458
Move it, bird!

1506
02:07:55,875 --> 02:07:57,250
- Whoa!
- Come on!

1507
02:08:00,834 --> 02:08:01,834
Come on!

1508
02:08:02,458 --> 02:08:03,498
Come on, come on, come on!

1509
02:08:06,917 --> 02:08:09,267
Thought we were limiting ourselves
to the higher life forms?

1510
02:08:09,291 --> 02:08:11,208
Yeah, well, me too.

1511
02:08:11,375 --> 02:08:13,500
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1512
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:20,583
Go, babies.

1513
02:08:20,750 --> 02:08:21,875
Go, babies.

1514
02:08:22,041 --> 02:08:23,500
Go!

1515
02:08:23,667 --> 02:08:25,834
I cannot hold much...

1516
02:08:32,625 --> 02:08:33,625
Run!

1517
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:34,917
Go! Go!

1518
02:08:46,417 --> 02:08:47,417
Quill!

1519
02:08:47,542 --> 02:08:48,583
Hurry!

1520
02:09:31,667 --> 02:09:34,125
Peter!

1521
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:42,750
Peter!

1522
02:10:47,917 --> 02:10:49,834
Did that...

1523
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,458
look...

1524
02:10:52,166 --> 02:10:53,458
cool?

1525
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:57,750
Come on.

1526
02:11:10,166 --> 02:11:12,792
Cosmo! I'm okay.

1527
02:11:50,667 --> 02:11:52,125
I am Groot.

1528
02:11:52,792 --> 02:11:55,166
Thanks. Just tell them
I'm gonna be right...

1529
02:12:00,834 --> 02:12:02,208
I am Groot.

1530
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:06,792
Yeah. It was good working with you, too.

1531
02:12:14,625 --> 02:12:15,625
Hey, Gamora.

1532
02:12:16,083 --> 02:12:17,083
Are you ready?

1533
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:18,875
Yeah.

1534
02:12:25,083 --> 02:12:26,883
You know, I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1535
02:12:28,709 --> 02:12:29,709
I know.

1536
02:12:31,083 --> 02:12:33,208
But who you are ain't so bad.

1537
02:12:53,166 --> 02:12:54,875
I bet we were fun.

1538
02:13:00,125 --> 02:13:01,875
Like you wouldn't believe.

1539
02:13:08,417 --> 02:13:09,458
Okay.

1540
02:13:23,417 --> 02:13:24,834
You okay?

1541
02:13:26,750 --> 02:13:28,917
I think I need to talk to everybody.

1542
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,208
So, you're gonna leave?

1543
02:13:34,875 --> 02:13:36,976
My mother died in front of me
when I was eight years old...

1544
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,125
and I have been running ever since.

1545
02:13:40,333 --> 02:13:42,333
I'm gonna need to take some time...

1546
02:13:44,417 --> 02:13:45,917
and learn how to swim.

1547
02:13:48,750 --> 02:13:49,750
I as well.

1548
02:13:54,333 --> 02:13:57,208
I love you all. I do.

1549
02:14:01,375 --> 02:14:04,542
But my whole life
I did whatever Ego wanted...

1550
02:14:05,083 --> 02:14:07,875
and then, I did
whatever the Guardians wanted.

1551
02:14:08,625 --> 02:14:11,875
I need to go out and discover what I want.

1552
02:14:12,041 --> 02:14:13,041
I'll come with you.

1553
02:14:13,166 --> 02:14:15,542
No, Drax. That's the whole point.

1554
02:14:15,709 --> 02:14:17,149
But you need someone to protect you.

1555
02:14:17,208 --> 02:14:19,208
- I don't.
- Not in a bad way.

1556
02:14:19,375 --> 02:14:20,893
Just because of your incredible weakness.

1557
02:14:20,917 --> 02:14:22,458
Oh, my gosh, you're so frustrating!

1558
02:14:22,625 --> 02:14:23,625
Drax.

1559
02:14:24,291 --> 02:14:25,458
I need you here.

1560
02:14:26,291 --> 02:14:27,750
We're building a new society.

1561
02:14:28,417 --> 02:14:31,041
I need all the support I can get
for those children out there.

1562
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:34,834
Today, I saw who you are.

1563
02:14:36,041 --> 02:14:37,834
You weren't born to be a destroyer.

1564
02:14:39,792 --> 02:14:41,166
You were born to be a dad.

1565
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:47,709
So, you'll lead the Guardians then?

1566
02:14:48,333 --> 02:14:49,333
No.

1567
02:14:49,917 --> 02:14:51,417
I'm gonna lead the city...

1568
02:14:52,166 --> 02:14:53,917
make it the type of home I never had.

1569
02:14:56,667 --> 02:14:57,959
So, that's it?

1570
02:14:59,458 --> 02:15:00,917
The group's over?

1571
02:15:01,458 --> 02:15:02,625
No.

1572
02:15:02,917 --> 02:15:05,083
Well, the Galaxy still needs its Guardians.

1573
02:15:06,291 --> 02:15:09,041
And you will make a better leader
than I ever was...

1574
02:15:09,875 --> 02:15:10,875
Cap'n.

1575
02:15:31,333 --> 02:15:33,083
I love you, guys.

1576
02:15:41,125 --> 02:15:42,208
For you.

1577
02:17:38,417 --> 02:17:39,667
Yeah!

1578
02:17:39,834 --> 02:17:41,083
Oh, yeah!

1579
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:47,667
Welcome home.

1580
02:18:35,917 --> 02:18:37,458
I think I might be at the wrong...

1581
02:18:39,291 --> 02:18:40,792
I'm looking for Jason Quill.

1582
02:18:40,959 --> 02:18:42,125
Yes.

1583
02:18:42,583 --> 02:18:43,834
Come in.

1584
02:19:02,041 --> 02:19:03,041
Pete?

1585
02:19:09,458 --> 02:19:10,458
Pete.

1586
02:19:15,041 --> 02:19:16,291
Hi, Grandpa.

1587
02:19:45,208 --> 02:19:48,208
Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yeah!

1588
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:53,458
Yeah!

1589
02:19:53,625 --> 02:19:55,208
Yeah!

1590
02:21:19,667 --> 02:21:21,500
Okay, how about your favorite musical act?

1591
02:21:22,125 --> 02:21:23,208
Phyla, you first.

1592
02:21:24,917 --> 02:21:27,750
Britney Spears and Korn.

1593
02:21:28,166 --> 02:21:29,166
Good choices.

1594
02:21:29,333 --> 02:21:31,959
I gotta go with the man. Garth Brooks.

1595
02:21:32,125 --> 02:21:35,250
The Carpenters do not
have a single bad song.

1596
02:21:35,417 --> 02:21:36,625
Adrian Belew.

1597
02:21:36,917 --> 02:21:40,208
Both solo and his work with King Crimson.

1598
02:21:40,959 --> 02:21:42,542
What about you, Captain?

1599
02:21:42,709 --> 02:21:44,250
This one's kind of special.

1600
02:22:02,208 --> 02:22:03,667
Guess they're here.

1601
02:22:03,834 --> 02:22:07,583
Well, I can handle this by my lonesome...

1602
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:09,333
if y'all wanna chill.

1603
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:10,500
Nah, nah.

1604
02:22:10,667 --> 02:22:14,083
It'll go faster if we all do it together.
Groot, wake up.

1605
02:22:25,417 --> 02:22:27,208
Do you ever feel a little sad for them?

1606
02:22:27,375 --> 02:22:30,500
Yeah, sure. But these townsfolk
can't protect themselves.

1607
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:32,917
On your word, <i>Kapitan.</i>

1608
02:22:42,792 --> 02:22:43,792
Word.

1609
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:12,643
I mean, if she needs help mowing her lawn,
I'll do it...

1610
02:29:12,667 --> 02:29:14,347
but I kinda feel like her son should help.

1611
02:29:14,917 --> 02:29:17,125
He's gonna sit on the porch
and watch me do it.

1612
02:29:17,417 --> 02:29:19,250
Like, he's a 45-year-old man...

1613
02:29:19,417 --> 02:29:21,250
able-bodied, and I'm mowing his lawn.

1614
02:29:21,417 --> 02:29:22,583
It just feels weird.

1615
02:29:22,750 --> 02:29:24,166
Don't get me started.

1616
02:29:25,917 --> 02:29:26,917
Oh, really?

1617
02:29:28,625 --> 02:29:29,917
Now I kind of want to know.
