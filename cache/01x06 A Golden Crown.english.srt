1
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,600
Your pardon, Your Grace.

2
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,890
I would rise, but...

3
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,020
Do you know what your wife has done?

4
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,530
- She did nothing I did not command.
- Who'd have thought she had it in her?

5
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,280
By what right dare you lay hands
on my blood?

6
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,240
- I am the King's Hand...
- You were the King's Hand!

7
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,160
You shall now be held accountable.

8
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,250
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?

9
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,920
Catelyn will release Tyrion
and you'll make your peace with Jaime.

10
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,210
He butchered my men.

11
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,260
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel
when his men attacked Jaime.

12
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,840
- Quiet, woman.
- Jaime has fled the city.

13
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,720
Give me leave to bring him back to justice.

14
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,600
I took you for a king.

15
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,020
Hold your tongue.

16
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,110
He's attacked one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

17
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,530
I should wear the armor
and you the gown.

18
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,580
I shall wear this like a badge of honor.

19
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,920
Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.

20
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,190
See what she does to me?

21
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,150
My loving wife.

22
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,280
I should not have hit her.

23
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,320
That was not...

24
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,700
That was not kingly.

25
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,000
If we don't act...

26
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,500
there will be a war.

27
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,840
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing.

28
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,510
She's had her fun, now put an end to it.

29
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,890
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

30
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,640
And what about Jaime Lannister?

31
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,520
What about Jaime?

32
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm half a kingdom in debt
to his bloody father.

33
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,320
I don't know what happened
between you and those yellow-haired shits.

34
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,110
I don't want to know.
This is what matters -

35
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,870
I can't rule the Kingdoms
if the Starks and the Lannisters

36
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,460
are at each other's throats, so enough.

37
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,880
As you command, Your Grace.

38
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,670
With your leave...

39
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,510
I will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

40
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,090
Piss on that. Send a raven.
I want you to stay.

41
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,550
I'm the king. I get what I want.

42
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,560
I never loved my brothers.

43
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,110
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.

44
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,990
You were the brother I chose.

45
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,830
We'll talk when I return from the hunt.

46
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,790
The hunt?

47
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,260
Killing things clears my head.

48
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,680
You'll have to sit on the throne
while I'm away.

49
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,760
You'll hate it more than I do.

50
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,600
- The Targaryen girl...
- Seven hells!

51
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,560
Don't start with her again!

52
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,060
The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.

53
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,150
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again,

54
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,190
I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing
on Jaime Lannister.

55
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,740
Khaleesi?

56
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,120
Oh, Khaleesi!

57
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,040
You're hurt.

58
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,020
- Not too fast.
- Come on, Dancer.

59
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,900
When are you gonna tell him?

60
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,060
Not now.

61
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,820
- Blood for blood.
- Come on!

62
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,570
You need to make the Lannisters pay
for Jory and the others.

63
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,160
- You're talking about war.
- I'm talking about justice.

64
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,950
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in
the bannermen and raise an army.

65
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,790
A Lannister put his spear
through your father's leg.

66
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,330
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock
where no one can touch him...

67
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,290
You want me to march on Casterly Rock?

68
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,580
- You're not a boy anymore.
- Come on.

69
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,590
They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

70
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,800
It's your duty to represent your House
when your father can't.

71
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,350
And it's not your duty,
because it's not your House.

72
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,110
Where's Bran?

73
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,820
I don't know.

74
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,780
It's not my House.

75
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,310
Robb?

76
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,070
All alone in the deep, dark woods.

77
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,280
I'm not alone.
My brother is with me.

78
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,950
I don't see him.

79
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,950
Got him hidden under your cloak?

80
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,290
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

81
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,960
Silver.

82
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,080
We'll take the pin and the horse.
Get down.

83
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,250
Be quick about it.

84
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,670
I can't.

85
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,720
The saddle... The straps.

86
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,350
What's wrong with you?
You some kind of cripple?

87
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,100
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

88
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,690
If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!

89
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,650
Cut his little cock off
and stuff it in his mouth.

90
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,320
The boy's worth nothing dead.

91
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,730
Benjen Stark's own blood?

92
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,990
Think what Mance would give us.

93
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,450
Piss on Mance Rayder
and piss on the North.

94
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,620
We're going as far south as south goes.

95
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,080
There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.

96
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,710
Drop the knife!

97
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,750
Let him go and I'll let you live.

98
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,480
Robb.

99
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,280
- Robb.
- Shut up.

100
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,780
Drop the blade!

101
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,820
- No, don't.
- Do it.

102
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,410
Are you all right?

103
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,950
Yes. It doesn't hurt.

104
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,450
Tough little lad.

105
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,290
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man
until you've killed your first enemy.

106
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,500
Well done.

107
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,090
Have you lost your mind?

108
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,920
What if you'd missed?

109
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,470
He would have killed you
and cut Bran's throat.

110
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,010
- You don't have the right...
- To save your brother's life?

111
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,800
It was the only thing to do, so I did it.

112
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,560
What about her?

113
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,400
Give me my life, my lord,
and I'm yours.

114
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,280
We'll keep her alive.

115
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,890
Mord!

116
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,140
Turnkey! Mord!

117
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,600
Mord!

118
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,530
Dwarf man making noise!

119
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,990
How would you like to be rich?

120
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,320
Dwarf man still making noise.

121
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,910
My family is rich.

122
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,870
We have gold, lots of gold.

123
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,210
I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...

124
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,880
No gold!

125
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,960
Well, I don't have it here.

126
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,340
No gold!

127
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,050
Fuck off.

128
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,290
I don't want to practice today.

129
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,910
No?

130
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,080
They killed Jory.

131
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,170
My father is hurt.

132
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,510
I don't care about stupid wooden swords.

133
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,470
You are troubled.

134
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,130
- Yes.
- Good!

135
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,470
Trouble is the perfect time for training.

136
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,760
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

137
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,770
this is not when fighting happens.

138
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,940
I don't like dolls and k...

139
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
You're not here.

140
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,980
You're with your trouble.

141
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,940
If you are with your trouble
when fighting happens...

142
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,700
...more trouble for you.

143
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,830
Just so.

144
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,870
How can you be quick as a snake...

145
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,090
...or as quiet as a shadow...

146
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,470
...when you are somewhere else?

147
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,810
You are fearing for your father, hmm?

148
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,310
That is right.

149
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,520
- Do you pray to the gods?
- The old and the new.

150
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,150
There is only one god...

151
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,860
and his name is death.

152
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,830
And there is only one thing we say to death -

153
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,950
"Not today. "

154
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,480
She has to eat the whole heart?

155
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,320
I hope that wasn't my horse.

156
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,190
She's doing well.

157
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
She'll never keep it down.

158
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,510
Tell me what she's saying.

159
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,140
"The prince is riding.

160
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,140
"I have heard the thunder
of his hooves.

161
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,480
"Swift as the wind he rides.

162
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,900
"His enemies will cower before him...

163
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,780
"... and their wives will weep tears of blood. "

164
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,620
She's going to have a boy.

165
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,130
He won't be a real Targaryen.

166
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,420
He won't be a true dragon.

167
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,060
"The stallion who mounts the world. "

168
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,100
The stallion is the khal of khals.

169
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,270
He shall unite the people
into a single khalasar.

170
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,610
All the people of the world will be his herd.

171
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,240
A prince rides inside me!

172
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,210
And he shall be called Rhaego!

173
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,710
Rhaego! Rhaego!

174
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,920
Rhaego! Rhaego!

175
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,670
Rhaego! Rhaego...

176
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,390
They love her.

177
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,060
Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego...

178
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,500
She truly is a queen today.

179
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,360
Don't let them see you carrying a sword
in Vaes Dothrak.

180
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,490
You know the law.

181
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,540
It's not my law.

182
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,500
They don't belong to you.

183
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,870
Whatever is hers is also mine.

184
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,580
Once, perhaps.

185
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,380
If I sell one egg,
I'll have enough to buy a ship.

186
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,590
Two eggs - a ship and an army.

187
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,890
- And you have all three.
- I need a large army.

188
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,430
I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.

189
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,270
The greatest dynasty
this world has ever seen

190
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,810
on my shoulders
since I was five years old,

191
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,690
and no one has ever given me
what they gave to her in that tent. Never.

192
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,320
Not a piece of it.

193
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,450
How can I carry
what I need to carry without it? Hmm?

194
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,780
Who can rule without wealth or fear or love?

195
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,080
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor.

196
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,760
You don't think I see you
looking at my little sister, hmm?

197
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,260
Don't think I know what you want?

198
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,560
I don't care. You can have her.

199
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,850
She can be queen of the savages
and dine on the finest bloody horseparts,

200
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,560
and you can dine
on whichever parts of her you like.

201
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,360
But let me go.

202
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,950
You can go.

203
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,860
You can't have the eggs.

204
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,700
You swore an oath to me.

205
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,160
Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

206
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,370
It means everything to me.

207
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,370
And yet here you stand.

208
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
And yet here I stand.

209
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,140
Mord!

210
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:12,200
Mord!

211
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Noise again!

212
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,460
- About the gold...
- No gold!

213
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,050
- No gold.
- Listen to me! Listen to me.

214
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,220
Sometimes possession...

215
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,340
is an abstract concept...

216
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,930
When they captured me, they took my purse,
but the gold is still mine.

217
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,770
Where?

218
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,190
Where? I don't know where,
but when they free me...

219
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,560
You want free?

220
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,860
Go be free.

221
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,320
Have you ever heard the phrase...

222
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,240
"Rich as a Lannister"?

223
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,870
Of course you have!

224
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,870
You're a smart man.

225
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,750
You know who the Lannisters are.

226
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,630
I am a Lannister.

227
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,380
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

228
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,970
And of course,
you have also heard the phrase,

229
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,770
"a Lannister always pays his debts. "

230
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,770
If you deliver a message from me...

231
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,610
to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.

232
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,740
I will owe you gold.

233
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,820
If you deliver the message...

234
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,040
and I live,
which I very much intend to do.

235
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,460
What message?

236
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,050
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

237
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,230
You wish to confess your crimes?

238
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,850
Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.

239
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,900
The sky cells always break them.

240
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,190
Speak, Imp.

241
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,490
Meet your gods as an honest man.

242
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,950
Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?

243
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,170
I'm a vile man, I confess it.

244
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,340
My crimes and sins are beyond counting.

245
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,300
I have lied and cheated...

246
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
gambled and whored.

247
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,390
I'm not particularly good at violence, but...

248
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,310
I'm good at convincing others
to do violence for me.

249
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,600
You want specifics, I suppose.

250
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,610
When I was seven, I saw a servant girl...
bathing in the river.

251
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,570
I stole her robe.

252
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,910
She was forced to return to the castle
naked and in tears.

253
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,080
If I close my eyes,
I can still see her tits bouncing.

254
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,130
When I was 10,
I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit.

255
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,840
When confronted with my crime,
I blamed a squire.

256
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,350
Poor boy was flogged and...
I escaped justice.

257
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,180
When I was 12 I milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.

258
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,150
I flogged the one-eyed snake.

259
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,150
I skinned my sausage.

260
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:34,490
I made the bald man cry
into the turtle stew,

261
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,490
which I do believe my sister ate.

262
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,490
At least I hope she did.

263
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,870
I once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel...

264
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,990
Silence!

265
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,580
What happened next?

266
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,750
What do you think you're doing?

267
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,670
Confessing my crimes.

268
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:56,840
Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man
to slay my son Bran in his bed,

269
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,590
and of conspiring to murder
my sister's husband -

270
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,430
Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.

271
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,770
Oh, I'm very sorry.

272
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,850
I don't know anything about all that.

273
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,320
You've had your little joke.

274
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,650
I trust you enjoyed it.

275
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,610
Mord, take him back to the dungeon.

276
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,120
But this time find a smaller cell...
with a steeper floor.

277
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,290
Is this how justice is done in the Vale?

278
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,460
You accuse me of crimes,

279
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,830
I deny them,

280
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,300
so you throw me into a cell
to freeze and starve?

281
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,510
Where is the king's justice?

282
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,840
I am accused and demand a trial!

283
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,020
If you're tried and found guilty, then by the
king's own laws you will pay with your life.

284
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,520
I understand the law.

285
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,400
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.

286
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,650
Life is more elegant here.

287
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,150
Open the Moon Door.

288
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,840
You want a trial, my Lord Lannister.

289
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,930
Very well.

290
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,510
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

291
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,350
and you will hear his judgment.

292
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,560
Then you will leave...

293
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,560
by one door or the other.

294
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,020
No need to bother Lord Robin.

295
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,150
I demand a trial by combat.

296
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,830
You have that right.

297
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,880
My lady, I beg the honor.

298
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,880
Let me be your champion.

299
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,300
The honor should be mine.

300
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,840
For the love I bore your lord husband...

301
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,550
let me avenge his death.

302
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,090
- I'll fight for you, my lady.
- It'll be my honor.

303
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,220
- The honor should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!

304
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,430
Ser Vardis...

305
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,150
you're quiet.

306
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,360
Don't you want to avenge my husband?

307
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,110
With all my heart, my lady.

308
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,530
But the Imp is half my size.

309
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,990
It would be shameful to slaughter such a man
and call it justice.

310
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,280
Agreed.

311
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,750
You demanded a trial by combat.

312
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,580
Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.

313
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,290
My lady,

314
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,340
I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.

315
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,630
I wouldn't be too glad, ser.

316
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,260
I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.

317
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,430
The Kingslayer
is hundreds of miles from here.

318
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,020
Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.

319
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
The trial will be today.

320
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,650
Do I have a volunteer?

321
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,410
Anyone?

322
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,950
Anyone?

323
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,380
I think we can assume that no one is willing...

324
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,250
I'll stand for the dwarf.

325
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,930
More wine, Your Grace?

326
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,560
- What was I saying?
- Simpler time.

327
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,820
It was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

328
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,650
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

329
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,110
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right there in the open,

330
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,280
vicious as you like,
all but sending you a bloody invitation.

331
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,200
Nothing like today.

332
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,160
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

333
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:01,000
Not as exhilarating as those balls
and masquerades you like to throw.

334
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,430
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

335
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,090
Once. I think.

336
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,930
You think? I think you'd remember.

337
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,930
Back in our day, you weren't a real man

338
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,020
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

339
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,810
and the Riverlands.

340
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,070
- We used to call it "making the eight. "
- Those were some lucky girls.

341
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,150
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

342
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,110
I don't believe so, Your Grace.

343
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,990
Those were the days.

344
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,870
Which days, exactly?

345
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,410
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

346
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,620
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

347
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,670
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

348
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,090
Or way before that, when dragons burned
whole cities to the ground?

349
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Easy, boy.

350
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,340
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the king.

351
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,970
I suppose it was all rather heroic.

352
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,810
If you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

353
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,390
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

354
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,400
More wine, Your Grace?

355
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,880
They burned most everything
in the Riverlands -

356
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,550
our fields, our granaries,

357
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,090
our homes.

358
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,140
They took our women,
then they took 'em again.

359
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,600
When they was done, they butchered them
as if they was animals.

360
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,940
They covered our children in pitch...

361
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,520
and lit them on fire.

362
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,780
Brigands, most likely.

363
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,860
They weren't thieves.
They didn't steal nothing.

364
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,240
They even left something behind, Your Grace.

365
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,620
It's the King's Hand you're addressing,
not the king.

366
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,580
The king is hunting.

367
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,800
Fish. The sigil of House Tully.

368
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,640
Isn't that your wife's House - Tully -
my Lord Hand?

369
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,770
These men, were they flying a sigil?

370
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,650
- A banner?
- None, your... Hand.

371
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,150
The one who was leading them...

372
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,700
Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,

373
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,040
saw him cut the blacksmith in two,

374
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,000
saw him take the head off a horse
with a single swing of his sword.

375
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,590
That sounds like someone we know.

376
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,710
The Mountain.

377
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,880
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

378
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,800
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

379
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,010
The man is an anointed knight.

380
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,180
I've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

381
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,430
I'm sure you have as well.

382
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,310
Can you think of any reason
the Lannisters might possibly have

383
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,070
for being angry with your wife?

384
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:16,240
If the Lannisters were to order attacks
on villages under the king's protection,

385
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,030
- it would be...
- That would be almost as brazen

386
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,240
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

387
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,950
Well...

388
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,550
I cannot give you back your homes
or restore your dead to life,

389
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:38,260
but perhaps I can give you justice
in the name of our king, Robert.

390
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,560
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

391
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,730
You shall have the command.

392
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,110
Assemble 100 men
and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.

393
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,030
As you command.

394
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,330
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,
the First of his Name,

395
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,330
King of the Andals and the First Men,

396
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,710
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

397
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,840
I charge you to bring the king's justice
to the false knight Gregor Clegane

398
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,300
and all those who shared in his crimes.

399
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,090
I denounce him and attaint him.

400
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,680
I strip him of all ranks and titles...

401
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,810
of all lands and holdings...

402
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,060
and sentence him to death.

403
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,650
My lord...
This... This is a drastic action.

404
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,490
It would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

405
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,950
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My lord.

406
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,370
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

407
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,740
Inform Tywin Lannister
that he has been summoned to court

408
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,870
to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.

409
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,040
He will arrive within the fortnight,
or be branded an enemy of the Crown

410
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,090
and a traitor to the realm.

411
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,770
A bold move, my lord, and admirable.

412
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,270
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?

413
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,820
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

414
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,860
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

415
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,160
Then how come Robert is king
and not Tywin Lannister?

416
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,180
Fight!

417
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,700
Hold!

418
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,990
- Attack! Attack!
- Come on, Ser Vardis!

419
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,660
Attack!

420
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,620
Stand and fight, coward!

421
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,690
Yes!

422
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,440
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

423
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,800
What are you doing? Get up!

424
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,800
Get up, get up, get up!

425
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,050
Raise your sword. Raise it!

426
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,100
Get up, man!

427
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,310
- On your feet!
- Get up! Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!

428
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,080
No! Have mercy!

429
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,940
Is it over?

430
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,030
You don't fight with honor!

431
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,280
No.

432
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,290
He did.

433
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,050
Can I make the little man fly now?

434
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,100
Not this little man.

435
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,430
This little man is going home.

436
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,480
I believe you have something of mine.

437
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,340
A Lannister always pays his debts.

438
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:07,020
You wear your hair like
a real southern lady now.

439
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,240
Well, why shouldn't I?
We're in the South.

440
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,570
It's important to remember
where you come from.

441
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,910
I'm not sure your mother
would like these new styles.

442
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,450
My mother isn't from the North.

443
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,710
I'm aware of that.

444
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,420
Why do you care?
Do you even have hair under there?

445
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,710
Yes. I have hair.

446
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,510
I've never seen it.

447
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,800
Would you like to?

448
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,760
No.

449
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,310
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

450
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:46,110
- I come from a very small village in...
- Oh, wait.

451
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,570
I just realized... I don't care.

452
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,860
- Sansa...
- Septa.

453
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,240
Now you are being rude.

454
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,620
My prince.

455
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,380
My prince.

456
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,000
My lady.

457
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,130
I fear I have behaved monstrously
the past few weeks.

458
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,640
With your permission?

459
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,860
It's beautiful,

460
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,820
like the one your mother wears.

461
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,910
You'll be queen someday.

462
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,660
It's only fitting you should look the part.

463
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,000
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

464
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,790
There's nothing to forgive.

465
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,260
You're my lady.

466
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,430
One day we'll be married
in the throne room.

467
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,470
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

468
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,770
from the last hearth in the North

469
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,730
to the salt shore in the South.

470
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,900
And you will be queen over all of them.

471
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,650
I'll never disrespect you again.

472
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,870
I'll never be cruel to you again.

473
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,160
Do you understand me?

474
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,700
You're my lady now...

475
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,580
from this day...

476
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,590
until my last day.

477
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,280
Stop.

478
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,320
- Stop!
- Whoa.

479
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,330
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

480
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,490
In a turnip cart?

481
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,410
I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.

482
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,330
And you can afford that?

483
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,130
Some of my friends
are more generous than others.

484
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,800
There's a thousand girls like you
in King's Landing.

485
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,090
So I'll have lots of company.

486
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,840
Yes, you'll be very popular...

487
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,510
until some fat lord comes to visit
with a big belly and a little prick

488
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,520
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

489
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,850
And what will happen to me if I stay here?

490
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,940
Will I become Lady Greyjoy,
Mistress of the Iron Islands?

491
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,980
Don't be a fool.

492
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,070
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark
in the streets of King's Landing.

493
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,860
Every man for a hundred miles
will be marching off to war soon

494
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,830
and most of them will never come back.

495
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,830
There's nothing left for me here.

496
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,210
Let's go, Steffon.

497
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,710
Giddy up.

498
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,040
Let me see it one more time!

499
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,300
See what?

500
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,890
I'm going to miss you!

501
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,690
I know.

502
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,580
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

503
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,080
- What?
- Listen...

504
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,080
- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

505
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,040
- Is that why you're sending us home?
- What? No.

506
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,420
- Please, Father. Please don't.
- You can't.

507
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,420
I've got my lessons with Syrio.
I'm finally getting good.

508
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:44,300
This isn't a punishment. I want you back
in Winterfell for your own safety.

509
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,800
Can we take Syrio back with us?

510
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,970
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?
I can't go.

511
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,060
I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
I love him and I'm meant to be his queen

512
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,190
- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.

513
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:59,570
When you're old enough, I'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,

514
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,320
someone who's brave
and gentle and strong...

515
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,610
I don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. I want him!

516
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,450
He'll be the greatest king that ever was,
a golden lion,

517
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,330
and I'll give him sons
with beautiful blond hair.

518
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,910
The lion's not his sigil, idiot.

519
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,750
He's a stag, like his father.

520
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,590
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk king.

521
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,670
Go on, girls.
Get your septa and start packing your things.

522
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,180
- Wait!
- Come on.

523
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,840
But it's not fair!

524
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,300
"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair. "

525
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,180
"Axel Baratheon, black of hair. "

526
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,100
"Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair. "

527
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,230
"Steffon Baratheon, black of hair. "

528
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,280
"Robert Baratheon, black of hair. "

529
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,490
"Joffrey Baratheon...

530
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,660
"golden-haired. "

531
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,240
Daenerys!

532
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,410
Where's my sister?

533
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:12,740
Stop him.

534
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,120
Where is she? Hmm?

535
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,540
Where is she?
I'm here for the feast.

536
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,170
The whore's feast?

537
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,710
- Come.
- Get your hands off me!

538
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,170
No one touches the dragon!

539
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,100
Khal Drogo!

540
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,560
I'm here for the feast.

541
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,860
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.

542
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,030
Back there.

543
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,540
That is no place for a king.

544
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,250
You are no king.

545
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,710
Keep away from me!

546
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,750
Viserys, please.

547
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,670
There she is.

548
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,970
Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.

549
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,560
They can't kill us.

550
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,600
They can't shed blood in their sacred city.

551
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,110
But I can.

552
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,330
I want what I came for.

553
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,670
I want the crown he promised me.

554
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,550
He bought you.

555
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,670
But he never paid for you.

556
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:01,020
Tell him I want what was bargained for
or I'm taking you back.

557
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,690
He can keep the baby.

558
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,980
I'll cut it out and leave it for him.

559
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,410
What's he saying?

560
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,580
He says yes.

561
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,960
You shall have a golden crown...

562
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,170
...that men shall tremble to behold.

563
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,520
That was all I wanted.

564
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,980
W- What was promised.

565
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,880
No!

566
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,510
No! You cannot touch me.

567
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,930
I am the dragon.
I am the dragon!

568
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,760
I want my crown! Ahh!

569
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,190
- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.

570
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,580
No, Dany.

571
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,000
Dany, tell them.

572
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,500
Make them!

573
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,250
Dany, make them...

574
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,090
No, you can't!

575
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,630
Just... Please!

576
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,010
Dany, please!

577
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,270
A crown for a king.

578
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,660
Khaleesi?

579
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,870
He was no dragon.

580
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,660
Fire cannot kill a dragon.
