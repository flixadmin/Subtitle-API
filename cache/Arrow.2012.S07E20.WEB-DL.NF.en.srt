1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,127
MY NAME IS OLIVER QUEEN.

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,378
AFTER 6 MONTHS IN HELL,

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,755
I HAVE BEEN RELEASED
FROM PRISON

4
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,757
AND RETURNED HOME
WITH ONLY ONE GOAL...

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,133
TO SAVE MY CITY,

6
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,593
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

7
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,386
INSTEAD OF OPERATING
OUTSIDE THE LAW,

8
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,514
I AM NOW WORKING
ALONGSIDE THE POLICE.

9
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,350
I AM NO LONGER INMATE 4587.

10
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,061
I AM ONCE MORE
THE GREEN ARROW.

11
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,689
PREVIOUSLY ON "ARROW"...

12
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,940
WORKING WITH THE SCPD...

13
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,525
THAT'S WHAT'S BEST
FOR THIS CITY.

14
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,860
THE WHOLE CITY WILL BE
WATCHING YOU,

15
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,611
HOLDING YOU TO
THE HIGHEST STANDARD.

16
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,405
DAD, PLEASE.
DON'T LEAVE.

17
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,199
EMIKO: DANTE TOOK
ME UNDER HIS WING,
AND HE TRAINED ME.

18
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,742
I KEPT HOLDING OUT,
THINKING

19
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,369
ONE DAY YOU'D BECOME
THE FATHER I DESERVED.

20
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,329
IT'S NEVER GONNA
HAPPEN, IS IT?

21
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,373
ROBERT: IS THERE
SOMETHING ELSE YOU'D
LIKE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

22
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,292
NO. HAVE
A GOOD TRIP.

23
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,671
WHEN EMIKO REALIZES
THAT DANTE HAS BEEN
MANIPULATING HER,

24
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:50,009
IT WILL DRIVE
A WEDGE BETWEEN HER
AND THE NINTH CIRCLE.

25
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,051
ROT IN HELL.

26
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,929
THE NINTH CIRCLE
GOT AWAY

27
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,138
WITH
A VERY DANGEROUS
BIOLOGICAL WEAPON...

28
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,017
THE CYGNUS X-1.

29
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,022
REPORTER: I HAVE JUST RECEIVED
CONFIRMATION

30
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,483
OF TWO FATALITIES HERE AT THE
HUDOLIN MCGUIRE METRO STATION.

31
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,694
SCPD HAVE CORDONED OFF THE AREA,

32
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,279
BUT THE COMMUNITY IS
VERY CONCERNED.

33
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,908
RUMORS ARE ALREADY FLYING AS
TO WHO MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE.

34
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,284
REPORTER: CAPTAIN DRAKE.
DINAH: HOW'S IT LOOK?

35
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,705
YOU NEED TO SEE
THIS FOR YOURSELF.

36
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,082
HEY, KEEP THOSE DAMN
REPORTERS BACK.

37
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,083
[SIREN]

38
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,505
THIS IS WHERE
WE FOUND THEM.

39
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,716
OH, MY GOD.

40
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,427
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT
FOR THE OFFICIAL
M.E. REPORT,

41
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,303
BUT IT SEEMS
OBVIOUS...

42
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,096
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA.

43
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,473
LOOKS LIKE THEY GOT OFF
A FEW ROUNDS

44
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,225
BEFORE THEY WENT DOWN.

45
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,727
DID THEY HIT ANYTHING?

46
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,520
NOTHING ALIVE.

47
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,070
WHERE ARE THE SUSPECTS?

48
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,868
WE'VE GOT TWO DEAD GUARDS
AND ONE HELL OF A MESS.

49
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,954
YOUR TEAM WAS ON-SITE.

50
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,539
I THINK YOU BETTER
START TALKING.

51
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,716
THIS IS...THIS
WHOLE THING
IS RIDICULOUS.

52
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,176
THE REAL DANGER
IS STILL
OUT THERE.

53
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,138
I DON'T THINK YOU GET TO
DECIDE THE REAL DANGER,

54
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,557
MR. QUEEN.

55
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,059
WE WENT TO THE
SUBWAY PLATFORM

56
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,560
TO STOP
A TERRORIST
ATTACK,

57
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,895
WHICH WE DID,

58
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,187
BUT THE PEOPLE
THAT WE WERE
AFTER

59
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,481
ARE STILL ON
THE LOOSE.

60
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,066
WELL, LUCKILY WE HAVE
HALF THE DEPARTMENT

61
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,818
OUT THERE RIGHT NOW
FOLLOWING THE SAME LEAD.

62
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,735
DO YOU THINK THAT THESE ARE

63
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,987
AVERAGE STREET THUGS,
DINAH?

64
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,822
THESE ARE TERRORISTS
THAT TRIED TO RELEASE

65
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,406
A BIOLOGICAL AGENT
IN STAR CITY.

66
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,033
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
COULD HAVE DIED.

67
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,286
TWO PEOPLE DID DIE.

68
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,749
WE FOUND TWO EMERALD ARROWS
AT THE SCENE.

69
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,085
THE NEW GREEN ARROW.

70
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:51,170
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT HER INVOLVEMENT
AT THE SUBWAY TONIGHT?

71
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,172
[EXHALES]

72
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,883
SHE WAS THERE.

73
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,720
SHE? HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

74
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,180
I THINK IT'S TIME WE
TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH.

75
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,183
THE NEW GREEN ARROW
IS MY HALF-SISTER.

76
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,811
HER NAME IS
EMIKO ADACHI.

77
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,395
DINAH: SHE BELONGS TO
A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION

78
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,356
CALLED THE NINTH CIRCLE.

79
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,565
THE VIGILANTES HAVE BEEN
TRACKING HER

80
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,859
FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW.

81
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,736
WHY DIDN'T YOU INFORM
THE SCPD?

82
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,446
BECAUSE THE NINTH CIRCLE
IS JUST A LITTLE BIT

83
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,033
BEYOND THE SCPD,
OFFICER.

84
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,036
THE SCPD-VIGILANTE
PARTNERSHIP WORKS BEST

85
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,745
WHEN WE OPERATE AS
A COVERT UNIT.

86
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,998
DOESN'T SEEM SO
IN THIS CASE.

87
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,416
WELL, I'M USUALLY KEPT
AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON,

88
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,003
BUT I DID NOT
KNOW ABOUT THIS.

89
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,629
CARE TO EXPLAIN WHY?

90
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,258
THINGS STARTED MOVING
PRETTY QUICKLY

91
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,344
AFTER YOU TOLD US
ABOUT DANTE.

92
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,849
FELICITY: OH, THANK GOD.

93
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,851
PLEASE TELL ME THE NEWS
THAT YOU ARE BRINGING

94
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,020
IS ABOUT EMIKO AND HER
NINTH CIRCLE BUDDIES

95
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,521
BECAUSE I HAVE HAD
NO LUCK

96
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,647
WITH MY TYPITY-TYPE
FINDING ANYTHING THING.

97
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,940
OH, WELL, YOU'RE
IN LUCK NOW.

98
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,608
DANTE, NOT SO MUCH.

99
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,986
A COUPLE SCPD BEAT COPS
FOUND HIS BODY THIS MORNING.

100
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,863
LET ME GUESS, AND NOT
FROM NATURAL CAUSES.

101
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,531
NOT UNLESS YOU CALL
3 ARROWS

102
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,824
AND A KNIFE
TO THE CHEST NATURAL.

103
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,201
JOHN: THIS WAS AFTER
YOU TOLD EMIKO

104
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,284
THAT DANTE KILLED
HER MOTHER.

105
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,285
CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE.

106
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,829
NO. SHE WENT AHEAD
AND KILLED

107
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,372
THE ONLY
FATHER FIGURE
SHE HAD LEFT.

108
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,124
FELICITY: RIGHT.
SO THAT'S A "NO"

109
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,667
ON THE EVIL SISTER
REDEEMING HERSELF
THEN.

110
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,502
JOHN: OK, SO WE HAVE
TO STOP EMIKO FROM USING

111
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,379
THIS BIO-WEAPON THAT SHE
STOLE FROM THE D.I.A.

112
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,339
RENE: THE TERRIFYING
BACTERIA THAT EATS
THROUGH EVERYTHING?

113
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,382
YEAH, LET'S KEEP
THAT CONTAINED.

114
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,800
OK, SO THE BAD
NEWS IS THAT

115
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:19,801
I HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO FIND

116
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,344
THE BIO-WEAPON,
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS

117
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,721
THAT THE NINTH CIRCLE
WON'T BE ABLE TO EITHER

118
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,347
UNLESS THEY GET
A DISSEMINATION DEVICE,

119
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,724
A.K.A. A THERMAL FOGGER.

120
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,558
AND, YES, I CHECKED.

121
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,559
THE ONLY PLACE
TO GET ONE

122
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,061
IS AERODYNE INITIATIVES.

123
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,020
DIGG, LET'S GET THERE

124
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,146
-AND HELP THEM PROTECT IT.
-OK.

125
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,522
DINAH: I'LL FOLLOW UP
WITH THE DETECTIVE,

126
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,108
SEE IF I CAN GET SOME MORE
CLUES OFF DANTE'S BODY.

127
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,025
OK.

128
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,068
AND I'LL HANG BACK
WITH FELICITY

129
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,027
AND HELP HER WITH
THE TYPEY-TYPE.

130
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,362
-THAT'S OK.
-MORAL SUPPORT.

131
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,739
OK.

132
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,161
MAN: MR. QUEEN,
MR. DIGGLE,

133
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,662
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO FINALLY MEET

134
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,289
THE FAMOUS GREEN ARROW
AND SPARTAN.

135
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,583
I ALWAYS BELIEVED IN
VIGILANTES IN THE CITY.

136
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,210
WELL, LOVE
TO HEAR IT.

137
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,045
WISH WE WERE
MEETING UNDER BETTER
CIRCUMSTANCES.

138
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,922
JOHN: WE HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE

139
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,506
THAT AN ASSET OF YOURS
HAS BEEN TARGETED

140
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,550
BY AN INTERNATIONAL
TERRORIST THREAT.

141
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,885
WELL, THAT'S QUITE
AN ACCUSATION,

142
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:02,761
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU

143
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,887
OUR SECURITY'S
TOP OF THE LINE.

144
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,472
OLIVER: WITH
ALL DUE RESPECT,

145
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,057
THIS ORGANIZATION IS
FAR MORE POWERFUL

146
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,308
THAN ANY
PRIVATE COMPANY

147
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,726
COULD POSSIBLY
CONTEND WITH.

148
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,603
AND WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT TO YOU,

149
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,981
WE HIRED OVER A DOZEN
OF THE WORLD'S BEST
HACKERS AND THIEVES

150
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,649
TO TRY TO BREAK INTO
OUR FACILITY.

151
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,234
NONE MADE IT PAST
THE FRONT ENTRANCE.

152
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,570
UH, MR. TOTH,

153
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,948
WE'RE SIMPLY OFFERING
TO HELP YOU.

154
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,492
WHAT POSSIBLE REASON
COULD YOU HAVE

155
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,827
FOR TURNING US DOWN?

156
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:28,996
WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,

157
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,331
BUT WE'VE GOT THIS COVERED.

158
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,843
DINAH: IT SEEMS ODD THAT
HE TURNED YOU DOWN.

159
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,219
WE AGREED,

160
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,637
SO WE HAD FELICITY
DO A DEEP DIVE

161
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,555
INTO TOTH'S
FINANCIAL RECORDS.

162
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,557
TURNS OUT HE WAS
GETTING

163
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,601
SOME VERY LARGE
DEPOSITS.

164
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,895
SO HE WAS
ON THE TAKE...

165
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,814
-FROM THE NINTH CIRCLE.
-MM-HMM.

166
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,192
AND WHY THE HELL
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

167
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,567
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T
CONFIRM IT

168
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,986
UNTIL LATER, DINAH.

169
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,612
WELL, I WANT TO BELIEVE
YOU, OLIVER,

170
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,363
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT,
THIS LOOKS REALLY BAD.

171
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,327
I MEAN, WE GOT ARROWS
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

172
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,370
WE'VE GOT A VERY
INCRIMINATING DISTRESS CALL

173
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,082
FROM ONE OF THE VICTIMS,
AND YOU WERE THERE.

174
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,043
NOT TO MENTION
THE MISSING
SECURITY FOOTAGE.

175
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:20,588
OK. DINAH,
YOU KNOW ME, ALL RIGHT?

176
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,634
YOU KNOW THAT I DIDN'T
KILL THOSE PEOPLE.

177
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,636
YOU'VE KILLED
BEFORE...

178
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,181
HUH...

179
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,225
MANY TIMES.

180
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,809
FIVE MONTHS AGO,
YOU WERE SITTING

181
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,269
IN A CELL
IN SLABSIDE.

182
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,104
YOU'RE NOT
EXACTLY INNOCENT.

183
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,898
ENJOYING YOURSELF?
YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?

184
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,607
YOU HAVE HAD IT
OUT FOR ME

185
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,444
SINCE THE MOMENT THAT
I WAS DEPUTIZED BY THE SCPD.

186
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,822
DINAH: YOU KNOW,
THOSE GUARDS WERE NOT
JUST KILLED, OLIVER.

187
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,076
THEY WERE SAVAGELY
BEATEN TO DEATH.

188
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,410
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW BAD THIS LOOKS
FOR THE DEPARTMENT?

189
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:55,207
YES, I DO,
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.

190
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,084
-THEN WHO DID?
-I DON'T KNOW.

191
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,001
SO IT
COULD HAVE BEEN

192
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,711
ONE OF THE MEMBERS
OF YOUR TEAM.

193
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,421
MY TEAM...

194
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,258
STOPPED
A TERRORIST ATTACK.

195
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,343
DINAH: EXCEPT IT
WASN'T JUST YOUR TEAM
WHO WAS THERE, WAS IT?

196
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,262
THERE WAS
SOMEBODY ELSE THERE,

197
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,971
SOMEBODY BESIDES
MR. DIGGLE

198
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,182
AND MS. SMOAK
AND MR. RAMIREZ.

199
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,811
YES, THERE WAS.

200
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,646
OLIVER: WE THOUGHT
THE NINTH CIRCLE

201
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,276
WAS GONNA WIPE OUT
STAR CITY.

202
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,777
SO I MADE A CALL.

203
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,282
YOU DO UNDERSTAND WHAT

204
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,326
ACCOMPLICE TO
MURDER MEANS, RIGHT?

205
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,036
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

206
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,454
TONIGHT'S SECURITY FOOTAGE

207
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,331
FROM HUDOLIN MCGUIRE
SUBWAY STATION

208
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,458
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED.
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN

209
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,127
TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THAT, WOULD YOU?

210
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,380
NOPE. NOTHING, ZILCH, NADA.

211
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,590
SHE'S COVERING FOR
HER HUSBAND.

212
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,135
-OH, COME...
-THAT CERTAINLY IS CONVENIENT.

213
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,219
AND WHEN EXACTLY
WERE YOU

214
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,178
PLANNING
ON TELLING ME

215
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,638
ABOUT ROY HARPER'S
INVOLVEMENT?

216
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,307
HONESTLY?

217
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,767
AFTER WE SAVED STAR CITY FROM
THE NINTH CIRCLE'S ATTACK.

218
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,936
WE KNOW HOW YOU GUYS FEEL
ABOUT "THE UNSANCTIONED."

219
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,729
LET'S GET REAL.

220
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,940
EMIKO AND THE NINTH CIRCLE
KNOW OUR FACES.

221
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,691
ROY WAS OUR ACE IN THE HOLE.

222
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,694
SO YOU RISKED YOUR
NEW RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE SCPD

223
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,529
BY TEAMING UP WITH
A CRIMINAL.

224
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,157
FORMER CRIMINAL.

225
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,825
ROY LEFT THE CITY
4 YEARS AGO,

226
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,410
AND HE'S BEEN
ON THE STRAIGHT
AND NARROW EVER SINCE.

227
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,411
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

228
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,787
YES, I'M SURE ABOUT THAT.

229
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,331
BECAUSE WE TRACED
HARPER'S WHEREABOUTS

230
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,832
AFTER HE FAKED HIS
DEATH IN PRISON

231
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,459
TO GET OLIVER QUEEN
OFF THE HOOK,

232
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,710
AND HIS TRAIL
WENT COLD IN MARCH
OF LAST YEAR.

233
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,172
OH. YOU MEAN WHEN
RICARDO DIAZ KIDNAPPED ROY

234
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,714
TO TURN HIM AGAINST OLIVER?

235
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,633
YOU MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN
ABOUT THAT SINCE YOU

236
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,760
WEREN'T EXACTLY ON
SPEAKING TERMS WITH
OLIVER AND I AT THE TIME.

237
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,553
IT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN

238
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,015
WHERE HE WENT AFTER
GETTING FREED FROM DIAZ.

239
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,351
I'M SURE THE KIDNAPPING
WAS EXTREMELY TRAUMATIC.

240
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,394
HE PROBABLY JUST WENT
TO GO GET SOME R&amp;R...

241
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,273
SOME ROY RELAXATION.

242
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:47,568
NOT FUNNY. I SEE THAT NOW.

243
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,613
OH. SO THIS IS WHAT
LEGIT LOOKS LIKE.

244
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,368
JOHN: THAT'S RIGHT.
A BADGE AND A BUNKER.

245
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,869
NEVER THOUGHT I'D
SEE THE DAY.

246
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,329
JOHN: GOOD SEEING YOU.

247
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,081
I'M GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY
SEEING IT IN PERSON AGAIN.

248
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,541
-OOH!
-OH!

249
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,669
OH, I MISSED YOU
SO MUCH.

250
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,963
SORRY. I'M JUST A LITTLE
OVERLY EMOTIONAL THESE DAYS.

251
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,465
I MEAN, NOT OVERLY
EMOTIONAL,

252
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:09,966
NOT, LIKE, HEIGHTENED
OR ANYTHING.

253
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,259
BECAUSE WHY WOULD THAT BE?

254
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,635
MY HORMONES
ARE TOTALLY IN CHECK,

255
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,179
LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

256
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,390
NERVES OF STEEL.
YOU KNOW ME. I'M COOL.

257
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,765
OK.

258
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,267
THE ARSENAL. NICE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

259
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,019
YOU, TOO. THANKS
FOR KEEPING WATCH.

260
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,522
THE GLADES CAN USE
AS MANY HEROES
AS IT CAN GET.

261
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,689
WELCOME BACK.

262
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,149
ALL RIGHT.

263
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:27,775
HOW'S THEA?

264
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,277
SHE'S GOOD.

265
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,654
YEAH, I THINK SHE'S
FINALLY FOUND HER PASSION.

266
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,989
YOU'D BE REALLY
PROUD OF HER.

267
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,533
LAST I SPOKE WITH HER,
SHE SAYS

268
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,201
YOU WERE ZEROING IN ON
THE REMAINING LAZARUS PITS.

269
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,203
YEAH, WE FOUND TWO
ALREADY,

270
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,829
-WHICH WE DESTROYED.
-MM-HMM.

271
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,498
WE WERE CHECKING
THE REST WHEN WE
GOT YOUR CALL.

272
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,250
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

273
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,418
WHY'D YOU ASK ME
TO COME HERE

274
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,211
INSTEAD OF THEA?

275
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:51,049
STAR CITY'S NEW TERRORIST
IS OLIVER'S NEW SISTER.

276
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,592
WHAT?

277
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,010
YEAH.

278
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,012
DON'T YOU THINK THEA
WOULD WANT TO KNOW THAT?

279
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,138
-YEAH.
-YES.

280
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,723
AND I HAVE EVERY INTENTION
OF TELLING HER.

281
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,310
I JUST...THIS WOMAN'S
NAME IS EMIKO,

282
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,146
AND WE WANTED TO GET
HER INTO CUSTODY
BEFORE WE TOLD HER.

283
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,024
I FEEL LIKE SHE'S
FINALLY FREE OF HER
LIFE IN STAR CITY,

284
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,360
AND I...I DON'T WANT
TO HURT HER AGAIN

285
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,487
WITH A WOUND INFLICTED
ON OUR FAMILY

286
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,781
BY OUR FATHER.

287
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,493
FELICITY, VOICE-OVER:
ROY HAD BEEN TRAVELING THE WORLD

288
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,661
DOING SOME EXTREMELY NORMAL
SIGHTSEEING.

289
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,289
APPARENTLY HE WAS TOO BUSY
TO EVEN SEND A POSTCARD.

290
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,790
THEN WHY DID YOU
CALL HIM IN?

291
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,417
BECAUSE OF
THE THERMAL FOGGER.

292
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,085
THE WHAT?

293
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,129
THE SCARY BIO-WEAPON THAT
THE BAD GUYS NEEDED

294
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,506
TO SPREAD THE BACTERIA
THROUGH THE SUBWAY'S
HVAC SYSTEM.

295
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,674
THE DEVICE FOUND
ON THE SCENE.

296
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,676
THE DEVICE FOUND
AT THE SCENE, YES.

297
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,345
LOOK,

298
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,514
WE THOUGHT IT WAS
WEIRD THAT
THE CEO OF AERODYNE

299
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,308
WASN'T GOING TO LET
US PROTECT IT FROM
THE NINTH CIRCLE,

300
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,518
SO WE DID
SOME DIGGING.

301
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,686
AND FOUND THAT JASON TOTH
WAS DIRTY. OLIVER TOLD US.

302
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,106
WE KNEW GOOD OLD JASON
WOULD BE LOOKING FOR
MEMBERS OF THE TGA,

303
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,317
AND WE NEEDED SOMEONE
WITH A VIGILANTE-LIKE
SET OF SKILLS.

304
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,026
VOILA. ROY HARPER.

305
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,904
THE FACILITIES AT
AERODYNE ARE NO JOKE,

306
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,824
AND ROY IS INCREDIBLE
AT PARKOUR.

307
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,245
I'M IN.

308
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,580
OLIVER: REMEMBER, ROY,
THE FLOOR IS ARMED.

309
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,290
FELICITY: IF YOU TOUCH

FROM AERODYNE?

409
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,708
I CAME BACK TO HELP
PREVENT EMIKO

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,960

AFTER YOU FAILED
TO STOP HER?

414
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,305
I WENT BACK TO THE BUNKER
TO FIGURE OUT A NEW PLAN.

415
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,182
ACCORDING TO FELICITY,
ALL EMIKO HAD TO DO WAS

416
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,143
FILL THAT DEVICE
WITH SOME SORT OF
KILLER BACTERIA

YEAH. SO SHE RAN SOME
SORT OF ALGORITHM

420
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,278
AND CAME UP WITH A FEW
POSSIBLE PLACES.

HAPPENED AFTER YOU
LEFT FELICITY?

425

BUT SHE INSISTED.

426

MIGHT HAVE SHOWED UP.

429
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,889

430
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,975
JUST KEPT COMING.

431
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,495
I TRIED TO FIGHT BACK, BUT THERE
WERE JUST TOO MANY OF THEM.

432
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,168
THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER IS

433
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,170
I WAS TAKING A MACE
TO THE FACE

434
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,922
BEFORE EVERYTHING
WENT BLACK.

435
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,383
AND WHEN I CAME TO,

436
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,385
YOU ALL WERE
ON THE SCENE,

437

AND THE GUARDS, THEY
WERE ALREADY DEAD.

438
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,015
SO YOU HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

439
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,725
WHO MAY HAVE KILLED THEM.

440

00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,410
WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON?

445
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,163
I AM ON THE ONLY SIDE
THAT MATTERS...THE TRUTH.

446
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,541
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
STOP WASTING MY TIME

447
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,252
AND TELL ME
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

448
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,213
JOHN: I TOLD YOU,
ROY WAS UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN I FOUND HIM,

449
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,925
AND THAT WAS BEFORE
THE GUARDS FIRED
THEIR SIDEARMS.

450
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,218
SO YOU DON'T THINK
HE KILLED THEM.

451
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,721
I JUST DON'T SEE
HOW HE COULD HAVE.

452
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,139
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PROTECT HIM, JOHN.

00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,308

454

RIGHT, RIGHT.

YOU DO, ISN'T IT?

OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES
BEFORE YOUR OWN.

MIGHT DISCOVER

WORTH IT.

00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,120
BUT DEEP INSIDE, HE'S
A VERY GOOD MAN.

462
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,247
WELL, YOU'RE VERY QUICK
TO DEFEND ROY.

463
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,874
WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF?

464
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,459
WHY? ARE YOU ASKING ME
IF I KILLED THOSE GUARDS?

465
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,252
IT CERTAINLY
DOESN'T HELP

ON YOUR SLEEVE.

468
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,469
AFTER YOU ARRIVED.

469
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,889
WELL, THERE WERE TWO
POSSIBLE DISBURSEMENT SITES.

470
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,101
OLIVER HEADED FOR
THE VENTILATION ROOM.

471
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,271
AND RENE AND I HEADED
FOR THE VENTILATION SHAFT.

472
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,482
AND THAT'S WHEN WE
RAN INTO TROUBLE.

473
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:16,196

AHEAD ON THE RIGHT.

SHE'S MINE.
GO SECURE THE DEVICE.

00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,255
SO THAT'S WHEN YOU
AND RENE SPLIT UP.

479
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,717
RENE WAS RIGHT.
THE DEVICE WAS THE PRIORITY.

I WAS HEADED FOR
THE VENTILATION SHAFT,

481

AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND
ROY UNCONSCIOUS.

482
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,935
AND THIS WAS BEFORE
THE GUNSHOTS.

I RAN TOWARD THE SOURCE

AS FAST AS I COULD,
BUT I WAS TOO LATE.

BUT THEY WERE
ALREADY DEAD.

ON MY SLEEVE.

WHAT YOU SAW.

00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,108
WHEN I GOT TO THE BODIES...

00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,905

00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,005
I CUT IT.

GETTING AT, D.?

THE LONGER THEY
SIT IN HERE.

505

THE TRUTH HAS A WAY
OF COMING OUT.

506
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,186
THIS ISN'T MY FIRST TIME

507
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,354
BEING FALSELY ACCUSED
OF A CRIME...

509
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,650
TWO MEN ARE DEAD, RENE.

00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,360
NOW, WE KNOW TEAM ARROW
WAS ON-SITE

MEANS OUR TWO MAIN SUSPECTS

ARE EITHER HER OR...

ME?

514
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,369
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

515
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,788

WERE THINKING,

'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR ANY EXCUSE

EVERY REASON NOT TO.

TRUSTWORTHY.

523
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,469
WELL, NOW SHE ENDS UP

524
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,471
ON THE SCENE
OF AN ATTEMPTED
TERRORIST ATTACK

525
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,848
AND A DOUBLE HOMICIDE,
AND YOU WERE THERE, TOO.

526
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,643
AND YOU WHAT? YOU
THINK I HELPED HER?

527
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,394
I JUST WANT THE TRUTH, RENE.

528
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,772
TELL ME WHAT YOU WERE DOING
BEFORE THAT MISSION TONIGHT.

529
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,232
RENE: WE MANAGED
TO GET THE INFO

530
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,691
ON THE NINTH CIRCLE'S
TARGET

THANKS TO FELICITY'S
ALGORITHM.

532
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,196

THE CHEMICAL SIGNATURE
OF THE BIO-WEAPON

533
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,614
TO THE SUBWAY STATION.

534
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,908
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU
HEADED OFF.

535
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,952
YEAH. STRAIGHT AWAY.

536
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,749
YOU GOOD WITH ALL THIS?

537
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,919
I'LL BE BETTER
ONCE WE GET TO
THE SUBWAY AND STOP HER.

538
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,672
I KNOW THAT IT'S
GOING TO BE TOUGH
GOING UP AGAINST EMIKO.

539
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,591
YOU GUYS GOT
REALLY CLOSE, RENE.

540
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,343
IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY
AND GIVE ME A PEP TALK,
SAVE IT. I'M GOOD.

541
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,013
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU
A PEP TALK.

542
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,014
I WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT

543
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,098
IF YOU'RE GOING
OUT ON A MISSION,

544
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,766
YOU'RE DOING IT
WITH A CLEAR HEAD.

545
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,732
WHEN I FIRST MET EMIKO,

546
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,943
AVENGING
HER MOTHER'S DEATH

547
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,821
AND HELPING THE GLADES
WERE THE ONLY THINGS
THAT MATTERED TO HER.

548
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,198
RIGHT, EXCEPT SHE
WAS LYING.

549
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,950
THEN WHY DID SHE KILL
DANTE?

550
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,410
WHY'D SHE DO IT?

551
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,454
I MEAN, SHE TURNED ON
A MEMBER OF THE NINTH CIRCLE

552
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,622
FOR HER MOTHER.
THAT TELLS ME THAT

553
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,790
FAMILY
MEANS MORE TO HER.

554
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,960
FINE. IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT THAT SHE

555
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:02,340
COULD POTENTIALLY
KILL THOUSANDS...
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

556
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,593
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT SHE'S
STILL YOUR SISTER, MAN.

557
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,763
DOESN'T ANY PART OF YOU
THINK THAT MAYBE SHE'S
DOING ALL OF THIS

558
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,390
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOUR
FATHER DID TO HER,

559
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,268
THAT IF NOT
FOR HER UPBRINGING,

560
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,063
SHE'D BE FIGHTING WITH US
INSTEAD OF AGAINST US?

561
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,191
A BIG PART OF ME
THINKS ABOUT THAT...

562
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,817
ALL THE TIME.

563
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,486
AT A CERTAIN POINT,

FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

566
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,914
EMIKO MADE HER CHOICE.
I'VE MADE MINE.

567
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,709
YOU NEED TO MAKE YOURS.

568
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,802
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'M NOT LIKING ABOUT
YOUR STORY, RENE.

569
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,679
THE PART WHERE WE
SAVE THE CITY?

570
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,430
THE PART YOU'RE NOT
TELLING US.

571
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,267
EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU
TONIGHT IS THE TRUTH.

572
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,060
THEN WHY DID WE FIND
YOUR FINGERPRINTS

573
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,686
ON THE MURDER WEAPON.

WHAT WERE YOU
DOING WITH THAT
PIPE, RENE?

575
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,775
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

HARDER AND HARDER

577
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,487
JOHN AND I SPLIT UP.

579
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,950
I WENT AFTER EMIKO.

580
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,619
AND DID YOU
CATCH UP TO HER?

581
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,954
NO.

582
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,422

TOO LATE.

583
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,048
LET ME HELP YOU.

584
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,926
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
I SPARED YOU ONCE.

585
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,053
THIS TIME, I WON'T
BE SO GENEROUS.

586
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,596
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!

587
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,308
BECAUSE THE QUEENS TOOK
EVERYTHING FROM ME.

588
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,060
NOW IT'S MY TURN TO
TAKE EVERYTHING FROM THEM.

589
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,564
THIS ISN'T YOU.

AND THAT PROVES WHAT
EXACTLY?

594
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,949
THAT FINDING YOUR
MOTHER'S KILLER MEANS

MORE TO YOU
THAN THE NINTH CIRCLE.

RISK MURDERING
THEIR LEADER?

WHAT YOU'VE BECOME.

00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:25,433
IF I WOULD'VE KNOWN WHAT
WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

778
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,310
I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT ANYONE.

779
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,104
I KNOW...

780
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:32,816
BUT KEEPING THIS
INFORMATION FROM US,

781
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,234
IT JEOPARDIZED
ALL THE THINGS THAT

782
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,195
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING
FOR THIS YEAR.

783
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,280
I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO COVER FOR ME.

784
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,616
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO.

785
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,035
YOU NEVER HAVE
TO ASK ME.

786
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,789
EVER.

787
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,627
FELICITY: GUYS?

788
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,587
FELICITY
HAS SOMETHING.

789
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,759
I EXPANDED MY SEARCH
PARAMETERS, AND PRESTO.

790
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,260
FACIAL RECOGNITION
PUTS EMIKO

791
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,554
IN AN ABANDONED BUILDING

792
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,805
A FEW MILES OUTSIDE
OF STAR CITY.

793
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,057
ANY BACKGROUND ON
THE BUILDING?

794
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,558
I MEAN, YOU NAME IT,
IT'S BEEN IT.

795
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,851
HOSPITAL,
SHIPPING WAREHOUSE,

796
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:08,935
MANUFACTURING PLANT.

797
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,269
I MEAN,
IT'S HAD MORE OWNERS

798
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,104
THAN
A "FORTUNE" 500 COMPANY.

799
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,022
WHICH MEANS IT COULD BE

800
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,981
A COVER FOR SOMETHING.

801
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,440
YEAH, SOMETHING
BEING

802
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,608
THE NINTH
CIRCLE'S
HEADQUARTERS

803
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,110
HERE
IN STAR CITY.

804
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,904
EMIKO'S THERE, WHICH IS
ALL THAT MATTERS TO US.

805
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,073
WE'RE GOING AFTER HER
AS A TEAM.

806
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,533
ARE YOU SURE?

807
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,618
RENE: WE GOT
YOUR BACK.

808
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,250
OH, HEY, DINAH! THANK
YOU FOR WIPING THAT
SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE.

809
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,252
I COULD NOT GET THERE
BEFORE THE COPS DID.

810
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,421
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

811
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,930
NO.

812
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,064
LET'S GO WIDE.

813
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,523
ARSENAL, ON MY 6.

814
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,693
OVERWATCH,
ANY HEAT SIGNATURES?

815
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,237
FELICITY:
NO. NOT EVEN YOURS.

816
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,072
THERMAL IMAGING
CAN'T PENETRATE

817
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,364
THROUGH THOSE WALLS.

818
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,118
[OPENS COMMS]

819
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,535
I HAVE EYES ON HER.

820
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,287
JOHN:
MOVING TO INTERCEPT.

821
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,417
JOHN: OLIVER, CONFIRM
YOUR LOCATION.

822
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,469
THIS IS OVER.

823
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,138
IS IT?

824
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,722
RIGHT NOW,
SERGEANT BINGSLEY

825
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,390
IS RECEIVING
AN ANONYMOUS GIFT

826
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,767
DELIVERED TO HIS OFFICE:

827
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,351
THE MISSING
SECURITY FOOTAGE

828
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,020
FROM THE METRO STATION.

829
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,398
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MADE IT DISAPPEAR?

830
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,276
YOU SET US UP.

831
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,618
WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

832
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,954
FOR YOU TO SUFFER
THE WAY I SUFFERED.

833
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,372
YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE
GONNA DIE IN THERE.

834
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,751
AND I WILL BE OUT THERE
DESTROYING YOUR LEGACY.

835
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,129
YOU'LL DIE A VILLAIN

836
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,214
JUST LIKE
OUR FATHER DID,

837
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,592
AND I WILL BE THE CAUSE
OF BOTH OF YOUR DEATHS.

838
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,845
AND JUSTICE WILL FINALLY
BE SERVED.

839
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,687
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

840
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,396
I HAD THE CHANCE

841
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,192
TO WARN OUR FATHER
ABOUT THE "GAMBIT."

842
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,820
IT WAS RIGGED
TO EXPLODE,

843
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,157
AND I KNEW
ABOUT IT.

844
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,574
I LET OUR FATHER
DIE BECAUSE HE

845
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,535
DIDN'T DESERVE
TO LIVE.

846
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,497
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

847
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,126
BYE, BROTHER.

848
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,227
FELICITY: OLIVER,
DO YOU READ ME?

849
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,645
DOES ANYBODY COPY?

850
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:01,233
OLIVER, COME IN.

851
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,235
JOHN?

852
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,321
JOHN, COME IN!
OLIVER?

853
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,948
COME IN, PLEASE!

854
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,283
COME IN!

855
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,895
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
