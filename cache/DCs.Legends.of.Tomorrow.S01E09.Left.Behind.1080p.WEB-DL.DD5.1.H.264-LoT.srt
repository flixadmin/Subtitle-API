It was like those two years
never happened.

forwards with her life--

451
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,562
She moved backwards?

452
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,798
- She said she wanted to go
to a place where she belonged.

453
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,335
What's the one place in 1958
she already called home?

- The league of assassins.

455

They're gonna toss you aside.

- Like you tossed me aside?

632

What matters, mick,
is your next move.

Well, I do hope your request
for an audience

643
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,908
Is not an attempt to justify
your trespass here.

644
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,777
- Most certainly not.

645
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,013
But it would be remiss of me
if I didn't use this opportunity

646

To reiterate that sara

To all of us.

she has chosen to remain here.

651

We will indeed honor it.

- Well, thank you.

654
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:52,036
But your deaths will make
that concession irrelevant.

655
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,104
- Well, according to my
understanding of league law,

656
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:57,408
The whole death thing
can be avoided,

Should we prevail at trial.
