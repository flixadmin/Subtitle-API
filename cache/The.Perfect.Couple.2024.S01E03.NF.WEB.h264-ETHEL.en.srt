00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,583
and we've already talked about...

15
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,083
Okay, give them my phone number.
I can give them my credit card.

16
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,416
Okay, bye.

17
00:00:58,958 --> 00:00:59,958
Oh, fuck me.

18
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,958
Oh! Hello. Sorry about that.

19
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,666
It's just my super-cool stepdad.

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,375
He just can't stop making friends
everywhere he goes.

21
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,791
Uh, also... Hi.

22
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,500
I'm Merritt. We haven't met yet.
I'm Amelia's friend.

23
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:18,541
Hi, Merritt, Amelia's friend.
I'm, uh, Tag, Benji's dad.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,083
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,833
-"Merritt"?
-Yeah.

26
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,666
Like the parkway.

27
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,708
Yeah, like the parkway.

28
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,250
It's nice.

29
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,375
-I mean I like the parkway.
-Yeah.

30
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,125
I should probably go back up there.

31
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,000
It was nice to meet you, Merritt.

32
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,625
Nice to meet you too, Benji's dad.

33
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,166
How did you know she was pregnant?
Did she tell you that last night too?

34
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,708
And she was sure it was his?

35
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,000
Tag was the only guy she was seeing.

36
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,958
Yeah, but you didn't even know
she was seeing him until last night.

37
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,750
Look, I know she comes off
like she's this...

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,291
party girl or whatever.

39
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,208
But the truth is,
she never really sleeps with anyone.

40
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,250
I mean, guys are always
falling all over her,

41
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:47,083
but she believes that if you sleep
with someone, you give away your power.

42
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,583
That's why I wanted to come here. I...

43
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,166
It's a big deal that she slept with him.

44
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,625
She must have
really been in love with him.

45
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,625
Okay.

46
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,916
Okay.

47
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,041
Where the fuck is it?

48
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:58,958
Hey.

49
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,166
Hey.

50
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,041
You okay? Where have you been?

51
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,208
Yeah, sorry. I... I went for a walk.

52
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,541
I should have texted.

53
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,416
That's okay.

54
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,458
It's, uh, it's pretty late.
Should we go to bed?

55
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,333
Yeah.

-You scared me.
-I heard someone walking around.

00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,958
-Are you all right?
-I was just, um...

68
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,791
-I was just thirsty.
-Thirsty?

69
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,291
Don't you have a carafe by your bed?

70
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,916
I do. I forgot.

71
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,083
Are you sure there wasn't something else
you were looking for? Because...

72
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,125
I'd hate you to be sneaking around.

73
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,250
I mean, if you want something, just ask.

74
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,083
- I will.
- Good.

75
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,958
You know, Benji's very important to me.

76
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,750
We're very close.

77
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,333
So I want you to be comfortable here
with all of us.

78
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,291
But don't ever go into Tag's office again.
Do you understand me?

79
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,083
-It was a mistake.
-Hmm.

80
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,750
-All right. Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

81
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,208
Mr. Tag, your green juice.

82
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,416
Thank you, Go Go.

83
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,583
How's the follow-up care going?

84
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,916
Almost done.

85
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
You know how I feel about that stuff.

86
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,458
Whenever you're ready.

87
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,833
Oh, Mr. Tag!

88
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,541
<i>People Magazine</i>
will be here this afternoon

89
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,625
and then we have
my book launch on Tuesday.

90
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,958
And the thing
I'm most worried about right now

91
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,583
is everyone having to stand in a line,
in the heat.

92
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,583
We'll pass chilled rosé and...
And pre-signed copies. No line.

93
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,750
-Do we have chilled rosé?
-Oh, of course we have chilled rosé.

94
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,625
Good morning, Amelia. How are you?

95
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,416
Okay.

96
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,666
The wedding caterers
forgot to cancel the brunch, so...

97
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,625
I'm not really hungry.

98
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,166
No?

99
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,708
There's juice there
if you're still thirsty.

100
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,916
Thank you.

101
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,583
Greer, are you sure
you don't want to postpone?

102
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,291
-With everything that's going on...
-Yeah.

103
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,500
Of course I want to postpone,
but we can't.

104
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,208
-Why not?
-We have people flying in from New York,

105
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,458
from London,
and then we would have to explain why.

106
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,375
And I don't think any of us
want to explain any of that right now.

107
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,333
-No.
-And that's not what we need. Is it?

108
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,458
Uh...

109
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:05,375
And there is going to be an interview
in the garden this afternoon, darling.

110
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,791
-Yes, yes, of course.
-Good.

111
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,583
And I apologize now,

112
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:14,166
but they're going to want
a family photo in the afternoon.

113
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,666
-They want a photo?
-Yeah.

114
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,083
Of course, we have to do a family photo,
right, Roger?

115
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,541
- They'll expect it. It's got to be done.
- You've got to be kidding me.

116
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,000
- We have the hydrangeas out.
- Yeah.

117
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,625
Please wear something lovely.

118
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,333
Hmm. Where's Shooter, by the way?

119
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,416
Has anyone seen him?

120
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,250
Uh, I don't know. Asleep, maybe?

121
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,541
- Can you wake him up, please?
- Yep.

122
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,625
Hey!

123
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,375
I want a lawyer!

124
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,916

And calling me "sir" doesn't excuse
the fact that you didn't have the decency

161
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,750
to come to my front door.

162
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,708
I catch you in here again,
I'll arrest you.

163
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,333
I understand, sir.

164
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,958
Do something to your hand?

165
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,666
Ow!

166
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:16,916
Fuck!

167
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,166
Will.

168
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,875
Will! What happened?

169
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,208
Hey! It's okay. It's okay.

170
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,875
No, it's nothing.

171
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,875
Get out.

172
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,500
And this time, use the door.

173
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,750
When I get home, we're gonna have a talk.

174
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,750
Will's a little weirdo.

175
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,416
He was a sweetheart as a kid, but then,
I don't know, something happened.

176
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,958
He shut down.

177
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,916
Started spending all of his time
in his room with the door closed.

178
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:11,708
I know he's 13 or 17 or whatever,
but no one jerks off that much.

179
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:16,666
Mr. William loves my pierogies.

180
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:22,125
And Mrs. Greer tried to make
a pierogi for him when I had cancer.

181
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,875
Hmm.

182
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,583
He looked skinnier than me
when I got back.

183
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,125
Aw.

184
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:31,958
Hey.

185
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,791
For stretch marks.

186
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:05,041
It's got this Madura tallow in it
that's banned by the FDA,

187
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,500
but my sorority sister gets it for me

188
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,583
from her Asian mother-in-law
who's a cosmetics magnate.

189
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,166
I make it in my Vitamix.
No parabens, and it's gluten-free.

190
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Cool.

191
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,416
The key to this family
is to just stay on the periphery...

192
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,041
where it's safe.

193
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,208
That's what I do.

194
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,333
What do you mean?

195
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,208
If something bad happened,

196
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,250
and I'm not saying that it did,
because that would be insane...

197
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,875
but if there's something more to it,

198
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,291
I would leave that
to the police to figure out.

199
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,250
Don't get caught in Greer's crosshairs.
It's not worth it.

200
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,416
Has she ever asked you to sign an NDA?

201
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,458
Well, if she has,
I probably shouldn't say, right?

202
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,375
That's kind of the whole point of an NDA.

203
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,000
It's not that big of a deal.

204
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I signed one in the beginning when I first
started dating Thomas, five years ago.

205
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,750
After the whole Mae thing.

206
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,833
Mae thing?

207
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,666
I assumed you knew.

208
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,250
Well, now you have to tell me.

209
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,625
Mae Pratt. She was Will's French tutor.

210
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,250
She worked here one summer,
and then she didn't.

211
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,958
"Disappeared under the cover of night"
kind of thing.

212
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,791
I always got the feeling something bad
happened, but I don't know what.

213
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,666
-Will was devastated.
-That's awful.

214
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,458
I'm surprised Benji never told you.

215
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,166
They were close.

216
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,291
I think she went to Deerfield.

217
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,041
But, duh, no wonder you're paranoid
if she asked you to sign an NDA.

218
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,708
But I promise you'll get used to it.

219
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,958
And... I am sorry about Merritt.

220
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,750
I know that I wasn't always,
like, the most welcoming,

221
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,041
but she was a really cool girl.

222
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,625
Thank you.

223
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,458
How come you never told me
about Mae Pratt?

224
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,625
Who, uh...

225
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,000
-Who told you about that?
-Was she a friend of yours?

226
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,458
She went to school with you or something?

227
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:09,625
She needed a summer job,
so she stayed here and taught Will French.

228
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,291
And she what, she just

229
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,291
left suddenly?

230
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,416
Yeah.

231
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,583
Didn't say good-bye.

232
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,666
It was weird.

233
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,833
Why are you asking me about this?

234
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,041
I just wondered
why you never mentioned it.

235
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,958
Because it was years ago. Why would I?

236
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,541
Apparently your mom
had everyone sign NDAs then too.

237
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,333
Jesus.

238
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,875
Amelia, look, I've told you.

239
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,583
This is how they do things.

240
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,250
Yeah?

241
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:56,375
This is how they've always done things,
so just leave it alone.

242
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,875
<i>People Magazine</i> is here.

243
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,291
My mom will be expecting us.

244
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,250
<i>Absolutely.</i>

245
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,791
That and agreeing with
each other as much as you possibly can.

246
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,708
I can see that.

247
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,958
Do you think that it requires
a kind of unconditional love

248
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,666
to stay married 29 years?

249
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,791
Well, I mean...

250
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,875
Unconditional love?

251
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,041
I think it's more just,

252
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,541
if one of us makes a mistake,
big or small,

253
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,708
then we're there to protect them.

254
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,291
-So that's it?
-What she said.

255
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,041
It's like that for the whole family,
isn't it, really?

256
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,083
- I mean, we have teamwork.
- Yes.

257
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,500
-Teamwork. Absolutely.
-Absolutely.

258
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,583
I mean, after,
I know it doesn't sound all...

259
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,875
Finish each other's sentences.

260
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,166
-That's right.
-Hear that?

261
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,958
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

262
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,041
Case in point.

263
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,166
I just got to think
that it's more than just teamwork.

264
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,666
Well, that and a healthy sex life.
I think that's... That's really important.

265
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,666
Good to know. Good to know.

266
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,041
Um...

267
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,625
-Well, let's talk about the book. Right?
-Of course. That's what we're here for.

268
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,833
-29th Dash and Dolly. That's...
-Dash and Dolly.

269
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,166
Do you just not sleep?

270
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,791
-She is prolific.
-I've always written.

271
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,583
I know she looks like a thoroughbred,
but total workhorse. Clydesdale.

272
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,291
-This one is up at dawn.
-Okay. Okay.

273
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:42,250
-I think that's enough.
-At dawn, making notes in her little pad

274
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:47,458
and feeding inbred children
and taking care of...

275
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,375
-Sorry, I'm not talking about our family.
-Just ignore him now.

276
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,458
-You've really revved him up.
-I'm sorry.

277
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,875
He's not gonna stop.

278
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:59,375
<i>♪ Because the greatest love of all... ♪</i>

279
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,833
And now the karaoke. All right. All right.

280
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,583
<i>♪ I found the... ♪</i>

281
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,458
That's great. It's wonderful.

282
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,291
-No, it is.
-Oh, it's a party.

283
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,791
And how did Dolly first come to you?

284
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,500
Um... how did she come to me?

285
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,041
Uh...

286
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,833
I don't... I don't actually remember.

287
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,916
I had an Agatha Christie obsession,
didn't I?

288
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,833
Yes.

289
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:25,500
I mean, I had inspiration,
I think, with some wealthy aunts.

290
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,458
-Oh. Quite a few wealthy aunts.
-And...

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,166
- Greer, you mentioned aunts?
- Yes.

292
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,500
You don't normally talk about your family.

293
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,458
No.

294
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,166
That's because I went to boarding school
when I was five.

295
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,083
As you do.

296
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,875
Um, but I do remember...

297
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,291
I remember when Dash Hardaway came to me.

298
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,416
And it was in the form of this

299
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,000
gorgeous man.

300
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,291
Oh, crap.

301
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,166
-Wasn't supposed to start until 4:00.
-Did you feel that?

302
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,708
- Oh, no.
- Right.

303
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,291
-Um...
-"The dearest events are summer rain."

304
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,708
Just wait until
you smell the grass afterwards.

305
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,250
-Better run.
-Only a few questions.

306
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:10,291
Now, we're going to have to do the photos
indoors in our own house,

307
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,166
and the whole reason to do it outside here

308
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,250
was because of the fucking hydrangeas.

309
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,333
And what was that all about, Tag?
Honestly.

310
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,166
-What was what all about?
-You know exactly what I'm talking about,

311
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,208
all that over-the-top romantic drivel.

312
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,916
I don't think, um...

313
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,333
I'm capable of saying anything today
that would pass muster with you.

314
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:38,708
What you're capable of and not capable of
seems to be ever-expanding, doesn't it?

315
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,000
I could say the same about you.

316
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,208
A thoroughbred?

317
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:53,333
I'd like to know
what possessed your pot-filled brain

318
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,083
to think you could liken me
to a fucking horse.

319
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,333
Just doing my part, darling.

320
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,833
Seems like you've been doing your part
just a little too much.

321
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,041
Might be enough now.

322
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,541
Is that what this is about?

323
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,625
Huh?

324
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,875
<i>People Magazine</i> is here,

325
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,916
and suddenly you've found
some fake fucking morality?

326
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,708
Suddenly we're the perfect family?

327
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,500
Is that... Is that it, Greer?
Is that what you want?

328
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,666
-Come on. Just get dressed.
-Do you even know what you want?

329
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:27,791
Because I do.

330
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,625
It's you.

331
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,166
That's all I've ever wanted.

332
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,333
That's my fucking sickness.

333
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,833
I've done everything I can to cure it,
but I can't!

334
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,750
Keep your voice down!

335
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,750
Don't you ever just want to say "fuck it"?
Get away from all of this bullshit,

336
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,083
all these lies?

337
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,375
Get on a fucking plane and go
somewhere beautiful? Just you and me.

338
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:55,750
You know the interesting thing
about guilt, Tag? It's not transferable.

339
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,625
I love you.

340
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,500
Just get dressed.

341
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,708
Oh, God... Oh!

342
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:28,416
Hi. Um...

343
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,000
You're not dressed.

344
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,875
Come on.
Are you going to be in the family photo?

345
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,750
-If you want me to.
-If I want...

346
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,166
Uh... Come on, do you want?

347
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,791
No, I don't think so.

348
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,541
I think it would mean a lot to Benji

349
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,375
to know that you gave a shit
about participating in his family.

350
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:51,041
-I give a shit.
-Really? Do you?

351
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,500
-You don't act like you do.
-I'm sorry you feel that way.

352
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,333
You don't act like you're in love.

353
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,625
Benji deserves to be loved, Amelia.

354
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,958
He does. I agree with you.

355
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,833
I just have a different idea
of what love looks like.

356
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,375
Do you mean how Tag loves you?

357
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,416
Tag adores me.

358
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,291
Now please go and put on
something presentable, would you?

359
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:22,250
Something that...

360
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,208
I know you don't care, but I do.

361
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:27,875
All right.

362
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,708
Happy families.

363
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,083
Let's go.

364
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,500
- Hey.
- Detective.

365
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,916
All these missed calls
are from the same number

366
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,458
going back a couple of weeks.

367
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,375
She never picked up.

368
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,000
Any word from the ME?

369
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,291
Um...

370
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,750
They're doing a blood test,

371
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:13,333
but depending on how far along she was,
it might not even be detectable yet.

372
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:15,958
Oh, and we heard
from Shooter Dival's lawyer.

373
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,166
They know
we don't have enough to keep him.

374
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,208
And?

375
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,250
-He's pulling him.
-Of course.

376
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:25,708
Never said a fucking word,
and now we don't have enough to keep him.

377
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:27,375
-Can I have a look at it?
-Yeah.

378
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:30,791
Oh, yeah.

379
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,375
Oh, yeah, you're right.
She was ignoring somebody.

380
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:36,208
Friday, day of the murder.

381
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:40,666
This number calls her at 9:05 a.m.,
9:15, 10:30, 10:35...

382
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,416
I wonder if they left any messages.

383
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,625
Let's check it out.

384
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,333
Let's see.

385
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:57,375
<i>Hi. Uh, it's pretty obvious by now</i>

386
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,583
<i>you don't want to talk about this.</i>

387
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:04,125
<i>And I promise I'm not going to bring it up
when you get here.</i>

388
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,416
<i>I'm not going to act weird. I just...</i>

389
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,458
<i>My biggest concern is Amelia getting hurt,</i>

390
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,333
<i>'cause this would kill her.</i>

391
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,541
<i>It would break her heart.</i>

392
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,083
<i>So I'm begging you, please,</i>

393
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,833
<i>just don't let her find out
until after tomorrow.</i>

394
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,583
Is that the groom calling the victim?

395
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,416
- Then, as far forward as you can.
- Will, you'll get blood on my suit.

396
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,875
- She just told me to...
- See if Amelia's on her way.

397
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,958
-Yeah...
-She told me to go closer to you.

398
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:06,958
We've been waiting.
We don't want to keep them.

399
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,541
She'll be here in a minute.

400
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,958
No, no, no, no.
It's been five minutes.

401
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,875
Okay, yeah, sure. Amelia!

402
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,041
- Shut up.
- Uh, let's look up here.

403
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,291
Oh! Here she is.

404
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,750
Oh!

405
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:37,125
- And you look gorgeous. Gorgeous!
- Do you want me to sit here?

406
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:38,583
- Yes.
- Yeah, let's do that.

407
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,000
- Okay.
- Yeah.

408
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,791
- Thank you.
- You all look gorgeous.

409
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,041
- She just told me...
- Just stop.

410
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,833
- You have to have sex to get Hep C.
- Look up here. Big smiles.

411
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:53,625
Beautiful. One, two, three.

412
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,083
- She's just going to snap a few.
- How's this? Good?

413
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,333
- Another great family photo.
- I had an idea.

414
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:04,083
I was thinking... I don't know if it's...
We have Amelia's parents here.

415
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,500
- Yes. Please.
- For the inside.

416
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:10,875
And we have, um, a family friend
who would love to be in the photo.

417
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,625
-Okay. I'll go get them.
-Gosia, can you go get Isabel?

418
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,000
This'll be interesting.

419
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,333
- The spot's a little bit...
- Yes.

420
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:20,166
-Just something different.
-Tag and Greer in the middle.

421
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,916
- Divine.
- Hey.

422
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,916
- Hello.
- Where would you be?

423
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,291
Your own cover.

424
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:27,666
-You're...
-I know.

425
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,500
- ...going to get married.
- We are.

426
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,916
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,125
It's nice,
but we don't need to be in there.

428
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,458
Let's do the photo.

429
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,458
-Don't need to be in the pictures.
-Just get in.

430
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,958
- No, we want you.
- It's okay.

431
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,166
Sit down, please.

432
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,458
-That sounds good. The couple.
-Yeah, right?

433
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,708
- This is Karen.
- Hi, Karen.

434
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:46,250
Sit down.
We'd love to have you both in the photo.

435
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:48,333
This is amazing!

436
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,875
-You okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

437
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:52,166
- We are the perfect family.
- Will...

438
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,291
Everyone. One, two, three.

439
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,916
You all look amazing.
You must be so proud.

440
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,500
Let's get a couple more.

441
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,500
Where's Shooter?

442
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,666
-Uh, I haven't seen him all day.
-It'd be nice to have him in the photo.

443
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,125
I hear he's finally been adopted
by someone else.

444
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,666
We can take this picture
without Shooter, darling.

445
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,791
Shooter and Greer?
Yeah. They're weirdly close.

446
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,958
And Mrs. Greer
has a special spot for Shooter.

447
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:23,583
She always says, "He's like a son to me."

448
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:30,791
I wouldn't behave this way with my son.

449
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:33,041
Whatever. Can't all have a dead mom.

450
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:40,125
All right, Mr. Dival, you're free to go,
but you cannot leave the island.

451
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:43,541
All right? None of you
can leave the island. Understood?

452
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,458
Yeah.

453
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:47,625
You got a good lawyer, but we still
believe you're hiding something,

454
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,666
so we're gonna keep a close eye on you.

455
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,666
Come on. Let's go.

456
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,041
- This way.
- Thank you.

457
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,375
Mmm!

458
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:09,708
Hell, yeah.

459
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,208
You've done it again.

460
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,541
- Hello?
- Uh, yeah, back here.

461
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,666
Hi. Your hedges need a haircut.

462
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,875
Yeah. Well, I'll be sure
to inform my gardener.

463
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,041
Ah!

464
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,458
Oh! Something smells good!

465
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:32,416
Stop & Shop marinara. I add real garlic.

466
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,500
Well, that's impressive.

467
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,916
I just lie and tell my kids
the frozen garlic bread's homemade.

468
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,208
Well, listen, anything, uh,
you have to preheat the oven for

469
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,708
counts as home cooking.

470
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:46,041
Oh!

471
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:49,791
No. No, thank you. I am still feeling
the plastic cup of Yellow Tail

472
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,833
I just had with Isabel Nallet
at the Sand Dollar.

473
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:55,041
Oh, and was it worth it?

474
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:58,500
Jeez. You know I can only understand
half of what that woman says.

475
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,541
But apparently
the Winbury money is all tied up in trust.

476
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,375
So that's why Greer churns out
a book or two a year.

477
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,875
She's paying for everything:

478
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,708
schools, cars,
the penthouse on Park, all of it.

479
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:12,625
Can't touch it.

480
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:15,583
Tag gets some money to invest,
but he's never worked a day in his life.

481
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,875
Yeah, well, no wonder Tag is such a...

482
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:20,666
Prick.

483
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,125
No, no, I wasn't gonna say that.
I was gonna say "great guy."

484
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,375
I mean,
the boys get their money down the line,

485
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,500
but Greer doesn't want them
to turn out like Tag.

486
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,958
I mean, it's too late for Thomas, clearly.

487
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,791
But she said Benji had some issues
when he was a teenager.

488
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,833
Got into fights,
got kicked out, had to switch schools.

489
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,916
Yeah.

490
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,666
-He's hard to read.
-Yeah.

491
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:46,708
And Will...

492
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:52,250
I mean, he's very anxious,
nervous kid, tightly wound,

493
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,041
and he doesn't get along with Tag at all.

494
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,708
Chloe, come here. Come here.

495
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,500
I want you to meet my daughter.

496
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,000
This is Detective Henry.

497
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,333
Hey.

498
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,041
"Hey"?

499
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:13,083
I like her. She seems nice.

500
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:20,916
-Quality door slam. I like her. Yep.
-Yeah.

501
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,833
-Never get used to that sound.
-No?

502
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,541
No, but it happens all the time.

503
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,833
Does it?
Never at my house.

504
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,291
What is that?

505
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,625
- Great.
- Going to start with Burgundy?

506
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,416
I don't know.
Does it taste like moldy castle?

507
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,708
Bread. If you want it.

508
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:45,208
Oh, Shooter? Is that you... Ah...

509
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,208
-You made it.
-Yeah.

510
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,583
The prodigal son returns.

511
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,041
Please.

512
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,458
Where have you been, dude?

513
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:54,208
Police station.

514
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,750
Uh, it's okay. They just wanted to talk.

515
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:57,833
It'll be fine.

516
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,833
Let me get the rest of the food.

517
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,708
- Greer?
- It's, um...

518
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:09,000
-What happened?
-I didn't say anything about the money.

519
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,375
- I swear.
- Good.

520
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,958
Should I be worried?

521
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:17,833
No. Gosia, that looks so delicious!

522
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:20,875
All right,
I think we all need some comfort food.

523
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,583
I prefer comfort drink.

524
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,833
Of course.

525
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:30,291
Gosia, you are a magician.

526
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:34,333
This is extraordinary. I don't know
what we would do without you. Bravo.

527
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,416
Hear, hear!

528
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,666
Yes. Thank you, Gosia.

529
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:41,166
Are you okay?

530
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,208
Bon appétit!

531
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,458
Mmm. <i>Oui!</i>

532
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:52,083
So, Isabel, how are you,
uh, liking the hotel?

533
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:55,541
-Oh, it's hideous. It's hideous.
-Oh!

534
00:34:55,625 --> 00:35:00,166
They serve wine in little plastic bottles.

535
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,708
Ooh.

536
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,375
That's better than none at all.

537
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,250
Yes, of course.

538
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,625
All the magazines are
about Nantucket. I am on Nantucket.

539
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,666
I should have bought a book
at the airport,

540
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:19,250
but I did not anticipate
so much <i>comment dit-on...</i>

541
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,750
-Downtime.
-Yeah. Downtime.

542
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,791
You were expecting more activity?

543
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,666
When Tom and I went to Parrot Cay
last month, I bought <i>Death in Greenwich,</i>

544
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,833
and I read it for the third time.
It never gets old.

545
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,875
Tom.

546
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,958
My books at the airport.
It's torture.

547
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,458
I know. Awful.

548
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,833
Mmm-hmm.
But it does make up 30% of my sales.

549
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,833
Exactly. You have to play the game.

550
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:45,541
Even though I do feel like
I'm churning them out like Doritos.

551
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,708
- People love Doritos.
- They do.

552
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,833
-I love Doritos.
-She does.

553
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,875
No, I mean, I did,
when I could still taste them.

554
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,833
You're right, Karen.
I love Doritos, too, once in a while.

555
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:58,833
She does.

556
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:02,583
Karen and I ate Fritos and Franzia
every night of our honeymoon

557
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:06,000
from this great little place
on the sand. It was terrific.

558
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,000
Heaven.

559
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,291
- Lovely!
- Sounds like it.

560
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,583
Why do you ask people to sign NDAs?

561
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:16,583
Pardon?

562
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,666
Why do you ask people
to sign legal documents

563
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,791
promising they won't talk about
what goes on here?

564
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,000
- We talked about this.
- It's all right.

565
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,375
It's a lot to get used to.

566
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,958
One of the reasons that we...

567
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,416
What happened to Mae Pratt?

568
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,208
Now, that is a good question.

569
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,000
Benji, what is she talking about?

570
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,333
-Mae Pratt?
-I don't know.

571
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:37,250
Honey.

572
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,208
What happened to her?

573
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,291
Amelia.

574
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:46,250
Well, if her disappearance
had nothing to do with anyone,

575
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,333
why ask people to sign NDAs?

576
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:51,500
-Yeah, that's so weird. Why...
-Why can't anyone talk about it?

577
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:52,416
Stop.

578
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,083
Benji, would you please ask your fiancée
to stop talking?

579
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,666
-Who are you protecting?
-Who am I protecting?

580
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,541
Okay, I think, um,
worn this subject out, frankly.

581
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,125
Uh, who is Mae Pratt?

582
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,666
Apparently not.

583
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,750
Yeah, Dad. Who is Mae Pratt?

584
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,541
Fuck off, Tom.

585
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:17,208
What... What's going on?
What are you talking about?

586
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,666
Nothing. It's all right, Will.

587
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,708
-Dad was fucking her, Will.
-Tom!

588
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,875
Thomas, why would you say
something like that?!

589
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,166
Because it's the truth.

590
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,791
Because your son
is an insecure little prick, that's why.

591
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,250
Would you mind not smoking
at the table, please?

592
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,500
I'm sorry, darling.

593
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,666
Dad... Dad was fucking who?

594
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,875
Mae, for one.

595
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:41,625
- He's had too much to drink.
- Oh, my God.

596
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:44,291
- That's not true.
- Don't listen to a word he's saying.

597
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:48,333
-That's not true.
-It <i>is</i> true!

598
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,791
And when Dad broke it off with her...

599
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,500
-You've had too much to drink.
-...she tried to kill herself, Mom.

600
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:54,666
-What are...
-Remember?

601
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,500
So Mom and Dad
threw their huge dicks on the table...

602
00:37:58,583 --> 00:37:59,416
Tom.

603
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,583
...and made a financial settlement
so that they wouldn't go to court.

604
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:05,833
Right?

605
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:10,041
-Okay.
-And that's why you never saw her again.

606
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,458
He doesn't know
what he's talking about, William.

607
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:18,458
You told me she was... she quit.
That's what you said.

608
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,333
She did. Yes.

609
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,958
I don't fucking... I don't buy it
for a second, actually.

610
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:31,916
Fuck you. Fuck all of you.
Fuck you, especially! Asshole.

611
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,291
Hmm.

612
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,333
Hmm.

613
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:51,666
I do love Chablis.

614
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,916
I mean, I think I prefer Italian whites,
but... Whatever.

615
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,208
A Chablis is a Chardonnay,

616
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:02,250
but a Chardonnay
is not necessarily a Chablis, right?

617
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:08,333
Are you going to go
and see if he's all right?

618
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,416
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.
I wouldn't worry about it.

619
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,583
Go and check on your son, Tag!

620
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:16,291
-Like, do something for once!
-Yes, of course. Here I go. On my way.

621
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,958
How is your Chablis?

622
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,458
Actually, Abby, is it...

623
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,541
I'm not having any.

624
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,208
Oh! You're not drinking.
Of course. You're pregnant.

625
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:33,625
But I do... I do recall that I like it.

626
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,000
It really doesn't matter.

627
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,750
It's disgusting.
No, really disgusting.

628
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:42,708
<i>Oui.</i>

629
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:45,750
Yes, it's disgusting.

630
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,583
Excuse me, everyone.

631
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,166
I really had no idea.

632
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,583
So, uh, what's your favorite kind
of Doritos?

633
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,208
When you could still taste.

634
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:07,333
-Cool Ranch.
-Hmm.

635
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:22,166
Okay. I am going to call
about those tests one more time.

636
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,916
Look here. That definitely
does not look like cocktail banter.

637
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,916
No. He is all over her Instagram.

638
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I mean, he has liked every single post
this entire year.

639
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:39,125
I think I counted, like,
16 fire emojis in June alone.

640
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,250
-And that means?
-He thinks she's hot.

641
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,833
Yeah, this is Detective Henry.
I'm just calling to...

642
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:46,583
Right.

643
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,458
Okay. Thank you.

644
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:53,250
Uh, she was definitely pregnant.

645
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,041
The prints on the oyster shucking knife,
Will Winbury.

646
00:40:56,583 --> 00:41:00,750
The blood in the sand,
Merritt Monaco and Will Winbury.

647
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,333
Did you find him?

648
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,166
-Not yet.
-Were you even looking for him?

649
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,875
-Sweetheart, I'm sure he's fine.
-Will!

650
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:28,666
-God. He's devastated by this.
-Honey, I'm sure he's fine.

651
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,208
You don't know him like I do.

652
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:34,625
I know I don't know him like you do,
but I know that he's probably fine.

653
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:38,666
And if anything happens to him,
I will never fucking forgive you.

654
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,708
Sweetheart, can we not...

655
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,541
Shut the fuck up and find our son.

656
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,041
Fucking shoes.

657
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,875
Hey, Will.

658
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:56,958
Fucking hate them!

659
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,708
My French tutor, Mae,

660
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:03,291
my dad was fucking her.

661
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,750
And they covered it up.

662
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,708
I made her this stupid little paper heart.

663
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,958
It said "You are cute" on it.

664
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,791
And she left right after that.

665
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:19,916
Didn't even say good-bye.

666
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,500
I... I thought it was because of me.

667
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:29,208
You know, I thought I'd freaked her out
or something and...

668
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,708
I don't know, it really messed me up.

669
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:38,583
He's such a fucking dick!

670
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:40,458
Okay, Will, what are you doing?

671
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:41,875
I'm going.

672
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,041
-What?
-I'm going.

673
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,250
No. That is not a good idea.

674
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:48,041
-Are you coming?
-No, it's dangerous!

675
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,041
Will, don't go.

676
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,083
You can't go by yourself!

677
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:15,666
<i>To the heavenly island of Nantucket,</i>

678

-Yeah.

685
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:38,791
You okay?

686
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,750
Mmm-hmm.

687
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:46,125
I should go help look for him.

688
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,166
Okay.

689
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:13,833
Will?

690
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,916
William! It's all right, darling!

691
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:25,291
William?

692
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,083
Will had it.

693
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:57,750
He was hiding it.

694
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,500
Miss Sacks. Hello.
