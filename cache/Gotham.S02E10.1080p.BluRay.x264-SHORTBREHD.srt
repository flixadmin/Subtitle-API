1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,380
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:06,091
<i>Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor,</i>

3
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:08,593
who will cleanse this city.

4
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:09,969
If you sell me your company,

5
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:13,598
I will give you the name of the man
who killed your parents.

6
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:14,808
Who the hell are you?

7
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,894
I'm Bruce's friend,
and you're a piece of gutter trash.

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,271
You think that little minx
is gonna tell you something, do you?

9
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,440
Getting information
out of a girl like that

10
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:25,527
requires a level of deception
that you do not yet possess.

11
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:27,112
You're under arrest!

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,780
May I ask what the charge is?

13
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,949
The kidnapping
and torture of Aubrey James.

14
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:32,492
These were Miss Kringle's.

15
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:35,286
A man with nothing to love is free.

16
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:37,539
Hey, Parks. You did good today.

17
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:43,294
Eduardo Flamingo killed Officer Parks
before they could get him into lock-up.

18
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:47,757
Bruce Wayne will die,
and his company will be ours.

19
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:51,553
<i>Everything is ready.
The brothers' arrival is imminent.</i>

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,597
<i>Gotham will be redeemed in blood.</i>

21
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,651
Please! Please don't hurt me!

22
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:07,944
Shut up!

23
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,499
Huh!

24
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:07,462
Forget your umbrella?

25
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:10,673
<i>Thought visiting hours were over.</i>

26
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:15,887
What are rules to the man
who arrested the Mayor of Gotham?

27
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,436
Any chance you're going to tell me
what this little visit is about?

28
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,231
Tomorrow's hearing, perhaps?

29
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,649
You're here to gloat.

30
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:30,610
Does the name Katherine Parks
mean anything to you?

31
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,073
No. Can't say it does.

32
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,577
I'm gonna be there tomorrow.

33
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,122
And I'll watch them put you away.

34
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:50,046
Always a pleasure, Detective.

35
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,972
- Hey.
- Hi.

36
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,771
You're soaking wet.

37
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,568
Do you wanna talk about it?

38
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,863
Katherine Parks was 23.

39
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,950
On the force a year.

40
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,037
And today, we put her in the ground

41
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,456
because when I had the chance,

42
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,543
- I didn't do the only sensible thing.
- Jim--

43
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,795
An assassin kills four cops,

44
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,548
dares me to pull the trigger, and I don't.

45
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,718
Explain that to me.

46
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:39,470
That man was your prisoner.
You didn't have a choice.

47
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,472
I had a choice.

48
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,935
Yes. To uphold the law
or to become a murderer.

49
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:47,145
You made the right one.

50
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:49,522
You think Katherine Parks
feels the same way?

51
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,107
What about her family?

52
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,695
I went to see Galavan today.

53
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,197
And?

54
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,992
You're asking did I get the guards
to turn the cameras off?

55
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,745
No. But they would have.

56
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:07,332
Galavan as good as killed Parks, Essen,
and a dozen other cops,

57
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,875
and yet he sits there.

58
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,877
Smiling. Breathing.

59
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:14,547
And tomorrow, Aubrey James is going
in front of the grand jury

60
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:17,175
and telling them that he was kidnapped
and tortured by Galavan.

61
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,802
He's gonna be put away for a long time.

62
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,262
Maybe.

63
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,140
Just the way he acted...

64
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,143
It wasn't a man looking
at a decade in prison.

65
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,688
I have a bad feeling.

66
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,690
Jim, it's over.

67
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,026
You did good.

68
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,864
Now, come to bed. Doctor's orders.

69
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,389
Where am I?

70
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,725
Who are you?

71
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:09,978
The day of reckoning is at hand.

72
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:14,524
The blood of the nine
shall wash away the sin.

73
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,860
Wait! Please!

74
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,946
And Gotham will be cleansed.

75
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,836
This isn't gonna work.

76
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:39,674
This girl is a world-class liar
from a family of world-class liars.

77
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,260
She'll see through you. Or her uncle will.

78
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:43,803
Both very possible.

79
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:45,763
And?

80
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,810
Bruce, they're playing nice with you
because they think you trust them.

81
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,439
Once they see you don't,
it'll get ugly fast.

82
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,233
- Your logic is flawless, Selina.
- It's not too late--

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,278
If there's even a chance Galavan knows
who killed my parents, I have to take it.

84
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,449
I've told Alfred
I have fencing practice after school.

85
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,451
It should buy us some time if we need it.

86
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,618
Hey.

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,289
The best liars always tell the truth.

88
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,541
Something to remember.

89
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,959
Thank you.

90
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:20,089
That's her car. You'd be--

91
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,931
Alvarez, call the morgue,

92
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,642
see if any bodies turned up
matching Gertrude Kapelput.

93
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,936
She didn't just vanish.
Galavan killed her.

94
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,104
I did that yesterday.

95
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:36,981
And you're gonna do it again today.

96
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,108
I got my own cases, Gordon.

97
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,486
Turn up anything on that symbol
we found in the penthouse?

98
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,280
No. I'm waiting for Father Mike
up at St. Bart's.

99
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,074
Sent him a picture of the cassock too.

100
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,659
He's up on all that religious mumbo-jumbo.

101
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,578
What exactly are we after here?

102
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:53,498
Something tying Galavan
to the murders of Essen, Parks,

103
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,832
any of the people he killed.

104
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,252
Not to state the obvious, Jim,
but the guy is going to jail.

105
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,254
I went to see him last night.

106
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,715
Yeah? You get the guards
to turn off the camera?

107
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,509
The look on his face, Harvey.

108
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,761
I don't know. I can't describe it.

109
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,429
You gotta be kidding me.

110
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:13,643
Guy gets stabbed, I thought we'd have
at least a week of peace.

111
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,854
Hey, Cap! How you doing?
Did you get my flowers?

112
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:19,357
Captain. How you feeling?

113
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,192
Five-by-five.

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,903
Damn Doc would've had me in bed
a week if I'd have let him.

115
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,154
Got something for you.

116
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,532
Unis found a dead body down by the port.

117
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,741
Throat cut from ear-to-ear.

118
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,661
The vic's a career dirtbag,
but the work's the same.

119
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:34,205
Sir. If it's all the same,
I'd like to stay on Galavan.

120
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:38,167
It isn't. Galavan's cooked,
so you're back in the rotation. What?

121
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,294
I just feel like
we're missing something, sir.

122
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:43,923
Yeah, some piece of the puzzle
that's gonna come back and bite us.

123
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,216
Just give me a few more days.

124
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:48,386
Answer's no.
Be pissed, but it's for your own good.

125
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,596
Oh, and, uh...

126
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,057
I'm sorry about Parks.

127
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:54,976
She deserved better.

128
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,396
Yo! Jim.

129
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,231
Message from Father Mike.

130
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:04,026
That symbol is from something called
the Order of St. Dumas.

131
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,945
They used to have an abbey downtown.

132
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,406
Barnes just told me to lay off of Galavan.

133
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,074
Oh, well, then you probably don't care

134
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,411
that the mayor's office
tried to buy the abbey last week.

135
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:14,745
Galavan tried to buy it?

136
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,831
Yeah. Some urban development nonsense.

137
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:20,418
The new owners said no.
It's a Chinese slap-slap joint now.

138
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,257
Hell with it. You got the address?

139
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,426
Yep. Let's go get lucky.

140
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:11,636
Your uncle made me an offer.

141
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,262
The name of my parents' killer

142
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,806
in exchange for selling him my shares
in Wayne Enterprises.

143
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,475
I said no.

144
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,352
But circumstances have changed.

145
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,812
You're going to sell?

146
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,148
- No.
- Then--

147
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,442
Your uncle was arrested
and his assets are frozen.

148
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,488
Tell him I'll pay for his defense.
In exchange, he gives me the name.

149
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,782
You're taking advantage of him.

150
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,159
I have something he needs,
he has something I need. That's all.

151
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,954
Do you believe
what people are saying about him?

152
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,039
I don't care what people say.

153
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,501
My father was investigating
Wayne Enterprises,

154
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,127
then he and my mother were killed.

155
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,922
Last year,
I investigated Wayne Enterprises,

156
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,340
and someone tried to kill Alfred.

157
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,175
Either I find out who killed my parents

158
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,427
and stop whatever's happening
at my own company,

159
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,595
or I'm dead.

160
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,807
I need that name.

161
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:01,394
The grand jury hearing is today.
He's going to be cleared.

162
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,437
What if he's not? What then?

163
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,232
<i>Silver, get him
to tell you the name,</i>

164
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,694
and I will make sure he has
the best defense money can buy. I promise.

165
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,195
You think he's guilty.

166
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:14,198
Why would you believe anything he says?

167
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:16,867
Because it would come from you.

168
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,163
If you bring me the name,
I'll know it's real.

169
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,222
Do you mean that?

170
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,651
I'll call you after I talk to him.

171
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,079
You still gotta get the name.

172
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:04,665
I will. I'm late for school.

173
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:21,891
Not yet.

174
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,530
You sure about this?

175
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,325
Doesn't look much like a massage parlor.

176
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,118
Maybe there's another entrance?

177
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,464
Get these girls out of here.

178
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,383
Come on. Come on. Come on.

179
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,180
G.C.P.D.!

180
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,682
Sir?

181
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:35,714
Stop!

182
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,678
Drop the knife.

183
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,181
The day of reckoning is at hand.

184
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,184
And the blood of nine
shall wash away the sin.

185
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:51,355
Uh-huh? Who are you?
What's your connection to Galavan?

186
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,524
And Gotham shall be cleansed.

187
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,236
Hey! Hey!

188
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:07,204
The girls at the parlor say
they saw at least six monks.

189
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,665
Uh-huh?

190
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,751
They have to be part
of this same Order of St. Dumas.

191
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,421
Bullock's contact says they're penitents.

192
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,215
Yeah. I forgot my dictionary in my purse.

193
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,593
They believed
in purification through pain.

194
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,470
Blood.

195
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,556
They were big in the old days in Gotham.

196
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,184
Then about a hundred years ago, vanished.

197
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,061
It was their crest we found
in Galavan's penthouse.

198
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,689
And now they're back
and they're pissed off

199
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,525
that their home is
a high-end rub and tug joint.

200
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,693
<i>Fine!</i>

201
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,529
Gather what you have
and give it to Alvarez.

202
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:43,365
Captain, these monks could be the key
to whatever Galavan is planning.

203
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,494
As I recall, Detective,
I already gave you a case.

204
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,538
And I expressly told you
to move away from Galavan.

205
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,081
The dead guy at the ports?

206
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,417
<i>He attacked a woman across town yesterday.</i>

207
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,504
In her statement,
she said her attacker was pulled off

208
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,088
by a man dressed like a monk.

209
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,467
Does the universe
normally like you this much, Detective?

210
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:02,635
First time.

211
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,553
<i>All right. Say they're the same monks.</i>

212
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,766
Why would they kill a bunch of bankers
and some nobody street thug?

213
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,520
The monk said, "The blood of the nine
shall wash away the sin."

214
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,105
It's obviously some sort of ritual.

215
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,609
And if Galavan is connected,
what does he stand to gain?

216
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:19,860
I don't know.

217
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,820
We have to find a monk
and get him to talk.

218
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,949
Well, considering what this last one did,
that might not be so easy.

219
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,283
Captain, it's no coincidence

220
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,453
that this is happening
just as Galavan's about to stand trial.

221
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,289
Whatever it is, it's going down today.

222
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,749
The blood of the nine.

223
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,376
<i>Five are already dead.</i>

224
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,212
Okay.

225
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,465
But I still want you at the grand jury
to hear James' testimony.

226
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,635
And, Gordon, whatever this is, stop it.

227
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,600
<i>Bruce, it's Silver.</i>

228
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,269
<i>I just saw my uncle.</i>

229
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,979
<i>He agreed to your deal.</i>

230
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,523
<i>Everything you asked.</i>

231
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,817
<i>He told me the name, Bruce.</i>

232
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,652
<i>Meet me across the way after school.</i>

233
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,672
Don't scream.

234
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,465
Don't run.

235
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,510
Just get in, or we kill the girl.

236
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,053
No! Please!

237
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:37,813
Go.

238
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,526
<i>This scar tissue is old.</i>

239
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,571
See how the wounds wrap over his shoulder?

240
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,905
It was definitely self-inflicted.

241
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,033
I stabbed him, he didn't flinch.

242
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,951
And there are thick scars on the palms.

243
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,786
He cut himself there repeatedly.

244
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,830
Father Mike said
the leaders cut themselves,

245
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,749
and then mark the followers
with the blood.

246
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,125
Like a blessing.

247
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,376
Charming.

248
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,962
Dug up two more bodies
from the past three days.

249
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,506
Career hoods.
Killed somewhere, then dumped.

250
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,008
Both their throats cut.

251
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,302
Seven down. Two to go.

252
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:09,803
It's weird.

253
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,764
How has nobody seen these monks till now?

254
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,725
A, they're killing people
and carrying them across town,

255
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,727
and B, they're monks.

256
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,189
The woman who was attacked yesterday.

257
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:23,817
She said the monk vanished
with the attacker,

258
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,362
but that alley was a dead end.

259
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,078
The sewers.

260
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,205
Oh, no.

261
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:49,009
So, the monk drags the woman's
attacker into the alley above us...

262
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,970
Next thing,
he's food for seagulls.

263
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,642
Ports are this way.

264
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,316
Again?

265
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,653
Did you try jiggling the handle?

266
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,699
Well, what did you put down it?

267
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,120
- Dr. Thompkins, can I help you?
- Hi, Ed.

268
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,788
This is the autopsy on the dead monk.

269
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,957
Jim wants you to run toxicology.

270
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,292
Fascinating.

271
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,461
The need to inflict
that kind of pain on oneself.

272
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,380
Is there anything else?

273
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,465
No.

274
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,509
Yes.

275
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,845
Was that Kristen you were just talking to?

276
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,012
What?

277
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,807
Sorry. It sounded like you were talking
to somebody in your apartment,

278
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,809
- and who besides--
- I was talking to my plumber.

279
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,561
Oh.

280
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,354
Well, have you heard from Kristen?

281
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,565
I know she said she was sick.
I was thinking of stopping by--

282
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,608
As it happens, she is not sick.

283
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,528
She lied. To all of us.

284
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,323
I just found out. Miss Kringle left town
with Officer Dougherty.

285
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,243
- She left Gotham with Dougherty?
- Mmm-hmm.

286
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,995
But he was abusive.

287
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,497
Love.

288
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,251
Well, I'm stunned.

289
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:11,508
Do you need to get that?

290
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,469
No. I don't think so.

291
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,520
Oh, Ed. You must be devastated.

292
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,023
Right now,
I'm just trying to focus on the job.

293
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,442
Well, let me know
if you ever want to talk.

294
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,319
Thank you. That means a lot.

295
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,708
- Yes.
<i>- Where is the spicy mustard?</i>

296
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,835
You better not have finished it.

297
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,546
Never mind.

298
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,556
Silver, are you okay? What happened?

299
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,983
You have one chance.
You let us go.

300
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,572
You talk when I tell you to.

301
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,075
Understand?

302
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,871
Now, so you know,
we are outside of the city,

303
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,124
and there is absolutely no one
to hear you scream.

304
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,417
Except me.

305
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,045
You work for the people
inside Wayne Enterprises.

306
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,630
Whoever's paying you--

307
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,679
Again, you talk when I tell you to.

308
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,724
Now, my employers have heard

309
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,436
<i>that you are thinking of selling
your company shares</i>

310
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,022
to the uncle of this one.

311
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,610
That's not good, but not why we're here.

312
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,822
The issue is someone's been nosing

313
00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:02,494
into the deaths of Thomas
and poor Martha Wayne.

314
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,832
And I wonder who. Mmm...

315
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,629
Kidding, we know it was blondie's uncle.

316
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,133
<i>So, I've been tasked to find out</i>

317
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,304
what dear old uncle
told little Bruce Wayne.

318
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,473
Nothing! Galavan didn't tell me anything!

319
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:28,854
You think that I won't hurt you
because you're a kid

320
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,315
or because you're you?

321
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,736
How'd that work out
for your mommy and daddy?

322
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,408
There're billions at stake here.

323
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,285
And that's with a "B."

324
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,497
Do what you want to me,
I don't know anything.

325
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,583
Okay. So, we start with Goldilocks.

326
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,834
You touch her, and I swear.

327
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,879
Yeah?

328
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,548
I've been threatened by the best, kid.

329
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:00,385
And you, not exactly terrifying.

330
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:05,933
Now let me tell you
how this is going to go.

331
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:13,190
In a minute,
I'm gonna take one of you into the back

332
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:17,277
and start cutting off your fingers.

333
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:18,862
<i>And you're gonna talk.</i>

334
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:24,368
I've been doing this a very,
very long time, and everyone talks.

335
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:30,624
So unless
you're really into wearing mittens,

336
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,043
<i>this is your last chance.</i>

337
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,505
What does Theo Galavan know?

338
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,554
Okeydokey.

339
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,435
- Let's go.
- No, no, no!

340
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,562
- No, no! Stop! Stop, stop!
- No!

341
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:53,772
Silver, you have to tell him.

342
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,273
<i>I'll hold my side of the deal. I promise.</i>

343
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,109
Please, please. I promise!

344
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,071
But my uncle didn't tell me anything.

345
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,572
But you left me a message.

346
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,242
I was supposed to keep you busy
till this evening.

347
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,494
<i>He's sure he's going to be freed,</i>

348
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:10,038
then he'll convince you
to sell your company.

349
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,834
I'm sorry, Bruce. I don't know anything.

350
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,378
- Really?
- I don't!

351
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,256
- That's a pity.
- No! No! No!

352
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,507
- Kid--
- No! Please!

353
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,385
Kid, you really need better
taste in women.

354
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,013
No!

355
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,057
No! No! No!

356
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,600
Stop! Bruce!

357
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,944
Just when you think
Gotham's shown her last jewel,

358
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,946
she reveals herself like a flower.

359
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,656
You're mixing metaphors.

360
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,450
I'm in a freaking sewer.

361
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,037
You hear something?

362
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,458
A voice?

363
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,437
I know this bum. Muscle for hire.

364
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,564
<i>Check out the finger paint
on the forehead.</i>

365
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:20,067
Victim at the port had the same thing.

366
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,485
Like a blessing.

367
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,905
Whoever did this can't be too far away.
We should--

368
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,156
Harvey!

369
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,001
No, no, no. Please, please don't. Hold.

370
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,637
- He needs an ambulance.
- Boo-hoo!

371
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,264
We gotta wake him up. Make him talk.

372
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,142
A religious fanatic who doesn't feel pain?
What's our angle?

373
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,103
These nut-jobs have killed eight people.

374
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,480
Whatever their plan is,
whatever Galavan's up to,

375
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:01,108
it is happening now! We make him talk!

376
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,692
What are we gonna do, torture him?

377
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,277
Threaten to let him die? He wouldn't care.

378
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,533
There's no signal down here.
I'll call it in, but I gotta go up.

379
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,284
Thank you.

380
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,249
The day of reckoning...

381
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:23,588
The day of reckoning, Brother...

382
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,056
Bruce?

383
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,561
<i>Whoo!</i>

384
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,566
Well, if nothing else,

385
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:47,112
today has given me
a newfound respect for boy billionaires.

386
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,240
Kid's tougher than he looks.
Didn't know a damn thing.

387
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,075
Did you kill him?

388
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,744
No. Not yet.

389
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,872
But the rest is kinda up to you.

390
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:01,418
I told you.
My uncle didn't tell me anything.

391
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,170
Are you gonna stick with that story?

392
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,713
It's the truth.

393
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,591
Bruce, I'm sorry! I don't know anything!

394
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:11,553
You know what? I don't like you.

395
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:16,057
The Wayne kid, he's got some sap in him.

396
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,268
But you...

397
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:22,230
You know when you meet someone
and you just don't click?

398
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,734
That's the way I feel about you.

399
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,196
That's why this is gonna be
so much easier.

400
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,658
What're you doing?

401
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:38,121
I'm gonna make sure
that you are telling the truth.

402
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:43,126
Touch me,
and my uncle will have you gutted.

403
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,921
Every person you love will die screaming.

404
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:51,259
I've had enough of this. Let me go. Now!

405
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:52,844
Well, hello!

406
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,847
Nice to meet you.

407
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,308
I knew there was someone hiding in there.

408
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,311
Are you deaf as well as ugly?

409
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:03,605
I said, let me go!

410
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,691
I heard you, princess.

411
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,778
What are you doing?

412
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,990
Stop! Malone! It's Malone!

413
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:17,160
- What's that?
- Malone. That's the name.

414
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,996
The man who killed Bruce Wayne's parents.

415
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,915
So your uncle did tell you.

416
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,834
Not today. Before.
When he first found out.

417
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,169
Malone's a very common name.

418
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:29,172
His first name begins with "M."
That's all I know.

419
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,217
- Mmm...
- Stop.

420
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:36,346
You know what? I believe you.

421
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,016
Are we good?

422
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,521
Yes.

423
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,108
We're good.

424
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,528
Hey. Remember me?

425
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,863
The gutter trash?

426
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,575
Bruce. What's happening?

427
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,369
What does it look like, dummy?

428
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,121
We tricked you.

429
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:04,874
Though if it was up to me,
you would've lost a few fingers.

430
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,377
Going soft, Tom?

431
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,212
Cat.

432
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,300
Thank you.

433
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,594
Thank you, Mr. Wayne.
Pleasure doing business.

434
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,555
Sorry about the slaps.

435
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,724
Now, are you two gonna be okay
with this one?

436
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,143
Or would you like me to, uh...

437
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,353
Nah. We're cool.

438
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,648
Mr. Wayne. Boys!

439
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,070
You're probably very confused right now.

440
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,698
Probably have a million questions
going through your head.

441
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,116
- Bruce, please--
- Be quiet.

442
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,744
I trusted you, Silver.

443
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,748
Even after your uncle was arrested,
I still believed you were my friend.

444
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,917
It was finally Selina
who convinced me otherwise.

445
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,753
I never bought your stupid act.

446
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:51,629
She broke into your apartment.

447
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,424
Found the file you had on me.

448
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,260
It was clear that you'd been sent
to push me to sell my company.

449
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,429
That your entire family was corrupt.

450
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:00,972
<i>But I still had to find out
what your uncle knew</i>

451
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,140
<i>about my parents' murder.</i>

452
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,600
Now I do.

453
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,936
Thank you.

454
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,646
Bruce, wait!

455
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,482
<i>That name wasn't real.</i>

456
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,777
It was just something I made up
to stop him.

457
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:15,945
<i>That's funny.</i>

458
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:19,949
You only made it up
when you were under the knife,

459
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,243
not when Bruce was getting tortured.

460
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,037
You little bitch. I'll--

461
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:27,582
Please. Try it.

462
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,630
You're right about my uncle.

463
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,049
He's everything everyone says.

464
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,094
Worse.

465
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:43,014
When he finds out what I told you,
he'll kill me.

466
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,643
You pretended to be my friend.

467
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,147
Goodbye, Silver.

468
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,693
Bruce, the things you told me today.

469
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,322
I believed you.

470
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,826
Yes. That was the point.

471
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,828
Bruce, you can't do this.

472
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,248
It isn't you.

473
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:18,842
That's what you think.

474
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,347
But you're wrong.

475
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,352
Bruce.

476
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,647
Bruce! Bruce!

477
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:49,873
Ambulance--

478
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,296
Drink, Brother.

479
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,217
- Can't see...
- You're hurt.

480
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,344
- Lie still.
- The police...

481
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,597
Dead. We got here just in time.

482
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,601
The blood of the nine...

483
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,061
Shall wash away the sin.

484
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,648
I fulfilled my task, Brother.

485
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,401
All that remains is the son.

486
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,737
Yes. The son.

487
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,073
Give me your blessing, Brother.

488
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,079
Please.

489
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:49,599
The Son of Gotham shall die,

490
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,853
and the city shall be cleansed.

491
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:56,773
<i>Detective, where's the--</i>

492
00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:59,442
What?

493
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:05,615
- Who are you?
- G.C.P.D. You're under arrest.

494
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,326
<i>Take him to the hospital.
See if you can get anything from him.</i>

495
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,078
I've gotta see Barnes.

496
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:21,464
<i>Bruce?</i>

497
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,633
<i>Bruce, you in here?</i>

498
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:25,843
Master Bruce.

499
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,055
Master B, are you here?

500
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:35,144
You're trespassing.

501
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,815
I'm looking for Bruce Wayne.

502
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,525
He's not answering his phone.

503
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,235
He's not home, he's not at school.

504
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:45,446
My guess, he's with
that snotty little niece of yours.

505
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,115
Sorry.

506
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:50,827
Now, I suggest you leave.
While you still can.

507
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,830
I see, you're a bit of a player, are you?

508
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,332
<i>How does it work then, Tabby?</i>

509
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,167
Big, bad Galavan barks the orders,

510
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,169
and you scamper around
bringing home dead rabbits,

511
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,005
so you might get a little pat on the head?

512
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,008
I wonder what he'd do
if I just disappeared you.

513
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:07,260
Honestly, I don't think he'd care.

514
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:11,014
If I learn anything's happened
to that little boy,

515
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,391
we'll find out, won't we?

516
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:33,911
Hurts, don't it?

517
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:56,392
For the record, I was telling the truth.

518
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,394
I have no idea where Bruce Wayne is.

519
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,563
But I'll tell him you were asking.

520
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,939
Mr. Dent, your witness.

521
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:45,233
So, Mayor James--

522
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,569
Excuse me, Mr. Dent,
I think you mean former mayor.

523
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:52,615
I'm just a citizen of Gotham
here to tell the truth.

524
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,286
Mr. James.

525
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,665
If you could begin by telling us

526
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,042
where you spent
the month of October this year.

527
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,836
<i>- I'd be happy to.</i>
- Where the hell have you been?

528
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,629
Bullock and I captured one of the monks.

529
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,923
I was right,
they're completing some sort of ritual

530
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,717
to cleanse the city of sin.

531
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,176
<i>They have one victim left.</i>

532
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,971
They're calling him the Son of Gotham.

533
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:17,140
Did they say anything about Galavan?

534
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,808
<i>I was not kidnapped
by Theo Galavan.</i>

535
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:20,268
They didn't, did they?

536
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,439
Quiet.

537
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,942
Mr. James, please repeat what you said.

538
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,697
Theo Galavan did not kidnap me.

539
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,741
Your Honor, the witness has suffered--

540
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,909
Please explain yourself, sir.

541
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:40,163
<i>Why did you lie? Who held you captive?</i>

542
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,332
Oswald Cobblepot. The Penguin.

543
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:44,834
<i>He hates Theo Galavan.</i>

544
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,754
<i>He tried to kill him multiple times.</i>

545
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:50,465
He told me what to say.

546
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,260
- He threatened me with terrible things.
- He's lying!

547
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:55,636
Gordon! Gordon!

548
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:57,472
- Detective Gordon, silence!
- Gordon!

549
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,641
Your Honor,
I move my client be released at once.

550
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:02,560
Your Honor,
the state requests a recess to further--

551
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:03,853
Quiet.

552
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,356
Mr. James, you do realize
you are under oath?

553
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:13,863
Oswald Cobblepot tortured me,
put my head in a box.

554
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,074
He made me lie.

555
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,037
I'm so very, very sorry.

556
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:23,247
In light of Mr. James' testimony

557
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:26,375
and the complete absence
of any other evidence

558
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,211
<i>provided by the state,</i>

559
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,338
I hereby order Theo Galavan released

560
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,548
<i>and the case against him dismissed.</i>

561
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:33,716
- Your Honor!
- Come on, Jim!

562
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:34,967
There's nothing we can do.

563
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,888
Your Honor, may I say a few words?

564
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,015
I think that's only fair.

565
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:44,143
I'd just like to state that

566
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:50,149
I harbor no ill will
toward Detective Gordon and G.C.P.D.

567
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,818
They did their jobs.

568
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,237
They're still my heroes.

569
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,073
<i>What do you say, Detective Gordon?</i>

570
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:59,575
Can we move forward together

571
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:04,247
to fix this broken, beautiful city?

572
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,583
<i>- Hey! Hey! Hey!</i>
- No, Jim!

573
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,751
- You son of a bitch!
<i>- Officers! Arrest him!</i>

574
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,420
You're a son of a bitch!
I'm gonna get you!

575
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,381
- Open the door!
- I'm gonna get you!

576
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:15,216
<i>Get him out of here!</i>

577
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,552
Ah, come on! Get your hands off of me!

578
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:20,221
Relax. We're not arresting you.

579
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,401
Alfred?

580
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:39,574
He's probably out looking for me.

581
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,326
Thank you, Selina.

582
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:43,870
I couldn't have done this without you.

583
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:46,831
I was just glad to see
the two-faced bitch get served.

584
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,209
What're you gonna do now?

585
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:55,381
You gonna tell the cops
or look for this Malone guy yourself?

586
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:58,301
Honestly,
I haven't thought that far ahead.

587
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:03,681
So, when you whispered to her,

588
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:07,143
before she went to her uncle,

589
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,978
what did you say?

590
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:10,980
You want to know what I said?

591
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,524
Hey, if you don't wanna tell me,
then I can leave--

592
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:16,319
I told her I've never met anyone like her.

593
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,448
I told her I trusted her with my life.

594
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:26,871
And that I felt tied to her
in a way that I couldn't explain,

595
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,331
but wouldn't change.

596
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:31,751
Ever.

597
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,963
The best liars always tell the truth.

598
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,507
And that was true?

599
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:41,177
Yes.

600
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,347
Just not about her.

601
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,269
Um...

602
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:51,938
Um...

603
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:57,443
I'm gonna steal one of your cars
to take to the city. Cool?

604
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:00,196
Sure.

605
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,539
It's good you're changing.

606
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:15,044
Just don't change too much.

607
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,889
Why did you keep her glasses
to begin with?

608
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,307
I told--

609
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:30,559
I loved Miss Kringle.

610
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,561
<i>Just get rid of them.</i>

611
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,689
Dr. Thompkins is suspicious.

612
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,358
Amateurs.

613
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,087
Gabe, when I gave you this address,
I was not inviting pop-ins.

614
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,006
Galavan's been let go.

615
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,929
Where is he?

616
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,062
My-my.

617
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:17,231
What a difference a day brings.

618
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:21,027
<i>Here you're the prisoner, and I'm free.</i>

619
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:23,112
Fortune's wheel.

620
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,072
<i>Turn, turn.</i>

621
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:27,575
These cops?

622
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:30,453
Good men who can tell
which way the wind's blowing.

623
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,457
Now, we have a very small window.

624
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,209
I have places to be, you have to die,

625
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,879
but I know you must have questions. So--

626
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:44,383
The monks. They work for you?

627
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:49,889
For centuries, the Order of St. Dumas
has protected my family.

628
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,769
They have been a light in a dark world.

629
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,148
Shall I tell you a secret?

630
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:04,236
Theo Galavan is a mask.

631
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:09,742
My name is Dumas, and my family
built this city out of nothing.

632
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:14,497
But we were betrayed. Driven out. Erased.

633
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,916
So, that's all this is about?

634
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,876
Revenge?

635
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:23,005
No. This is about atonement.

636
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:27,051
The ground that Gotham is built on
is poisoned

637
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:29,178
by the wrongs done to my forefathers.

638
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:30,805
I will change that.

639
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:34,016
By killing nine random people?
You're insane.

640
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,187
I can see why you'd think so.

641
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,439
<i>Ritual blood sacrifices,</i>

642
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:43,818
a bunch of guys in robes
chanting prophesies.

643
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,069
It's a bit too...

644
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:49,031
But belief itself.

645
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,699
That's what matters, Detective.

646
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,537
Belief gives strength, purpose.

647
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,289
And not all the victims are random.

648
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,043
Son of Gotham.

649
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:03,879
Goodbye, James.

650
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,924
I couldn't have done it without you.

651
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:10,719
Ah, what the hell!

652
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,140
I have a few minutes. Cut him loose.

653
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,396
<i>Go on, Jim. Give it your best shot.</i>

654
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:22,148
Save Gotham.

655
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,102
Kill him.

656
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:03,272
Don't make it quick.

657
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:18,495
Alfred? Is that you?
You won't believe what I learned--

658
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:24,126
Sorry. Not Alfred.

659
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,684
Hello, Jim.

660
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:46,190
Lucky for you,
Gabe had people following Galavan.

661
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:49,401
Now, where is he?

662
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:52,655
Where's Galavan?

663
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:57,117
Tell me! Where is Galavan?

664
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:08,087
You've shown mettle and ingenuity, my boy.

665
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,756
But that's all done with.

666
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:12,758
What do you want?

667
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,931
Why, your life, of course.

668
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:07,062
