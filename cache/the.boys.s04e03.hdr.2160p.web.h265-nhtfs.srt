a resync

33
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:33,642
- Fuck you!
- Starlight's right! Starlight's right!

34
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:36,103
Starlight's right! Starlight's right!

35
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:38,397
Starlight's right!
Starlight's right!

36
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,023
Starlight's right! Starlight's right!

37
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:46,089
Big round of applause

38
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:49,324
for the Samaritan's Embrace Boys Choir.

39
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,371
I'll tell you, these kids really are
a comfort in troubled times, aren't they?

40
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,665
Yeah. A time when this country

41
00:00:56,748 --> 00:01:00,377
is facing the biggest threat
in its history,

42
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,795
Starlighters.

43
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,231
Starlight is right!

44
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:04,774
What do these crazies
want to do now?

45
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,385
They want to get rid of superheroes.

46
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,928
- You asshole!
- Get out.

47
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:12,598
They want to get rid of me.

48
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:13,932
No!

49
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:16,810
And then they want to replace you
with some godless,

50
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:19,563
non-binary socialists like them.

51
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,941
Their depraved leader Starlight commands it.

52
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:25,194
String her up!

53
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:26,320
Love you, pal.

54
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:29,823
I love all of you.
And I love this country, so I am not

55
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:31,241
gonna let that happen.

56
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,702
The Seven is gonna fight back.

57
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:34,971
All right,

58
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,081
here they are,
the defenders of real Americans.

59
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:38,999
Yeah.

60
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:41,335
Deep, A-Train and Black Noir.

61
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,513
You're doing too much, pull it back.

62
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:55,849
And today is a very special day

63
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,603
because The Seven is getting
even stronger as we welcome

64
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,854
two new members.

65
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,105
Put your hands together for

66
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,067
Firecracker and Sister Sage.

67
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,778
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

68
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,743
You look great. Really suits you.

69
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:17,162
Welcome, ladies, welcome.

70
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:22,709
Well, as for that last spot, who knows?

71
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:25,170
But, actually, my son

72
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:27,464
he did stop those bank robbers
the other day.

73
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,424
Y-You saw that video, right?

74
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:32,153
{\an8}<i>So, let's just say I might be keeping
that last chair warm for him,</i>

75
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:33,095
{\an8}<i> all right?</i>

76
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:35,156
There's enough here
to take down a bull elephant.

77
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,640
Ten bull elephants.

78
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,725
I'm not taking any chances.

79
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:41,144
How you gonna get close enough to use it?

80
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,106
If I can get Ryan here,
I can dose him. You just be ready.

81
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,775
He's not gonna be real happy with us
when he wakes up.

82
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,485
Grace built the Hazlet Safe House

83
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,988
with the specific intention
of hot-boxing Supes.

84
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,823
- It'll hold Ryan.
- Not for long.

85
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,075
Then we better work fast.

86
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:57,369
Like when we deprogrammed
them two ISIL lads, eh?

87
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:59,371
And if he doesn't listen to us?

88
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:00,998
<i>My son Ryan.</i>

89
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,254
Then we keep him high
on Halothane till he does.

90
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:08,964
Now listen here, Joe,

91
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:13,135
we get Ryan's head clear,
and that's it, all right?

92
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,554
Nothing about training him up
to top Homelander.

93
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:17,139
So you've said.

94
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,932
I mean it, Joe.

95
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:20,892
Would you train your boy up
to be a killer?

96
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:23,270
Listen, brother, you don't trust me?

97
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,480
Go back to your team.

98
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:26,690
Oh. Wait.

99
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,872
Smile. Right now.

100
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,006
Ooh, there we go!

101
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:54,092
Did you know that these

102
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:57,346
"vaccines" that they're giving out

103
00:03:57,429 --> 00:04:00,557
at the Starlight House
actually cause autism?

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,393
And-and not that cool <i>Rain Man</i> autism

105
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:04,746
that makes you good
at counting cards and shit.

106
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,271
- Her?
- Yeah.

107
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,315
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:11,026
Seems like she fell off her Jet Ski
one too many times.

109
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:14,988
Mm-mm. Now that Starlight's back
leading the Starlighters, we need her.

110
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:17,324
Mm. That is gonna shut them up?

111
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:20,077
No. She's gonna make them louder.

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,912
Are you gonna trust me or not?

113
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,413
Is there a problem?

114
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,499
'Cause this is a huge day for you,

115
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:28,293
but you seem to have something
firmly lodged up your asshole.

116
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:29,920
This spandex is.

117
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,880
Up my ass and in a camel toe.

118
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:34,716
- Mm.
- The whole point was for me to stay behind the scenes.

119
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:40,222
You're clearly punishing me
for openly disagreeing with you,

120
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:42,075
which you said you could handle,
but clearly you can't.

121
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:44,476
- Do you really think I'd be that petty?
- Yes, I do.

122
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,228
I mean, did it occur to you

123
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:49,523
that it is harder to stage a fucking coup
with a million eyes on me?

124
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:51,316
Popularity is power, Sister.

125
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,567
It's a prison.

126
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,319
Listen, it's gonna be great. Okay?

127
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:56,822
You're a member of The Seven now.
You're a superhero.

128
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,073
Act like it.

129
00:04:58,156 --> 00:05:01,159
Hey, how about a photo
with the new girl, guys?

130
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:02,244
Yeah, get in here.

131
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:03,388
- Front and center.
- Get in there.

132
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:04,555
- Make a sandwich out of her.
- Right there.

133
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,790
Like, if she really cared about women,

134
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,043
why push to let these transgenders
into the girls' bathrooms?

135
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,367
Because she in no way represents

136
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:14,089
Vought's values.

137
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:17,217
Because we are
on the right side of history here.

138
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,718
{\an8} <i>I'm back.</i>

139
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:22,055
{\an8} <i>Starlight is...</i>

140
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,433
All pretty cut and dry.

141
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:28,186
Your mom has power of attorney,
and she has to execute your dad's wishes.

142
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,064
Right, but that-that directive
only applies to a vegetative state.

143
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:32,691
My dad's not a vegetable.

144
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:34,234
His doctor say so?

145
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:36,903
People wake up from comas all the time.

146
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,866
I'm sorry, Hughie.

147
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,993
There just really isn't anything
you can do legally.

148
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,287
You want my advice?

149
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,872
Just work it out with your mom.

150
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,178
Hey. What are you doing here?

151
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,054
We need to talk.

152
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:05,640
Um... Just give me one sec.

153
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,111
Hey, welcome to Starlight House.
Can I help you?

154
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,614
- Where are they?
- I'm sorry, who?

155
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:23,867
Where are the kids?
The ones in the basement.

156
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,369
- We don't have a basement.
- Bullshit.

157
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,163
Firecracker's onto you pedos.

158
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:30,624
What, are you selling Cheese Pizza?
C.P.? Child Porn?

159
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:31,917
Okay. Uh...

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,627
- Oh, my God.
- Stay back.

161
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,003
All right.

162
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,522
- I'm rescuing those kids.
- Call the police.

163
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,089
All right, all right.

164
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:39,341
Come on, now.

165
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:45,430
- Frenchie?
- The hell happened?

166
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,099
A friend of Firecracker's.

167
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:50,352
<i>Un imbécile.</i>

168
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:56,399
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

169
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,486
Okay. So, how does a chemist

170
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,947
know how to disarm a guy
like Jason fucking Bourne?

171
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,115
I'd say more like Jean Reno

172
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,076
- in <i>Léon.</i>
- Never heard of it.

173
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,619
You're a thousand years old.

174
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:10,163
Okay. There.

175
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,252
You need me to kiss it better?

176
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:18,964
I'm fine.

177
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,175
Oh, Colin.

178
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,843
I can't.

179
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:28,765
You gonna knock me out, too?

180
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:42,696
We've got Berns and Sasha.

181
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,448
I don't care about our side, Mitch.

182
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,908
Tell me about the other side.

183
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:49,244
How many are still in Vought's pockets?

184
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,621
214 in the House.
43 in the Senate.

185
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,248
Fucking hell.

186
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,918
Sorry I'm late. Bob's office
must've forgotten to loop me in on this.

187
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:00,630
Glad you could make it, Vicky.

188
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,883
I read the new draft.
There seems to be an amendment.

189
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,511
Vought's been calling the shots
for too damn long.

190
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:09,055
Thanks to Starlight, folks are wising up.

191
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:14,060
The DOJ is filing antitrust charges,
but I say we take it a step further.

192
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,770
It's time we ban Supes

193
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:18,273
from the military, from private policing,

194
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:21,318
and all other government positions.
Don't you agree?

195
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,653
Of course. But, I mean,
we don't want to seem

196
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,256
as though we're prejudiced
against them either, so...

197
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,992
Supes are entertainers,
period, end of story.

198
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,329
So, shouldn't we take them off the streets

199
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:36,124
and put them back on <i>The Masked Singer,</i>
where they belong?

200
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,256
Absolutely.

201
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:01,316
No matter.

202
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,610
A Shining Light cell nearby.

203
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:04,986
How do you know?

204
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,920
Hughie helped me with the CIA Mainframe.

205
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:08,490
I'm a hacker now.

206
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,910
The therapist was right.

207
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,995
I need to face my past.

208
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,747
So I'm going to kill them all.

209
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,999
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

210
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,544
Absolute no. Bad.
This is a bad idea, very bad.

211
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,505
Shining Light is hurting kids.

212
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:25,507
Kids like me.

213
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,550
You need to come with me.

214
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,344
No questions. No hesitation.

215
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,012
Because I'm asking you.

216
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,309
When do we leave?

217
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,937
Um, just, uh...

218
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,814
- Just keep your arms up.
- Yeah.

219
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:42,691
I mean, you're 80% limbs.
Use 'em.

220
00:09:42,774 --> 00:09:44,734
- Okay. Arms are up.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

221
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,279
Ah, fuck, that was hard.

222
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,699
That was, like, 10% of hard.

223
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,910
{\an8}Yo. These new Seven picks
make any goddamn sense to you?

224
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,954
I mean, Sage? Elon Musk

225
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:58,456
has more charm than she does,
and he's half-android.

226
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,542
{\an8}I mean, Firecracker hates my guts

227
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,336
{\an8}for some reason, but outside of that,
I don't get it.

228
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,797
- Something big is happening.
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,008
And we need help. Now, look,
I know y'all ain't gonna like this shit.

230
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:11,010
- I want to flip A-Train.
- What?

231
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:13,388
- You're joking.
- Fuck that.

232
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:14,973
We turn A-Train informant,

233
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:16,683
there's no bigger fish than him.

234
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,412
- Yeah, or he could murder you.
- He did help clear your Starlighters.

235
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:22,188
Guys, I know when
a motherfucker's wavering, okay?

236
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:24,441
And A-Train, he's right there, he's ready.

237
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,127
One guess what my problem
with this might be?

238
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:27,318
No. No.

239
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:29,404
- I think we should bring Butcher back.
- Fuck no.

240
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:32,323
And need I remind you
who still runs this operation.

241
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:35,034
I thought we all had a say.
I thought that was the point.

242
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:36,578
Hello?

243
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:39,706
You guys want to ask
before you just up and fuck off?

244
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:42,309
<i>'Cause we are
on the right side of history here.</i>

245
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,586
{\an8} <i>- I just think that I am living proof...</i>
- Oh, God.

246
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:48,256
{\an8}<i>...that America
is still the land of opportunity,</i>

247
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:53,011
{\an8}<i>where a woman can make it
all the way to The Seven Tower</i>

248
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:55,805
{\an8} <i>without blowing some dude to get there.</i>

249
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,575
{\an8}<i>Lamplighter.
Crimson Countess.</i>

250
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:26,169
<i>Oi, Ryan.</i>

251
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,378
<i>Butcher?</i>

252
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:30,215
<i>Well, better me than some dodgy
incel hawkin' Voughtcoin.</i>

253
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:32,342
<i>My dad said
I'm not supposed to talk to you.</i>

254
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,511
<i>Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.</i>

255
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,638
<i>Just-just give me 20 seconds.</i>

256
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,100
<i>Begin.</i>

257
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:42,435
<i>We need to talk.</i>

258
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,789
<i>- We're talking now.
- No, no, a-a proper catch up,</i>

259
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:47,106
<i>in real life, over at my place maybe.</i>

260
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,692
<i>Come on, don't make me play
the "six months to live" card.</i>

261
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,695
I mean, if you had a "one month to live"
card, then that'd be something.

262
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,076
<i>Nice one.
Reckon I deserved that.</i>

263
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,752
<i>Just please
think about it, all right?</i>

264
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:09,754
<i>That's all I ask.</i>

265
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:14,300
{\an8}<i> And we will not be denied.</i>

266
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,095
<i>It is long overdue</i>

267
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:22,016
<i>for Vought and Homelander's power
to be curbed and regulated</i>

268
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,895
<i>because they do not have all the power.</i>

269
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,981
<i>We do.</i>

270
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,653
<i>I know that I...
that-that Starlight...</i>

271
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,823
- Hey, boss?
<i>- ...has been gone for too long.</i>

272
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:39,176
- I just wanted to personally thank you for...
<i>- Well, today,</i>

273
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,886
<i>I can promise you, not anymore.</i>

274
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,537
{\an8} <i>I'm back.</i>

275
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,542
<i>- Starlight is back.</i>
- ...fuckin' sexy-ass new suit.

276
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,419
Breathing the same air as Homelander.

277
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,338
- Yeah.
- S-Sorry, wh-wh... what?

278
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:53,774
<i>Starlight! Starlight!</i>

279
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:56,259
I just want you to know
that I will forever be

280
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,844
your most loyal servant.

281
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:00,555
- Okay.
- So, anything you need,

282
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:02,640
anything,

283
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:03,808
I mean anything.

284
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:07,186
- Anything.
<i>- With Starlight reclaiming her role</i>

285
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,397
<i>- as leader of her grassroots movement...</i>
- Anything.

286
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,792
<i>- ...and calls for increased superhero oversight...</i>
- Anything.

287
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,526
- Okay.
- Okay? Good.

288
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,256
{\an8}I studied
performing arts at Godolkin.

289
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,680
{\an8}I did <i>Cirque de Vought</i> in Montreal.

290
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,968
You didn't hire me to stand around
like a fucking oak tree.

291
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,785
- What do you need?
- Some direction.

292
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,579
Look, I'm on an island here, okay?

293
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:26,581
I have questions,
but I'm not allowed to speak.

294
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:29,083
Like, Noir lives
in a ninja dojo apartment,

295
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,210
but, best I can tell,
he didn't know karate.

296
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:33,171
I need some intentionality here.

297
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:35,149
Is there, like, a playlist I can use
to get me inside his head?

298
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:38,493
- I don't think he listens...
- Shut the fuck up, Noir, and everyone take your seats.

299
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,266
Ashley, you can go.

300
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,809
Sorry, sir?

301
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,621
This is a meeting of The Seven,
and you're not a member.

302
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:50,146
But I'm always here. I...

303
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,023
Well, Sage is gonna
take over your workload.

304
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:54,317
For all intents and purposes,
she's the new CEO.

305
00:13:57,487 --> 00:13:59,155
Am I getting fired?

306
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,492
- Course not.
- No.

307
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,995
Company still needs a figurehead
like Ronald McDonald or Buster Beaver.

308
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,623
Oh... I'm a mascot.

309
00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:10,667
Exactly. A mascot.

310
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,752
Okay.

311
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:16,756
Okay.

312
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,132
Great.

313
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,684
Actually, Ashley. Uh...

314
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,353
there is one thing you can do for me.

315
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,354
Yeah?

316
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,690
Find Ryan, would you? Thanks.

317
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,150
Okay. Sure.

318
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,070
Shit.

319
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:51,916
Okay. So, Sage here has something
she would like to address with the gr...

320
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:54,520
You have got
to be fucking kidding me.

321
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,254
Is Noir sleeping?

322
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:57,337
Mm-hmm.

323
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,799
Oh, shit! Sorry, you guys.
I'm narcoleptic.

324
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:01,384
Oh, what the fuck?

325
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:03,803
Sage.

326
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:07,765
Few days ago, valuable surveillance
footage was taken from Crime Analytics

327
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:10,977
and given to Starlight...
or some members of her team...

328
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,188
clearing these two men
of murdering three Hometeamers.

329
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,407
Why is everybody looking at me?

330
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,242
Because it's your department.

331
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,327
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

332
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:30,163
I'm gonna need a list of every employee

333
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,123
with access to the server room.

334
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:34,876
- And you are no longer in charge of Crime Analytics.
- What?

335
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,711
Good. Okay.

336
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:38,963
Moving on. What's next?

337
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:41,108
Reactions from today's
presentation are coming in.

338
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:43,332
Very positive. Ryan's received offers

339
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:44,969
from Teenage Kix...

340
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:46,447
- and Capes for Christ.
- Well, you know...

341
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:50,058
The Starlighters have started
a hashtag called RescueRyan.

342
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:53,895
Kevin?

343
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:55,897
Honey, is that you?

344
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,193
Yeah. It is.

345
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:04,238
Can you at least open the door
and look at me when we're talking?

346
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:06,866
What?

347
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,826
Notice anything?

348
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,040
My tank. You forgot to clean it
and now there's an algae bloom.

349
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:15,541
Sorry. All right?

350
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,752
You've been so distant lately,

351
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:20,963
and we haven't been intimate
in over a week.

352
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,633
You're working too hard.
Let's take a vacation.

353
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,968
My cousins live
on that reef off Nantucket...

354
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,696
Hey, how many times
do we have to go over this?

355
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,573
I can't just drop everything
and go on vacation, okay?

356
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:30,598
I have work.

357
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:34,143
At least let me spend some time
in the aquarium above your bed?

358
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,603
It's so dark in here.

359
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:41,275
Just... I can't, babe.

360
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,694
Are you embarrassed by me?

361
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:46,739
No, I'm not...
I'm not embarrassed by you, okay?

362
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:48,741
I've told you that. I'm... It's just...

363
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:51,369
You know, it's-it's too risky.

364
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,831
Just tell me what's wrong.

365
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:57,708
Mm? Yeah, I'm great.
Honestly, babe.

366
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,924
<i>God, I've given him everything.</i>

367
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:07,718
I haven't had a doctor's appointment
in three fucking years.

368
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:10,054
Countless UTIs,

369
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:13,057
enough yeast infections to open a Panera.

370
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:16,519
I don't need this crap, you know?
I went to Vanderbilt!

371
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,314
{\an8}Don't quote me on it, but
you should leave a floater in his toilet.

372
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:24,777
{\an8}I did it to Suzanne, and...
you'd be surprised how satisfying it felt.

373
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:28,990
Did I give you permission to talk,
you fucking prom night dumpster baby?

374
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:31,242
I'm gonna finally do it.

375
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:33,995
I am finally gonna fucking quit.

376
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:35,838
Disney's been trying
to recruit me for years,

377
00:17:35,913 --> 00:17:38,833
and I am a goddamn girlboss.

378
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,461
Now... who wants their balls crushed?

379
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:44,297
Me?

380
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:20,291
Yeah.
I've got Connect 4,

381
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:21,584
and LEGO.

382
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,296
Plus, a special
little something just for you.

383
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:28,841
Your mum's recipe.

384
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:30,760
World-famous, some say.

385
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,182
Mom used to bake them every year
for my birthday instead of cake.

386
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,517
But... no, thanks.

387
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,811
- Really?
- I'm not hungry.

388
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:44,815
All right. Maybe later, then.

389
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,737
Fancy a game?

390
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,786
It's nothing.

391
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,579
I'm fine.

392
00:18:58,663 --> 00:18:59,956
Butcher...

393
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,001
Are you... scared?

394
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:05,294
Scared of what?

395
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,004
To die, I mean?

396
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:16,639
I'm all right with it.

397
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,561
You're lying.

398
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:25,231
I can tell when you're lying.

399
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:28,818
You know, maybe this was...

400
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,945
I-I just think I should go.

401
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:32,571
Oi, Ryan.

402
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:35,950
How's your foosball?

403
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:39,954
What's foosball?

404
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:48,838
Hughie's guy?

405
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,549
- You jacked my brother's phone?
- Cloned it.

406
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:53,759
Had to get your attention somehow.

407
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:55,529
You know I could smear
your motherfucking face

408
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:57,346
across this astroturf in three seconds,

409
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,390
- right?
- Like you did Blue Hawk?

410
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:01,976
- I just want to talk.
- Why the fuck would I ever talk to you?

411
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,228
'Cause you gave Starlight that footage.

412
00:20:04,312 --> 00:20:06,564
I got you on the office camera doing it.

413
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:09,567
Matter of fact,
I got so much dirt on you, A-Train,

414
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,069
I could bury you six dozen feet under.

415
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:16,198
But... I don't think
I'm gonna need to do that.

416
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,491
And why is that?

417
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,660
'Cause of those dark circles
under your eyes.

418
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:21,537
You ain't getting no sleep.

419
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,291
It makes me wonder, what the fuck
is keeping A-Train up at night?

420
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:28,502
Is it that bullshit white savior movie
they got you in?

421
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:30,546
Or that they put
your brother in a wheelchair?

422
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:34,633
Or guilt for beating three man to death
over at Planet Vought?

423
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:39,096
I knew one of those guys.

424
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,600
Wasn't my favorite person, but...
he was innocent.

425
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:46,812
You know what I think?

426
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:51,942
I think you've spent so much time
wearing that stupid-ass Black Power suit,

427
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:56,364
pretending to give a shit,
that something stuck.

428
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,991
You may have that racist
white boy's heart up in you,

429
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:02,661
but you got a second goddamn chance
to actually give a shit.

430
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:06,082
So what you gonna do with it, man?

431
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:10,628
Fuck you.

432
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:15,841
Sage is already hunting
for whoever leaked that footage.

433
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:18,427
'Cause giving a shit just gets you killed.

434
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,762
True.

435
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:23,724
But you're still standing here.

436
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,674
Should be about 10 Shining Light,
but maybe...

437
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:00,845
You okay?

438
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:09,019
Are you high right now?

439
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:10,813
Of course not.

440
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,357
- You are!
- It's just this light mélange

441
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:14,441
of hallucinogens.

442
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:15,484
I'm fine.

443
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:27,371
One man. Armed.

444
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:47,183
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>

445
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,266
<i>Frenchie... Frenchie...</i>

446
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:17,505
<i>Frenchie.</i>

447
00:23:17,588 --> 00:23:18,797
Colin?

448
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,345
<i>Frenchie.</i>

449
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,599
<i>Frenchie...</i>

450
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:49,328
Colin?

451
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,457
What are you doing here?

452
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,127
Just some family time.

453
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,799
I'm sorry.

454
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:07,930
- I am so sorry.
- No, you're not.

455
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,059
If you were really sorry,
you wouldn't have kept doing it.

456
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,402
<i>Non, s'il vous plaît. Non.</i>

457
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:30,411
Sergei...

458
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:39,503
Mm.

459
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:40,796
Why shoot me?

460
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,216
I don't hold
your choke chain anymore, <i>Zaichik.</i>

461
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,385
Nobody does.

462
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:49,221
Mm. You're free of me...

463
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:52,308
Aw, and look at you, on your own.

464
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,351
Complete and utter failure.

465
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:58,397
Fucking that boy you orphaned,
it's pathetic.

466
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,736
All because you cannot accept
what you've always known to be true.

467
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,073
You killed them. Every last one.

468
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,492
The women and children.

469
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,203
And you only have yourself to blame.

470
00:25:14,705 --> 00:25:16,123
You're a murderer.

471
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,628
A monster...

472
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:23,047
...through and through.

473
00:25:29,553 --> 00:25:30,554
Kimiko?

474
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:44,943
Hey!

475
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,289
Who is she?

476
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:02,378
Where did you go?

477
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:15,599
Where'd you learn how to play?

478
00:26:15,683 --> 00:26:17,267
Down the local pub.

479
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:19,269
Lenny and I'd spend hours at it

480
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:21,397
while the old man was
getting pissed with his mates.

481
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,690
Who's Lenny?

482
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:24,650
My little brother.

483
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,861
He, uh... he passed away.

484
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,156
I always used to let him win.

485
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,326
But I ain't making the same mistake
with you, governor.

486
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,327
Sorry.

487
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:37,830
Oi!

488
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:39,957
That's okay.

489
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,418
Everyone at the Tower always lets me win.

490
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,796
It's no fun.

491
00:26:51,885 --> 00:26:54,346
Saw your save on the telly.

492
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,598
So, you're a big hero now, eh?

493
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,309
Not really.

494
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:02,604
Come on, you're a star.
Nailed your lines and all.

495
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,526
I actually...

496
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:12,030
I accidentally hurt someone.

497
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,367
What do you mean, "hurt 'em"?

498
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:18,829
I was supposed to throw them...

499
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,791
...but I did it too hard.

500
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:26,128
They gonna be all right?

501
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,972
My dad says I shouldn't even care.

502
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,355
I get why you don't want me.

503
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:49,443
I wouldn't want me, either.

504
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,073
Hey.

505
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:57,910
Now you listen to me.

506
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,830
Them horrible things I said...

507
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,375
I didn't mean 'em.

508
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,421
I have this, uh...

509
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,550
I have this habit, see,

510
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:16,386
of pushing people away.

511
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:19,848
Why?

512
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,352
'Cause, uh...

513
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:28,023
'Cause I'm a bad man.

514
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:34,446
I ain't got no business
looking after a kid.

515
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:38,116
Ah, that's not true.

516
00:28:40,994 --> 00:28:46,792
Before, you asked if I was scared.

517
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,380
And the truth of the matter...

518
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,091
is I'm bloody terrified, mate.

519
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:57,845
I'm leaving this world
with nothing to show for it.

520
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:01,223
I lost me bruv...

521
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,977
...your mum.

522
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,148
And I could be leaving
without making things right

523
00:29:10,232 --> 00:29:13,277
with the one part of her
that is still alive.

524
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:17,155
And that...

525
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,576
...that scares me more than anything.

526
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:45,100
Why'd you do that?

527
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,685
I fucked 'em up.

528
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:48,270
Put way too much sugar in 'em.

529
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:54,151
Hey...

530
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:56,570
how about we have another game, eh?

531
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:58,405
Yeah.

532
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:00,657
Come on then.

533
00:30:00,741 --> 00:30:03,744
Best of three, all right?
Give me your best game.

534
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,915
<i>So,</i>

535
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:11,168
tell me about your relationship
with Starlight.

536
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:13,271
I understand you two were friends.

537
00:30:13,295 --> 00:30:15,505
Uh, friends?

538
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:18,216
Um, no, I wouldn't say
that we were friends.

539
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,386
I mean, we, uh, shared
an Almond Joy from time to time.

540
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,222
Our records show you made a phone call

541
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:28,143
to the Starlight House
within the past month, so...

542
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,896
- Um...
- Are you working with her?

543
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:34,608
Uh, no, I-I was just, um,
donating some clothes?

544
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:36,811
So why is your heart pounding
like a little bass drum?

545
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,090
- I didn't do anything, okay? I swear.
- Okay, let's-let's just all calm down.

546
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:44,284
Okay? You're not in trouble here,

547
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:45,953
Anika.

548
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:49,414
Starlight's the bad guy here.
So, look, we're gonna find out anyway,

549
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:53,085
so, you just tell us the truth,
we swear you'll be fine.

550
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:56,004
Right?

551
00:30:57,214 --> 00:30:59,216
Yes, yes, I... I swear.

552
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,678
I... I swear

553
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,721
on the life of my son.

554
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:10,978
Okay.

555
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:15,774
Mm, yes, Starlight did call me
a few days ago.

556
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:18,944
She just wanted some help tracking...

557
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:22,239
Ah!

558
00:31:22,322 --> 00:31:24,032
What?

559
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,952
- She confessed. Leak plugged.
- You don't think

560
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:29,496
the next word out of her mouth
might have been useful?

561
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,542
- Guess I am that petty.
- Hmm.

562
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:02,779
This is fucking insane.

563
00:32:02,863 --> 00:32:05,240
You can't actually mean this.

564
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,284
I'm sorry. Who let you in?

565
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:09,411
Bedroom window.

566
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,288
This used to be my place.

567
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:13,457
Yeah, I got to say,

568
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,417
I really hate what you've done with it.

569
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,670
You know, when I said, "Debate me,"
this wasn't what I had in mind.

570
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:23,633
Why me? What have I done
to make you hate me so much?

571
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,721
You really don't remember me, do you?

572
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:32,601
Of course. I mean, why would you?

573
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:36,480
We were only on the same pageant circuit
together for three fuckin' years.

574
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:40,358
'Course I was going by "Sparkler"
back in those days.

575
00:32:40,442 --> 00:32:42,694
Sparkler.

576
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:45,572
Yeah, right. You, um,

577
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:47,991
sang that "God Bless America" medley.

578
00:32:48,075 --> 00:32:51,286
I practiced that routine so fuckin' hard.

579
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,209
Never mind we were too poor
to have a backyard to practice in, but...

580
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:01,129
I'd dream that one day,
I'd get good enough to win.

581
00:33:03,423 --> 00:33:04,633
Miami-Dade.

582
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,344
Down to you and me, the finals.

583
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:10,180
And my mom starts doing my makeup,

584
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:13,642
and I notice that everyone is...

585
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,770
snickering... at me.

586
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:19,523
You remember why?

587
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:22,234
Turns out you told everyone that I had

588
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:26,613
an ass-fuck gangbang with the judges,

589
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:29,449
which was the only way trash like me

590
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:32,077
could ever make it to the final.

591
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,579
I was 13 years old.

592
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:39,960
And when I went to you
to ask you... "Why?"

593
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:41,628
you remember what you said?

594
00:33:41,711 --> 00:33:44,840
Look, I was immature and stupid,

595
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,425
and my mom taught me to be ruthless.

596
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:51,221
Do you remember... what you said?

597
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,727
I said that...

598
00:33:57,811 --> 00:34:01,606
"I don't talk to fat sluts."

599
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:06,236
And then, not long after that,
I had to quit the pageant circuit,

600
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,198
'cause... well, a rumor like that,

601
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,701
it really follows you around.

602
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,204
- And the more you deny it, the more they believe it.
- I'm sorry.

603
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:17,539
I'm so sorry.

604
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:21,084
It was so fucked up, and it was so wrong.

605
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:26,173
I was jealous.
But I'm not that person anymore.

606
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:27,716
People don't change.

607
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:33,638
And everybody thinks
that you're so decent,

608
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:36,308
so pretty and perfect.

609
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:38,685
Hell, you fucking think
you're better than everybody else.

610
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:42,272
- That's not true.
- You're damn fucking right it's not.

611
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:45,942
All that dove, pure angel bullshit?

612
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:52,532
No, I see the conniving little
mean-girl bitch in there.

613
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:56,453
And when I'm done, the rest
of the world's gonna see it, too.

614
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:18,475
Here's your peppermint latte.

615
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:19,768
Why, thank you.

616
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,395
- Happy holidays!
- Excuse me?

617
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:24,606
Don't you mean, "Merry Christmas"?

618
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,524
We say "Happy Holidays"

619
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:29,152
because the holidays
should be for everyone.

620
00:35:29,236 --> 00:35:31,571
But Christmas is for everyone.

621
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:34,824
It's the most magical day of the year.

622
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,195
- Still no Annie?
- No.

623
00:36:13,196 --> 00:36:14,322
No. Fuck.

624
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,533
Hey, where the fuck is everybody?

625
00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:19,369
- All I got is you?
- Okay, one, thanks.

626
00:36:19,452 --> 00:36:21,871
That's heartwarming. And two,

627
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:24,433
I don't get it. I mean, Vought On Ice?
This doesn't make any sense.

628
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:26,185
This is the last place
Vicky would pick for a meet.

629
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:28,670
I mean, can you just tell me
who your source is already?

630
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,673
<i>Okay, skaters,
that's a cut on rehearsal.</i>

631
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,675
A-Train.

632
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,844
- What?
- He says she's meeting Homelander here.

633
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,822
You fucking teamed up with him
and you didn't tell me?

634
00:36:37,846 --> 00:36:40,932
I don't got to tell you shit, Hughie.
I made the call and it paid off.

635
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:43,268
How do you know this isn't a trap?
We're leaving.

636
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:44,620
- Right now.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

637
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:47,731
Hold on a second.
I'm your motherfuckin' CO, okay?

638
00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:50,025
Which means you don't get a say.

639
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:52,235
You do what I say

640
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:54,255
and you say, "Yes, sir" as you do it.
You got that?

641
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,073
- Do you have that?
- Okay... Yeah, fine.

642
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:01,536
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

643
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,668
Oh, fuck, it's hot as balls up here.

644
00:37:14,424 --> 00:37:16,134
<i>You know, I'm, like, six foot three.</i>

645
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:17,802
<i>Why am I the one in here?</i>

646
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:20,096
- Hi.
- Hi, Madame Vice President.

647
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,015
Oh, shit.

648
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:24,059
Shit? What do you mean, shit?

649
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,226
Neuman's here early.

650
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,270
It's okay, she's taking cast photos.

651
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:28,480
Just stay calm.

652
00:37:28,563 --> 00:37:30,065
But, you know, move your ass.

653
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,149
Okay.

654
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,238
Hey, Zo, come in.

655
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,531
I'm good.

656
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:42,452
Teenagers.

657
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:44,079
Okay, thank you.

658
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:46,539
It's great. Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.

659
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:48,833
The show looks great. Good luck.

660
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:51,961
Hey, Zo. Zo, hey.

661
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:55,382
Ten minutes, then we'll get
frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity, huh?

662
00:37:56,466 --> 00:37:57,967
Go. Go sit down, okay?

663
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:59,469
Thanks, guys.

664
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:03,306
Okay, Neuman's on the move.

665
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,892
<i>Plant the bug and get the fuck out.</i>

666
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:40,009
Why is she here?

667
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:41,893
Sage here is a valued
new member of The Seven.

668
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,489
<i>- Hughie, talk to me.</i>
- That's right.

669
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:45,783
You and Miss Floribama Shore.
You sure know how to pick 'em.

670
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:47,600
Kid, do you copy?

671
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:48,977
I picked Firecracker.

672
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,479
She has something
I can't find anywhere else.

673
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:52,897
And what's that?

674
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:54,899
She can destroy Starlight.

675
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:57,318
A lot of effort
for a petty rivalry.

676
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,821
Starlight's just the first pebble
down the mountain.

677
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,031
Soon, it's an avalanche.

678
00:39:02,115 --> 00:39:05,452
Well, that's not creepy or ominous at all.
What does that mean?

679
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:07,370
We're just clearing the way for you, boo.

680
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:09,205
We'll handle Singer

681
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:11,166
after the election's certified.

682
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,768
After all, you can't just pop his top.

683
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:13,853
You need plausible deniability

684
00:39:13,877 --> 00:39:16,045
when the 25th is invoked.

685
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:17,464
And in return?

686
00:39:17,547 --> 00:39:19,924
You disband
the Bureau of Superhuman Affairs.

687
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:22,969
Condemn the "Defund the Supes" movement,

688
00:39:23,052 --> 00:39:26,890
remove all books and teachers
that teach Critical Supe Theory.

689
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:28,475
A hero in every town,

690
00:39:28,558 --> 00:39:30,977
with legal authority over the police.

691
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,437
Then, when you get in the Oval,

692
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,939
you show the world who you really are.

693
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,609
You want me to come out?

694
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:39,110
As a Supe?

695
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:40,570
No fucking way.

696
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:43,072
Singer and the military are
joined at the dick tip.

697
00:39:43,156 --> 00:39:45,176
What happens when they
send in soldiers, which they will?

698
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,952
Vicky...

699
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:50,079
Why do you want to be president?

700
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:53,541
What, just some unchecked lust for power,

701
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,185
or are you still trying to fucking
prove something to Daddy Stan?

702
00:39:59,506 --> 00:40:02,592
He really did a fucking number
on you, didn't he?

703
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:04,511
I mean, look at you.

704
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:05,803
You hate yourself,

705
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:08,306
you're ashamed of yourself,
and you should be proud.

706
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:10,391
We all should. And what about Zoe?

707
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:14,187
Do you want her to hate herself as well?
Be ashamed of herself?

708
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,980
That's what this is about.

709
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:19,692
We have to do better for them.

710
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:22,195
So what kind of example are you setting

711
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:24,614
by staying in the closet?

712
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:56,646
It's from fucking Campbell.
I can smell him.

713
00:40:56,729 --> 00:40:58,249
No, wait, you kill Hughie,
his team outs me as a Supe.

714
00:40:58,273 --> 00:40:59,482
Good, about time.

715
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,743
Fuck.

716
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,308
Come on!

717
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:43,276
Go! Get the fuck out of here!

718
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,278
Get out of the way!

719
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:49,782
Oh, fuck!

720
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:51,451
Oh, fuck!

721
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:05,006
Time to go.

722
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,906
Why'd you do that?

723
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,003
Wow.

724
00:42:44,087 --> 00:42:46,964
Looks like you two had
an even shittier day than me.

725
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:57,475
When I was a boy

726
00:42:57,558 --> 00:43:01,354
and my papa brought home prostitutes,

727
00:43:01,437 --> 00:43:03,856
he'd draw me a bath
and tell me to stay in it

728
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,025
till he was done.

729
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,155
I sat in lukewarm water,
listening to their grunts.

730
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:14,701
Oh, God. That sounds terrible.

731
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:17,704
My fingers turned into prunes.

732
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:21,165
But for that hour, I had no choice.

733
00:43:21,249 --> 00:43:25,002
All I could do was stay in that bath.

734
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:28,297
And that was so nice.

735
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:35,847
"Man is condemned to be free
because once thrown into this world,

736
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,225
he is responsible for everything he does."

737
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:49,318
It was a lot easier
shitting on Vought's decisions,

738
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:53,322
and my mom's decisions,
and everyone's decisions,

739
00:43:53,406 --> 00:43:56,701
than making my own.

740
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:01,914
Do you ever miss it?

741
00:44:01,998 --> 00:44:04,333
Your choices all made for you?

742
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:06,043
Uh...

743
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:11,758
Pretty sure Hughie has
some weed in his desk.

744
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:13,801
I'll gonna...

745
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:19,056
Enough.

746
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,726
- Something's going on with you.
- Why?

747
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:22,977
Because I took a few pills,

748
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,646
like I've done every day of my life?

749
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:28,858
Rehab was working,

750
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:30,860
I don't know if it's Colin or what,

751
00:44:30,943 --> 00:44:32,361
- but something's wrong.
- I'm fine.

752
00:44:32,445 --> 00:44:34,655
You don't have to worry about me,
<i>mon coeur.</i>

753
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:35,990
Really.

754
00:44:37,158 --> 00:44:39,827
All the times you've helped me,

755
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,038
let me help you.

756
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,580
Talk to me.

757
00:44:43,623 --> 00:44:44,957
What if it's not your business?

758
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,959
We are not joined at the hip.

759
00:44:47,043 --> 00:44:49,128
We don't have to tell
each other everything.

760
00:44:49,212 --> 00:44:51,047
Or do you want to tell me

761
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,567
who was that girl was back there
in the warehouse, with the scars?

762
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:55,426
Huh?

763
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:58,262
We cannot solve each other's problems.

764
00:44:58,346 --> 00:45:01,724
Now, <i>excusez-moi,</i> I'm gonna get high.

765
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:08,815
<i>A massive electrical fire
broke out this afternoon</i>

766
00:45:08,898 --> 00:45:11,609
<i>at VoughtCoin Arena
during a tech rehearsal</i>

767
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:13,861

768
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:16,739

00:45:16,823 --> 00:45:18,908
<i>and live entertainment

770
00:45:33,673 --> 00:45:35,383
Hey. Um, how is he?

771
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,176
He's the same.

772
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,439
Look, um, my plan was to come in here,

773
00:45:50,523 --> 00:45:54,485
you know, fight you bloody
over Dad, but, um...

774
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:59,407
I have had a day,

775
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,159
and I think what I really just

776
00:46:02,243 --> 00:46:06,205
want to know right now is, um, why?

777
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:10,001
Why what?

778
00:46:12,128 --> 00:46:14,672
Why'd you leave?

779
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:19,635
How... you know, how could you leave me?

780
00:46:21,053 --> 00:46:22,221
Mm.

781
00:46:29,145 --> 00:46:31,981
I was, uh...

782
00:46:32,064 --> 00:46:34,901
- 22 when I had you.
- Mm-hmm.

783
00:46:34,984 --> 00:46:38,195
Oh, those dimples.

784
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:42,950
But I was depressed.

785
00:46:44,577 --> 00:46:46,412
Postpartum.

786
00:46:46,495 --> 00:46:48,039
Uh...

787
00:46:48,122 --> 00:46:51,226
You know, people think depression, they
think, "Oh, so you're sleepy, so what?"

788
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,128
But it's... not like that.

789
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,714
It... it's painful.

790
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,675
It hurts.

791
00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:03,721
My friends all said,
"Give it a month, six months, a year,"

792
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:06,015
but it-it never went away.

793
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:07,808
But you were always so fun.

794
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:09,644
We'd have dance parties.

795
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:11,646
I never wanted you to see it.

796
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:18,110
But... getting dressed was like...

797
00:47:18,194 --> 00:47:20,029
climbing Everest.

798
00:47:23,366 --> 00:47:25,743
And so, one night, I just took

799
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:28,913
40 Ambien and tried to kill myself.

800
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:32,458
Thank God I threw them up in the toilet.

801
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:35,711
So the next day, I...

802
00:47:35,795 --> 00:47:37,964
took you to school, and I left.

803
00:47:38,047 --> 00:47:41,258
I didn't want to, but...

804
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:44,095
it was life or death for me.

805
00:47:50,685 --> 00:47:52,103
I didn't know that.

806
00:47:52,186 --> 00:47:53,396
Why would you?

807
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:57,650
You, um...

808
00:47:57,733 --> 00:47:59,276
you never called.

809
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,903
I tried.

810
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,866
But your dad was so hurt, and-and...

811
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,576
he didn't want me to confuse you.

812
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,663
So, eventually, I just stopped.

813
00:48:10,746 --> 00:48:13,958
I thought, you know, maybe

814
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:16,419
I wasn't cut out to be a parent.

815
00:48:18,004 --> 00:48:19,880
And I know you've spent a lot of your life

816
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:21,590
hating me and thinking I'm the villain,

817
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:24,051
and I would never ask
for your forgiveness.

818
00:48:29,223 --> 00:48:33,060
But I'm really sorry, Hughie,
that I hurt you.

819
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:38,315
I was just fucked up, you know?

820
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,609
Like...

821
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:42,403
everyone.

822
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:45,197
I don't know.

823
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,749
You think that carfentanil
was easy to score?

824
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,584
Why didn't you give him
the fucking cookie?

825
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,461
Boy wants to keep talking.

826
00:48:58,544 --> 00:49:01,172
We don't got to kidnap him.
We can just fucking ease him into it.

827
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:02,631
And who has time for that?

828
00:49:02,715 --> 00:49:06,010
You? How long before you drop dead?

829
00:49:07,136 --> 00:49:10,014
Hi. CIA. I can find a medical file.

830
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:12,141
The whole world is about to burn,

831
00:49:12,224 --> 00:49:14,268
- Billy, we need the kid.
- Need the kid?

832
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,228
I fucking told you, we ain't turning him

833
00:49:16,312 --> 00:49:17,772
into an asset. He ain't ready.

834
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:19,607
By the time he's ready, it'll be too late.

835
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,942
Everything will be burnt down.

836
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:26,155
You asked me

837
00:49:26,238 --> 00:49:29,366
if I could train up my boy.

838
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,243
You're damn right I could.

839
00:49:31,327 --> 00:49:33,496
And if he died,
I would cry at his funeral,

840
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:37,583
but I would be proud of him
for saving the fucking world.

841
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:39,543
Jesus Christ, Joe, he's 12 years old.

842
00:49:39,627 --> 00:49:41,504
And if he takes after his dad?

843
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:47,051
Either we figure out how to train him...

844
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:49,637
or we figure out how to kill him.

845
00:49:59,146 --> 00:50:01,440
<i>You look fat.</i>

846
00:50:01,524 --> 00:50:04,568
<i>Why are you sticking out
all in the gut area?</i>

847
00:50:05,945 --> 00:50:08,155
<i>- Do I look pregnant?</i>
- Yes.

848
00:50:09,698 --> 00:50:12,910
Hey, smartass.

849
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:14,495
Where you get off?

850
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,914
Crime Analytics was my department.

851
00:50:16,997 --> 00:50:19,041
My angelfish and I had
a great thing going.

852
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:20,685
And I had nothing to do with that leak.

853
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,419
- I know.
- I wasn't even...

854
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:24,272
What is that?
Is that a Bloomin' Onion from Outback?

855
00:50:24,296 --> 00:50:26,465
Yeah. You want some?

856
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:28,134
Yeah.

857
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,636
Mm.

858
00:50:37,726 --> 00:50:39,145
Mmm.

859
00:50:40,396 --> 00:50:42,398
- It's good.
- I know.

860
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,863
Are you doing okay?

861
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:51,907
- It's a tough day.
- Mm.

862
00:50:51,991 --> 00:50:53,492
Hey.

863
00:50:53,576 --> 00:50:56,245
You want to watch <i>Transformers 2?</i>

864
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:57,997
The one with the-the racist robots?

865
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,101
It's funny you mention that.
Shia's actually a good buddy of mine.

866
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,919
He wants me to be
in <i>Honey Boy 2.</i>

867
00:51:04,003 --> 00:51:05,796
Script just isn't there yet, though.

868
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,631
Oh, yeah. That's tough.

869
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:13,554
You know, at first,
I kind of thought you were a bitch,

870
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,639
but you're actually pretty fucking cool.

871
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,228
- You're hot.
- You're totally fucking hot.

872
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:22,897
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

873
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,523
- You like that?
- Yes.

874
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:26,150
Oh, don't tease me like that.

875
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,652
- Like that? Ah.
- Mm...

876
00:51:28,736 --> 00:51:30,321
Oh...

877
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:55,221
- Where have you been?
- Sorry.

878
00:51:55,304 --> 00:51:57,264
I flew to Coney Island
to get those hot dogs.

879
00:51:58,599 --> 00:51:59,892
You're lying.

880
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:01,185
No, I'm not.

881
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:02,853
You've been at William Butcher's.

882
00:52:02,937 --> 00:52:05,231
I can smell him on you.

883
00:52:05,314 --> 00:52:07,608
I wanted to see him.

884
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:10,569
He's going through a tough time.

885
00:52:10,653 --> 00:52:11,779
Why do you care

886
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,114
when you have everything here?

887
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:16,492
You have a home, you have a father.

888
00:52:16,575 --> 00:52:18,744
I've given you everything
that I ever wanted,

889
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:20,412
and it's still not good enough for you.

890
00:52:20,496 --> 00:52:21,664
Why?!

891
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:23,374
You're ungrateful.

892
00:52:23,457 --> 00:52:26,460
You go behind my back. You lie to me.

893
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,213
Why?

894
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:37,638
Why am I not good enough for you?

895
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,474
No, I...

896
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:41,976
It's just Butcher...

897
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,727
Butcher. You know what?

898
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:45,914
If you love him so much,
why don't you get him to be your dad?

899
00:52:45,938 --> 00:52:47,564
No, I don't want him to be my dad.

900
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:49,525
- You're my...
- Enough!

901
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:51,277
Enough!

902
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:02,204
Aw, fuck.

903
00:53:02,288 --> 00:53:03,789
Fuck.

904
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:12,256
John?

905
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:16,343
John.

906
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:18,971
Come here.

907
00:53:23,517 --> 00:53:27,479
John, come here.

908
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,567
You really made a mess this time, tiger.

909
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:36,363
Come on, champ, pull yourself together.

910
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:37,740
Deep breath.

911
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:40,242
For God's sakes, look at you.

912
00:53:40,326 --> 00:53:43,162
A few Starlighters hate you,
Ryan spends some time with Butcher,

913
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:45,372
and, aw, boo-hoo, you're a fucking mess.

914
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:49,001
You have to be stronger, John. For Ryan.

915
00:53:49,084 --> 00:53:50,461
You still need love.

916
00:53:50,544 --> 00:53:52,379
- You're pushing him away.
- So much love.

917
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:54,757
- You still crave it.
- No, that's not true.

918
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,010
You're gonna make him weak
and needy, like you.

919
00:53:58,093 --> 00:54:00,304
You can still fix things. He's your son.

920
00:54:00,387 --> 00:54:02,765
He hates you. He's gonna turn on you.

921
00:54:02,848 --> 00:54:04,391
- Your blood.
- Everyone hates you.

922
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:07,686
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

923
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:11,565
It's time to overcome this need for love,

924
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,777
this sickness, once and for all.

925
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,572
You're never gonna be your true self
until you transcend your humanity.

926
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:19,865
What do I do?

927
00:54:19,948 --> 00:54:22,368
You need to go
back to the start.

928
00:54:26,705 --> 00:54:30,751
John,
you need to go home.

929
00:56:46,595 --> 00:56:48,514
{\an8}<i>Amen, Jesus!</i>
