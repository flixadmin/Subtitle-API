00:01:44.377 --> 00:01:48.592
'There are millions of clusters
of stars in the universe...'

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.103
'That are called galaxies.'

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:55.371
'The galaxy our world belongs to...'

00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:58.137
'Is called the Milky Way.'

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:02.457
'My husband who was
a space scientist used to say...'

00:02:02.896 --> 00:02:06.484
'There are innumerable galaxies
like the Milky Way...'

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:10.404
'And somewhere some planet
could possibly have life.'

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.618
'He had only one goal, to search
for life on other planets.'

00:02:16.477 --> 00:02:18.583
'He'd made various
kinds of gadgets.'

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.155
'He used them to gather data.'

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:26.251
'He'd send sound signals to space.'

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:29.373
'He believed the voice never dies.'

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.020
'The message moves in space
in the form of waves.'

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.597
'He was convinced
that in some other world...'

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:41.329
'Somebody would someday
hear his sound signals.'

00:02:41.743 --> 00:02:43.039
'And will respond to him.'

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.355
'One evening...'

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:56.078
'Sending'

00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:05.297

Sonia!

'Sending'
'Receiving'

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.880
Sonia!
- Coming.

00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:04.630
What is the matter?
- Take a look at this.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.753
They are responding.

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:09.476
But...

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:11.803
These sounds?

00:04:11.976 --> 00:04:16.666
I made a pattern
using the word OM.

00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:20.707
I converted this pattern
digitally on the computer...

00:04:20.902 --> 00:04:23.384
And sent sound signals into space.

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:27.129
And somebody from
another planet is responding.

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:29.635
I've succeeded!
I've achieved a breakthrough!

00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:30.992
I've achieved a breakthrough!

00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:33.864
We must inform the space centre.

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:40.395
So Dr Mehra, did they talk to you?

00:04:40.838 --> 00:04:42.195
So did they say, hello?

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.463
And asked you how was
the weather on earth?

00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:46.611
I'm sorry, sir.

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.749
But this isn't a joke.

00:04:49.093 --> 00:04:52.198
Dr Mehra, do you see
this research centre?

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.234
We've been working on this for years.

00:04:55.684 --> 00:04:58.167
And they contacted you?

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:00.975
How is that possible?
- Why not?

00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:03.916
I too have spent my entire
life on this research.

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.933
I've sent varied sound waves.
Invented varied sound instruments.

00:05:06.256 --> 00:05:07.978
After multiple experiments...

00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:13.239
When I sent OM in diverse
notes and variations...

00:05:13.568 --> 00:05:14.565
It is possible...

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:17.385
What is this OM
he's talking about?

00:05:17.663 --> 00:05:19.253
OM is a Hindu religious word...

00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:22.014
Which has all the
vibrations of the universe.

00:05:22.194 --> 00:05:24.879
Oh! So they believe in
your religion as well!

00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:29.912
Listen, Dr Mehra,
daydreaming is a very bad habit.

00:05:33.954 --> 00:05:35.049
Believe me, Sir.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.470
I can prove it to you.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.305
You are wasting our time, Dr Mehra.
Please go home.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:50.111
They say, daydreaming is
a bad habit. Go home and sleep.

00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:54.715
Don't they know, every
discovery is initially a dream?

00:05:57.917 --> 00:06:03.201
Sanjay, don't be discouraged.
The world rejects every new idea.

00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:05.253
Then they accept it.

00:06:06.288 --> 00:06:07.518
This will happen with us too.

00:06:10.164 --> 00:06:11.860
Sanjay, is it possible...

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:18.894
Another world of this galaxy
which is millions of miles away...

00:06:20.215 --> 00:06:21.415
Will ever contact us?

00:06:21.722 --> 00:06:24.624
Why not? We went to the moon.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.910
Sent out space shuttles.

00:06:28.127 --> 00:06:31.480
Similarly they want
to know about us.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.214
That is why UFOs are often sighted.

00:06:40.014 --> 00:06:42.069
Why are the lights
switching on and off?

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.026
What is happening?

00:06:55.562 --> 00:06:57.377
Sanjay, look at that.

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:02.402
UFO!

00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:09.352
I can't believe it!

00:07:09.622 --> 00:07:16.342
They didn't believe me
but they've come. Hey!

00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:38.294
No!

00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:41.763
In one moment, all my dreams
were shattered.

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:49.323
The man looking for other worlds
moved on to the next one.

00:07:52.422 --> 00:07:55.032
After his death,
I had no support in Canada.

00:07:56.148 --> 00:08:00.536
Rohit too was very young,
so I came back home here.

00:08:01.024 --> 00:08:07.137
Mrs Mehra, I have understood
the entire case history.

00:08:08.466 --> 00:08:10.432
These are the X-rays
of Rohit's brain.

00:08:11.106 --> 00:08:13.919
Do you see these?
These white spots?

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:15.637
It's called gliosis.

00:08:18.142 --> 00:08:20.442
It is formed when
the brain is hurt.

00:08:21.356 --> 00:08:25.376
But nothing of that sort
ever happened with Rohit.

00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:28.550
It did occur, Mrs Mehra,
when you met with the accident.

00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:33.200
You fell on your belly and
the baby's brain was hurt.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.985
He was in your womb and this
part of his head was damaged.

00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:42.339
This is the reason that
his mental growth isn't normal.

00:08:42.744 --> 00:08:44.618
And he is weak in studies.

00:08:44.926 --> 00:08:49.539
He is 8 but has
the brain of a 2 year old.

00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:55.089
I'm afraid, his mental age will
always lag behind his physical age.

00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:01.187
But Doctor, there must be a cure.

00:09:02.528 --> 00:09:05.416
There is a cure. Brain operation.

00:09:06.622 --> 00:09:09.683
But...
- But what?

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.007
There are very few chances
of success in this case.

00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:18.274
If the operation fails,
his body will be paralysed.

00:09:19.444 --> 00:09:21.671
Or even death!

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:28.571
No, I've lost all I had.

00:09:29.681 --> 00:09:33.968
I have nothing
but Rohit in my life.

00:09:36.614 --> 00:09:37.747
I can't lose him.

00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:50.384
'He is 8 but has
the brain of a 2 year old.'

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.660
'His mental age will always
lag behind his physical age.'

00:10:20.744 --> 00:10:23.407
Rohit!
- Sorry, uncle Sukhwani.

00:10:23.527 --> 00:10:26.894
You keep breaking my window panes
with your ball.

00:10:27.014 --> 00:10:28.740
This is my last warning!

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.889
One more pane breaks and
I'll have you locked up!

00:10:32.085 --> 00:10:34.912
Sorry, my foot! Shameless!

00:10:39.644 --> 00:10:41.129
Rohit!

00:10:43.303 --> 00:10:45.897
What did I ever do to you?

00:10:46.017 --> 00:10:49.842
You broke my window pane again!
- I did but I also apologise.

00:10:50.021 --> 00:10:52.106
Are you doing me
a favour by saying sorry?

00:10:52.473 --> 00:10:54.903
I've been listening to
your apologies all these years!

00:10:55.023 --> 00:10:57.686
This time I won't spare you!
I'm coming down!

00:10:57.806 --> 00:10:59.697
Now what?
- Don't be scared.

00:10:59.817 --> 00:11:00.836
Let him come.

00:11:00.956 --> 00:11:05.164
Dear God, look at this state!

00:11:05.284 --> 00:11:10.482
Broke the panes on top and bottom.

00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:12.932
Sunlight and rain enter in.

00:11:13.052 --> 00:11:15.918
Dust and dirt in and I'm out!

00:11:16.106 --> 00:11:20.442
Don't worry, uncle.
When I grow up, I'll fix it up.

00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:23.440
Great? How much more will you grow?

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.397
You're already as tall as a tree!

00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:27.160
Will you grow as tall
as the Eiffel Tower?

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.213
Don't insult our friend.

00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:32.725
We'll fix all your panes.
- Then do it!

00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:35.470
First give me Rs 500.
- What? Rs 500?

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.195
Why? - To buy new glass.
Give us the cash.

00:11:38.353 --> 00:11:40.297
Yes, pay up.

00:11:40.417 --> 00:11:44.268
Asking me for cash!
Run or I'll beat you up!

00:11:44.388 --> 00:11:45.814
Blackmailing me!

00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:51.188
Rohit, hurry up.
You'll be late for school.

00:11:51.826 --> 00:11:55.159
Today is an important day.
I'm going to a new class.

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:58.994
Seventh standard.
God, take care of me.

00:11:59.812 --> 00:12:00.840
Please dear, God.

00:12:03.483 --> 00:12:05.922
Did you never go to school?

00:12:06.845 --> 00:12:09.097
You don't take old
books to a new class.

00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:11.581
I'll get new books
in the seventh standard.

00:12:13.653 --> 00:12:16.033
You're not going to the 7th.
- Why?

00:12:16.326 --> 00:12:17.541
My friends are going.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:21.992
You failed.

00:12:26.728 --> 00:12:27.817
I failed again!

00:12:29.573 --> 00:12:30.601
Yes.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.392
I'll never go to school. Never!

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.078
The teacher is very bad.
I study so hard!

00:12:38.198 --> 00:12:40.997
Yet he fails me.
He passed all the others.

00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:43.276
I won't go! Why should I go?

00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:45.355
I won't go!

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:51.882
Study harder this year.
You will pass.

00:12:52.002 --> 00:12:53.048
No.

00:12:54.164 --> 00:12:57.789
New boys will come to my class.
Once again they'll tease me.

00:12:58.292 --> 00:13:01.025
They'll poke fun at me.
Call me tall bloke and names.

00:13:01.595 --> 00:13:04.973
So I won't go to school.
I don't want the books!

00:13:10.656 --> 00:13:12.772
How can you say that?

00:13:13.925 --> 00:13:16.777
Promoting Rohit to
the 7th standard is impossible.

00:13:17.407 --> 00:13:19.201
In fact, he shouldn't
be studying in this school.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.135
There are special schools
for such children.

00:13:23.885 --> 00:13:25.844
But there's no such
school in this city.

00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:32.494
I'm trying to get a
transfer to Delhi.

00:13:33.602 --> 00:13:36.019
Delhi has special schools
for children like Rohit.

00:13:37.805 --> 00:13:42.211
The chairman of the bank
I work for has promised me.

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:47.098
Sir, it's a matter of a year.

00:13:48.524 --> 00:13:49.643
Please?

00:13:50.964 --> 00:13:53.155
Do me one last favour.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.369
Teachers don't do
favours for children.

00:13:57.793 --> 00:14:03.406
Promoting him in this way
won't help him at all.

00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:10.026
Father, I know Rohit can never
become what I want him to...

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.198
Or what his dad wanted for him.

00:14:17.268 --> 00:14:20.547
But for his happiness...

00:14:22.168 --> 00:14:23.226
Please.

00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:24.998
For his smile...

00:14:26.725 --> 00:14:27.963
Okay, Mrs Mehra.

00:14:31.318 --> 00:14:32.399
This is the last time.

00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:35.807
Yes, boys?

00:14:36.572 --> 00:14:38.607
If X = 12

00:14:39.327 --> 00:14:41.143
and Y = 8,

00:14:41.758 --> 00:14:45.459
How much is X + 3Y?
Solve it in your answer books.

00:14:50.376 --> 00:14:51.487
Sir?

00:14:55.278 --> 00:14:56.329
Yes, Rohit.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.911
What is X + 3Y =?

00:14:59.196 --> 00:15:00.450
Show me your answer.

00:15:14.465 --> 00:15:15.568
Very good.

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:18.861
You are right.
- Really, sir?

00:15:19.138 --> 00:15:23.086
But the next time, you should
be the first to raise your hand.

00:15:53.245 --> 00:15:58.232
"When I see the flight of birds
flying high..."

00:15:58.352 --> 00:16:03.264
"I dream of touching the sky."

00:16:03.384 --> 00:16:13.604
"With our feet rooted,
our dreams will take us high."

00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:42.263
Train!

00:16:48.304 --> 00:16:57.820
"Tell me, how we will go there
without wings?"

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.742
"Anything is possible,
anything can happen."

00:17:03.862 --> 00:17:09.315
"All you should do is
trust yourself."

00:17:13.427 --> 00:17:23.870
"Tell me, how will we go
there without any wings?"

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:29.202
"Anything is possible.
Anything can happen."

00:17:29.322 --> 00:17:34.062
"All you should do is
trust yourself."

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:09.462
"Believe me, one
day you will see..."

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.222
"Will only be my day."

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:24.829
"Everybody in the world
would want to be my friend."

00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:34.926
"Believe me, one
day you will see..."

00:18:35.046 --> 00:18:39.780
"Will only be your day."

00:18:39.966 --> 00:18:50.797
"Everybody in the world
would want to be my friend."

00:18:55.630 --> 00:19:00.464
"Your life will be
filled with all the happiness."

00:19:00.584 --> 00:19:05.574
"One day, your life will change."

00:19:05.694 --> 00:19:10.709
"The sky will be the limit
to your success."

00:19:10.829 --> 00:19:16.084
"There'll be none like you here."

00:19:26.246 --> 00:19:31.193
"When I see the flight of birds
flying high,"

00:19:31.313 --> 00:19:36.105
"I dream of touching the sky."

00:19:36.315 --> 00:19:46.640
"With our feet rooted,
our dreams will take us high."

00:19:49.049 --> 00:19:54.395
"Our dreams will take us high."

00:20:28.648 --> 00:20:30.081
Why are you shaking your head?

00:20:30.339 --> 00:20:32.415
You're 6 feet tall and hanging out
with these little kids.

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.691
Have you no shame? Move aside.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.083
We came here first.
- Yes.

00:20:39.337 --> 00:20:41.842
We'll go first. Move your bikes.

00:20:42.048 --> 00:20:43.917
Fool, our bikes don't
have reverse gears.

00:20:44.037 --> 00:20:46.307
Shall we fit them?
You'll only be going in reverse.

00:20:50.035 --> 00:20:52.721
He's started talking too much.

00:20:53.275 --> 00:20:58.106
These dogs are barking too much.
Let's give them a shot today.

00:20:58.487 --> 00:21:02.039
Formula number?
- 320.

00:21:14.404 --> 00:21:15.604
Catch him!

00:21:21.347 --> 00:21:22.447
Take this!

00:21:27.347 --> 00:21:28.720
'STOP'

00:21:59.649 --> 00:22:01.665
Move aside!

00:22:24.207 --> 00:22:25.328
Good morning.

00:22:26.172 --> 00:22:30.106
If you don't mind,
may I ask where you're rushing?

00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:32.661
Driving in a No Entry road.
Are you crazy?

00:22:32.839 --> 00:22:34.459
Sir, he threw down
our bikes and ran away.

00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:37.586
That's no excuse
to break traffic rules.

00:22:38.367 --> 00:22:40.647
Write them a receipt.
- Yes, sir.

00:22:40.767 --> 00:22:41.815
Excuse me, sir?

00:22:42.411 --> 00:22:44.079
You're probably
not aware of who I am.

00:22:44.253 --> 00:22:49.209
You're the son of the
Collector Harbans Saxena.

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:54.937
Charge him with a double fine,
and print
this news in the local daily.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.480
Everyone must know
when Inspector Khan is in charge...

00:23:00.015 --> 00:23:01.731
Nobody can break the law.

00:23:02.361 --> 00:23:05.553
Whether he's the collector's son
or the collector himself.

00:23:07.005 --> 00:23:08.913
I hope you've got the message.

00:23:09.609 --> 00:23:10.647
Good day.

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:14.817
Colonel, come out!

00:23:15.969 --> 00:23:17.679
Harbans, you fool!

00:23:17.961 --> 00:23:20.649
Never saw a bigger duffer than you!

00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:22.473
You didn't come to
the station to receive me!

00:23:22.617 --> 00:23:27.483
There can be no bigger idiot
than you in the world!

00:23:27.825 --> 00:23:31.611
You sent a fax that you're coming.
But how and when?

00:23:31.731 --> 00:23:35.439
Idiot, where to receive you?
- Show some consideration.

00:23:35.619 --> 00:23:37.155
Guests aren't welcomed with abuse.

00:23:37.275 --> 00:23:41.673
This guy is just too stupid.
Now he's standing still. Hug me.

00:23:46.727 --> 00:23:50.583
My pal, nice to meet you.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.346
He came here after retirement
to spend his life with his pal.

00:23:55.466 --> 00:23:58.185
The friendship will be
celebrated for a whole year.

00:23:58.305 --> 00:24:03.294
Starting with a grand party
at my house tonight.

00:24:03.414 --> 00:24:05.357
Thank you, Harbans.

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:08.340
Take a seat.
- Yes.

00:24:09.624 --> 00:24:14.469
Lost in catching up with you,
I forgot the most important thing.

00:24:14.589 --> 00:24:19.312
What is it?
- Where is my little doll?

00:24:19.432 --> 00:24:23.297
Your little doll has now grown up.

00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:24.579
Is it?

00:24:24.786 --> 00:24:26.577
But where is she?

00:24:32.108 --> 00:24:33.711
Hello!

00:24:33.917 --> 00:24:35.426
Hello!

00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:39.332
Hello! Hello!

00:24:43.686 --> 00:24:46.047
Why are you late?
We'd have missed the bus.

00:24:46.167 --> 00:24:48.972
I'm not late.
The bus will come after 5 minutes.

00:24:49.092 --> 00:24:51.453
The film is 3 ½ hours long.

00:24:51.573 --> 00:24:55.665
That long!
- Long films are in fashion.

00:24:56.124 --> 00:24:58.562
The bus is here!
- Run!

00:24:58.682 --> 00:25:00.258
Stop the Bus!
Run!

00:25:00.378 --> 00:25:02.114
Run! Hurry!

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:04.449
Stop!
- Darn! We missed the bus!

00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:07.572
Missed the bus and
film holiday ruined.

00:25:12.857 --> 00:25:15.462
Excuse me?
- Yes, please?

00:25:15.719 --> 00:25:19.279
I'm new to this city. Can you
tell me where Shanti Villa is?

00:25:19.399 --> 00:25:23.041
Yes, it is...
- It's this way.

00:25:23.539 --> 00:25:25.771
But Shanti Villa is...
- Empty jeep!

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:29.371
The girl seems naive,
she'll be of use to us.

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:32.107
Oh!
- Yes!

00:25:32.227 --> 00:25:34.057
We'll take you there.
- Let's go.

00:25:34.177 --> 00:25:34.993
Great.

00:25:35.113 --> 00:25:39.332
Hurrah! Get in, everyone.

00:25:39.452 --> 00:25:41.430
Hurrah!
- Hurry!

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.752
Come on, let's go.
- Thank you.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.584
So sweet of you all.
- Very sweet.

00:25:47.778 --> 00:25:50.394
My name is Nisha. What's yours?

00:25:50.688 --> 00:25:52.272
Right.
- Right?

00:25:52.392 --> 00:25:54.582
Turn Right!
- Go right!

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.152
What places are worth seeing here?

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.942
Many. - Sunset point,
China Beach, Chidiya Ghar.

00:26:01.062 --> 00:26:02.958
Lal Bazaar.
- Tea Garden.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:07.284
I mean the night life.
What do people do at night?

00:26:07.572 --> 00:26:09.120
They sleep.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.372
Good sense of humour.

00:26:12.492 --> 00:26:15.294
Seriously.
Isn't there a night club or disco?

00:26:15.414 --> 00:26:17.168
There is but kids aren't allowed.

00:26:17.288 --> 00:26:18.915
Yes.
- Kids?

00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:21.158
Go left!
- Left.

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:24.992
Stop! Stop!

00:26:25.112 --> 00:26:26.732
Stop!
- Stop!

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.195
We are there.

00:26:28.315 --> 00:26:29.980
Get off!
- Hurry!

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.060
Hurry!

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.478
Hurry!
- Hey!

00:26:32.658 --> 00:26:35.178
I don't see Shanti Villa.
- This is a cinema house.

00:26:35.298 --> 00:26:36.370
Cinema?

00:26:36.558 --> 00:26:38.185
But I want to go to...
- Yes, we know.

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:39.700
You want to go to Shanti Villa.
- Yes.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.180
But we wanted to see the theatre.

00:26:43.337 --> 00:26:46.516
Shanti Villa isn't far.
- First right then left...

00:26:46.636 --> 00:26:48.526
Followed by right
and left and left.

00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:50.274
There comes Shanti Villa.

00:26:50.446 --> 00:26:52.922
So you wanted a lift.

00:26:53.139 --> 00:26:55.051
Yes, aunty!
- Yes, aunty!

00:26:55.276 --> 00:26:57.338
Aunty?
- Thank you, aunty.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.975
You ought to be ashamed!
You fool people with these kids!

00:27:01.755 --> 00:27:04.245
And you laugh!
- Not at you.

00:27:04.365 --> 00:27:08.362
I'm laughing at your nose
which wobbles when you yell.

00:27:08.482 --> 00:27:11.219
Like air rushing out of a balloon!

00:27:11.707 --> 00:27:12.831
Let's go.

00:27:12.951 --> 00:27:14.708
Bye!
- How dare you?

00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:18.411
You shouldn't have done that.

00:27:18.749 --> 00:27:23.069
You should help if somebody
asks for help, not fool them.

00:27:23.189 --> 00:27:28.835
We'd have missed the film.
- I read the Gita to you.

00:27:29.994 --> 00:27:35.394
What did I say? God always
helps those who help others.

00:27:35.777 --> 00:27:38.537
Didn't I say that?
- Yes, you did.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.184
I'd forgotten.

00:27:42.676 --> 00:27:46.966
Promise, you'll apologise to
the girl when you see her next.

00:27:47.588 --> 00:27:49.313
You'll say sorry.
- Okay.

00:27:54.723 --> 00:27:55.893
Mother, what's this?

00:27:57.571 --> 00:27:59.581
It's a computer your father made.

00:28:00.489 --> 00:28:02.957
Dad made a computer!
- Yes.

00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:06.572
Through the computer
and instruments he made...

00:28:07.045 --> 00:28:11.155
He'd talk to people living
far away on the stars.

00:28:12.944 --> 00:28:14.339
Do people live on the stars?

00:28:15.906 --> 00:28:16.949
Yes.

00:28:27.764 --> 00:28:30.005
Mother, I can't see them.

00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:35.851
There are many things
that can't be seen.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.620
But they exist.

00:28:47.109 --> 00:28:48.561
What?
- Party.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.581
Isn't that true?

00:28:51.701 --> 00:28:53.298
Too good!

00:28:53.846 --> 00:28:54.891
Amazing!

00:28:56.579 --> 00:29:00.272
Even today, your jokes are funny.

00:29:01.208 --> 00:29:02.732
Hasn't anything changed
in all these years?

00:29:02.852 --> 00:29:07.528
It has. Look at Raj.
He was little and now he's so tall.

00:29:07.764 --> 00:29:09.574
I'm sure somebody pulled his legs.

00:29:09.694 --> 00:29:11.439
Hey! Look who is talking.

00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:14.045
Even she used to be little and fat.

00:29:14.165 --> 00:29:17.448
Always crying, mummy!
- Hey, what rubbish! Raj!

00:29:17.846 --> 00:29:21.809
You've met after years
and are still fighting.

00:29:21.929 --> 00:29:22.986
Come on, mom.

00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:24.582
Fights bring us closer.

00:29:24.702 --> 00:29:26.028
Right?
- Right.

00:29:29.437 --> 00:29:31.765
Wow.

00:29:35.602 --> 00:29:36.560
That is Rahul.
- Hey Rahul!

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.589
Hi.
- That's Monty.

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:38.511
Hello.

00:29:38.631 --> 00:29:40.528
That's Kimi.
- Hi.

00:29:41.615 --> 00:29:43.550
Girlfriend?
- No. Only a friend.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:53.512
Man will sing praise of God
if he gets food on time.

00:29:53.632 --> 00:29:54.918
Great. Pour some more.

00:29:57.233 --> 00:29:58.395
Let's go.

00:29:59.151 --> 00:30:03.977
It's the age to eat. I see chicken
but where's the 'papad'?

00:30:04.097 --> 00:30:05.600
Excuse me?
- There's a queue.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.127
I'll come back later.
- Take this.

00:30:07.382 --> 00:30:08.600
Wow.

00:30:12.962 --> 00:30:14.158
Is this mutton?
- Yes.

00:30:14.278 --> 00:30:15.780
I eat it. Serve me more.

00:30:16.194 --> 00:30:18.503
More. That's it.
- Give us some food.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.131
You took a plate full.
- That's gone down.

00:30:23.251 --> 00:30:24.675
Where?
- Here.

00:30:24.795 --> 00:30:25.854
Good God.

00:30:25.974 --> 00:30:27.820
What a belly.
- Serve this.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.383
300 million in our country live
under the poverty line.

00:30:31.503 --> 00:30:33.925
They don't get to see
a handful of rice.

00:30:34.045 --> 00:30:35.758
And you eat 2 plates!

00:30:35.878 --> 00:30:37.276
Does it pinch your pocket?

00:30:37.847 --> 00:30:41.205
That is true.
- Serve some more.

00:30:43.614 --> 00:30:46.788
Bittu, I want more.
- Hold on.

00:30:47.522 --> 00:30:49.857
Holy smoke! Run! - I think
we should just let the boys drink.

00:30:49.977 --> 00:30:51.334
I'm famished.
- Yes.

00:30:51.721 --> 00:30:52.740
Bittu?

00:30:54.993 --> 00:30:56.007
Pass some food!

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:00.960
You?
- Holy smoke!

00:31:04.185 --> 00:31:04.995
Oh my God!

00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:06.094
Somebody apprehend him!

00:31:06.214 --> 00:31:07.261
Catch him!

00:31:07.381 --> 00:31:08.437
Ah!

00:31:15.391 --> 00:31:16.415
Stupid. Idiot.

00:31:16.705 --> 00:31:18.896
What does he think of himself?
Ruined my hair!

00:31:19.446 --> 00:31:20.980
Let me get my hands on him...

00:31:22.936 --> 00:31:23.985
I won't spare him!

00:32:15.699 --> 00:32:16.662
Hey! Rohit!

00:32:16.912 --> 00:32:18.507
What are you doing?
What are you stealing?

00:32:18.627 --> 00:32:20.907
No, I was saying sorry.

00:32:21.111 --> 00:32:23.897
What?
- See how he says sorry.

00:32:24.254 --> 00:32:26.169
Sticking gum to the seat.

00:32:26.378 --> 00:32:27.596
No.
- Oh!

00:32:29.078 --> 00:32:30.876
Sticking gum.

00:32:31.532 --> 00:32:32.712
Raj? Raj!

00:32:32.832 --> 00:32:33.700
He's the same boy.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.323
He's the boy!

00:32:36.374 --> 00:32:38.627
Scoundrel! Acting too smart!

00:32:38.973 --> 00:32:42.388
First you mess with us.
Now you tease girls.

00:32:42.684 --> 00:32:45.835
He's the boy who took me
to the movie hall instead of home.

00:32:45.987 --> 00:32:48.019
He even threw food on my head!

00:32:48.382 --> 00:32:52.292
That's nothing. Your hair
would be cut if he succeeded.

00:32:52.444 --> 00:32:53.703
Look at the chewing gum!

00:32:56.742 --> 00:33:00.990
My God! Such an innocent
face and so roguish!

00:33:01.652 --> 00:33:04.138
He should be handed to the police!

00:33:05.148 --> 00:33:09.137
No point handing him to
the police for a minor thing.

00:33:09.941 --> 00:33:12.499
We'll let him go.
Raj, what do you say?

00:33:15.056 --> 00:33:16.106
Run.

00:33:17.073 --> 00:33:18.082
Go on.

00:33:19.392 --> 00:33:20.401
Go on.

00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:26.033
Why are you letting him go?
He should be taught a lesson.

00:33:47.542 --> 00:33:50.912
Don't beat me. I was telling the
truth. I only wanted to apologise.

00:34:06.569 --> 00:34:08.804
Champion of the scooter?

00:35:13.824 --> 00:35:16.799
Actually, Nisha,
that mad guy can't be blamed.

00:35:17.446 --> 00:35:19.575
Anyone could lose
their sanity looking at you.

00:35:21.104 --> 00:35:23.361
Really? Trying to flirt?

00:35:24.639 --> 00:35:27.624
No but sometimes
the truth does slip out.

00:35:27.975 --> 00:35:31.439
Now he won't mess up.
He's got punished severely.

00:35:31.939 --> 00:35:33.350
Well, he deserves that.

00:35:33.564 --> 00:35:36.453
No. He deserves to be amongst you.

00:35:37.503 --> 00:35:39.485
He deserves to
be educated like you.

00:35:40.442 --> 00:35:43.254
He deserves to be blessed
with an adult mind like you all.

00:35:44.227 --> 00:35:46.107
But my son isn't like you.

00:35:47.433 --> 00:35:49.879
Because God didn't
make him like you.

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:55.712
He is grown up
but has the mind of a child.

00:35:56.665 --> 00:35:58.794
An innocent child.

00:35:59.685 --> 00:36:01.916
Who doesn't know the difference
between good and bad.

00:36:04.524 --> 00:36:06.954
You thrashed him black and blue.

00:36:07.591 --> 00:36:09.002
You broke his scooter.

00:36:09.828 --> 00:36:11.794
Assuming he's teasing a girl!

00:36:13.658 --> 00:36:18.045
He'd come to apologise not
tease or trouble you.

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:21.372
Look at this.
He came to apologise to you!

00:36:22.581 --> 00:36:25.694
Anyway, I can't complain to you.

00:36:26.866 --> 00:36:28.328
Because you're new to the city.

00:36:29.963 --> 00:36:33.095
But Raj knows everything.

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.301
Once he too was in Rohit's class.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.728
He went ahead because he's normal.

00:36:40.406 --> 00:36:41.761
But my son remained there.

00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:43.880
But you know something?

00:36:44.598 --> 00:36:46.162
I have no regrets about it.

00:36:47.334 --> 00:36:48.388
No regrets at all.

00:36:48.913 --> 00:36:53.378
If normal people are like you
then I am glad...

00:36:54.152 --> 00:36:58.050
That my son Rohit is abnormal.
I am happy!

00:37:10.601 --> 00:37:12.796
'Sorry, Rohit!'

00:37:13.061 --> 00:37:14.448
Good morning, brother.

00:37:14.568 --> 00:37:15.810
Good morning, brother.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.867
Good morning, brother.
- Good morning.

00:37:23.573 --> 00:37:24.602
Rohit?

00:37:25.484 --> 00:37:27.135
What are you doing in
computer class?

00:37:27.909 --> 00:37:29.728
Sir, he's taken computers
as the optional class.

00:37:29.876 --> 00:37:30.885
Shut up.

00:37:31.005 --> 00:37:32.219
Sit in your seat.

00:37:35.337 --> 00:37:37.135
Sir, I too want to learn computers.

00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:40.080
You need brains to
learn about computers.

00:37:40.381 --> 00:37:44.334
You're so clever that
you're still in the 7th.

00:37:45.088 --> 00:37:48.019
My dad was a great scientist.
He had a computer!

00:37:48.946 --> 00:37:52.920
I want to be like dad.
- Then learn from your dad!

00:37:55.101 --> 00:37:56.232
He's not in this world.

00:37:56.476 --> 00:38:01.233
Then learn in the world he is!
Don't chew my brains! Get out!

00:38:04.285 --> 00:38:05.309
Get out!

00:38:43.277 --> 00:38:44.505
A1 cycle!

00:38:46.634 --> 00:38:48.565
Mother!

00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:53.695
Did you get this cycle for me?
- Yes.

00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:57.638
Thank you, it's great. A1!

00:38:57.801 --> 00:38:58.866
Thank you, mother.

00:38:59.059 --> 00:39:01.943
Thank her. She got it for you.

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:13.239
I won't say thank you or sorry.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.850
I don't want the cycle.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:15.990
Rohit.

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:20.000
See that?

00:39:35.609 --> 00:39:38.837
It's true that I was wrong.

00:39:40.157 --> 00:39:45.858
But how was I to know you wanted
to apologise not make mischief?

00:39:47.391 --> 00:39:51.392
Forget what happened.
Now let me apologise to you.

00:39:52.204 --> 00:39:53.289
Sorry.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:04.864
Not me alone but Raj, Monty
and the others too will say sorry.

00:40:05.628 --> 00:40:08.007
Henceforth nobody will trouble you.

00:40:11.017 --> 00:40:16.237
What if somebody does?
- We'll beat them up together.

00:40:16.357 --> 00:40:18.778
Goodness! You too?
- Yes.

00:40:19.267 --> 00:40:21.036
We're now friends.
- Really?

00:40:21.188 --> 00:40:22.319
Truly!

00:40:23.083 --> 00:40:24.209
Friend's!

00:40:31.703 --> 00:40:32.594
Sorry.

00:40:32.752 --> 00:40:33.623
It's okay.

00:40:34.087 --> 00:40:35.891
All of you must apologise to Rohit.

00:40:36.011 --> 00:40:37.623
So sweet.
- Sorry Rohit.

00:40:37.743 --> 00:40:39.049
Sorry.
- Hi Rohit.

00:40:39.169 --> 00:40:40.765
Hi.
- Sorry Rohit.

00:40:40.885 --> 00:40:41.942
It's okay.

00:40:42.062 --> 00:40:45.346
What did I tell you?
Now are you happy?

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:49.408
Hear me out, everyone.
Henceforth, no fights or mischief.

00:40:49.528 --> 00:40:50.977
Only friendship.

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:55.958
Hey come, Nisha. Let's dance.

00:40:56.078 --> 00:40:57.185
Be a moment, Rohit.

00:41:06.843 --> 00:41:08.580
Rohit, let's go and dance.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.248
I don't know how to dance.
- There's nothing to it.

00:41:12.368 --> 00:41:15.903
Hold the body like
this and move to the music.

00:41:16.023 --> 00:41:17.263
No, I'm scared.

00:41:17.383 --> 00:41:20.371
There's nothing to fear.
I'll teach you.

00:41:20.491 --> 00:41:23.993
I never learnt it.
- You're breaking in sweat.

00:41:24.113 --> 00:41:27.172
Yes, a little.

00:41:27.549 --> 00:41:28.675
Have a coke.

00:41:29.158 --> 00:41:31.012
One coke.

00:41:38.537 --> 00:41:41.589
Here, this will get rid of
the fear and the sweat.

00:41:41.709 --> 00:41:44.601
Now I'm fine.
- Just a little.

00:41:46.994 --> 00:41:50.458
It's horrid. Don't want it.
- It's nice. Have it.

00:41:50.578 --> 00:41:53.439
Drink it. Then we'll dance.

00:41:54.692 --> 00:41:56.204
What nonsense is this?

00:41:56.403 --> 00:41:59.842
You're giving him alcohol!
- A little Bacardi won't hurt.

00:42:00.158 --> 00:42:03.022
He's no kid.
- What did I tell you?

00:42:03.142 --> 00:42:06.700
Don't trouble Rohit but you...
Shame on you guys!

00:42:06.985 --> 00:42:08.065
Let's go.

00:42:09.186 --> 00:42:10.271
Rohit?

00:42:53.457 --> 00:42:56.427
"I stagger when I go here and
I stagger when I go there."

00:42:56.547 --> 00:42:59.734
"I don't know where am I
heading to."

00:42:59.854 --> 00:43:02.862
"I stagger when I go here and
I stagger when I go there."

00:43:02.982 --> 00:43:05.735
"I don't know where am I
heading to."

00:43:05.855 --> 00:43:09.830
"Oh, I tripped!"

00:43:09.979 --> 00:43:13.377
"What have you done?"

00:43:27.025 --> 00:43:30.023
"I stagger when I go here and
I stagger when I go there."

00:43:30.143 --> 00:43:33.264
"I don't know where am I
heading to."

00:43:33.384 --> 00:43:36.494
"I stagger when I go here and
I stagger when I go there."

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:39.296
"I don't know where am I going."

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:43.467
"Oh, I tripped!"

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:46.610
"Just like you did."

00:44:26.099 --> 00:44:29.639
"Who has cast a spell on us?"

00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:35.284
"Who has cast a spell on us?"

00:44:35.404 --> 00:44:38.755
"Is that why we tripped
while walking?"

00:44:38.875 --> 00:44:45.465
"What changed all of a sudden
while we were laughing?"

00:44:51.702 --> 00:44:54.531
"Who has cast a spell on us?"

00:44:54.651 --> 00:44:58.056
"Is this why we slipped?"

00:44:58.176 --> 00:45:04.096
"What changed all of sudden
while we were laughing?"

00:45:04.216 --> 00:45:07.091
"Why did we change?"

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:10.574
"We just did."

00:45:11.022 --> 00:45:14.086
"I stagger when I go here and
I stagger when I go there."

00:45:14.206 --> 00:45:16.932
"I don't know where I'm going."

00:45:17.052 --> 00:45:21.048
"Oh, I tripped!"

00:45:21.168 --> 00:45:24.580
"What have you done?"

00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:16.139
"Why are you so innocent?"

00:46:16.259 --> 00:46:19.354
"You are saying that
because you're so nice."

00:46:19.474 --> 00:46:22.428
"Why do you say that I'm nice?"

00:46:22.548 --> 00:46:26.396
"Why do I tell you that?"

00:46:32.209 --> 00:46:35.323
"Why are you so innocent?"

00:46:35.443 --> 00:46:38.478
"You are saying that
because you're so nice."

00:46:38.598 --> 00:46:41.642
"Tell me why am I nice."

00:46:41.762 --> 00:46:44.776
"Why should I tell you?"

00:46:44.896 --> 00:46:47.931
"Tell me something at least."

00:46:48.051 --> 00:46:51.701
"Why should I tell you?"

00:46:51.821 --> 00:46:54.646
"I stagger when I go here and
I stagger when I go there."

00:46:54.964 --> 00:46:57.730
"I don't know where am I
heading to."

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:01.880
"Oh, I tripped!"

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.040
"Just like you did."

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.273
"I stagger when I go here and
I stagger when I go there."

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:12.079
"I don't know where I'm going."

00:47:12.199 --> 00:47:16.884
"Oh, I tripped!"

00:47:22.794 --> 00:47:25.869
"What have you done?"

00:47:25.989 --> 00:47:29.102
"I tripped just like you did."

00:47:29.222 --> 00:47:32.276
"What have you done?"

00:47:32.396 --> 00:47:35.689
"I did too,
while walking with you."

00:47:40.744 --> 00:47:43.610
Mr. Sukhwani.
- What is it?

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:46.774
Yes?
- What madness is this?

00:47:46.973 --> 00:47:49.112
Your son is responsible for it.

00:47:49.371 --> 00:47:52.704
I've got accustomed to living in
a house with broken panes.

00:47:52.824 --> 00:47:54.962
Wind, water, I had everything.

00:47:55.082 --> 00:47:58.962
Even sunlight.
Since I fixed the panes...

00:47:59.082 --> 00:48:00.256
I feel suffocated.

00:48:00.376 --> 00:48:02.823
But why do you have
to break the glass?

00:48:03.352 --> 00:48:06.211
You could've opened the window.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.383
The thought never struck me.

00:48:09.948 --> 00:48:13.027
That's a good idea. Shame on me.

00:48:13.147 --> 00:48:16.403
I'm the first Sindhi
who made a loss for himself.

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:20.258
Really?
- Yes, Nisha is your girlfriend.

00:48:20.378 --> 00:48:21.187
How?

00:48:21.307 --> 00:48:23.161
She gave you a cycle.
- Yes.

00:48:23.281 --> 00:48:25.817
And took you to the disco.
- Yes and danced with me.

00:48:25.937 --> 00:48:28.052
Then she took you home and said,
good night, Rohit.

00:48:28.172 --> 00:48:30.909
Yes.
- Kissed you good night?

00:48:31.184 --> 00:48:34.252
No.
- Then she's not his girlfriend.

00:48:34.372 --> 00:48:35.392
Why?

00:48:35.812 --> 00:48:37.423
They become a couple...

00:48:37.543 --> 00:48:39.719
When they kiss!

00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:41.504
Now what should he do?

00:48:41.624 --> 00:48:46.289
My mom is right. All men are fools!

00:48:46.582 --> 00:48:51.187
Don't you know you have
to be friends before kissing?

00:48:51.352 --> 00:48:55.372
I want to meet your mother.
She thinks we're all fools!

00:48:55.492 --> 00:48:57.652
Yes!
- Rohit, what you can do...

00:48:57.772 --> 00:48:59.249
Is give her a present.

00:48:59.969 --> 00:49:01.829
But I have no money.

00:49:02.166 --> 00:49:03.598
Mother gives me only a buck.

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:08.225
I have an idea!
You can give her a flower.

00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:10.881
Nisha?

00:49:12.223 --> 00:49:16.018
Dear, you spoke about
a mentally challenged boy.

00:49:16.138 --> 00:49:19.041
Yes.
- There's an article on the net.

00:49:19.378 --> 00:49:24.993
I got a printout.
It says treat such guys with love.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.306
That's their cure.

00:49:44.171 --> 00:49:45.274
Rohit.

00:49:46.992 --> 00:49:48.342
What are you doing?

00:49:49.678 --> 00:49:50.885
Come on up.

00:49:58.053 --> 00:50:00.746
Why are you hiding the flower?
- I'm not.

00:50:02.066 --> 00:50:03.386
It's a present for you.

00:50:06.134 --> 00:50:07.557
How sweet!

00:50:09.295 --> 00:50:10.435
Thank you.

00:50:11.652 --> 00:50:14.261
Why are you blushing?

00:50:15.794 --> 00:50:21.401
My friends say,
if a girl kisses a boy...

00:50:21.986 --> 00:50:24.082
They become a couple.

00:50:24.634 --> 00:50:27.919
Your friends are right.
I am your girlfriend.

00:50:28.039 --> 00:50:29.473
Really?
- Truly!

00:50:32.637 --> 00:50:33.457
'Nisha!'

00:50:33.577 --> 00:50:35.721
Yes, dad?
- I'll take your leave.

00:50:36.017 --> 00:50:39.562
Come in. My parents
will be happy to meet you.

00:50:41.474 --> 00:50:43.256
Dad? Mom? This is Rohit.

00:50:43.549 --> 00:50:44.928
Hello, Rohit.
- Hello, sir.

00:50:47.283 --> 00:50:49.455
Rohit, would you like
to drink some tea or coffee?

00:50:50.211 --> 00:50:51.675
Bournvita.
- Bournvita?

00:50:51.899 --> 00:50:54.066
Bournvita?
- Bournvita?

00:50:54.434 --> 00:50:56.693
Bournvita is necessary
for energy and strength.

00:50:56.813 --> 00:50:59.865
I'm in the seventh
but I am the tallest in class.

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.239
All because of Bournvita.

00:51:04.396 --> 00:51:08.187
Sorry, Rohit. We don't have it.
- You don't?

00:51:08.898 --> 00:51:09.992
You should have it
and drink it everyday.

00:51:10.112 --> 00:51:11.185
Right, we'll get it today.

00:51:11.305 --> 00:51:12.817
And we'll drink it too.
- Good.

00:51:13.246 --> 00:51:16.336
Sir, call from the collector.

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:17.954
Tell him I'm coming.

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:22.008
Nisha, save this page.
I'll be back soon. - Okay.

00:51:34.142 --> 00:51:36.026
Do you know anything
about computers. - Yes.

00:51:36.545 --> 00:51:39.829
I also know that you
want to learn computers.

00:51:41.133 --> 00:51:43.300
Will you teach me?
- Of course.

00:51:43.569 --> 00:51:45.811
Let's go home.
My dad has a computer!

00:51:58.946 --> 00:52:02.067
The stars...
- Dad was a great scientist.

00:52:02.322 --> 00:52:04.595
He spoke to people
living on the stars.

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:06.235
Really?
- Of course.

00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:09.297
Press enter to continue.

00:52:10.351 --> 00:52:11.384
Enter.

00:52:13.344 --> 00:52:14.425
What's this?

00:52:16.938 --> 00:52:17.944
Don't know.

00:52:18.572 --> 00:52:20.755
Must be your dad's project.

00:52:21.228 --> 00:52:22.807
'Press key B'

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.272
See, 'Press B' is flashing.

00:52:31.411 --> 00:52:34.084
Nothing is happening.
- There's B here too.

00:52:35.612 --> 00:52:37.018
Let's connect this to that.

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:38.391
Okay.

00:52:51.695 --> 00:52:52.705
Good.

00:52:57.502 --> 00:52:58.599
Wow.

00:53:01.479 --> 00:53:02.549
Press C.

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:08.618
Amazing.

00:53:09.757 --> 00:53:10.843
Press F.

00:53:14.415 --> 00:53:15.464
Press E.

00:53:21.788 --> 00:53:24.860
How did you play this?
- I know this tune.

00:53:25.057 --> 00:53:27.053
Mother taught me. Want to hear?

00:53:36.531 --> 00:53:37.544
Fabulous!

00:53:37.664 --> 00:53:40.857
Teach me too.
- It's easy. Give me your hand.

00:54:23.916 --> 00:54:30.184
"My dreams and fantasies
have found a face in you."

00:54:35.364 --> 00:54:41.945
"My dreams and fantasies
have found a face in you."

00:54:42.536 --> 00:54:46.345
"I have found meaning
to my existence."

00:54:46.465 --> 00:54:50.028
"I have found him."

00:54:50.259 --> 00:54:53.709
"I have found the one."

00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:57.713
"Whom have you found?"

00:54:57.833 --> 00:55:02.036
"I found someone special."

00:55:15.527 --> 00:55:21.825
"Both of us have been meeting
each other everyday."

00:55:26.967 --> 00:55:33.468
"Both of us have been meeting
each other everyday."

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:37.397
"But when I met you today,
I felt as though..."

00:55:37.988 --> 00:55:41.145
"As if I have found her..."

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.277
"I have found the one."

00:55:45.397 --> 00:55:49.339
"Whom have you found?"

00:55:49.459 --> 00:55:53.458
"I found someone special."

00:56:26.052 --> 00:56:33.615
"Tell me what you
feel when you meet me."

00:56:33.735 --> 00:56:37.643
"Please tell me the truth."

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:48.629
"I'll whisper it to you.
So, come closer."

00:56:49.039 --> 00:56:52.297
"Come close to me."

00:56:52.521 --> 00:56:56.307
"I know what you're going to say."

00:56:56.427 --> 00:57:00.025
"So, I won't come closer."

00:57:00.145 --> 00:57:04.000
"No, please listen to me."

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:10.675
"We' like to talk to each other
everyday."

00:57:11.415 --> 00:57:15.111
"But today that I feel as though..."

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:18.378
"As if I have found somebody."

00:57:18.841 --> 00:57:22.246
"I have found somebody."

00:57:22.366 --> 00:57:26.426
"Whom have you found?"

00:57:26.546 --> 00:57:31.327
"I found somebody special."

00:58:09.182 --> 00:58:16.513
"I feel your presence
even when you away."

00:58:16.777 --> 00:58:20.510
"You are close
even when you are away."

00:58:24.253 --> 00:58:31.786
"No other feeling is
as special as this one."

00:58:31.906 --> 00:58:35.261
"This one is quite
a unique feeling."

00:58:35.381 --> 00:58:39.152
"I don't know why
is this happening."

00:58:39.272 --> 00:58:42.973
"I don't understand
what the heart wants to say."

00:58:43.093 --> 00:58:46.842
"Try to understand
what your heart wants."

00:58:46.962 --> 00:58:53.260
"My heart has been attracted
to many earlier."

00:58:54.105 --> 00:58:57.433
"Why is it that today I feel..."

00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.303
"As if I have found somebody."

00:59:01.703 --> 00:59:05.201
"I have found him."

00:59:05.321 --> 00:59:09.253
"Whom have you found?"

00:59:09.373 --> 00:59:13.512
"I found someone special."

00:59:13.632 --> 00:59:20.158
"My dreams and fantasies
have found a face in you."

00:59:20.872 --> 00:59:24.632
"But today,
why did I feel as if..."

00:59:26.715 --> 00:59:29.896
"I have found somebody."

00:59:30.096 --> 00:59:34.979
"I found someone special."

00:59:35.485 --> 00:59:39.311
Rohit!

00:59:43.957 --> 00:59:45.235
Rohit!

00:59:53.427 --> 00:59:55.048
Raj is a great player.

00:59:55.168 --> 00:59:56.924
Kasauli Tigers is a strong team.

00:59:57.044 --> 00:59:58.968
Blue Bulls is not less.

00:59:59.088 --> 01:00:01.926
And he scores again!

01:00:02.851 --> 01:00:05.233
Hurrah!

01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:10.373
Minutes into the game
and the score is 60-58.

01:00:10.493 --> 01:00:12.408
A player of Blue Bulls
passed the ball but...

01:00:12.528 --> 01:00:15.737
Saxena of Kasauli
Tigers makes a move..

01:00:15.857 --> 01:00:17.737
He crosses the half line...

01:00:21.405 --> 01:00:23.448
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:00:25.384 --> 01:00:26.598
You...
- Raj!

01:00:26.718 --> 01:00:30.265
Let's go. - What's going on?
Girl walks away with the boy.

01:00:30.385 --> 01:00:33.207
The girl took the boy
and the player took the ball.

01:00:33.327 --> 01:00:36.790
Which game should I comment on?

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:41.065
Anyway, Raj Saxena proceeds
with the ball and passes it.

01:00:41.185 --> 01:00:47.244
He runs with ball and
the captain shows alertness.

01:00:47.364 --> 01:00:51.266
Score is almost equal.
The match is getting exciting.

01:00:51.386 --> 01:00:56.179
Last few seconds remain.
I see Kasauli Tigers have the ball.

01:00:56.299 --> 01:00:57.696
He has the ball.

01:00:57.816 --> 01:01:00.604
Tigers!
- Everyone is cheering the Tigers.

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:02.654
They bounce the ball...

01:01:02.774 --> 01:01:07.379
Raj runs with the ball and scores!

01:01:07.499 --> 01:01:09.535
Hurrah!
- Yes!

01:01:09.655 --> 01:01:10.560
Hurrah!

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.541
Kasauli Tigers are the winners
of this year's Hero Honda Cup!

01:01:14.661 --> 01:01:17.002
Applause!
- Congratulations!

01:01:17.927 --> 01:01:20.810
Hurrah!

01:01:51.426 --> 01:01:52.584
What is going on, Rohit?

01:01:53.662 --> 01:01:56.596
I too will play basketball
and be a champion.

01:01:57.527 --> 01:01:58.871
Then people will clap for me too.

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:00.687
Oh!

01:02:01.679 --> 01:02:04.747
Like Nisha was applauding me?

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.111
Yes.

01:02:08.096 --> 01:02:11.604
How will you learn by yourself?
We'll teach you.

01:02:12.821 --> 01:02:15.544
Will you teach me?
- Of course, we will.

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:19.458
Come on boys.
Let's teach Rohit basketball.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.671
Take the ball.

01:02:25.853 --> 01:02:27.761
Stand in the centre. Here...

01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:30.761
Rohit, what are you doing?
Take the ball.

01:02:34.306 --> 01:02:38.892
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?
- It's okay.

01:02:39.051 --> 01:02:40.482
The ball will come to me now.

01:02:46.371 --> 01:02:48.404
I don't want to learn!

01:02:48.524 --> 01:02:49.726
Get aside.

01:02:54.269 --> 01:02:55.713
Huh?

01:02:59.054 --> 01:03:01.661
How will Nisha applaud
unless you learn the game?

01:03:11.729 --> 01:03:17.304
Next time watch your step
when you go to see Nisha!

01:03:17.424 --> 01:03:18.552
Understand?

01:03:33.457 --> 01:03:35.860
Mother says, sinners are
always punished.

01:03:37.576 --> 01:03:38.893
But I haven't committed any sin.

01:03:40.144 --> 01:03:41.409
Then why do I get punished?

01:03:43.147 --> 01:03:44.277
Everyone makes fun of me.

01:03:46.146 --> 01:03:47.874
Who will help me if You don't?

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:50.598
You have great powers.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.282
Give me some of Your powers.

01:03:55.872 --> 01:03:57.744
Please, dear God.

01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:59.496
Please, God...

01:04:51.792 --> 01:04:53.598
'Sending'

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:58.380
'Receiving'

01:04:59.772 --> 01:05:01.656
'Sending'

01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:06.042
'Receiving'

01:05:30.756 --> 01:05:34.542
'Upright!'

01:05:45.498 --> 01:05:46.500
Rohit.

01:05:47.748 --> 01:05:48.774
Rohit.

01:06:01.548 --> 01:06:06.313
Rohit! What are you doing?
- What's wrong, mother?

01:06:06.433 --> 01:06:08.230
Why did you touch it?
- What are you doing?

01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:09.439
I didn't do anything.
- Why did you touch it?

01:06:09.559 --> 01:06:10.355
It was playing on its own.

01:06:10.475 --> 01:06:12.144
Why did you touch it?
- I didn't do anything.

01:06:12.264 --> 01:06:14.392
Why did you touch it?
- I didn't do anything.

01:06:14.644 --> 01:06:17.974
I didn't do anything.
It started on its own...

01:06:23.686 --> 01:06:24.826
Mom!

01:06:25.222 --> 01:06:27.604
What is happening?

01:06:29.662 --> 01:06:32.884
What's happening?
- No lights in the city.

01:06:33.249 --> 01:06:34.719
Darkness all around.

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:39.393
What's wrong with this?
It doesn't work on electricity.

01:06:42.144 --> 01:06:44.460
Sir, I think a storm is brewing.

01:06:44.998 --> 01:06:46.150
A terrible storm.

01:07:17.405 --> 01:07:18.605
Sir! Take a look!

01:07:21.947 --> 01:07:23.158
Good Lord!

01:08:11.041 --> 01:08:17.743
'An Unidentified Flying Object
has been sighted in Kasauli.'

01:08:18.031 --> 01:08:22.687
'Many world space organisations
find the incident hard to believe.'

01:08:22.963 --> 01:08:26.635
'No radar station on earth
or satellite in space...'

01:08:27.061 --> 01:08:28.819
'Have received UFO signals.'

01:08:29.155 --> 01:08:32.887
'UFO stories are like ghost
stories.'

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:37.459
'Those who see them believe
in them, the others don't.'

01:08:37.705 --> 01:08:41.425
'The UFO or saucer like
object sighted in Kasauli...'

01:08:41.545 --> 01:08:44.323
'Was also seen in
Bangalore in May 2001.'

01:08:44.827 --> 01:08:47.125
'Dad, did you see...'
- Not just in India, UFOs...

01:08:47.329 --> 01:08:49.730
'People the world over
claim to have seen them.'

01:08:49.874 --> 01:08:53.156
'There is no solid evidence
but believers believe in them.'

01:09:26.313 --> 01:09:27.885
Captain, take the chopper down.

01:09:43.059 --> 01:09:47.109
The burning grass and
3 depressions are evidence...

01:09:47.414 --> 01:09:50.750
That the space craft that flew
over Kasauli last night...

01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:53.456
Landed right here.
- You're absolutely correct.

01:09:53.708 --> 01:09:55.832
It does seem as if the
space craft landed here.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.130
This is terrific.

01:09:58.766 --> 01:10:00.014
Amazing.

01:10:00.908 --> 01:10:06.206
So out of the entire world
the aliens chose our city!

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:12.314
Imagine how popular our
little hill station will now be.

01:10:12.434 --> 01:10:16.298
I declare 2 days' official
holiday to celebrate.

01:10:36.087 --> 01:10:37.107
What is all this?

01:10:37.869 --> 01:10:41.037
It's like a carnival.
People are dressed as aliens.

01:10:41.212 --> 01:10:43.966
You also dress up.
- I'll take a moment.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.465
Hey Rohit!

01:10:56.608 --> 01:10:57.574
What are you doing?

01:10:57.694 --> 01:10:59.014
Making eyes and a mouth on the pot.

01:10:59.836 --> 01:11:03.052
Why? - I'm dressing as
an alien and going to the Mall.

01:11:05.968 --> 01:11:07.168
Aliens...

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.930
You won't go anywhere.
- Why?

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:14.050
All my friends are going.
- They're different from us.

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:15.514
What difference?
- Don't argue.

01:11:15.634 --> 01:11:18.394
But...
- I said, you won't go.

01:11:18.514 --> 01:11:20.920
Holy smoke! Let's scoot.

01:11:36.634 --> 01:11:37.900
Life from another planet.

01:11:40.036 --> 01:11:41.194
Aliens.

01:11:42.190 --> 01:11:43.786
Khan, what are you saying?

01:11:44.284 --> 01:11:46.996
It's a fact that the
spaceship landed here.

01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:50.752
So possibly somebody
may have come out of it.

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:56.512
That's exactly how it happened.
I inspected the entire area.

01:11:57.322 --> 01:12:01.684
The footprints prove
that some creatures came out.

01:12:02.602 --> 01:12:04.036
But...
- What?

01:12:06.286 --> 01:12:08.608
But one of them hasn't gone back.

01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:10.918
How can you say that?

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.736
I saw alien footprints
going towards the jungle.

01:12:16.768 --> 01:12:20.428
But one set of footprints
didn't come back to the ship.

01:12:20.771 --> 01:12:24.095
Suppose they are the
alien's footprints...

01:12:24.971 --> 01:12:25.997
We'll nab him.

01:12:26.417 --> 01:12:29.450
It will be an achievement bigger
than man going to the moon.

01:12:29.828 --> 01:12:31.748
We can find out the
secrets of the universe.

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:35.654
But what if he's dangerous?
- We'll shoot him.

01:12:36.422 --> 01:12:40.838
Whatever it is,
till this is proven beyond doubt...

01:12:41.312 --> 01:12:43.082
It should remain between us.

01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:47.186
The town is celebrating.
We don't want them to panic.

01:12:51.494 --> 01:12:52.586
Okay, sir.

01:13:18.968 --> 01:13:22.334
No excuse will work. Mother
won't let me go. Go away, Bittu.

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.266
Why are you whistling away?
I said I can't come!

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.502
Go away.

01:14:12.434 --> 01:14:14.384
Rohit?

01:14:15.422 --> 01:14:18.236
Do you know an alien got
left behind in the woods?

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:20.666
What's an alien?

01:14:22.346 --> 01:14:24.368
Creatures living on other
planets are called aliens.

01:14:25.598 --> 01:14:28.244
How does he look?
- Don't know.

01:14:28.622 --> 01:14:31.616
He could be like an animal
or maybe like us.

01:14:33.194 --> 01:14:34.454
Could he be like Bittu?

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.404
Bittu...
- Yes.

01:14:36.596 --> 01:14:40.424
I was here last night and
I saw a child I thought was Bittu.

01:14:40.724 --> 01:14:42.812
I got angry and broke this pot.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.384
He ran back into the
woods but the pot is intact.

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.006
This must be another pot.
- No, it's the same.

01:14:50.126 --> 01:14:51.944
I drew a face on it. See..

01:14:54.902 --> 01:14:58.466
Oh my God!
Could it have been the alien?

01:14:59.156 --> 01:15:02.654
Let's find him!
- One who can fix a broken pot...

01:15:02.774 --> 01:15:05.462
Can do anything. I am frightened.

01:15:05.906 --> 01:15:09.422
Why are you scared?
I am with you. Come on.

01:15:41.917 --> 01:15:46.207
It must've been a child.
- Yes, let's go back.

01:15:46.758 --> 01:15:47.790
Let's go.

01:16:05.393 --> 01:16:06.509
Rohit!

01:16:16.247 --> 01:16:17.321
Rohit!

01:16:54.155 --> 01:16:55.391
Have you come from above?

01:17:02.897 --> 01:17:04.817
He seems to have come from there.

01:17:09.701 --> 01:17:11.375
We should help him.

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:16.937
God knows what
the police will do with him.

01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:21.551
If he remains in the jungle,
wild animals will eat him up.

01:17:24.124 --> 01:17:26.956
So what must we do?

01:17:28.288 --> 01:17:30.016
We must keep him hidden.

01:17:33.928 --> 01:17:35.032
Will you come with us?

01:17:37.858 --> 01:17:38.914
Will you be our friend?

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.218
Long live India, sir.
- Long live India!

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.134
Good morning, sir.

01:18:56.974 --> 01:18:58.006
Sukhwani.

01:18:58.642 --> 01:18:59.524
Good morning, sir.

01:18:59.644 --> 01:19:01.582
Get these rolls developed
and printed. - Yes, sir.

01:19:01.702 --> 01:19:02.734
Be quick.

01:19:04.414 --> 01:19:08.839
Sir, you've done a great job!

01:19:08.959 --> 01:19:13.512
It's the truth, the police job
can't be taken for granted.

01:19:13.632 --> 01:19:16.410
And anything can happen
to an honest officer like you.

01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:19.086
What nonsense!
- I'm praising you.

01:19:19.206 --> 01:19:24.391
Your side business.
As long as there are weddings...

01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:26.345
Your business will do well.

01:19:26.465 --> 01:19:28.979
Sukhwani, do the job given to you.

01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:30.293
Okay.

01:19:32.897 --> 01:19:34.787
Indian Space Research Organization?

01:19:35.507 --> 01:19:36.665
Dr Subramaniam?

01:19:37.103 --> 01:19:38.351
Sir, Khan here.

01:19:39.101 --> 01:19:42.485
According to your instructions,
I've photographed the footprints.

01:19:43.097 --> 01:19:45.149
I'll send them to you very soon.

01:19:45.701 --> 01:19:49.277
Sir, your opinion in this
matter is very important.

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:45.072
What's the matter? What is wrong?

01:20:49.302 --> 01:20:50.346
What is wrong?

01:20:50.466 --> 01:20:52.320
Open the door, Rohit.

01:20:56.874 --> 01:20:57.948
I'm glad you came.

01:20:58.782 --> 01:21:00.354
Why? Any problem?

01:21:00.474 --> 01:21:02.334
Yes. He was screaming.

01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:06.600
He's probably hungry.

01:21:08.298 --> 01:21:10.704
I've given him many things
but he doesn't eat them.

01:21:11.874 --> 01:21:13.062
He must eat something else.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.942
What do you eat?

01:21:21.414 --> 01:21:22.458
Glass?

01:21:27.006 --> 01:21:28.050
Wood?

01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:30.960
Wire mesh? Sun window?

01:21:31.596 --> 01:21:32.604
No, Rohit.

01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:35.442
He means something else.

01:21:38.082 --> 01:21:39.138
Air?

01:21:40.272 --> 01:21:41.304
Sun rays?

01:21:43.068 --> 01:21:44.640
Sunlight?
- Sunlight.

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:46.092
Sunlight.

01:21:46.488 --> 01:21:48.012
Holy smoke, he can speak!

01:21:49.776 --> 01:21:51.240
He understands us.

01:21:52.024 --> 01:21:55.956
This means he's very intelligent.

01:21:56.244 --> 01:21:57.270
Yes.

01:21:57.984 --> 01:22:00.828
But how can he eat sunlight?
It's not edible.

01:22:01.032 --> 01:22:04.170
Our bodies get strength
from what we eat.

01:22:04.602 --> 01:22:07.487
They possibly get strength
from the sun.

01:22:18.479 --> 01:22:20.873
Look at his head.
- Rohit!

01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:23.375
Hurry, hide!

01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:31.055
What are you doing here
early in the morning?

01:22:31.175 --> 01:22:33.589
Nothing Nothing.

01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:37.171
When did you come, Nisha?
- A minute ago.

01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:41.006
Join us for breakfast.
- You go ahead, we'll come.

01:22:42.064 --> 01:22:44.628
I'm getting late, dear.
I have to go to office.

01:22:54.737 --> 01:22:57.564
Why is the jug here? Bring it in.

01:22:58.503 --> 01:23:04.683
Don't come out. We'll be back.
- Here you are.

01:23:06.822 --> 01:23:08.369
Bye, Nisha.
- Bye, aunty.

01:23:08.489 --> 01:23:10.789
Rohit, get up only
after finishing breakfast.

01:23:11.989 --> 01:23:13.210
Holy smoke!

01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:26.037
Bittu, found the ball?
- No, man.

01:23:26.157 --> 01:23:27.807
The sixer sent the ball
out of the stadium.

01:23:27.927 --> 01:23:30.582
No, it's in the outhouse. There.

01:23:31.415 --> 01:23:33.019
Let's get it.
- Yes.

01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:40.263
Where's the ball?

01:23:45.747 --> 01:23:50.873
What are you doing here?
- Somebody is inside!

01:23:50.993 --> 01:23:53.028
It's a ghost!
- No, it's a monkey.

01:23:53.256 --> 01:23:55.056
Our ball is in his hand.
- Yes.

01:23:57.618 --> 01:24:00.524
Why did you come out?
Told you to stay in the basket!

01:24:03.322 --> 01:24:04.438
Ball.

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:07.030
Don't say a word.
You ruined everything!

01:24:07.228 --> 01:24:08.614
Now everyone knows!

01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:10.720
Who is he?

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:15.676
First all of you must promise,
you won't tell anyone about him.

01:24:15.838 --> 01:24:16.900
Promise.

01:24:18.406 --> 01:24:20.626
He's my friend. Like all of you.

01:24:23.746 --> 01:24:24.916
Hi.

01:24:26.398 --> 01:24:29.326
He came in the spaceship
that landed here.

01:24:29.871 --> 01:24:32.727
The spaceship left but
this poor guy got left behind.

01:24:34.359 --> 01:24:35.403
Holy smoke!

01:24:41.313 --> 01:24:45.597
"I ate a 'dadd', and you ate two."

01:24:45.717 --> 01:24:50.661
"Don't avert your eyes,
you are mad."

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:15.598
Holy smoke, magic!
- Yes, magic!

01:25:19.402 --> 01:25:21.279
Magic!

01:25:21.399 --> 01:25:24.064
Magic!

01:25:24.562 --> 01:25:26.326
Magic!

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:53.244
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:25:53.364 --> 01:25:57.754
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:10.846
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:26:10.966 --> 01:26:16.012
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:20.812
"Someone from the skies
is here on the earth."

01:26:20.932 --> 01:26:26.041
"Someone from the skies
is here on the earth."

01:26:26.161 --> 01:26:30.957
"It is as if the wind is blowing
with us, not against us."

01:26:31.107 --> 01:26:35.799
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:26:35.919 --> 01:26:40.533
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:26:40.653 --> 01:26:45.363
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:26:45.507 --> 01:26:50.529
"Magic...
- Yes, it's magic."

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:21.267
"Love needs no language.
Isn't that wonderful?"

01:27:21.387 --> 01:27:25.879
"And now, there is no room
for unhappiness."

01:27:25.999 --> 01:27:30.895
"Love needs no language.
Isn't that wonderful?"

01:27:31.015 --> 01:27:35.891
"And now, there is no room
for unhappiness."

01:27:36.011 --> 01:27:40.655
"There is no exchange of words
between us."

01:27:40.775 --> 01:27:44.873
"Yet we can express
the feelings of our heart."

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:50.183
"Isn't this less than any miracle?"

01:27:50.303 --> 01:27:54.989
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:59.705
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:27:59.825 --> 01:28:04.409
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:28:04.529 --> 01:28:09.989
"Magic...
- Yes, it's magic."

01:28:36.307 --> 01:28:41.065
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:28:41.185 --> 01:28:44.977
"Magic...
- Yes, it's magic."

01:28:45.097 --> 01:28:49.879
"You live in our heart
and you are dear to us."

01:28:49.999 --> 01:28:55.069
"No one will ever ask
anything in return."

01:28:59.401 --> 01:29:04.213
"You live in our hearts
and you are dear to us."

01:29:04.333 --> 01:29:09.295
"No one will ever ask
anything in return."

01:29:09.415 --> 01:29:14.055
"You came here to meet us."

01:29:14.205 --> 01:29:18.258
"You brought along
a lot of dreams."

01:29:18.378 --> 01:29:23.526
"Promise to always be friends."

01:29:23.646 --> 01:29:28.224
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:29:28.344 --> 01:29:32.922
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:29:33.072 --> 01:29:37.632
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:29:37.752 --> 01:29:42.672
"Magic... Yes, it's magic."

01:29:49.206 --> 01:29:50.688
Hey guys! What's up?

01:29:50.808 --> 01:29:54.156
Why are you laughing hard?
New spaceship joke on the phone?

01:29:54.276 --> 01:29:58.224
That's old hat.
We're laughing at the new joke.

01:29:58.344 --> 01:30:01.530
Will Rohit and Nisha
have abnormal kids?

01:30:02.418 --> 01:30:03.660
Rohit and Nisha's kids?

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:07.164
As if you don't know.
Nisha spends everyday with Rohit.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.202
It's not too late. Do something.

01:30:11.616 --> 01:30:14.088
Else that fool will steal
your girl away.

01:30:21.846 --> 01:30:25.909
Any news of the alien?
- No, Colonel.

01:30:26.935 --> 01:30:29.491
I think Inspector Khan was wrong.

01:30:30.667 --> 01:30:33.175
Else we'd have found
something on him by now.

01:30:34.075 --> 01:30:35.767
This is check and mate.

01:30:35.887 --> 01:30:38.629
Congratulations, dad.
I have good news.

01:30:38.839 --> 01:30:40.153
What is it?

01:30:40.273 --> 01:30:42.139
Your son has decided
to get married.

01:30:42.433 --> 01:30:44.683
Very good. Who is the lucky girl?

01:30:44.923 --> 01:30:46.507
Nisha, uncle.
- Nisha?

01:30:47.755 --> 01:30:50.473
This is fantastic.
That's great news.

01:30:50.593 --> 01:30:54.595
Did you hear that?
Nisha and Raj want to get married.

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:56.533
Really?
What are you saying?

01:30:57.211 --> 01:30:59.629
This is great news!
Isn't it, Indu?

01:30:59.749 --> 01:31:00.895
Congratulations.

01:31:01.015 --> 01:31:02.089
Thank you.

01:31:02.509 --> 01:31:06.523
What's up? - Do you know
Nisha is marrying Raj?

01:31:06.643 --> 01:31:08.227
Holy smoke! How do you know?

01:31:08.641 --> 01:31:11.779
My parents had gone to the
club last night. They told me.

01:31:11.899 --> 01:31:15.115
But that's impossible.
Nisha is Rohit's girlfriend.

01:31:15.235 --> 01:31:17.431
Let's go tell him.
- Yes.

01:31:17.809 --> 01:31:19.959
Rohit!

01:31:20.079 --> 01:31:22.099
Rohit!

01:31:31.813 --> 01:31:32.893
Nisha!

01:31:33.241 --> 01:31:34.405
Nisha!

01:31:35.923 --> 01:31:37.027
Nisha!

01:31:40.321 --> 01:31:41.665
Hi, Nisha.

01:31:55.711 --> 01:31:57.853
Why did you lie?
I never said I'll marry you.

01:31:58.111 --> 01:32:01.015
Neither did you refuse
and that's what our parents want.

01:32:01.231 --> 01:32:03.211
It's not about them.
It's about lying.

01:32:03.331 --> 01:32:06.343
There are no lies.
I like you and I know you like me.

01:32:07.603 --> 01:32:10.141
Liking doesn't mean we get married.

01:32:10.645 --> 01:32:14.450
It's vital to know
each other to get married.

01:32:15.523 --> 01:32:19.549
Going by the present,
we'll never know each other.

01:32:19.987 --> 01:32:22.484
What's happening?
- Oh come on, Nisha. I'm not blind.

01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.313
Can't I see what's brewing
between you and Rohit?

01:32:26.295 --> 01:32:30.292
What? An affair brewing
between me and Rohit!

01:32:31.462 --> 01:32:33.247
Okay. Alright then.

01:32:33.612 --> 01:32:35.333
Even if we're having it off,
it's none of your business.

01:32:35.687 --> 01:32:37.529
I'll decide whom to meet.

01:32:37.781 --> 01:32:40.228
You have no right to
interfere in my personal life!

01:32:40.348 --> 01:32:41.350
Do you understand?

01:32:41.836 --> 01:32:43.720
You insult me for that lunatic.

01:32:43.882 --> 01:32:48.868
He's not a lunatic.
- You seem to know him well.

01:32:49.168 --> 01:32:53.158
Yes, I know him well.
And I know you too.

01:33:03.242 --> 01:33:05.972
What broke?

01:33:07.454 --> 01:33:08.534
What's wrong, dear?

01:33:11.378 --> 01:33:12.434
Rohit.

01:33:12.836 --> 01:33:15.476
Nisha is getting married. To Raj.

01:33:16.376 --> 01:33:19.376
Why does it annoy you?

01:33:20.138 --> 01:33:23.342
Every girl gets married.
- But she is my girlfriend.

01:33:23.822 --> 01:33:28.826
What? Nisha is your girlfriend!

01:33:29.102 --> 01:33:30.110
Yes!

01:33:32.726 --> 01:33:37.540
Talking to you doesn't
make her your girlfriend.

01:33:37.921 --> 01:33:40.867
She said she's my girlfriend
and I'm her boyfriend.

01:33:42.151 --> 01:33:43.861
She must have been kidding.

01:33:45.316 --> 01:33:48.052
Nisha is an educated,
sensible girl.

01:33:50.192 --> 01:33:51.998
She can make you her friend...

01:33:54.092 --> 01:33:55.340
Not her life partner.

01:33:55.718 --> 01:33:56.852
Why not?

01:33:58.688 --> 01:33:59.708
Rohit.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.160
You have grown up...

01:34:05.216 --> 01:34:08.768
Yet you're still too immature.

01:34:11.066 --> 01:34:13.142
You're not like boys your age.

01:34:13.262 --> 01:34:15.782
Why not? Why am I not
like other boys my age?

01:34:16.022 --> 01:34:19.238
I did nothing.
Then why is Nisha leaving me?

01:34:20.156 --> 01:34:21.170
Rohit.

01:34:26.504 --> 01:34:28.040
Everything would've been fine...

01:34:30.296 --> 01:34:32.300
Had we not seen that evil spaceship.

01:34:34.682 --> 01:34:36.296
Then your dad
would have been alive...

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:42.776
And you wouldn't be like this.

01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:45.350
Spaceship?

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.300
Dad?

01:34:48.146 --> 01:34:50.942
What had happened?
- We met with an accident.

01:34:51.908 --> 01:34:53.810
I was carrying you then.

01:35:35.247 --> 01:35:36.357
What are you doing here?

01:35:36.477 --> 01:35:37.497
'Rohit.'

01:35:39.267 --> 01:35:42.801
Take a quick bath.
I'll lay breakfast.

01:35:46.401 --> 01:35:49.041
Don't smile. Go and hide.
Don't come out or you'll be caught.

01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:50.679
Go.

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:14.727
Mother, I can't see.

01:36:15.345 --> 01:36:18.399
Splash some cold water.
Then you'll be able to see.

01:36:37.704 --> 01:36:40.530
Mother, I can see!

01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:43.794
First he says, can't see.
Then he says, he can see!

01:36:43.914 --> 01:36:45.996
Hurry up. You'll be late.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.688
The computer bell
causes many problems.

01:36:50.808 --> 01:36:53.748
Rohit, hide somewhere
or Rawat will scold you.

01:36:53.898 --> 01:36:55.920
Why will he scold?
I'm now learning computers.

01:36:56.304 --> 01:36:59.226
Where are your glasses?
Left them home?

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:02.730
I don't need them. I could see
everything clearly now.

01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:04.386
What?
- Really.

01:37:04.572 --> 01:37:05.748
Okay. Wait.

01:37:06.474 --> 01:37:09.264
Read out what Mr Chaturvedi has
written on the blackboard.

01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:16.476
If a turn-table rotates through
720 degrees in 1 second...

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.042
How many rotations
does it take in 1 minute?

01:37:21.456 --> 01:37:22.542
Boys.

01:37:23.334 --> 01:37:24.492
Write the answer to this.

01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:34.224
120 rotations in 1 minute.

01:37:34.434 --> 01:37:35.526
Who is that?

01:37:41.496 --> 01:37:42.660
Who gave this answer?

01:37:45.894 --> 01:37:50.484
You solved the Class 10 problem
without paper and pen, Rohit.

01:37:51.570 --> 01:37:53.220
Yes.
- Come in.

01:37:55.104 --> 01:37:57.222
Did you guess or...

01:37:58.332 --> 01:38:00.288
Was it the right answer?

01:38:00.781 --> 01:38:04.015
Absolutely right but
how did you solve it?

01:38:04.357 --> 01:38:06.487
I don't know.
It just came to me when I read it.

01:38:07.357 --> 01:38:09.313
Rohit? I can't believe it.

01:38:10.141 --> 01:38:12.919
Neither can I believe it.
But it's the truth.

01:38:13.297 --> 01:38:14.095
Where is Rohit?

01:38:14.215 --> 01:38:17.449
How many times did I tell you,
you can't learn computers!

01:38:17.911 --> 01:38:19.381
Learn carpentry or masonry!

01:38:20.179 --> 01:38:23.305
You keep coming here and
I have to keep insulting you!

01:38:23.425 --> 01:38:24.457
Mr Mathur.

01:38:26.257 --> 01:38:27.811
Is this the way
to talk to a student?

01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:30.487
This boy's IQ is 0.

01:38:31.003 --> 01:38:33.385
He needs a doctor not a teacher.

01:38:33.889 --> 01:38:36.709
See for yourself. Tell me.

01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:39.739
Without opening a particular file...

01:38:40.309 --> 01:38:43.309
How can you copy from one
drive of Windows to another?

01:38:44.557 --> 01:38:48.031
You're asking a difficult
question to show him down.

01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:49.867
First click in the program.

01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:51.577
When the
Windows Explorer opens...

01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:53.995
Take the cursor to
the file and right click.

01:38:54.253 --> 01:38:57.139
Without leaving the button
take it to the other drive.

01:38:57.511 --> 01:38:58.831
And your file will be copied.

01:38:58.951 --> 01:39:01.051
It's right. It's absolutely right.

01:39:01.171 --> 01:39:03.175
Holy smoke!
- How?

01:39:03.433 --> 01:39:04.501
How do you know this?

01:39:05.359 --> 01:39:08.029
You asked me to go
and learn from my dad.

01:39:08.971 --> 01:39:10.621
I've learnt from my dad.

01:39:12.607 --> 01:39:15.949
Sir, you're a teacher. You're
responsible for many children.

01:39:16.423 --> 01:39:18.757
You should encourage
them to progress in life.

01:39:19.441 --> 01:39:22.549
Computers didn't make man.
Man made computers.

01:39:22.885 --> 01:39:25.861
Your computer can't do
what the human mind can.

01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:28.699
Sir, never consider
anybody insignificant.

01:39:29.185 --> 01:39:32.929
Because every small person
grows up someday in life.

01:39:45.181 --> 01:39:47.821
That was fun.
How Mathur face fell!

01:39:47.989 --> 01:39:50.761
Rohit, all of a sudden
how did you get so smart?

01:39:51.439 --> 01:39:54.577
There's just one problem.
Now you'll forget us.

01:39:55.213 --> 01:39:58.051
You'll have new adult pals.
- That's not true.

01:39:58.507 --> 01:40:00.895
You're my friends and
you'll always be.

01:40:02.923 --> 01:40:05.095
Rohit, pass the ball.

01:40:06.757 --> 01:40:09.613
What will he pass? He still
hides behind his mother's skirt.

01:40:12.907 --> 01:40:14.293
Why are you glaring?

01:40:25.255 --> 01:40:26.455
Holy smoke!

01:40:28.687 --> 01:40:29.929
Rohit, look at the ball!

01:40:37.687 --> 01:40:40.123
Do you think you are
too strong now?

01:40:40.711 --> 01:40:41.932
Show him.

01:40:45.922 --> 01:40:50.650
What a punch, Rohit!
- Suddenly you're strong!

01:40:57.276 --> 01:41:00.330
What muscles!
- Oh no!

01:41:00.450 --> 01:41:03.528
Rippling muscles!
- Oh no!

01:41:03.648 --> 01:41:05.046
Take a good look!

01:41:07.242 --> 01:41:08.586
What are you looking at? Come on!

01:41:08.706 --> 01:41:10.224
Yes!

01:41:10.344 --> 01:41:11.598
Come on!

01:41:11.718 --> 01:41:13.116
Come on!

01:41:18.348 --> 01:41:20.094
You don't seem to have
had mother's milk.

01:41:20.334 --> 01:41:22.308
Next time drink some,
so we can have a good fight.

01:41:22.428 --> 01:41:23.628
Yes.

01:41:29.346 --> 01:41:30.420
Why did you get me here?

01:41:31.098 --> 01:41:32.172
Are you mad at me?

01:41:32.964 --> 01:41:33.966
Yes.

01:41:34.248 --> 01:41:35.934
Why?
- Because you're not my friend!

01:41:36.432 --> 01:41:37.476
You're going with Raj!

01:41:39.108 --> 01:41:42.204
I'm not going with Raj.
- You're not!

01:41:42.826 --> 01:41:44.914
I turned him down.
- Good.

01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:48.298
I don't like him.
- Neither do I.

01:41:49.132 --> 01:41:51.502
We have similar likes.
- Yes.

01:41:52.042 --> 01:41:55.228
We have similar tastes
and we understand each other.

01:41:56.254 --> 01:41:58.018
Therefore I want to
explain something to you.

01:42:00.094 --> 01:42:02.344
Every girl has to go someday.

01:42:02.902 --> 01:42:04.462
She sets up her own home.

01:42:04.912 --> 01:42:06.994
Isn't it?
- Yes.

01:42:07.654 --> 01:42:09.562
What type of boy do you like?

01:42:09.886 --> 01:42:12.790
I'll find him for you.
- You will!

01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:16.246
Yes, we have the same likes.
You'll like the one I like.

01:42:16.756 --> 01:42:18.748
So who is your choice?

01:42:18.868 --> 01:42:22.522
I like Bunty, Bittu, Chottu.

01:42:23.818 --> 01:42:26.908
Rohit, they are all kids.
- But I'm an adult.

01:42:27.202 --> 01:42:31.588
That will be fun! We'll go
around and drink Bournvita!

01:42:32.676 --> 01:42:35.871
Marriage doesn't mean
drink Bournvita together.

01:42:36.261 --> 01:42:38.481
Marriage is a grave commitment.

01:42:39.336 --> 01:42:42.291
There's only one responsibility
The husband should love his wife.

01:42:42.913 --> 01:42:45.605
You can't live life only by love.

01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:51.867
Every girl wants a man who
is physically and mentally strong.

01:43:10.135 --> 01:43:11.712
Am I not physically strong?

01:43:12.138 --> 01:43:15.754
Yes but...

01:43:16.069 --> 01:43:18.003
But I'm mentally weak.

01:43:18.341 --> 01:43:20.133
No. I...

01:43:20.379 --> 01:43:21.531
Slow on the uptake.

01:43:22.521 --> 01:43:23.691
I'll learn.

01:43:25.677 --> 01:43:26.790
Just you watch.

01:43:29.709 --> 01:43:31.935
I hit such a punch.
It was wonderful!

01:43:32.055 --> 01:43:34.209
Nisha was very impressed.

01:43:34.329 --> 01:43:38.379
And the ball I kicked it so hard,
it kept flying!

01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:48.200
You did this, right?

01:43:50.942 --> 01:43:52.262
Thank you, Jadoo.

01:43:53.288 --> 01:43:54.512
Thank you, Jadoo.

01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:56.276
Thank you, Jadoo.

01:43:56.918 --> 01:43:58.178
Thank you, Jadoo.

01:44:00.926 --> 01:44:02.930
Mother, don't be afraid.
He's Jadoo, my friend.

01:44:03.182 --> 01:44:05.168
Stay away from him!
Don't go near him!

01:44:05.288 --> 01:44:06.368
Stay away!
- Mother.

01:44:06.488 --> 01:44:07.784
What on Earth is this?

01:44:07.904 --> 01:44:08.948
Mother, don't scream.
- How did he get here?

01:44:09.068 --> 01:44:10.244
Mother, don't scream.
Somebody might come.

01:44:10.364 --> 01:44:12.074
Stay away!
- Mother...

01:44:12.194 --> 01:44:13.904
Stay away!
- Mother, listen to me.

01:44:14.024 --> 01:44:15.380
Sit down, Mother.

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:18.260
What is it?
- The spaceship that came.

01:44:18.476 --> 01:44:20.000
He was on it.
- What?

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.526
I saved him in the woods.
He's with me since then.

01:44:22.646 --> 01:44:26.060
He's very nice.
- Nice? Are you mad?

01:44:26.489 --> 01:44:30.467
He can't stay here!
I'll call the police!

01:44:30.587 --> 01:44:31.841
But listen to me.

01:44:31.961 --> 01:44:34.326
How dare you hide him here!

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:36.942
Will you have the one
who did you a favour arrested?

01:44:37.062 --> 01:44:39.426
What favour did he do me?
- Look at me.

01:44:39.546 --> 01:44:44.409
Listen to me - I don't
want to hear or see anything!

01:44:45.528 --> 01:44:46.824
Hello?
- Mrs Mehra?

01:44:47.322 --> 01:44:51.258
Father Rodriguez here.
What have you done?

01:44:51.482 --> 01:44:52.952
Rohit is a changed person.

01:44:53.546 --> 01:44:57.122
The entire school is stunned
at his knowledge and intelligence.

01:45:00.704 --> 01:45:05.048
We've decided to promote
him to the tenth class.

01:45:06.716 --> 01:45:07.850
Are you on the line?

01:45:10.208 --> 01:45:12.374
Mother, what's wrong? Who was that?

01:45:12.578 --> 01:45:13.754
The Principal.

01:45:15.338 --> 01:45:19.316
He's promoting you to the tenth.

01:45:20.828 --> 01:45:22.988
That's because that's
their last class!

01:45:24.974 --> 01:45:27.362
But how did this?

01:45:27.512 --> 01:45:31.142
Jadoo performed this miracle.
I'm no longer that Rohit.

01:45:32.144 --> 01:45:34.214
Your glasses?

01:45:34.334 --> 01:45:36.476
I can see clearly.
I also understand everything.

01:45:36.704 --> 01:45:39.020
I can explain to you
and show you things too.

01:46:30.074 --> 01:46:31.640
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

01:46:32.108 --> 01:46:33.524
Sir, this is Dr Steven.
- Hello.

01:46:33.644 --> 01:46:34.832
This is Dr Subramaniam.
- Hello.

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:36.140
This is Dr Heinz.
- Hello.

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:37.424
And this is Dr Ferguson.
- Hello.

01:46:37.544 --> 01:46:40.178
All are from space research
centre, sir. - I see.

01:46:40.298 --> 01:46:42.308
Gentlemen, this is our
city collector, Mr Saxena.

01:46:42.428 --> 01:46:43.436
Nice meeting you, sir.

01:46:43.556 --> 01:46:47.900
The photographs sent
by Inspector Khan proved...

01:46:48.098 --> 01:46:49.718
That these are
the footprints of an alien.

01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:51.956
We've come here
for further research.

01:46:52.664 --> 01:46:56.384
Khan, this implies that
your suspicions are true.

01:46:59.072 --> 01:47:00.500
Tell me, doctor.

01:47:01.544 --> 01:47:05.036
Is this alien dangerous?

01:47:05.276 --> 01:47:06.926
Dangerous? I don't think so.

01:47:07.376 --> 01:47:11.138
Had he been dangerous,
by now he'd have shown us.

01:47:11.666 --> 01:47:14.480
But so far we've
received no reports.

01:47:15.056 --> 01:47:18.710
The silence could also
mean that he is dead.

01:47:19.004 --> 01:47:22.214
It is possible but even his
corpse will be priceless to us.

01:47:22.754 --> 01:47:26.918
I'll have to search the area
to find him dead or alive.

01:47:27.458 --> 01:47:29.060
We'll need extra force.

01:47:30.494 --> 01:47:31.748
You have my permission.

01:47:33.332 --> 01:47:34.448
'Sachin!'

01:47:34.568 --> 01:47:35.828
Hey Jadoo.

01:47:37.424 --> 01:47:38.732
How do I look?

01:48:00.654 --> 01:48:04.212
What is wrong with you?
- I don't talk to kids.

01:48:05.304 --> 01:48:09.342
It's my age to be dancing
not playing games.

01:48:09.613 --> 01:48:10.807
Tell everyone.

01:48:13.363 --> 01:48:16.513
What? Rohit dressed as a hero!
- Yes.

01:48:16.681 --> 01:48:20.383
He said, it's his age to
be dancing not playing games.

01:48:20.557 --> 01:48:21.637
Really?

01:48:37.585 --> 01:48:40.186
Great.
- What are you doing?

01:48:40.441 --> 01:48:41.899
Practice.
- Practice?

01:48:42.019 --> 01:48:43.375
Take a look.

01:48:47.215 --> 01:48:49.477
I'm a little slow.
Trying to become smarter.

01:48:49.597 --> 01:48:53.383
Else all will laugh at you.
- On me? Why?

01:48:53.503 --> 01:48:57.823
Because we're a couple,
so they'll laugh at you.

01:48:57.943 --> 01:49:01.045
Rohit... - Ladies and gentlemen,
please give them a big hand.

01:49:01.165 --> 01:49:02.755
What a vibe!

01:49:04.549 --> 01:49:08.065
And our next participant
is Rohit Mehra.

01:49:08.707 --> 01:49:10.477
You're taking part
in the dance competition!

01:49:10.597 --> 01:49:12.013
Of course. Wish me luck.

01:49:13.117 --> 01:49:17.083
Listen to what I'm saying.
- No, watch what I'm showing.

01:49:17.539 --> 01:49:18.655
But...

01:49:47.992 --> 01:49:50.612
Everyone is laughing.
Come on, let's go.

01:49:50.741 --> 01:49:54.086
I'll be able to do it.
One more time. Music.

01:49:54.917 --> 01:49:56.290
Move a little.

01:49:57.129 --> 01:49:58.343
Holy smoke!

01:50:01.491 --> 01:50:03.862
This is not child's play.

01:50:04.078 --> 01:50:05.105
Let's go.

01:50:05.886 --> 01:50:07.335
Very well. Then I'm leaving.

01:50:09.222 --> 01:50:10.254
One last time.

01:50:12.141 --> 01:50:13.163
Music.

01:50:56.755 --> 01:50:58.752
"It's magic. It's magic."

01:50:58.944 --> 01:51:00.258
"I've got the vibe that you need."

01:51:00.378 --> 01:51:02.198
"It's magic. It's magic."

01:51:02.553 --> 01:51:04.646
"I've got the vibe that you need."

01:51:05.851 --> 01:51:09.392
"Nothing is certain,
nor is anything fixed."

01:51:09.512 --> 01:51:13.027
"What happens, is all a game."

01:51:19.862 --> 01:51:21.893
"It's magic. It's magic."

01:51:23.438 --> 01:51:25.459
"It's magic. It's magic."

01:51:27.193 --> 01:51:30.663
"After the curtain rises
and before the curtain falls,"

01:51:30.783 --> 01:51:33.550
"Anything can happen,
anything can change."

01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:37.717
"Nothing is definite or sure."

01:51:37.837 --> 01:51:41.808
"Whatever does,
is all a game of fate."

01:52:17.896 --> 01:52:24.721
"Why do all the things which are
beyond our reach, look attractive?"

01:52:24.976 --> 01:52:31.956
"Why don't we believe
in things that are near us?"

01:52:32.613 --> 01:52:40.819
"The heart tries to make us see
reason, but we don't believe it."

01:52:41.425 --> 01:52:44.891
"We don't pay heed. We never do."

01:52:45.011 --> 01:52:48.375
"Nothing is certain or sure."

01:52:48.495 --> 01:52:52.235
"What does, is all
a part of the game."

01:53:30.164 --> 01:53:36.793
"See it for yourself
and give it a thought."

01:53:37.206 --> 01:53:44.017
"Think about it well
and then second my words."

01:53:44.918 --> 01:53:48.435
"Don't underestimate
the strength of a small thing."

01:53:48.555 --> 01:53:53.488
"They give us an
important message."

01:53:53.608 --> 01:53:57.088
"Yes, that is true.
Absolutely true."

01:53:57.208 --> 01:54:05.118
"Nothing is certain or sure.
What does, is all a game."

01:54:11.347 --> 01:54:13.243
"It's magic. It's magic."

01:54:13.771 --> 01:54:14.825
"I've got the vibe you need."

01:54:14.945 --> 01:54:16.975
"It's magic. It's magic."

01:54:17.095 --> 01:54:18.655
"I've got the vibe you need."

01:54:18.775 --> 01:54:22.150
"After the curtain rises
until the curtain falls,"

01:54:22.270 --> 01:54:25.102
"You can expect the unexpected,
anything can change."

01:54:25.222 --> 01:54:29.218
"Nothing is definite or sure."

01:54:29.338 --> 01:54:33.559
"Everything that happens,
is a game."

01:54:35.991 --> 01:54:38.126
"Are you ready to vibe?"

01:54:38.246 --> 01:54:41.957
"Come on, everybody.
Vibe with me."

01:55:23.038 --> 01:55:25.375
You were amazing.
- Thank you.

01:55:25.548 --> 01:55:27.581
You were terrific. Good.
- Thank you.

01:55:28.451 --> 01:55:30.252
Am I ready?

01:55:32.224 --> 01:55:35.418
You... I... This...

01:55:35.912 --> 01:55:37.035
Rohit.

01:55:39.776 --> 01:55:42.622
This is just the beginning.
Now watch the fun.

01:55:57.521 --> 01:55:58.961
Rohit.

01:56:05.615 --> 01:56:07.142
This isn't a child's toy.

01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:09.892
Falls flat when exploded.

01:56:11.126 --> 01:56:13.885
We'll see who falls flat.
Want to have a match?

01:56:15.161 --> 01:56:18.016
Very confident.
- We'll know after the match.

01:56:18.212 --> 01:56:20.880
Okay, you're on.
- What do we bet on?

01:56:21.547 --> 01:56:22.543
Hero cup.

01:56:22.663 --> 01:56:26.092
In addition to the Hero Cup,
Nisha will kiss the winner.

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.670
Alright?

01:56:29.902 --> 01:56:31.121
Alright.

01:56:33.563 --> 01:56:35.574
Nisha, be ready to kiss me.

01:56:38.141 --> 01:56:39.629
Kiss?
- Yes.

01:56:39.874 --> 01:56:43.809
We're playing a basketball match
and you will kiss the winner.

01:56:44.076 --> 01:56:48.147
I'll never kiss Raj!
- But you'll kiss me!

01:56:48.703 --> 01:56:49.932
Only if you win.
Dance and basketball are different.

01:56:50.052 --> 01:56:53.331
`Accepted a match but have no team.
That's asking for trouble.

01:56:53.618 --> 01:56:57.010
You are bound to lose
and Raj will beat you.

01:56:57.130 --> 01:56:59.622
But you're my team.
- Us?

01:57:00.057 --> 01:57:02.873
They're tall guys.
And we're little kids.

01:57:02.993 --> 01:57:07.874
We can't even jump. Look.

01:57:09.052 --> 01:57:10.642
Holy smoke!

01:57:11.676 --> 01:57:13.034
Wow!

01:57:13.154 --> 01:57:15.682
Today's match is quite strange.

01:57:15.802 --> 01:57:19.409
Last year's winners Kasauli
Tigers have been challenged...

01:57:19.529 --> 01:57:21.426
By Rohit Mehra and his team.

01:57:21.546 --> 01:57:24.030
The team is called Pandavas.

01:57:24.184 --> 01:57:26.992
Please welcome Pandavas,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:57:28.206 --> 01:57:31.951
I don't believe my eyes.
Can this be a team? Kids?

01:57:38.965 --> 01:57:40.040
Don't move.

01:57:56.612 --> 01:57:58.242
The match begins with
the referee's whistle.

01:57:58.362 --> 01:58:01.957
The ball is flung high and
Raj taking advantage of height...

01:58:02.077 --> 01:58:05.825
Flings it towards
his team mate who passes it...

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:08.863
And proceeds towards half leg.
One more pass.

01:58:08.983 --> 01:58:12.212
He throws it back towards Raj.

01:58:12.332 --> 01:58:15.918
But I see,
Rohit running away with the ball!

01:58:16.038 --> 01:58:22.202
He dribbles with it
and scores a basket!

01:58:24.261 --> 01:58:26.864
Once again, the match begins
with the referee's whistle.

01:58:26.984 --> 01:58:30.714
The ball is with Raj
who dribbles and advances.

01:58:30.834 --> 01:58:33.640
Rohit grabs the ball and runs.

01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:40.632
Rohit leaps high and
scores another basket!

01:58:41.243 --> 01:58:46.005
He's being applauded
and the score board moving on.

01:58:47.443 --> 01:58:48.691
Wow!

01:58:49.483 --> 01:58:52.468
Raj's team, ball in hand,
passing to each other.

01:58:52.588 --> 01:58:55.160
Ball gets to Raj Saxena.
He jumps and

01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:57.866
Rohit throws the ball to his team.

01:58:57.986 --> 01:59:01.930
Once again, the ball is with
Raj but Rohit snatches it back.

01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:05.868
Once again he leaps up and basket!

01:59:11.722 --> 01:59:12.764
Come here, guys.

01:59:14.467 --> 01:59:15.581
Everyone surround Rohit.

01:59:15.797 --> 01:59:16.982
Yes.
- Understand?

01:59:17.126 --> 01:59:18.872
Okay. Give me 5.
- Yes.

01:59:18.992 --> 01:59:21.137
The referee whistles
and match starts again.

01:59:21.257 --> 01:59:25.747
Ball with Rohit but he
is surrounded by the Tigers.

01:59:25.867 --> 01:59:28.510
Raj jumps over a little player.

01:59:28.630 --> 01:59:31.841
And proceeds towards
the basket and scores!

01:59:31.961 --> 01:59:35.602
Kasauli Tigers score.
Their supporters are happy.

01:59:35.921 --> 01:59:37.687
The little kids begin the match.

01:59:37.807 --> 01:59:40.485
Passing the ball but
Rohit Mehra can do nothing.

01:59:40.605 --> 01:59:43.130
Little kids are helpless.

01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:46.558
And Raj Saxena bounds
to score another basket!

01:59:46.735 --> 01:59:49.917
Raj Saxena and his team is elated.
Kids are sad. - Yes!

01:59:50.108 --> 01:59:52.045
Rohit still surrounded
by the Kasauli Tigers.

01:59:52.165 --> 01:59:55.729
Raj Saxena runs with the ball.
Rohit tries to get ahead.

01:59:55.849 --> 01:59:58.094
What do I see? Rohit Mehra falls.

01:59:58.214 --> 01:59:59.643
He fell or perhaps got tripped.

01:59:59.763 --> 02:00:03.276
But it has no effect on Raj.
He scores another basket!

02:00:03.396 --> 02:00:04.548
Foul!

02:00:04.668 --> 02:00:07.101
Foul!
- Kids object to the foul...

02:00:07.221 --> 02:00:09.486
But the referee isn't convinced.
- Foul!

02:00:09.606 --> 02:00:12.469
Scores are equal.

02:00:12.995 --> 02:00:15.054
Match begins.
A little player jumps and...

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:18.650
Flings the ball to Rohit
who dribbles and proceeds.

02:00:18.990 --> 02:00:22.125
Once again Rohit passes
to another little player.

02:00:22.245 --> 02:00:26.411
But I see the little player is
helpless compared to tall Tigers.

02:00:26.531 --> 02:00:30.161
The Tigers score another basket!

02:00:32.479 --> 02:00:34.184
What is happening?
Why aren't you flying?

02:00:34.586 --> 02:00:36.929
We're trying but can't fly.
- Yes.

02:00:38.781 --> 02:00:40.793
The match takes a turn.

02:00:40.913 --> 02:00:43.106
The attack of the Tigers
gets more acerbic.

02:00:43.226 --> 02:00:46.897
Raj Saxena lunges and
scores another basket!

02:00:47.017 --> 02:00:49.197
Score board goes up.

02:00:49.686 --> 02:00:52.891
They're scoring basket
on basket and here's another!

02:00:53.526 --> 02:00:56.667
Looks like Raj and his friends
are playing with the kids.

02:00:56.826 --> 02:01:00.914
The kids try to jump
and grab the ball.

02:01:01.034 --> 02:01:04.063
But Raj scores again.

02:01:04.183 --> 02:01:09.022
It feels as if the Tigers invited
the kids for practice.

02:01:09.142 --> 02:01:11.008
And another basket!

02:01:11.128 --> 02:01:14.193
Excitement amid the fans
of the Kasauli Tigers.

02:01:14.313 --> 02:01:17.539
The referee whistles,
it's half time.

02:01:21.252 --> 02:01:25.305
What is going on? Why can't we fly?

02:01:25.447 --> 02:01:27.938
Sunshine.
- Sunshine?

02:01:33.288 --> 02:01:34.683
Jadoo gets his powers from the sun.

02:01:35.724 --> 02:01:38.621
He can do nothing till
the sun shines on him.

02:01:41.439 --> 02:01:44.285
Jadoo can do nothing
till the sun comes out.

02:01:44.710 --> 02:01:45.850
Now what do we do?

02:01:48.858 --> 02:01:51.887
Dear Lord Kishen,
show us your glory.

02:01:55.502 --> 02:01:59.888
The second half of the match
begins with the whistle.

02:02:00.008 --> 02:02:02.399
Referee throws the ball
and Kasauli Tigers grab it.

02:02:02.519 --> 02:02:04.981
They pass to each other.

02:02:05.101 --> 02:02:07.211
Raj lunges to score and...

02:02:07.331 --> 02:02:11.564
The basket is saved.

02:02:14.041 --> 02:02:15.212
Rohit!

02:02:19.022 --> 02:02:22.460
Rohit falls but the Tigers
run with the ball.

02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:27.376
The kids try but are helpless
in front of tall men.

02:02:27.496 --> 02:02:30.385
Tigers run with the ball
but Rohit tries to grab it...

02:02:30.505 --> 02:02:31.830
And passes it to his little friend.
- Jump!

02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:34.922
And his little friend...

02:02:37.308 --> 02:02:42.261
The kid passed the ball in air,
another caught it and basket!

02:02:42.395 --> 02:02:46.800
Something strange is going on but
whatever it is, it's amazing.

02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:49.480
The spectators are staggered.

02:02:51.073 --> 02:02:53.175
That's Jadoo.

02:02:54.309 --> 02:02:58.730
Match is resumed.
The Tigers have the ball.

02:02:58.850 --> 02:03:01.632
The Pandavas leaping in the air.

02:03:01.752 --> 02:03:07.464
Rohit Mehra himself leaps
into the air and scores!

02:03:08.361 --> 02:03:10.024
Hurrah!

02:03:14.083 --> 02:03:19.101
All shout for the victory!
- Victory to the disciples!

02:03:19.221 --> 02:03:22.116
The excitement is increasing.
- Hurrah!

02:03:22.236 --> 02:03:24.261
Starting once again.
- Pass the ball.

02:03:24.381 --> 02:03:26.823
The Tigers pass
the ball to each other...

02:03:26.943 --> 02:03:29.497
I see them advancing and...

02:03:29.617 --> 02:03:34.096
A little player leaps into the air,
grabs the ball and...

02:03:34.216 --> 02:03:37.427
He passed the ball to Rohit Mehra.

02:03:37.547 --> 02:03:40.814
I can't believe this!

02:03:41.284 --> 02:03:44.310
I don't have to bend low to give
you an eye witness account...

02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:46.557
Everything is happening
in front of my eyes.

02:03:46.677 --> 02:03:50.444
The Tigers are falling and
the kids are flying in the air.

02:03:50.564 --> 02:03:53.146
I don't understand anything.

02:03:53.266 --> 02:03:54.521
Another basket!

02:03:54.641 --> 02:03:57.262
The puny little kids
are teasing the tall men!

02:03:57.382 --> 02:03:59.228
Hey!

02:03:59.749 --> 02:04:03.217
I never thought the match
would take such a twist.

02:04:03.337 --> 02:04:08.103
And the ball...

02:04:13.666 --> 02:04:15.056
Sorry.

02:04:15.810 --> 02:04:17.884
It's so exciting.

02:04:18.004 --> 02:04:24.279
I think these kids
will defeat the Tigers.

02:04:24.399 --> 02:04:28.419
Raj Saxena is exhausted
and the children keep scoring.

02:04:28.755 --> 02:04:34.557
They're the best.
Scoring basket after basket!

02:04:34.677 --> 02:04:37.094
The score board is increasing.

02:04:37.562 --> 02:04:42.769
The last 25 seconds of the match
Pandavas at 48 and Tigers at 49.

02:04:42.911 --> 02:04:46.280
Let's see which team
wins the Hero Cup.

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.920
Tigers!

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:51.532
Match continues.
Ball is with the Tigers.

02:04:51.652 --> 02:04:53.378
Tight hold over the ball.
Carefully they pass it.

02:04:53.498 --> 02:04:56.240
They're doing something
but won't leave the ball.

02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:01.395
Raj, an experienced player
leaps with the ball...

02:05:01.515 --> 02:05:05.393
But Rohit Mehra catches the ball.

02:05:05.513 --> 02:05:06.692
Merely 10 seconds to go.

02:05:06.812 --> 02:05:12.723
Rohit somersaults
and gets to the hoop.

02:05:12.843 --> 02:05:15.230
Basket!

02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:17.728
Final score 50 to 49.

02:05:17.908 --> 02:05:22.465
Hurrah!

02:05:23.611 --> 02:05:26.183
Hurrah!

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:37.251
Thank you, Jadoo. We won!

02:05:37.371 --> 02:05:40.592
Hurrah!

02:05:40.823 --> 02:05:44.916
The Kasauli Tigers stand
with heads bowed.

02:05:45.036 --> 02:05:47.756
Little Pandavas stand proudly
and accept the cup.

02:05:47.876 --> 02:05:50.221
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

02:05:50.341 --> 02:05:54.029
The cup is being presented.
Please applaud!

02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:59.378
They also win
a Hero Honda motorbike.

02:05:59.498 --> 02:06:01.101
Rohit.

02:06:03.693 --> 02:06:07.005
Not now. Something remains.

02:06:07.672 --> 02:06:09.985
Bring on Hero's Honda. Let's go.

02:06:11.066 --> 02:06:12.677
I can't believe this.

02:06:12.797 --> 02:06:15.483
How did the kids fly?

02:06:16.451 --> 02:06:20.236
There is some secret.
Must find out from the kids.

02:06:20.356 --> 02:06:21.531
What are you saying?

02:06:21.651 --> 02:06:22.662
Whatever I'm saying is right.

02:06:23.354 --> 02:06:25.259
My son is getting maligned
because of our friendship.

02:06:25.961 --> 02:06:28.469
He's become a laughing
stock for everybody.

02:06:29.164 --> 02:06:31.033
And your daughter
is the cause of it.

02:06:31.153 --> 02:06:34.666
I understand.
I also tried to convince Nisha.

02:06:34.786 --> 02:06:35.847
What do you mean?

02:06:36.925 --> 02:06:40.030
Do you mean if Nisha
wants to marry Rohit...

02:06:40.438 --> 02:06:42.609
In spite of knowing
that he is retarded...

02:06:42.873 --> 02:06:45.294
Will you give your daughter
away to that lunatic?

02:06:46.359 --> 02:06:48.620
Branding me a lunatic
won't solve the problem.

02:06:49.224 --> 02:06:52.042
Simply branding a person mad
won't explain his madness.

02:06:52.162 --> 02:06:55.184
What category of madness
does he fit into?

02:06:55.304 --> 02:06:58.502
Schizophrenia is madness,
megalomania is madness.

02:06:58.622 --> 02:07:02.308
Obsession, psychopathy
and mental imbalance is madness.

02:07:02.428 --> 02:07:04.264
And lunacy is madness.

02:07:04.384 --> 02:07:06.032
There's no limit to madness.

02:07:06.152 --> 02:07:09.358
There are many names
for mad diseases.

02:07:09.506 --> 02:07:12.160
Certain forms of madness
appear to be so...

02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:15.328
But actually they're not mad
while some are actually mad...

02:07:15.448 --> 02:07:17.244
But their madness isn't visible.

02:07:17.364 --> 02:07:20.427
In short, this is a short
summary on madness.

02:07:22.175 --> 02:07:25.512
Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

02:07:25.632 --> 02:07:27.102
I'll have a Bournvita.

02:07:27.222 --> 02:07:28.543
Thank you.
- Yes.

02:07:31.169 --> 02:07:34.130
As I was saying there
are kinds of lunacy.

02:07:35.408 --> 02:07:39.394
Shaking your legs nervously
is a form of madness.

02:07:40.622 --> 02:07:42.197
And you think I'm mad.

02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:44.637
Yes. I'm mad.

02:07:45.179 --> 02:07:46.655
I'm madly in love
with your daughter.

02:07:48.264 --> 02:07:50.588
Madly in love with Nisha.

02:07:51.229 --> 02:07:52.719
Holy smoke!

02:07:59.944 --> 02:08:02.191
"Holy smoke!"

02:08:25.323 --> 02:08:27.040
"Oh my God!
- Something crazy happened."

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:28.843
"Oh my God!
- Your sensational touch!"

02:08:28.963 --> 02:08:32.389
"Oh my God, I feel as if
I'm in a different world."

02:08:32.509 --> 02:08:36.067
"What have I done unknowingly?"

02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:43.287
"Oh my God, I felt as if
I'm in a different world."

02:08:43.407 --> 02:08:46.944
"What have I done unknowingly?"

02:08:54.082 --> 02:08:55.754
"Oh my God!
- Something crazy happened."

02:08:55.874 --> 02:08:57.562
"Oh my God!
- Your sensational touch!"

02:08:57.682 --> 02:09:01.141
"Holy smoke!
What is this desire in me?"

02:09:01.261 --> 02:09:04.713
"What is this change in me?"

02:09:04.833 --> 02:09:08.362
"Holy smoke!
What is this desire in me?"

02:09:08.482 --> 02:09:12.386
"What is this change in me?"

02:09:40.653 --> 02:09:44.105
"The touch was just an excuse..."

02:09:44.225 --> 02:09:47.968
"To come close to you.
You have touched my heart."

02:09:51.592 --> 02:09:55.923
"I have always loved you forever..."

02:09:56.043 --> 02:09:59.535
"I only have confessed it to you."

02:10:03.936 --> 02:10:07.467
"I have realised
what is in your heart."

02:10:07.587 --> 02:10:11.078
"I have understood
the person that you are."

02:10:11.198 --> 02:10:14.033
"And the truth is that
you are crazy."

02:10:14.153 --> 02:10:15.856
"You have caught me.
- And your mischiefs too."

02:10:15.976 --> 02:10:17.883
"Your arms are flawless.
- Why did you grab them?"

02:10:18.021 --> 02:10:21.294
"You have set my pulse racing."

02:10:21.414 --> 02:10:23.036
"Oh my God!
- Something crazy happened."

02:10:23.156 --> 02:10:24.743
"Oh my God!
- Your sensational touch!"

02:10:24.863 --> 02:10:28.155
"Oh my God, I feel as if
I'm in a different world."

02:10:28.410 --> 02:10:31.849
"What have I done unknowingly?"

02:10:31.969 --> 02:10:35.482
"Holy smoke!
It happened when you touched me."

02:10:35.602 --> 02:10:39.092
"What is this desire evoked in me?"

02:10:39.212 --> 02:10:42.669
"I feel as if I have
no control on my heart."

02:10:42.789 --> 02:10:46.444
"I have no control over my heart."

02:11:18.677 --> 02:11:22.116
"I tried to stop my heart."

02:11:22.236 --> 02:11:26.265
"But it did not listen to me."

02:11:30.448 --> 02:11:33.938
"What have you done to it?"

02:11:34.058 --> 02:11:37.941
"Now, it only thinks about you."

02:11:42.124 --> 02:11:45.661
"Who knows what I did?
Who knows what happened?"

02:11:45.781 --> 02:11:49.289
"Who knows what I did?
Who knows what happened?"

02:11:49.409 --> 02:11:52.207
"I can't stop smiling since then."

02:11:52.327 --> 02:11:54.061
"Whether it is day...
- Or it is night."

02:11:54.181 --> 02:11:56.180
"Let's sit together.
- And talk all the time."

02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:59.736
"Love has conquered us."

02:11:59.856 --> 02:12:01.606
"Holy smoke!
- Something crazy happened."

02:12:01.726 --> 02:12:03.348
"Holy smoke!
- Your sensational touch!"

02:12:03.468 --> 02:12:06.976
"Holy smoke! What is this desire?"

02:12:07.096 --> 02:12:10.578
"Why can't my heart
stop being so crazy?"

02:12:10.698 --> 02:12:12.437
"Oh my God!
- Something crazy happened."

02:12:12.557 --> 02:12:14.210
"Oh my God!
- Your sensational touch!"

02:12:14.330 --> 02:12:17.878
"Oh my God! I feel as if
I'm in a different world.

02:12:17.998 --> 02:12:21.494
"What have I done unknowingly?"

02:12:21.614 --> 02:12:25.747
"I have no control over my heart."

02:12:42.348 --> 02:12:45.582
Why did you stop? The other
day you were jumping a lot.

02:12:46.183 --> 02:12:48.781
Jump over us today too.

02:12:50.822 --> 02:12:53.860
Why are you looking down?
What's in that bag?

02:12:54.871 --> 02:12:58.267
Run! The sun has set.
We must save Jadoo!

02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:45.527
Jadoo!

02:13:45.758 --> 02:13:47.011
Jadoo!

02:14:21.984 --> 02:14:24.347
Sir, I've seen it myself!

02:14:59.610 --> 02:15:01.067
Rohit!

02:15:05.959 --> 02:15:09.737
Stop firing. Follow me.

02:15:28.695 --> 02:15:29.840
Jadoo.

02:15:38.532 --> 02:15:39.786
Check the bag.

02:15:58.478 --> 02:15:59.605
Come and check.

02:16:31.886 --> 02:16:32.960
Hey!

02:17:49.615 --> 02:17:51.900
Go home.

02:17:55.127 --> 02:17:56.771
But how did you run?

02:18:00.142 --> 02:18:01.557
Ran.

02:18:08.241 --> 02:18:11.146
Got saved today.
- You were great.

02:18:16.936 --> 02:18:18.183
What's wrong?

02:18:18.369 --> 02:18:20.311
Is Jadoo here?
- He's inside.

02:18:25.732 --> 02:18:26.796
Rohit.

02:18:27.224 --> 02:18:28.340
What happened?

02:18:29.323 --> 02:18:31.014
The way inspector Khan
looked at me.

02:18:32.129 --> 02:18:33.536
He suspects us.

02:18:35.522 --> 02:18:36.986
We must hide Jadoo elsewhere.

02:18:37.106 --> 02:18:39.829
In my house.
My parents have gone out.

02:18:41.332 --> 02:18:43.135
No. My house is best.

02:18:43.521 --> 02:18:46.747
Nobody will imagine Jadoo
is with the collector's friend.

02:18:46.924 --> 02:18:49.249
But how long will you hide him?

02:18:49.491 --> 02:18:51.466
Someday he'll be caught.
- No!

02:18:53.063 --> 02:18:55.984
I'll take Jadoo and
go to another city.

02:18:56.854 --> 02:18:59.092
Once the police begin looking...

02:19:00.297 --> 02:19:02.898
You can't hide Jadoo
anywhere in the world.

02:19:03.233 --> 02:19:04.461
Then what do we do?

02:19:07.709 --> 02:19:10.143
There's only one
way to save his life.

02:19:11.958 --> 02:19:13.485
Send him back...

02:19:16.555 --> 02:19:17.968
To where he's come from.

02:19:18.088 --> 02:19:21.243
No, mother!
Nobody can take Jadoo away from me!

02:19:22.093 --> 02:19:25.380
Nobody can touch him
as long as I am alive!

02:19:25.755 --> 02:19:26.929
Rohit.

02:19:28.372 --> 02:19:29.656
Aunt is right.

02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:33.710
You can't fight the world.

02:19:37.269 --> 02:19:40.818
Jadoo won't go.

02:19:49.179 --> 02:19:52.794
Everyone will be sad
at being separated.

02:19:53.508 --> 02:19:57.174
But you will safe
only in your world.

02:19:58.244 --> 02:20:00.164
Jadoo won't go.

02:20:00.922 --> 02:20:04.677
Or the powers will go.

02:20:10.125 --> 02:20:11.422
What does he mean?

02:20:16.143 --> 02:20:17.396
He means...

02:20:18.611 --> 02:20:20.218
All the powers will leave with him.

02:20:22.462 --> 02:20:23.753
That he has given me.

02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:38.663
Jadoo.

02:20:44.649 --> 02:20:45.978
You don't worry about me.

02:20:47.485 --> 02:20:48.740
I was alright before you came...

02:20:50.172 --> 02:20:51.292
I'll live the same way again.

02:20:57.741 --> 02:20:58.905
Rohit.

02:20:59.025 --> 02:21:00.166
Go, my son...

02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:05.520
Lest it gets too late.

02:21:12.874 --> 02:21:14.390
We'll miss you.

02:21:26.430 --> 02:21:27.763
What's happening?

02:21:29.574 --> 02:21:30.778
There's no answer.

02:21:30.898 --> 02:21:32.206
'Rohit!'

02:21:37.116 --> 02:21:41.021
We know the alien is with you.

02:21:42.341 --> 02:21:44.404
Hand him over to us.

02:21:49.794 --> 02:21:52.958
We've surrounded your house.

02:21:56.092 --> 02:22:00.695
We'll count to 10.
If you don't hand him over...

02:22:00.958 --> 02:22:03.437
We'll attack your house.

02:22:04.958 --> 02:22:07.257
'Receiving'

02:22:07.466 --> 02:22:08.796
One!

02:22:10.849 --> 02:22:12.198
Two!

02:22:12.551 --> 02:22:14.464
Perform some magic.

02:22:15.745 --> 02:22:17.005
Sunlight.

02:22:17.456 --> 02:22:18.648
Three!

02:22:21.804 --> 02:22:23.059
Four!

02:22:26.412 --> 02:22:28.154
They're responding.

02:22:28.274 --> 02:22:30.980
'Receiving'

02:22:31.188 --> 02:22:32.727
Five!

02:22:35.864 --> 02:22:37.031
Six!

02:23:40.376 --> 02:23:41.423
Rohit!

02:23:41.543 --> 02:23:43.521
Rohit!
- Rohit!

02:23:43.725 --> 02:23:45.202
Rohit!

02:23:45.322 --> 02:23:47.872
Rohit! Hand him over to us.

02:23:48.561 --> 02:23:53.049
Never!
- Don't compel us to use force.

02:23:54.187 --> 02:23:57.958
Do as you please
but I won't hand him to you!

02:23:58.078 --> 02:23:59.468
Snatch him.

02:24:11.444 --> 02:24:12.998
Leave my child alone!

02:24:20.125 --> 02:24:21.468
Leave him!

02:24:26.284 --> 02:24:27.899
Rohit!

02:24:35.675 --> 02:24:37.377
Rohit!

02:24:37.497 --> 02:24:40.311
Rohit!

02:25:21.613 --> 02:25:23.661
Jadoo!

02:25:59.617 --> 02:26:01.513
Kasauli base, come in please.
- We have captured the alien.

02:26:01.633 --> 02:26:04.105
Khan here. We'll soon be there

02:26:08.003 --> 02:26:09.913
I won't leave him! Jadoo!

02:26:10.033 --> 02:26:11.492
Rohit?
- Rohit?

02:26:11.794 --> 02:26:12.847
I won't leave him!

02:26:16.142 --> 02:26:18.033
Mother, where's Jadoo?

02:26:19.207 --> 02:26:20.346
They took him away.

02:26:20.466 --> 02:26:21.874
Where?
- I'll tell you.

02:26:22.997 --> 02:26:27.518
Yes, me. I never saw
such love and friendship.

02:26:28.391 --> 02:26:31.274
From Delhi, they're taking
your friend to America.

02:26:31.844 --> 02:26:32.970
Rohit.

02:26:33.874 --> 02:26:36.750
If you want to repay Jadoo
for his favours...

02:26:37.425 --> 02:26:40.063
Go, this is the time.

02:26:40.769 --> 02:26:42.651
Save him and prove...

02:26:43.963 --> 02:26:46.441
That goodness still exists.

02:26:46.759 --> 02:26:47.985
Rohit, go!

02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:52.959
Jadoo!

02:29:07.441 --> 02:29:08.613
Let's go.

02:29:24.084 --> 02:29:25.214
You?

02:29:26.599 --> 02:29:27.910
Jadoo?

02:29:32.267 --> 02:29:33.433
Let's go.

02:29:33.553 --> 02:29:34.746
Drive faster!

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:41.828
Fast!

02:30:08.521 --> 02:30:10.556
You! Where's Rohit?

02:30:10.676 --> 02:30:14.167
Inspector Khan! Keep searching.

02:32:15.652 --> 02:32:16.986
Go, my friend.

02:32:18.130 --> 02:32:19.825
They're waiting for you.

02:32:44.440 --> 02:32:46.589
Thank you.

02:34:16.193 --> 02:34:18.343
'Rohit Mehra remanded
to police custody.'

02:34:30.419 --> 02:34:34.792
This is Priti Sompura reporting
for Zee News from Kasauli town.

02:34:34.996 --> 02:34:38.968
'A Special court acquitted
Rohit Mehra on the basis...'

02:34:39.088 --> 02:34:41.281
That he's mentally abnormal.

02:34:41.563 --> 02:34:45.849
The town has gathered
to honour Rohit Mehra.

02:34:45.969 --> 02:34:49.601
Rohit considered
the alien his friend...

02:34:49.721 --> 02:34:51.701
By sending him back to his world...

02:34:51.821 --> 02:34:55.116
He set a new example
of friendship and humanity.

02:34:55.377 --> 02:34:58.979
Let's all welcome him.

02:35:16.715 --> 02:35:19.891
Rohit once said,
he'd become a great man.

02:35:20.011 --> 02:35:21.907
He's proved it.

02:35:22.820 --> 02:35:24.114
Thank you.

02:35:25.954 --> 02:35:27.065
Thank you.

02:35:39.885 --> 02:35:41.306
Miss you, Jadoo.

02:35:49.981 --> 02:35:51.616
I know what you're thinking.

02:35:54.180 --> 02:35:56.213
Jadoo took back his powers.

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:00.053
But he hasn't taken my love.

02:36:04.774 --> 02:36:07.205
You thought you were a hero.

02:36:09.779 --> 02:36:11.128
What are you looking at?

02:36:11.819 --> 02:36:14.804
The one on whose strength
you were flying, has left.

02:36:15.421 --> 02:36:16.923
Now pass the ball.

02:36:20.725 --> 02:36:22.059
Rohit, let's go.

02:36:23.421 --> 02:36:25.075
Come on.
- Take him away...

02:36:25.321 --> 02:36:27.230
And let him wear your bangles.

02:36:37.599 --> 02:36:38.911
Rohit!

02:36:42.633 --> 02:36:44.617
Rohit, the ball is flying!

02:36:47.499 --> 02:36:48.587
I can't see!

02:36:48.707 --> 02:36:52.601
There.
- I don't see...

02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:02.477
I can see.

02:37:02.761 --> 02:37:04.113
I see clearly.

02:37:04.233 --> 02:37:07.298
Jadoo has returned your powers!

02:37:08.541 --> 02:37:09.960
Look up there!

02:37:17.724 --> 02:37:19.565
Thank you, Jadoo.

02:37:20.421 --> 02:37:22.421
Thank you, Jadoo.
