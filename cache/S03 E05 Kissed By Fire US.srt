1
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,499
Lord, cast your light upon us.

2
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,043
Lord of Light, defend us.

3
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,631
Show us the truth.

4
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,511
Strike this man down if he is guilty.
Give strength to his sword if he is true.

5
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,640
Lord of Light, give us wisdom.

6
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,524
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

7
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,569
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

8
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:55,944
Get back!

9
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:27,183
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

10
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:32,563
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

11
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,317
-Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
-Kill him!

12
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:41,155
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

13
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,171
Lord, cast your light upon this man,
your servant.

14
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,965
Bring him back from death and darkness.

15
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,842
His flame has been extinguished.
Restore it.

16
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,761
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

17
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,596
-Lord, cast...
-Arya, don't!

18
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,932
Bring him back from death and darkness...

19
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,770
No! Let go of me! Let me go!

20
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,149
Looks like their God likes me more
than your butcher's boy.

21
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,608
Burn in hell!

22
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,235
He will.

23
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,574
But not today.

24
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,769
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

25
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,145
Tell me what you know.

26
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,856
There are four to a patrol,

27
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,358
two builders to check
for structural damage,

28
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,818
two rangers to watch for enemies.

29
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,570
How often do these patrols go out?

30
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,114
It varies.

31
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,493
If I knew where on the Wall
we were heading, I could tell you.

32
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,660
You'd like to know that.

33
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,249
There are 19 castles guarding the Wall.

34
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,461
How many are manned?

35
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,799
-Three.
-You sure of that?

36
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,261
Which three?

37
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,724
Castle Black.

38
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,896
Aye, Castle Black.
Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?

39
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,864
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
and the Shadow Tower.

40
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,787
How many men remain in Castle Black?

41
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,163
-A thousand.
-Liar.

42
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,167
What happens to your eagle
after I kill you?

43
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,170
Does he drift away
like a kite with his strings cut

44
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,049
-or does he just flop dead to the ground?
-He's no crow.

45
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,468
Just because you want him inside you
don't make him one of us.

46
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,469
I'm not afraid of you.

47
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,854
I like you, boy.

48
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,356
But if you lie to me,

49
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,860
I'll pull your guts out
through your throat.

50
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,447
A thousand men.

51
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,247
We'll find out soon enough.

52
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,841
-I don't need you to protect me.
-Of course you do.

53
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,719
Who stopped Rattleshirt
when he was about to cut your throat?

54
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,387
Who vouched for you with Mance?

55
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,140
It seems you owe me a debt.

56
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,269
-Give it back.
-Well, I stole it.

57
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,939
It's mine. If you want it,
come steal it back.

58
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,318
Ygritte!

59
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,279
Ygritte!

60
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,871
Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!

61
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,335
Is Orell right?

62
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,296
Are you still a crow?

63
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,633
It's time you proved yourself.

64
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,970
-Ygritte.
-You swore some vows.

65
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,557
I want you to break them.

66
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,978
I want you to see me.

67
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,608
All of me.

68
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,582
We shouldn't.

69
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,586
We should.

70
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,316
Why are you still dressed?

71
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,444
You know nothing, Jon Sn...

72
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,046
That thing you did, with your mouth...

73
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,218
is that what lords do
to their ladies in the South?

74
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,306
I don't know.
I just wanted to kiss you there is all.

75
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,519
-You seemed to like it.
-Aye, I liked it some.

76
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,021
Who taught you that?

77
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,357
There's been no one else. Only you.

78
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:14,739
-A maid. You were a maid.
-I was a man of the Night's Watch.

79
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,202
-How about you? Were you a maid?
-What do you think?

80
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,788
-Who was he?
-Just a boy.

81
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,458
He came trading with his brothers.

82
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:32,590
He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire. But he was weak.

83
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,092
Not like you.

84
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,305
That was the first one.
Then there was this Thenn boy.

85
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,808
Spoke no Common, but gods,
he was built like a mammoth...

86
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,394
Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough.

87
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,317
We'd best get back. Tormund...

88
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,822
I'm not done with you yet.

89
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,123
How long's it been since you had a bath?

90
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,891
Let's not go back.

91
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,895
Let's stay here a while longer.

92
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,901
I don't ever want to leave this cave,
Jon Snow.

93
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,446
Not ever.

94
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,418
I want my gold.

95
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,628
It says it clearly right there
on that note you'll be repaid in full

96
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,712
when the war's over.

97
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,965
Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.

98
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,718
We're outlaws. Outlaws steal.
You're lucky we didn't kill you.

99
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,471
Come try it, archer.
I'll shove those arrows up your ass.

100
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,932
You can't let him go.
He's a murderer. He's guilty.

101
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,976
-Not in the eyes of God.
-You can't!

102
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,562
Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.

103
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,570
Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.
The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.

104
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,951
Riders coming through!

105
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,673
The Kingslayer.

106
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,134
Down! On your knees.

107
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,722
Lord Bolton, I give you the King slayer.

108
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,808
Pick him up, Locke.

109
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,611
-You've lost a hand.
-No, my lord, he has it here.

110
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,533
-Take this away.
-Send it to his father?

111
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,202
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

112
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:12,041
Cut her free. Apologies, my lady.
You're under my protection now.

113
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,251
Thank you, my lord.

114
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,343
Find suitable rooms for our guests.
We'll speak later.

115
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,846
Lord Bolton.

116
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,727
Is there word from the capital?

117
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,438
You haven't heard?

118
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,150
Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to King's Landing.

119
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:43,697
Sailed into Blackwater Bay.
Stormed the gates with thousands of men.

120
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,117
And your sister...

121
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,250
How can I put this?

122
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,170
Your sister...

123
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,760
is alive and well.
Your father's forces prevailed.

124
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:11,058
Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.

125
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,371
-Will I die?
-No.

126
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,709
The corruption has spread.
I fear it must be cut away.

127
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,795
The safest course
would be to take the whole arm off.

128
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,422
Then you'll die.

129
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,845
You're no maester. Where's your chain?

130
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,098
The Citadel stripped me of it.

131
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,644
They found some of my experiments
too bold.

132
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,065
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

133
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,818
I don't need my right hand to kill you.

134
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,739
I can take away the rotting flesh

135
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,368
and try and burn out the corruption
with boiling wine.

136
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,790
With any luck, that will suffice.
You'll need milk of the poppy.

137
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,586
-No milk of the poppy.
-There will be pain.

138
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,714
-I'll scream.
-Quite a bit of pain.

139
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,549
I'll scream loudly.

140
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,420
-Lord Baelish.
-Your Grace.

141
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,257
-I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
-Of course, Your Grace.

142
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,176
I have reason to believe
that House Tyrell do not hold

143
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,969
the Crown's best interests at heart.

144
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,682
I see. And have you shared
these suspicions with Lord Tywin?

145
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,352
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

146
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,021
Myself, I often find them a hindrance.

147
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,316
And he appreciates those
who aid his family, as you well know.

148
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,776
He's almost as generous
to those who help us

149
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,362
as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.

150
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,281
You have a good working relationship
with the Tyrells.

151
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,867
I thought you might look into it
before you leave the capital.

152
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,286
-I shall do my best.
-Thank you.

153
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,706
And your best will prove better
than when I asked you

154
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,332
to locate Arya Stark?

155
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,667
I assure you that it will.

156
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,760
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

157
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,137
-Pardon, my lady.
-No need to speak.

158
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,847
Are there any figs? Fetch some.

159
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,726
I always take figs midafternoon.
They help move the bowels.

160
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,688
-To what do I owe this summons?
-Thank you for seeing me, my lady.

161
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,149
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

162
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:09,194
I climbed all those steps
to discuss financial matters?

163
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,947
It's the royal wedding.
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

164
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,073
Naturally.

165
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,451
It's shaping up to be
a very involved affair.

166
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,786
The word "extravagant" has been used.

167
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,455
What good is the word "extravagant"

168
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,832
if it can't be used to describe
a royal wedding?

169
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,834
-I understand that.
-Good.

170
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:28,047
But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me
to calculate the cost for the Crown.

171
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,133
-As of now, it's a huge expense.
-And?

172
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,512
And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

173
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,890
I'd nearly forgotten.

174
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,851
-Yes, and maintaining supply lines--
-I can't think how it slipped my mind.

175
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:45,439
What is it, 12,000 infantrymen
the Tyrell family has supplied?

176
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,860
Eighteen hundred mounted lances.
Two thousand in support.

177
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,155
Provisions so this city
might survive the winter.

178
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,615
A million bushels of wheat.

179
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,368
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

180
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,371
Twenty thousand head of cattle.
Fifty thousand sheep.

181
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,333
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

182
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,626
I'm quite familiar with them.

183
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,961
And we are so grateful
for your contributions

184
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,422
which are necessary
for the preservation of the realm.

185
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,007
As is a royal wedding.

186
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,843
The people are hungry for more
than just food.

187
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,470
They crave distractions.

188
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,431
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

189
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,603
And their distractions are likely
to end with us being torn to pieces.

190
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,231
A royal wedding is much safer.

191
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,483
-Wouldn't you say?
-I would.

192
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,987
And traditionally paid for
by the royal family.

193
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,952
I was told you were drunk, impertinent,
and thoroughly debauched.

194
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,079
You can imagine my disappointment

195
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,581
at finding nothing
but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

196
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,252
Where did you go for them, Volantis?

197
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,381
-My lady--
-Very well.

198
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,968
I won't have it said that House Tyrell
refuses to play its part.

199
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,553
We'll pay for half the expenses

200
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,596
and the celebrations will go on
as planned.

201
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,182
-Is that sufficient?
-Quite sufficient. Thank you.

202
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,518
Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.

203
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:08,939
Give me that.

204
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,696
What are you doing?

205
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,325
-Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
-Why?

206
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,912
I'm going to stay on
and smith for the Brotherhood.

207
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,914
Have you lost your mind?

208
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,001
When the Lannisters find this place,
you think they'll spare the smiths?

209
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,086
They'll cave your head in
with your own helmet.

210
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,589
The Lannisters wanted to kill me
long before I joined the Brotherhood.

211
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:34,965
You don't have to do this.

212
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,303
I want to. They need good men.

213
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,097
Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.

214
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,349
-And then you--
-What? Serve him?

215
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,853
I've served men my entire life.

216
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,190
I served Master Mott at King's Landing
and he sold me to the Watch.

217
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,028
I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal,
wondering every day

218
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,529
if I'd get tortured or killed.

219
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,449
I'm done serving.

220
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,492
You just said you were serving Lord Beric.

221
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,455
He may be their leader,
but they chose him.

222
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,751
These men are brothers. They're a family.

223
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,754
I've never had a family.

224
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,967
I can be your family.

225
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,308
You wouldn't be my family.
You'd be "my lady."

226
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,828
Willem.

227
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,833
Willem!

228
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,340
-Is this a rescue?
-Lannister filth! Take him!

229
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,134
Please, I didn't do anything.
I'm just a squire. Please...

230
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,066
Bring them in.

231
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,875
Is that all of them?

232
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,631
It took five of you to murder
two unarmed squires?

233
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,677
-Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance.
-Vengeance?

234
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,639
Those boys didn't kill your sons.

235
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,143
I saw Harrion die on the battlefield
and Torrhen--

236
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,936
Was strangled by the Kingslayer.

237
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,230
-They were his kin.
-They were boys!

238
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,900
Look at them.

239
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,990
Tell your mother to look at them.
She killed them as much as I.

240
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,367
My mother had nothing to do with this.

241
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,536
This was your treason.

242
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:14,291
It's treason to free your enemies.
In war, you kill your enemies.

243
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,126
Did your father not teach you that, boy?

244
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,919
Leave him.

245
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,967
Aye.

246
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,970
Leave me to the king.

247
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,140
He wants to give me a scolding
before he sets me free.

248
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,938
That's how he deals with treason.
Our King in the North.

249
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:42,444
Or should I call him
the King Who Lost the North?

250
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,242
Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon.
Hang the rest.

251
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,829
Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone.
I only watched for the guards.

252
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,997
This one was only the watcher.

253
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,250
Hang him last
so he can watch the others die.

254
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,127
Please! Please, no. They made me do it!

255
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,923
They made me! They made me!

256
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,560
Word of this can't leave Riverrun.
They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.

257
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,814
The Lannisters pay their debts.
They never stop talking about it.

258
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,607
Would you make me a liar
as well as a murderer?

259
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,858
It wouldn't be lying.

260
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,904
We will bury them and remain silent
until the war is done.

261
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,656
I'm not fighting for justice

262
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,408
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

263
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,244
no matter how highborn.

264
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,125
-He has to die.
-The Karstarks are Northmen.

265
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,086
They won't forgive
the killing of their lord.

266
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,087
Your mother's right.

267
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,924
If you do this,
the Karstarks will abandon you.

268
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,592
You tended to their wounds.

269
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,929
You brought them supper.
Now, they're dead.

270
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,724
And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.

271
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,601
You need Karstark men to end it.

272
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,937
Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.

273
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,522
A hostage.

274
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,442
Tell the Karstarks
that as long as they remain loyal,

275
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,361
he will not be harmed.

276
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,058
The blood of the First Men flows
through my veins as much as yours, boy.

277
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,478
I fought the Mad King for your father.

278
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:48,570
I fought Joffrey for you.
We are kin, Stark and Karstark.

279
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,407
That didn't stop you from betraying me.
And it won't save you now.

280
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,534
I don't want it to save me.

281
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,455
I want it to haunt you
to the end of your days.

282
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,249
Kneel, my lord.

283
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,221
Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold,

284
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,807
here in sight of gods and men,
I sentence you to die.

285
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,727
Would you speak a final word?

286
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:27,192
Kill me and be cursed.
You are no king of mine.

287
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,585
Joffrey. Cersei.

288
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,631
Ilyn Payne.

289
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,218
Ser Meryn.

290
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,306
The Hound.

291
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,481
-What are you going to do with me?
-At first light we'll ride for Riverrun.

292
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,817
Your brother's there now.

293
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,612
He'll make a contribution to our cause
and you can go home.

294
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,284
-I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
-Don't think of it that way.

295
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,661
-But it is that way.
-It is.

296
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,081
-And it isn't.
-More is than isn't.

297
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,585
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know?

298
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,588
He wanted to refuse
your ransom altogether.

299
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,716
-So, why don't you?
-We need the gold.

300
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,398
-Do I frighten you, child?
-No.

301
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,238
You're angry with me.
And I don't blame you.

302
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,365
But letting him go was the right thing.

303
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,826
I have more reason
than most to want him hanged.

304
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,911
-I thought he killed you.
-He did.

305
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,580
But how...

306
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,540
Thoros.

307
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,920
-How many times have you brought me back?
-It's the Lord of Light brings you back.

308
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,632
I'm just the lucky drunk
who says the words.

309
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,634
-How many times?
-Five, I think.

310
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,430
-No, this makes six.
-Six.

311
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,183
There was the first time, the Mountain.

312
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,021
Show her. Lance right through the chest.

313
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,524
Then I was stabbed in the belly.

314
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,569
Then it was an arrow in the back.
And that axe in the side.

315
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,490
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

316
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:45,455
-Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
-Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.

317
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,707
And the Hound makes six.

318
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,835
Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.

319
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,045
You'd think you'd learn.

320
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:58,051
-It's not getting any easier, you know?
-I know.

321
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,931
Every time I come back, I'm a bit less.

322
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,643
Pieces of you get chipped away.

323
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,730
Could you bring back a man without a head?

324
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,444
Not six times. Just once.

325
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,322
I don't think it works that way, child.

326
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,247
He was a good man, Ned Stark.

327
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,753
He's at rest now, somewhere.
I would never wish my life upon him.

328
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:35,964
I would.

329
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,468
You're alive.

330
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:52,397
Lord, cast your light upon me.
Protect me in the darkness.

331
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:59,404
Burn away my sins. Help me serve you.

332
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,407
Use me as you will.

333
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:09,289
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

334
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,845
I have prayed day
and night for you to come to me.

335
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,225
My lady. I meant to come sooner.

336
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,188
-The battle--
-I know of your troubles, my king.

337
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,357
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

338
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,526
Yes, of course.

339
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:53,500
You mustn't despair. Your claim is true.
You will be victorious.

340
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,751
I believed that once.

341
00:29:54,834 --> 00:30:00,173
You are the One God's champion,
and the finest man I've ever known.

342
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,424
Selyse.

343
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,929
I've broken a sacred vow.

344
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,143
-I've sinned.
-No.

345
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,770
I've wronged you.

346
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,191
-I have shamed you.
-You're doing God's work.

347
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,192
You don't understand.

348
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,283
The Red Woman...

349
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,497
-The Lady Melisandre.
-I know, Stannis.

350
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,834
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

351
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:42,131
No act done in service
of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.

352
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,635
When she told me,

353
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,682
I wept with joy.

354
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,737
My sweet boys.

355
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:11,494
Petyr, Tommard, Edric.

356
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:19,627
I thank God every day
for bringing Melisandre to us.

357
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,547
She gave you a son.

358
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,342
I gave you...

359
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,263
-nothing.
-That's not true.

360
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,270
So, you've come to see her as well?

361
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,858
There is no need.

362
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,154
You must keep away from such distractions.

363
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,572
She's my daughter.

364
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,451
I want to see her.

365
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,374
You are a king.
You don't need my permission.

366
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,926
Under the sea, I know, I know

367
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:17,977
The birds have scales
And the fish take wing

368
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,813
I know, I know

369
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,611
-Shireen.
-Father!

370
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,624
-You've grown since I last saw you.
-Mother said you fought in a battle.

371
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,418
Did you win?

372
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,129
No.

373
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,216
Did the Onion Knight come back with you?

374
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:55,181
-He did. He fought bravely.
-He hasn't come to visit me.

375
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,226
He said he'd bring me back
a present from the capital.

376
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:03,314
-He won't be visiting, child.
-Why not? He's my friend. Look.

377
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,157
He made this for me.

378
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,245
But don't tell Mother I have it.
It's a secret.

379
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,789
Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.

380
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,627
Ser Davos is a traitor.

381
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,757
He's rotting in a dungeon cell
for his crime.

382
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,601
Best forget him.

383
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,117
Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.

384
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,703
-What are you doing here?
-I need a bath.

385
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,164
Help me out of these rags.

386
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,006
Now, get out.

387
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,857
-There's another tub.
-This one suits me fine.

388
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,456
Don't worry. I'm not interested.

389
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,002
If I faint, pull me out.

390
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,298
I don't intend to be the first
Lannister to die in a bathtub.

391
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:56,302
-Why should I care how you die?
-You swore a solemn vow, remember?

392
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,181
You're supposed to get me
to King's Landing in one piece.

393
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,434
Not going so well, is it?

394
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,729
No wonder Renly died
with you guarding him.

395
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,993
That was unworthy. Forgive me.
You protected me better than most--

396
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,287
-Don't you mock me.
-I'm apologizing.

397
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:30,670
-I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
-You need trust to have a truce.

398
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,631
I trust you.

399
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,350
There it is. There's the look.

400
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,354
I've seen it for 17 years
on face after face.

401
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:55,152
You all despise me.
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.

402
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,947
A man without honor.

403
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,540
-You've heard of wildfire?
-Of course.

404
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,333
The Mad King was obsessed with it.

405
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,211
He loved to watch people burn,

406
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,717
the way their skin blackened,
and blistered, and melted off their bones.

407
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,346
He burned lords he didn't like.
He burned Hands who disobeyed him.

408
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,474
He burned anyone who was against him.

409
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,104
Before long,
half the country was against him.

410
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,693
Aerys saw traitors everywhere.

411
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:42,742
So, he had his pyromancer place caches
of wildfire all over the city.

412
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,122
Beneath the Sept of Baelor
and the slums of Flea Bottom.

413
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:53,794
Under houses, stables, taverns.
Even beneath the Red Keep itself.

414
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:01,010
Finally... the day of reckoning came.

415
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,307
Robert Baratheon marched on the capital
after his victory at the Trident.

416
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,354
But my father arrived first
with the whole Lannister army at his back,

417
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,900
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

418
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,196
I knew my father better than that.

419
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,074
He's never been one
to pick the losing side.

420
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:29,455
I told the Mad King as much.
I urged him to surrender peacefully.

421
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,250
But the king didn't listen to me.

422
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,670
He didn't listen to Varys
who tried to warn him.

423
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,715
But he did listen
to Grand Maester Pycelle,

424
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,635
that grey, sunken cunt.

425
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,973
"You can trust the Lannisters," he said.

426
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,062
"The Lannisters have always been
true friends of the crown."

427
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,236
So, we opened the gates
and my father sacked the city.

428
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:06,867
Once again, I came to the king,
begging him to surrender.

429
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:15,626
He told me to bring him my father's head.

430
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,215
Then he turned to his pyromancer.

431
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,802
"Burn them all," he said.

432
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:30,725
"Burn them in their homes.
Burn them in their beds."

433
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,313
Tell me, if your precious Renly

434
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,526
commanded you to kill your own father

435
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,865
and stand by while thousands of men,
women, and children burned alive,

436
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:50,244
would you have done it?
Would you have kept your oath then?

437
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:58,210
First, I killed the pyromancer.

438
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:04,842
And then when the king turned to flee,
I drove my sword into his back.

439
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:10,264
"Burn them all," he kept saying.
"Burn them all."

440
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,895
I don't think he expected to die.
He meant to...

441
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,901
burn with the rest of us and rise again.

442
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,697
Reborn as a dragon
to turn his enemies to ash.

443
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,704
I slit his throat to make sure
that didn't happen.

444
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,753
That's where Ned Stark found me.

445
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,259
If this is true,
why didn't you tell anyone?

446
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,556
-Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
-Stark?

447
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:59,313
You think the honorable Ned Stark

448
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,941
wanted to hear my side?

449
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:07,822
He judged me guilty
the moment he set eyes on me.

450
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:16,705
By what right does the wolf
judge the lion?

451
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,418
-By what right?
-Help! Help! The Kingslayer!

452
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,465
Jaime. My name's Jaime.

453
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,014
Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.

454
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,269
Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?

455
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,813
-You'll wake Bert.
-Bert?

456
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,858
He's the fat one.
He's on guard duty tonight.

457
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,943
He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.

458
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,445
Go back to your room.
You're not supposed to be here.

459
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,531
-If your father knew--
-He said you're a traitor.

460
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,368
-Are you?
-I am, child.

461
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,290
I disobeyed my king, your father,
and now, I'm paying the price.

462
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:03,961
I don't care. You're my friend.
You must get bored down here.

463
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,715
I brought you something to read.
It's about Aegon and his dragons.

464
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,551
Aegon used to live here.
Did you know that?

465
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,970
And the Targaryens built this castle.

466
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,306
-So they did.
-You can hide the book under your cloak.

467
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,641
It's a good one. I'll bring you more.

468
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,019
Thank you, my lady.
I'm sure it's a fine book,

469
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,522
-but it's wasted on me.
-Take it. I have more.

470
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:29,111
-My lady, I can't read the words.
-You can't?

471
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,240
I'll teach you. I'll come
when Bert's on duty and teach you.

472
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,909
-No. No. No.
-It's easy. It'll be fun.

473
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,952
-Go. We can't.
-Why not?

474
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,830
What will they do, lock us in cells?

475
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,464
-I wouldn't know where to start.
-At the beginning.

476
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,300
This word is Aegon.

477
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,389
When you see A, E, and G
together like that, it sounds like egg.

478
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,391
And the title of the whole book

479
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:03,938
isAn History of Aegon the Conqueror
and His Conquest of Westeros.

480
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,868
It was a bitch of a siege.

481
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,037
You were first through the breach at Pyke?

482
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:25,709
The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone,
waving that flaming sword of his.

483
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:30,631
Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.
Robert knighted you after the battle?

484
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,760
Proudest moment of my life.
One knee in the dust,

485
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,721
the King's sword on my shoulder,
listening to the words.

486
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,474
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

487
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,603
All I could think of was
how badly I had to piss.

488
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,899
In full plate metal for 16 hours.

489
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,442
Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

490
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,862
I was very nearly the first man
knighted to piss on the king's boots.

491
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:00,286
Robert would have laughed.
He was a good man, a great warrior.

492
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,998
And a terrible king.

493
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,459
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

494
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,253
-You swore an oath.
-Yes.

495
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:14,216
And a man of honor keeps his vows,
even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.

496
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,927
Just once in my life before it's over,

497
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,763
I want to know
what it's like to serve with pride,

498
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:24,476
to fight for someone I believe in.
Do you believe in her?

499
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,440
With all my heart.

500
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,115
-These are the ones?
-Yes, Khaleesi. The officers.

501
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,529
All Unsullied boys are given new names
when they are cut.

502
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,033
Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.

503
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,913
Names that remind them
what they are. Vermin.

504
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,713
-King Robert wanted her dead.
-Of course, he wanted her dead.

505
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,133
She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

506
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,470
I suppose no one on the small council
could speak sense to him.

507
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,514
-I didn't sit on the small council.
-No?

508
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,684
Doesn't the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard traditionally--

509
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,438
Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen
of Robert's friends during his rebellion.

510
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,650
He didn't want advice on how to govern

511
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,485
from a man who had fought
for the Mad King.

512
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:42,948
Can't say I minded much.
I always hated the politics.

513
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,451
Yeah, I imagine I would too.

514
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:50,164
Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings
and betrayals the world over.

515
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,378
Still, she'll have to wade
through that muck

516
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,046
if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

517
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,883
She'll have good men
around her to advise her,

518
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,009
men with experience.

519
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,927
Which men do you have in mind?

520
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,971
Forgive me, Ser Jorah,
for what I'm about to say,

521
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,266
but your reputation in Westeros
has suffered over the years.

522
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,645
It suffered for a reason.
I sold men into slavery.

523
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,607
I don't know if your presence
by her side will help our cause

524
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,901
-when we go home.
-Our cause?

525
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,904
Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy

526
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,989
defending the Khaleesi
against King Robert's assassins

527
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,574
while you were still bowing to the man.

528
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,660
We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?

529
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,165
You only joined us a few days ago.
I can't speak to your intentions.

530
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:37,753
If we're truly her loyal servants,
we will do whatever needs to be done,

531
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,298
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

532
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:45,552
You're not Lord Commander here.
You're just another exile.

533
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,347
And I take my orders from the queen.

534
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,066
-Come to bed.
-You were right.

535
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:04,780
The Karstarks are gone.
Almost half our forces.

536
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,826
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs
to do to make us unravel.

537
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,205
Nothing. Only wait.

538
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,085
-Don't let him.
-What can I do?

539
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,462
Attack King's Landing?

540
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,383
There's nothing he'd like better.
He'd crush us in a day.

541
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,346
We could ride north.
Take your land back from the Greyjoys.

542
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,724
-Wait out the winter.
-Winter could last five years.

543
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,393
Once my bannermen are home again,

544
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,229
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,

545
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,232
warm and safe,
they'll never ride south again.

546
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:44,361
When I gathered my lords together,
we had a purpose, a mission.

547
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,905
Now, we're like
a band of bickering children.

548
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,952
-Give them a new purpose.
-What?

549
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,625
I don't know.
I don't even know where Winterfell is.

550
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,338
Here.

551
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,596
And we're here. King's Landing...

552
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,770
What is it?

553
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,693
I can't force them to meet us in the field

554
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,071
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

555
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,616
but I can attack them where they're not.

556
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,994
And Casterly Rock can't run away.

557
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,957
I'm going to take their home
away from them.

558
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,918
Can you do it?

559
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,672
I need men to replace
the Karstarks who marched home.

560
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,384
There is only one person in this kingdom
with that kind of army

561
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,303
who hasn't already sided
with the Lannisters.

562
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,976
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry, Walder Frey.

563
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:13,116
He's such a splendid fighter.
Do you have any idea when we might...

564
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,912
I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and I are married.

565
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,915
-It should grow quickly.
-Joffrey won't let me leave.

566
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,292
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

567
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,003
And only one to let you go.

568
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,591
-Because it will please me.
-Squire!

569
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,141
-Well fought, ser.
-That was no fight. I don't know you.

570
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,686
Olyver, if it please you.

571
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,899
I should like to see you spar
with a proper partner, ser.

572
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,535
-How did you know?
-Know what?

573
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,540
-That I wanted to.
-My lord...

574
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,463
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon

575
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,382
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

576
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,051
They rarely do, in my experience.

577
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:19,266
You have a good deal of experience,
do you? With the husbands.

578
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,821
-That didn't take long.
-Well, it took long enough.

579
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,826
It seems our Knight of Flowers
is engaged to be wed.

580
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,286
Is he?

581
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,331
And... who's the lucky girl?

582
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,837
She may not be the grandest ship
in the world or the fastest...

583
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:51,882
but she's mine.

584
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,930
I've always wanted a ship.
Now, I want a dozen.

585
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,684
-Strange, isn't it?
-What is?

586
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,771
It doesn't matter what we want,
once we get it,

587
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:07,731
then we want something else.

588
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,654
-Your hair is different.
-Is it?

589
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:19,075
-Lady Margaery wears it that way.
-Many ladies wear it this way.

590
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,205
I have good news.
I'll be leaving the city soon.

591
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,625
-You still want me to come with you?
-It's not a question of what I want.

592
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,629
It's what you want.
You want to go home, don't you?

593
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,881
Of course. More than anything.

594
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,386
But maybe it would be better to wait.

595
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,515
I've been thinking
how dangerous it would be.

596
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:45,977
Not just for me, but for you.
You've been so kind.

597
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,355
I'd feel terrible
if anything happened to you.

598
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:54,361
I can't tell you how touched I am
by your concern for my welfare.

599
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,240
I hope you know
that I'm your friend, Sansa.

600
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,118
-Your true friend.
-I do, Lord Baelish.

601
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,703
-Petyr.
-Petyr.

602
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:09,417
If you wish to stay,
then of course, you will stay.

603
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,925
We'll speak again when I return.

604
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,648
You're late.

605
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:38,280
-What's she doing here?
-Our business concerns her too. Sit.

606
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,118
You'll be pleased to learn

607
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,079
that after one conversation
with Olenna Tyrell,

608
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,709
I've saved the Crown
hundreds of thousands on this wedding.

609
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,461
Never mind that now.
We have something important to discuss.

610
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,755
I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

611
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,343
Stop that.
You're making me uncomfortable.

612
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,346
Your sister has learned
that your new friends the Tyrells

613
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,224
are plotting to marry Sansa Stark
to Ser Loras.

614
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,144
Very well. She's a lovely girl.

615
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,857
Missing some of Loras' favorite bits,
but I'm sure they'll make do.

616
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,027
-Your jokes are not appreciated.
-It wasn't my best, but I thought--

617
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,946
I bring them into the royal fold
and this is how they repay me,

618
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,116
by trying to steal the key
to the North out from under me.

619
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,826
Sansa is the key to the North?

620
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,329
I seem to remember
she has an older brother.

621
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,122
The Karstarks have marched home.

622
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,375
The young wolf has lost half his army.
His days are numbered.

623
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,295
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.

624
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,465
That makes Sansa Stark
the heir to Winterfell.

625
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,385
And I am not about to hand her
over to the Tyrells.

626
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,096
The Tyrell army is helping us
to win this war.

627
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,599
Do you really think
it's wise to refuse them?

628
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,937
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.
Plots are not public knowledge.

629
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,149
And the Tyrells won't carry this one out
until after Joffrey's wedding.

630
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,278
We need to act first
and kill this union in its crib.

631
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,990
-And how do we do that?
-We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

632
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,117
-Wonderful.
-Yes, it is.

633
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,587
-You can't mean it.
-I can and I do.

634
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,798
Joffrey has made
this poor girl's life miserable

635
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,050
since the day he took her father's head.

636
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,637
Now, she's finally free of him
and you give her to me?

637
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,515
-That's cruel, even for you.
-Do you intend on mistreating her?

638
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,267
The girl's happiness is not my concern.

639
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,311
-Nor should it be yours.
-She's a child!

640
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,272
She's flowered, I assure you,
she and I have discussed it at length.

641
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:40,318
There, you see? You will wed her,
bed her, and put a child in her.

642
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,779
-Surely, you're capable of that.
-And if I refuse?

643
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,532
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

644
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:49,411
Sansa Stark is a finer reward
than you could ever dare hope for.

645
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,665
-And it is past time you were wed.
-I was wed.

646
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,501
Or don't you remember?

647
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,588
Only too well.

648
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:06,094
You should be thanking the gods for this.
This is more than you deserve.

649
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,390
Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.

650
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,729
-What do you mean?
-You'll marry Ser Loras.

651
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,942
-I will not.
-The boy is heir to Highgarden.

652
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,528
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

653
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,822
-No, I won't do it.
-Yes, you will.

654
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,242
You're still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.

655
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:32,579
-I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.
-You're my daughter!

656
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:37,709
You will do as I command
and you will marry Loras Tyrell

657
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,714
and put an end to the disgusting rumors
about you once and for all.

658
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,133
Father, don't make me do it again, please.

659
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,176
Not another word.

660
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:48,970
My children.

661
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,184
You've disgraced the Lannister name
for far too long.

662
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:12,619
It's always summer, under the sea

663
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,330
I know, I know

664
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:23,088
The birds have scales

665
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,925
And the fish take wing

666
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,636
I know, I know

667
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:39,896
The rain is dry, and snow falls up

668
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,066
I know, I know

669
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,657
The stones crack open

670
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,619
The water burns

671
00:56:55,453 --> 00:57:01,042
The shadows come to dance, my lord

672
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:07,090
The shadows come to play

673
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:13,513
The shadows come to dance, my love

674
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:20,311
The shadows come to stay
