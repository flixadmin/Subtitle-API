1
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:06,758
All right, Legends. Let's get
this show on the road.

2
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:09,094
Can't let this immortality buzz
go to waste.

3
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,680
For your convenience,
I started a countdown timer.

4
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:14,933
23 hours and 45 minutes to save
my brother. You're welcome.

5
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:17,019
All right. You heard the lady.

6
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:18,145
Clock is ticking.

7
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:19,605
Yeah, let's get back to the ship

8
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:21,246
and fire up the loom
before it's too late.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,984
Has anyone seen Gary because
someone at your party

10
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,944
has stolen my Shadow Stone.

11
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:28,363
So if you come
across a disembodied voice

12
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:31,325
floating around, crying out like a baby,
then that's your culprit.

13
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:34,161
Yeah, Gary went back to the ship.
His bunny has IBS.

14
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:36,538
Yeah, and serious gas issues.

15
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,375
Ooh!

16
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:45,422
Wow, that is some arctic breeze
blowing in.

17
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:47,299
[Agent Sharpe] Why are we in England?

18
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:49,843
[Constantine] Where the bloody hell
is the portal?

19
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,554
Has anyone seen Astra?

20
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:10,239
How's your tummy, my bunny-wummy?

21
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:12,074
[smooching]

22
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,910
Gideon, can you do me a favor?

23
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:17,621
Can you fabricate more veggies
for Gary Junior Il?

24
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,209
Gideon? You there?

25
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:25,044
Huh.

26
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:29,169
[Gideon] Gary, the ship's compromised.
They're shutting me down. [distorting]

27
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:36,640
If Gideon is down, then...

28
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,364
- who's flying the ship?
- [bunny squeaks]

29
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:40,870
Oh, come on.
Are you lot off your trolleys?

30
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:43,272
I mean,
why would Astra steal the <i>Waverider,</i> eh?

31
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:46,042
I know we're "friends" with her now,
but maybe she wanted to use the Loom.

32
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,526
Or what if my sisters got to her?

33
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,369
If they get control of the Loom
before we do,

34
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:51,047
we'll never get a chance
to bring my brother back.

35
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:53,115
Okay. Let's all just keep our cool.

36
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,866
Gideon, what's going on?

37
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:57,451
Gideon?

38
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:01,290
- Okay, no Gideon.
- Yeah, it's okay, it's okay.

39
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:02,373
We'll figure this out.

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,422
What just happened?
Did you have another vision?

41
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:11,758
Uh, no, it's, um... it was nothing.

42
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,678
As in, you saw nothing or what?

43
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,307
It was just a flash,
and then it was nothing.

44
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,852
I think it's the Chalice. It's probably
messing with my powers.

45
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:24,479
So what? Now you're just blind?

46
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:26,291
- Mick, that's insensitive.
- That's not helpful.

47
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:27,315
[gasps]

48
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:29,756
Wait, wait, wait. I think I just came up
with an amazing plan.

49
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:33,196
Rip set up Time Bureau safe houses
all over the world,

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,117
some of which are still standing,
like the one in London.

51
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,828
Yes? We go there, we get a Time Courier,

52
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:40,871
he'll take us
to the <i>Waverider.</i>

53
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:41,788
- Yes.
- Yes.

54
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,957
[Sara] Yeah, babe.
That is a perfect plan.

55
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,709
And you know what? We're gonna do it.

56
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:50,088
We're gonna go to London because
we are immortal superheroes.

57
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:52,549
- Except me.
- Except for Zari.

58
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:55,844
And nothing is gonna stand in our way.

59
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:02,684
We're immortal and we're superheroes,
and we have to wait for the bus.

60
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:03,726
Yeah.

61
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,646
Well, at least Constantine
got us these nice warm clothes.

62
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,566
- We're ready for anything, right?
- Yeah, like a pheasant hunt.

63
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:12,486
But in our defense,
we do look pretty good.

64
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,739
Okay, tell me this. How do you live here
and not have a car?

65
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:17,783
Never needed one, love.
Always bummed a ride.

66
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,618
So exactly how far is it to London?

67
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,289
Well, according to my phone,
it says 275.8...

68
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,875
- Miles or kilometers?
- Doesn't matter, it's far.

69
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,585
When is the bus supposed to get here?

70
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:33,507
According to the schedule, it'll be here
in either one minute or three hours.

71
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,883
Wait. Guys, is it a holiday?

72
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:35,926
[Nate] Is it a holiday?

73
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:37,637
- [vehicle approaches]
- Ah. Finally.

74
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,677
- Yes!
- There we go.

75
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:39,678
Okay.

76
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:52,943
Now, hold up. Who's paying the fare?

77
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:54,426
- Does anybody have any money?
- No.

78
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,071
Uh...

79
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:58,240
Sir, I know this sounds ridiculous,

80
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:00,867
but the fate of the world depends on us
getting on this bus.

81
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,245
I don't care who depends on who.

82
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:06,081
When I'm driving this bus,
everyone pays the fare.

83
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:08,458
Have it your way.

84
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,543
[screams]

85
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:12,503
Well, come on!

86
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:14,255
[grunts]

87
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:16,842
I really am so sorry, sir.

88
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,485
Believe it or not, we're the good guys.

89
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:25,891
Bollocks!

90
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,953
Thank you for delivering
this lovely Timeship.

91
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:48,999
And Atropos, thank you for shutting off
that aggravating talking computer.

92
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,292
She thought she was so witty.

93
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:53,962
[sighs] You don't have to thank me.
It's not like I had a choice.

94
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:57,883
- You called in your favor, after all.
- Everything comes at a price, Astra.

95
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,051
I gave you a shot
at killing John Constantine,

96
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:01,303
and you squandered that.

97
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,555
You drank from the Chalice of Dionysus.

98
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,958
You're immortal for a day
and can operate the Loom of Fate.

99
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,853
Are you asking me to work with you?
Because I'm not hearing a question.

100
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:15,150
Fine, I'll join you.
But I have some demands.

101
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,985
Demands? Really?

102
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:20,322
Yeah. Now I've experienced
life on Earth again,

103
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,781
some things have got to change.

104
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:24,201
Like prunes. Disgusting.
I want them gone.

105
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:27,329
And dogs, they should
stay puppies forever.

106
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,165
Oh, and there's just one more thing.

107
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,543
I want to bring my mother back to life.

108
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,336
Let's kill her.

109
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,424
- I'm immortal. Remember?
- For now.

110
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:43,220
Astra's friends will be
searching for us by now.

111
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,730
Do something productive
and take care of them

112
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:50,101
while I chat with Astra
about this list of demands.

113
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,439
Now, tell me about these prunes.

114
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,274
[Agent Sharpe] Um...

115
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,878
Should I tell Mick that he's driving
on the wrong side of the road or just...

116
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:01,446
No, definitely not.
It'll just confuse him more.

117
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,448
- Okay.
- Speaking of driving,

118
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:05,212
maybe you should run point
on this mission.

119
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:07,326
What?

120
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:09,746
Is this because you're blind?

121
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,790
Because you totally
killed it at beer pong.

122
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:12,999
Thank you.

123
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,752
But now that I can't see the future,
you know,

124
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,255
just thinking maybe I'm more
useful as a foot soldier.

125
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:21,383
And plus, you're exactly who
the team needs right now.

126
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:26,555
Uh, okay, fine.
But this is only temporary.

127
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:27,973
Because as far as I'm concerned,

128
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,891
we are co-captains for life.

129
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:31,892
Always.

130
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:53,498
[incanting in ancient Greek]
Rise again, oh fallen souls.

131
00:06:55,875 --> 00:07:02,841
We seek revenge.
Help conquer our foes.

132
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:09,180
Who's that?

133
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:34,873
[Nate] We're gonna get
your brother back.

134
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:39,044
We're just taking, you know,
the scenic route.

135
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,965
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

136
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,885
Oh, you must be joking.
What are you doing?

137
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,863
Oh, I'm just having a little chin wag
with an old friend.

138
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:51,222
- Come on, give it here.
- This is not your friend.

139
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,933
I thought you quit.
Why are you starting again?

140
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:55,393
Because I trusted Astra

141
00:07:55,477 --> 00:07:58,480
and then she betrayed me
by siding with Charlie's sisters.

142
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:01,900
Once they use the Loom,
we're all as good as dead anyway.

143
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,903
This doomsday act is getting super old.

144
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,113
Look around. The sky hasn't fallen.

145
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:08,448
The world is still here.

146
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,159
And for whatever reason, the cabal
of mystical seamstresses

147
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:12,202
hasn't started spinning yet.

148
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:15,247
Which means we still have time
to stop them.

149
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,540
So, just don't do that.

150
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,584
- Fine.
- It's so gross.

151
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:23,295
[tires screech]

152
00:08:24,673 --> 00:08:26,257
- [Mick grunts]
- [tires screeching]

153
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,815
- Oh, damn, Mick, you killed her.
- No, I didn't.

154
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,693
- How do you know?
- She's moving.

155
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:52,033
Uh, uh, ma'am, maybe you should
just stay down. Are you okay?

156
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,453
- [roars]
- Whoa.

157
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,080
- [all gasping]
- What is it?

158
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:58,289
[screeches]

159
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:00,041
Punch it! Punch it!

160
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:05,337
Nice one.

161
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:08,926
Oh, we've seen this before in the forest
where Atropos was chasing us.

162
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:12,011
My sister will do everything she can
to stop us.

163
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:14,973
Then we're probably gonna start seeing
a lot more of these zombies soon.

164
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,308
- Or now.
- Hmm?

165
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:25,442
[growling]

166
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,324
[growling]

167
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:34,408
Let's go!

168
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:37,412
[grunts]

169
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,450
Oh, come on, really?

170
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,415
What the hell, John?
Now you have a death wish?

171
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:23,792
Oh, come on. Don't be daft.

172
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,853
See, apparently, the good thing
about having a damned soul

173
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:27,477
is these zombies
aren't interested in me.

174
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:31,341
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

175
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,824
- Cool demo. Could you do something now?
- Yeah, okay. Watch.

176
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,223
[gurgles]

177
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:43,436
[both grunting]

178
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,988
[Agent Sharpe] All right, team.

179
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:55,949
We gotta stick to the plan.

180
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,536
Let's get this bus up and running
before more of these come back.

181
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:00,244
[sighs]

182
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,205
[chitters softly]

183
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,960
Maybe this cable
will get Gideon back online.

184
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,586
[whir]

185
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,420
Gideon?

186
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,963
Should have paid more attention
in computer science.

187
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:15,843
[yells]

188
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:24,411
- [rabbit squeaks]
- [Gideon] Wake up, sleepyhead.

189
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,562
[gasps]

190
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:35,362
Are you an angel?

191
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,115
Am I dead?

192
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:39,702
Oh, you're not dead, Gary.
And I'm Gideon.

193
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,658
- You're Gideon?
- Mmm-hmm.

194
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:43,829
But you're so...

195
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,457
You're so...

196
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,168
human. Are you real?

197
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,589
Well, I could explain,
but it wouldn't matter one bit.

198
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:56,509
Now, listen to me very carefully because
you have a rather important job to do.

199
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,136
- I do?
- Yes.

200
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:00,847
You must hide those
very important and powerful rings

201
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,265
from those evil sisters.

202
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:04,414
The fate of the world depends on it.

203
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,895
Now, come on, Gary.

204
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,147
It's time to get to work.

205
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,167
Guys, come on. We gotta keep moving

206
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,235
before my sisters send
something else our way.

207
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,989
The engine's busted after the fight,
and the fuel pump's got no power.

208
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,574
Even if we fix the pump,

209
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,785
all this leaking fluid tells me
this is a lost cause.

210
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,871
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, relax.

211
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,224
Remember when we all worked together
to defeat a time demon?

212
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,876
We can make it to London
if we just work together.

213
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,770
All right. How long is it going to take
to fix the engine?

214
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,005
- An hour.
- Maybe two.

215
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:36,066
To be honest, I don't know
anything about mechanics, so...

216
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,634
All right. We're running out of time.

217
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:39,877
You live around here.
You must know someone with a car.

218
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,075
- Yeah, I might know a bloke.
- Great.

219
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,433
Wait, Zari. Shouldn't you stay with us?
You're not immortal.

220
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,352
Look, I can't just
sit here and do nothing.

221
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,354
Hey, hey, hey.

222
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:50,915
- I got her. It's fine.
- Hey, no, no, no, no.

223
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:53,358
Where are you guys going?
We're not supposed to split up.

224
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:54,817
That's not a part of the plan!

225
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,237
Astra, dear, we have been
very patient with you,

226
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:01,157
especially considering you betrayed us
without saying a word.

227
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,992
You betrayed me first.

228
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,411
Besides, I had to take my destiny
into my own hands

229
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:07,455
and try to bring my mother back myself.

230
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,415
And I appreciate your gumption.

231
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,962
But I'm afraid you don't
fully grasp what that means.

232
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:16,005
Right now, my mother is dead.

233
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:19,342
I would like her to be alive.
Fairly simple concept.

234
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:24,138
But as you know,
life as a human is very difficult.

235
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:27,558
If you insist on having
a normal life with your mother,

236
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:29,519
you will be bound
to the rules of nature,

237
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:31,479
which are not kind to humans.

238
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:33,563
See for yourself.

239
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:39,529
- [heart rate monitor beeping]
- [wheezing, coughing]

240
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,408
[flatlining]

241
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,742
[sobs]

242
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:48,037
[gasping]

243
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:52,329
Why would you show me that?

244
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,837
Because that is what is going to happen
if you bring your mother back.

245
00:13:57,046 --> 00:14:00,133
Life as a human
is a life of pain and suffering.

246
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:02,969
Constantine promised
to bring your mother back

247
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,804
as if it would solve all your problems.

248
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,389
But what he didn't tell you...

249
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,684
is you're just postponing
the inevitable.

250
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:13,021
Why bring your mother back...

251
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:17,108
only to lose her all over again?

252
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,238
[Zari] Look, I couldn't just sit
in that bus and do nothing.

253
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,008
[Constantine] Oh, I suppose it's good
to go through the motions.

254
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:26,075
At least it gives you
the illusion of control.

255
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,761
Yeah, I'm not just
going through the motions,

256
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,996
I'm actually doing something
to save my brother.

257
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,041
Yeah, and I was actually
trying to help Astra,

258
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:34,542
and look what happened there.

259
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,920
You may see no point in trying,
but I'm not giving up.

260
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,273
Have you ever considered the possibility

261
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,924
that your brother's fate
is doomed in every timeline?

262
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:44,677
Apparently, this bloke, Rip Hunter,
used to say

263
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:47,305
that certain things are just inevitable.

264
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:50,725
Go to hell, John.

265
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:53,287
You know,
I've been there and back, love.

266
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,664
Look, I'm just trying to save you
the disappointment, is all.

267
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,857
You know what?
Let's just walk in silence. Cool? Cool.

268
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:00,692
Yeah.

269
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,988
Real smooth, Johnny. Real smooth.

270
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,998
She's so intriguing.

271
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,084
Gary, she's positively evil.

272
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:19,337
But she's so talented
with those weird knives.

273
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,964
Well, never mind her many
splendid talents, Gary.

274
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:24,926
I must ask you to focus,
pay attention now.

275
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:29,722
Okay, but how are we gonna distract her
to grab the rings so she doesn't notice?

276
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:32,057
I've got an idea.

277
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,017
Wish me luck.

278
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,061
Good luck.

279
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,264
[Agent Sharpe sighs]

280
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:13,557
What's up?

281
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,103
I really don't think I should have
let John and Zari go.

282
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,414
What if we get the bus up and running
before they get back?

283
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,583
Or even worse, more zombies?
Then what am I supposed to...

284
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:25,069
Hey. Don't sweat it
if the plan falls apart.

285
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:28,364
Sometimes, the best solutions come
when there is no plan at all.

286
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,201
Besides, Legends are
all about improvisation.

287
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:35,746
It's kind of like, uh, free-form jazz.

288
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,746
Ugh.

289
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,875
- I hate free-form jazz.
- Yeah, me too.

290
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,836
- [vehicle approaching]
- Uh, sounds like we have company.

291
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,671
Whoa, I think those are soldiers.

292
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,008
- Maybe they can help us get to London.
- What did I tell you?

293
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:51,846
- Hey, guys, hi!
- [soldier] Hands up!

294
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:55,047
- Oh, we are so glad you found us.
- Stay where you are.

295
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,711
They've got blood on their clothes.
They might be infected.

296
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,020
- What? No.
- No.

297
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,521
[chuckling]

298
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:02,365
- It's not.
- No, no, no, we're not infected.

299
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:04,441
Ava!

300
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:09,155
[Agent Sharpe growling]

301
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:10,947
Oh, my God.

302
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:14,202
[yelling]

303
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:19,373
Ow.

304
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:22,960
My God. These zombies
can withstand headshots.

305
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,713
Since when do zombies talk, you idiot?

306
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,673
Super zombies have become sentient.

307
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:30,141
Round them up and take them
back to base camp.

308
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,941
[soldier] Your hands
where I can see them.

309
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:41,686
Lachesis?

310
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,941
- Yes.
- The rings are gone.

311
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,903
I don't understand.

312
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,586
- How could this happen?
- There must be someone else on the ship.

313
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,827
You're right. Someone else is here.

314
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,462
And I know exactly who it is.

315
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,258
I got the rings.
We make an amazing team.

316
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:13,261
We should have our own spin-off.

317
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:17,223
[singing] <i>Gideon and Gary
Having adventures</i>

318
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,933
<i>Solving problems</i>

319
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,435
<i>And saving the world</i>

320
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:22,913
[chuckles] Brilliant song, Gary.

321
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,331
You must teach it to me
once you've managed

322
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:26,983
to wrestle control of the <i>Waverider</i>
from those pesky sisters.

323
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,068
- I know how we can do that.
- Mmm.

324
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:31,195
We'll blow up the ship.

325
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:34,824
Or, perhaps, we'll do something
just a smidge less suicidal.

326
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:36,784
Oh, that sounds like fun.

327
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:40,288
Let's track down a Courier, so we can
jump the rest of the Legends here.

328
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,873
Well, what are we waiting for?

329
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:47,336
Let's go to the lab and make
those Couriers ours.

330
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,756
Gary, you're making me blush. [chuckles]

331
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,049
[chuckles]

332
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,677
- [both chuckle]
- Let's go.

333
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:01,559
[Zari] This is charming.

334
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:04,621
How did you hear about this place?

335
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:08,190
Back in the day, old man Joe called
me about a demon-possessed '75 Fiat.

336
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:10,359
It was a right messy exorcism.

337
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:12,028
And a right crappy car.

338
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:13,779
Ah, now, there's a beauty.

339
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:17,217
All right, come on. We don't want to be
out here any longer than we have to be.

340
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,576
[growl]

341
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:20,536
What was that?

342
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,331
It is not a sound we want
to be waiting around for.

343
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:26,417
- [growling]
- Okay, let's go, this way, go.

344
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,421
[growling]

345
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,185
[panting]

346
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:47,438
- Okay, I'll go find the van keys.
- Yeah, all right, yeah. You do that.

347
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,241
Okay.

348
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,419
Thanks, Old Man Joe.

349
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,297
[howls]

350
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,937
Ugh. [gags]

351
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,939
What is that infernal racket?
Are you all right?

352
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:31,816
Yup. Yeah. I am fine. Just...

353
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,568
Filing this away for future therapy.

354
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:36,946
Ugh.

355
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,156
Okay.

356
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,622
We better leg it to that chip van before
you become zombie fodder.

357
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:48,958
John, there's too many
of them out there.

358
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,919
But they're not interested in you.

359
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,399
You need to take the van,
find the team and save Behrad.

360
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,174
No, no, no, no, no,
that is a terrible idea.

361
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:58,652
Why, because you didn't think of it?

362
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,676
Because I'm not leaving
you here to die, all right?

363
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:04,557
That's it.

364
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:06,268
Oh, now you're good with
leaving me to die?

365
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,560
Yes to death, no to leaving.

366
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,287
You see, there was
this spell that the ancient Egyptians...

367
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,164
I don't need the history lesson,
John, just do it.

368
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,607
Yeah, all right,
but it means stopping your heart.

369
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,545
And when I do that, we've only got a few
minutes before the rest of you stops.

370
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:19,530
It's risky and anything can go wrong.

371
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:23,534
You know what? This whole day
has gone wrong, so,

372
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,618
why stop now?

373
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,288
Why, indeed?

374
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,334
You're making a huge mistake.

375
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:34,503
What sentient zombies
are this well-dressed?

376
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:38,048
Damn it. I promised Lita
I would never get locked up again.

377
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:39,717
This stays between us.

378
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,403
Okay, I am...
I am just gonna make up a speech.

379
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:43,427
About what? I don't know.
Just made up on the spot.

380
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,473
Ava's lost it, she's lost it.

381
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:46,783
- Shh, she's thinking...
- Okay.

382
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,392
You know what, guys? Um...

383
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:51,437
We are not wasting
any more time in this tin can.

384
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,106
Let's try to get creative and think
about what resources we have.

385
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,816
- Okay.
- Look, we've got

386
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,276
a guy who turns into steel.

387
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,321
We've got a shapeshifter, right?

388
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,907
That's friggin' amazing.
We've got a kickass blind assassin.

389
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,783
And a reformed thief
turned romance novelist.

390
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,702
Who you calling reformed?

391
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:07,786
Oh. Well...

392
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,870
Whoa.

393
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:09,871
Wait a minute.

394
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,916
I've been locked up
in one of these before.

395
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:12,999
[gasp]

396
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:15,503
There's a weak door...

397
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,630
down here somewhere.

398
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,173
[Mick tapping]

399
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:20,256
Ah.

400
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,092
Steel boy, punch.

401
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,094
I'd be honored.

402
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,307
Whoa, wait, what, so we're gonna
just jump out of a moving car?

403
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:31,821
Uh, you know, we're not going to die,
but it's really going to hurt.

404
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,899
- Okay, who's first?
- You!

405
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,382
- [Nate yells]
- [metallic scraping]

406
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:41,111
- Oh, God!
- Out of here, sucker!

407
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:42,613
[yells]

408
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,365
All right, then, come on, step right up.

409
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:45,717
- You got her?
- Yeah, got her. Yeah.

410
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:46,741
Whoo!

411
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,161
I'm actually glad I can't see
what's about to happen.

412
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:50,704
Ready? And jump!

413
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:51,830
[yells]

414
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,791
Gravity's actually
not a part of the plan!

415
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:54,874
[whoops]

416
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:02,216
- Ow!
- [bones creaking]

417
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,427
- [metallic chime]
- Ah.

418
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,137
- [all groan]
- Well, Ava,

419
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:10,182
as far as inspirational speeches go,
I give that a gentleman's 7.

420
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:12,685
You know what?
I will take it because now we are...

421
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,354
80 miles from London, which is...

422
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,148
- you know, closer than we were before.
- Yeah.

423
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:21,235
- We're never going to make it.
- Hey! Never say "never."

424
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,279
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Can you help us?

425
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:24,822
[grunting] Ow!

426
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,949
Don't stop, Wilbur! Zombies!

427
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,119
Damn it!

428
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,247
You're giving off a vibe.

429
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,582
Oh, man.

430
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:37,164
- [Sara] Come on, babe, we gotta walk!
- I'm coming.

431
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:40,421
[growling]

432
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,635
All right, love. Can you give me
a bit of room here, eh?

433
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:50,180
[clears throat] Sure.

434
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:52,724
Okay.

435
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,791
If I die, I can't believe the last thing
I'm going to see is your face.

436
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:02,067
Yeah, well, better than
those zombies out there, eh?

437
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,986
Debatable.

438
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,405
Yeah. All right, love.

439
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:09,700
Close your eyes now.

440
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:11,784
Okay.

441
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:19,251
[incanting in Middle Egyptian]

442
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,797
[heart beating]

443
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,387
[heartbeat slows]

444
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:31,888
[heartbeat stops]

445
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,774
[growling]

446
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:16,974
Okay.

447
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:24,358
[incanting in Middle Egyptian]

448
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,791
Oh, no, no, no, no.

449
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,168
Don't do this to me!
Don't do this to me!

450
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:45,462
Come on, Zari, come on!

451
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,923
Come on, don't do this.

452
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,050
Come on, come back to me, love.
Come back to me.

453
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,802
- [gasps]
- [pants]

454
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:00,936
Is this what a hangover feels like?

455
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,105
[growling]

456
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,192
We need to get out of here.

457
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,163
- Got one!
- Smashing job, Gary.

458
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,581
Now, let's go get your friends,

459
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:22,708
so we can finish this adventure
once and for all.

460
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,876
Easy enough.

461
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:25,586
[gasps]

462
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,962
- Drop it.
- [gasps]

463
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,841
She means it. She'll skin you alive.

464
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:34,636
What are you doing, Astra?
Why are you working with them?

465
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,680
Now, give us the rings.
We know you have them.

466
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,684
Gideon, run, save yourself!

467
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:43,812
[chitters]

468
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,522
The moron is speaking to the rabbit.

469
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:46,732
[squeaks]

470
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,444
The rings are in your pocket.
Give them to us.

471
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,321
Gideon?

472
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,030
Help me.

473
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:55,407
[Gideon] I can't, Gary.

474
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,201
I'm just a figment of your imagination.

475
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,787
But you must believe in yourself.

476
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,580
And don't give in,
no matter what they do.

477
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:08,253
How could I give you the rings
if they were never really here?

478
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:12,632
Trickery.

479
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,802
I may have been electrocuted
by Gideon's mainframe,

480
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:16,845
but I could still do
a simple obfuscation spell.

481
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,431
Time for more persuasive tactics.

482
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:21,391
[gasps]

483
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,024
Those headlights are coming in fast.

484
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:31,151
All right, everybody. Just be cool.

485
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:33,111
Yeah? try to act as
un-zombie-like as possible.

486
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,322
- Maybe Mick should stand in the back.
- Mmm.

487
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,329
Get in, losers, we're going looming.

488
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,248
[cheering]

489
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,267
Uh, hello?

490
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,812
Ex-Director Sharpe here,
who's manning this post?

491
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:24,788
Aha!

492
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:29,042
Well, cheers to this nightmare of a day
coming to an end soon.

493
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,167
[Sara] I'll drink to that.

494
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,063
Yeah, well, we're not out
of the woods yet, love,

495
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,964
but you can sign me up
for a beer anytime.

496
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,090
[sighs]

497
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:40,721
Yup, John was right.
We are not out of the woods yet.

498
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,139
Is it dead?

499
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:44,558
Yeah, how did you know?

500
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,770
Great, that's just great.

501
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:51,273
My brother's gone forever,
and the world's going to end

502
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,126
- because someone forgot to charge it.
- [slams table]

503
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,234
Great.

504
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:09,666
Smoke break?

505
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,919
Actually, uh...

506
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,338
I quit smoking.

507
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:16,964
Again.

508
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:20,010
Mmm, don't tell me you finally
found something to live for.

509
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,093
[grunts]

510
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:22,804
There's no point.

511
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,642
The Fates are literally against us.

512
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:31,021
I mean, how else do you explain
an overnight zombie apocalypse?

513
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,815
Or the fact that we're now
at the mercy of a charger?

514
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,611
You know, I gotta say,

515
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:40,405
all this doom and gloom attitude

516
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:41,865
really don't suit you, love.

517
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:45,869
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had
a monopoly on doom and gloom.

518
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,454
No, I'm just saying,

519
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,373
you stick to what you know best, is all.

520
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:52,042
Yeah, I'm not going to take advice
from a professional exorcist

521
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,377
with a savior complex.

522
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:55,504
[laughs] Come on,
I do not have a savior complex.

523
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,339
[chuckles] Are you serious right now?

524
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:00,008
"Oh, save me from my demons,
John Constantine!"

525
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,719
Oh, what about you, then?
You talk about savior complex,

526
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,972
what with all your self-help
and advice videos.

527
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,683
Saving your minions from a life
of drudgery.

528
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,018
I give my followers
something to aspire to.

529
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:11,853
Aspire to? Really?

530
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:16,441
What's that, then? Ah, oh, yeah,
it's being a superficial git.

531
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:19,111
If you think I'm superficial,
then why are you here with me?

532
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,672
Do you know what, I don't know,
I just think I haven't

533
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:22,072
had enough punishment for one day.

534
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,075
Punishment? You should just go, then.
Right now.

535
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:26,886
You want me to leave?
Because I will leave.

536
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,070
- I will go right now and not come back.
- Good, great.

537
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,807
Leave. I wouldn't wanna
be with you right now,

538
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,183
if you were the last man on Earth.

539
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,434
Well, good,
because I wouldn't wanna be with you

540
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,858
- if you were the last woman...
- [exclaims with frustration]

541
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,307
So, where should we start?

542
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,436
Head, shoulders, knees

543
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,062
or toes?

544
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,567
[voice trembles]
How about none of those things?

545
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:01,903
You can hand me those rings
or you can give me your hands,

546
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,030
it is that simple.

547
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,824
This isn't you. You're not like them.

548
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:07,951
[screams, gasps]

549
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:10,162
You don't know a thing about me.

550
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,539
I do know that when you had to choose
between staying

551
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:14,541
in hell or putting your trust
in the Legends,

552
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:17,461
you grabbed Ava's hand and took
a leap of faith.

553
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:25,343
That was a mistake.

554
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,012
A moment of weakness

555
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:29,473
when I still believed
I wanted to see my mother.

556
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:31,807
Wait.

557
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,019
You don't want your mother
to come back anymore?

558
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,313
Not if it means
losing her all over again.

559
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,608
Lachesis opened my eyes
and showed me her death

560
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,735
and what it would be like
if I brought her back.

561
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:44,196
You actually had to see your mother die?

562
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:48,784
Are you okay? Because if I were you,
I'd be a big puddle of...

563
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,827
Of course I am not okay.

564
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,955
It was bad enough losing her
when I was a kid.

565
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:56,416
But did this Lachesis lady
show you anything else?

566
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,127
Like, what about all the good moments?

567
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,420
Before she died.

568
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:01,504
Why bother?

569
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:03,882
Those memories would be

570
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:07,052
painful reminders of what I would
one day have to lose.

571
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,429
You must have some memories of your mom

572
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:11,431
when you were little
that make you smile.

573
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:12,973
Right?

574
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:17,062
Well, maybe,
instead of torturing me, you could...

575
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,357
I don't know, share one?

576
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:25,737
[door opens]

577
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,116
You guys good?

578
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,034
Yeah, feeling a little better.

579
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:32,869
Wow. Those yams?

580
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,080
- Horrible, aren't they?
- [groans]

581
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,541
Look, guys, I know today was...

582
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,168
- was rough. I mean...
- Oh.

583
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:41,920
You got shot in the head,
for Pete's sake.

584
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,338
Do you have to bring that up?

585
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:47,300
And if I could,
I'd spend every day like this.

586
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,678
Sitting around with my pals.

587
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,095
[Agent Sharpe] Aw.

588
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:54,976
Well, you could end every day any way
you like with the Loom of Fate, mate.

589
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:58,353
You know, after we best your sister,
any one of us might be called

590
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:00,564
to use the Loom,
and you got to ask the question,

591
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,524
what kind of temptations we'd have?

592
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,485
I'm actually pretty happy just...

593
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,156
flying through time with you guys,

594
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,657
and I got my lady.

595
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,576
I'm pretty happy.

596
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,287
Mmm. Same.

597
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:18,081
I'd be a criminal again.
The simple life.

598
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:24,880
You know, if Behrad were alive
and we were together and happy, I...

599
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:29,384
I don't know, I would use my talents

600
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,969
to make the world a more...

601
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,306
inclusive, better place, I guess.

602
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,898
Well, I, for one, would throw
a multi-continent rager. [chuckles]

603
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,438
- Would you really, though, John-o?
- I would, yeah.

604
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,569
[Charlie] There's nothing
a little deeper...

605
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,530
little closer to your heart?

606
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,203
Oh, you know, uh... [clears throat]

607
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,164
Even after everything that's happened...

608
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:03,168
I'd wanna do right by Astra, you know.

609
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,422
Make sure she was happy
growing up in a big house,

610
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,382
and I could keep an eye on her.

611
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:13,428
Sure is nice to dream.

612
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:14,846
I'll drink to that.

613
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:17,015
Cheers!

614
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,810
[Constantine chuckles]

615
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,035
Okay.

616
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,705
What are you not telling me?

617
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:42,498
Nothing.

618
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:43,624
[scoffs]

619
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,750
Come on.

620
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,044
Let me guess.

621
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,214
You didn't really lose your powers.

622
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,297
Yeah?

623
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,925
You had a vision.

624
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,695
And you saw the future, and you don't
want to tell me about what happened.

625
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,720
Am I right?

626
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,181
The Courier is not going
to charge in time.

627
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:02,018
- In time for what?
- In time to escape

628
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,522
before that front door gets
busted down by what's outside.

629
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,150
Why'd you lie to me, babe?

630
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:13,822
[sighs] Because my vision ended
with me dying here.

631
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,243
In this pub.

632
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:21,204
Sorry, what?

633
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,833
Oh, my God,
I can't really think straight. I just...

634
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,376
It's okay.

635
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,878
This is why I didn't wanna tell you.

636
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:33,091
I didn't want to distract you
from getting the team to this moment.

637
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,611
Okay, so you have been saying
goodbye and just

638
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:37,429
pushing me to take over this whole time?

639
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:41,766
[sighs] Yes, but it's a temporary
goodbye, all right?

640
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,936
Because you guys,
you're going to fix this,

641
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,479
and you're going to save the day.

642
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:47,707
Did you happen
to have some sort of vision

643
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:48,791
of how we saved the day, Sara,

644
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,459
because that would
be really helpful right now.

645
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:54,195
I wish, but, no, I couldn't see anything
past my death. That was it.

646
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:56,989
Okay.

647
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,117
And what if we don't succeed?

648
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:01,578
I have faith in you, babe.

649
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:03,455
And I have faith in this team.

650
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:06,624
And after I go,
you will fix it, I know it.

651
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:10,837
Um, I don't wanna freak you guys out...

652
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,090
but we're completely surrounded
by zombies.

653
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,765
[growling]

654
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,983
Looks like they're biding their time
until our immortality runs out.

655
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:35,070
Well, damnees,
the inevitable has arrived.

656
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:38,156
Kiss your immortality goodbye.

657
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:43,370
[screeching]

658
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:50,210
[roaring]

659
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,764
[Astra] It's strange the memories
you hold on to when someone's gone.

660
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,268
My mom loved strawberries.

661
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:11,981
And one year we went
strawberry picking at this farm.

662
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,819
And we just ate them right off the vine.

663
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,321
They didn't even make it to the basket.

664
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:22,283
We just spent the whole day
stuffing ourselves.

665
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,037
Sounds like a cool lady.

666
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,580
She was.

667
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,019
Think about all the strawberries
you could pick if you came...

668
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,378
Okay, enough wheedling.

669
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:35,797
Just show me how to use this damn thing,

670
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,091
so we can get help
and I can bring her back already.

671
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:41,386
Okay, yeah. So...

672
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:44,931
Congratulations. You're just as weak
as any other human.

673
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,976
Your immortality has run out. Time's up.

674
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:51,020
[gasps]

675
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:56,608
The rings.

676
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,154
Or join your friend on the floor.

677
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,284
[all grunting]

678
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:07,368
We just have to hold out
until the Courier charges.

679
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:11,332
- [zombies growl]
- [grunting]

680
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:15,753
The door's not going to hold.

681
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:18,923
Once they're inside,
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

682
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:27,848
Sara.

683
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,101
Co-captains for life.

684
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:31,185
Always.

685
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:39,819
Come on.

686
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,452
The bloody thing's still charging.

687
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:20,360
Hey, deadheads, over here!

688
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:49,596
[Sara grunts]

689
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:00,900
Sara!

690
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:03,903
[flesh ripping]

691
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:08,324
It's charged.

692
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:10,577
Charlie, you have to go.

693
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,120
Deal with your sisters and fix this.

694
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,205
- How?
- You've outsmarted them once before,

695
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,623
you can do it again.

696
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,940
[gun clicking]

697
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,543
[gasping]

00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:01,794
[muffled yell]

699
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:03,379
Gary.

700
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,173
[muffled words]

701
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:06,591
Charlie, thank God you're here.

702
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:09,111
Your sisters took over the ship
and they somehow convinced Astra

703
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:11,280
to work with them, and then I convinced
her she was wrong,

704
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:12,930
which is how she ended up on the floor.

705
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:15,183
Where's everyone else?

706
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,146
There's no time to explain,
where are the rings?

707
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,478
Okay, yeah.

708
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:23,191
We have to be careful.
Your sisters were just...

709
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:24,567
[blade plunges]

710
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,748
What a pity.

711
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:40,541
You've come crawling back.

712
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,960
You're just in time, Clotho.

713
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:48,091
I'm done running.

714
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:52,637
Now, let's get to work.

715
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:05,066
[theme music playing]
