1
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:23,625
Long ago, in ancient China.

2
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:27,210
The Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.

3
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:31,594
They brought great joy and
prosperity to the city.

4
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,852
For they have invented 'fireworks'.

5
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:41,507
But their son, Lord Shen

6
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:44,804
saw darker power in the fireworks.

7
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,594
What that brought color and joy,

8
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:52,583
could also bring darkness and destruction.

9
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:56,654
Shen's troubled parents
consulted a Soothsayer.

10
00:00:57,805 --> 00:00:58,656
She foretold,

11
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:02,255
that if Shen continued
down this dark path,

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,503
he would be defeated by
a warrior of black and white.

13
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:12,128
The young lord set out
to change his fate.

14
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,607
But he did next,

15
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,705
only sealed it.

16
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:25,814
Shen returned to his
parents full of pride.

17
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,728
But in their faces,
he saw only horror.

18
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,238
He was banished
from the city forever.

19
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:38,046
But Shen swore revenge.

20
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:41,462
Someday, he would return,

21
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:45,525
and all of China would
bow at his feet.

22
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,212
It's almost done Lord Shen.

23
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:20,418
But we ran out of metal.

24
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,951
Search the furthest villages.

25
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:26,368
Find more metal!

26
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:29,432
China will be mine.

27
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,163
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five.

28
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,653
And they became the most
awesome kung fu team ever.

29
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,142
Enough talk, let's fight.

30
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:51,916
Listen, you can hear the
Dragon Warrior training right now.

31
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:55,067
Stop him! That's too dangerous!

32
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,354
Stay focus.

33
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,339
Thirty-seven...

34
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,522
Why is he doing that to his face?

35
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:08,228
Thirty-eight bean buns!

36
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,971
Yes, new record!
You monster!

37
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:12,498
Keep going! Hit forty!

38
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:13,742
He'll never hit forty.

39
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:16,115
You got it buddy.
I'm going for forty!

40
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,427
Do it!

41
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,679
No problem.

42
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:26,391
I'm going to make it.

43
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:31,291
He did it!
- Well done, Po!

44
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,682
Your training has paid off.

45
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:36,803
Oh, Master Shifu.

46
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,213
Got to go. See you later!

47
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:40,589
You will save those for me, right?

48
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:02,918
Inner peace.

49
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,982
Inner peace.

50
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:12,794
Oh, inner peace.

51
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,867
Master Shifu.

52
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:17,275
Master Shifu.

53
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:18,627
What have we got?
Pirates?

54
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:20,875
Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

55
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,251
Whatever it is, I'll take them down.

56
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,282
Cause I am in the mood.

57
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:27,330
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

58
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:31,379
What are you doing?

59
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:34,041
One of Master Oogway final teachings.

60
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:07,111
Awesome!

61
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:10,080
How did you do that?

62
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:11,628
Inner peace.

63
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,725
Inner peace. That's cool.

64
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:16,629
Inner peace of what?

65
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,876
It's your next phase of training.

66
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:21,431
Every master must find

67
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,222
his path to inner peace.

68
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:26,901
Some choose to meditate for 50 years.

69
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:29,006
And became just like this.

70
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:34,436
Without the slightest
taste of food or water.

71
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:37,339
Or..?

72
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:39,320
Some find it through pain and suffering.

73
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:40,754
As I did.

74
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:43,430
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior,

75
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:45,968
was the worst day of my life.

76
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:49,297
By far, nothing else came close.

77
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:52,012
It was the worst most painful,

78
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:54,337
mind destroying horrible moment,

79
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:56,664
I have ever experienced.

80
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,456
But once I realized the
problem was not you,

81
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,202
but within me,

82
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:06,689
I found inner peace.

83
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,729
And was able to harness
the flow of the universe.

84
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,536
So that's it.
I just need inner peace?

85
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:15,361
My inerts are already super peaceful.

86
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:19,049
So all I need to do is
just get this thing going.

87
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:20,872
Inner peace, you're going down.

88
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,208
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

89
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:24,880
I saw you just sort of fanciful foot work.

90
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:27,865
Po, bandits approaching
the Musicians' Village.

91
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:29,248
Danger.

92
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,317
Tell those musicians to start
playing some action music,

93
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:32,919
because it is 'On'.

94
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,848
Don't worry Master Shifu.

95
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:35,556
I'll master inner peace
as soon as I get back.

96
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,211
No snack stop this time.

97
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:37,924
Ha-ha-ha!

98
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,736
Snack stop.

99
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:41,774
Wait, are you serious?

100
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:56,341
Get all the metal you can find!

101
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,032
Grab the metal!

102
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,852
Help...Help...Help...Help!

103
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:15,050
That's everything.
Let's get out of here!

104
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:24,831
Wings of justice!

105
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:45,012
The Dragon Warrior.

106
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,220
The panda? That's impossible.

107
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:49,161
My fist hungers for justice.

108
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,411
That was... my fist.

109
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:54,007
Get them!

110
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:55,323
Come on!

111
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,657
Take that!

112
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:31,519
Po! Incoming!

113
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:33,104
Thanks, Mantis!

114
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:53,376
Tigress! Double-jump strike!

115
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,185
Feet of Fury!

116
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,211
Tigress!

117
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:10,706
Monkey!

118
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:11,730
Viper!

119
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:12,811
Mantis!

120
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:14,570
Bunny! What?

121
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:16,370
Oh, sorry.

122
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:25,529
Crane, go!

123
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:26,806
I am on it!

124
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:47,076
Is everyone okay?

125
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:49,225
Yeah! Awesome!

126
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:53,837
I got this.

127
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:06,029
Po!

128
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:13,986
Chew on that, tubby.

129
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,215
Are you okay?

130
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,280
What happened?

131
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,865
I think I saw...

132
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:30,987
I think...

133
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,339
I got to go.

134
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:36,760
Thank you.

135
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:40,310
Thank you for coming to
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

136
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,082
Some more tea? Lemon sauce?

137
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,283
If you need anything, just ask.

138
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,642
Feet of Fury!

139
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:51,826
Dragon Warrior's mop.

140
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:54,219
It must be very good.

141
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:57,293
Hey! No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

142
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:00,280
He once waited on me.
- Awesome.

143
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:01,967
Yes, I have a stain to prove it.

144
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,111
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

145
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:06,806
He doesn't work here anymore.

146
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:09,912
He's busy out there
protecting the valley.

147
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:12,279
The Dragon Warrior.

148
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:13,239
Po!

149
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:19,762
You should have told
me you were coming.

150
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:20,400
Hi, Dad.

151
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,365
I would have save you some stinky tofu.

152
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:25,794
Dad, can I talk to you?

153
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:27,144
Of course, son.

154
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:29,745
In honour of my son,

155
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:33,709
free tofu dessert for everybody,

156
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:35,859
...with purchases.

157
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:38,722
It's so good to see you, Po.

158
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:41,186
Have you lost weight?

159
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:43,450
I can almost put my wings around you.

160
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,420
Well, maybe a little.

161
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,483
Poor you. You must feel weak.

162
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:49,483
Let me get you some soup.

163
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,227
No, that's okay, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

164
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:52,755
Not hungry?

165
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:53,922
Po, are you alright?

166
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:55,795
Yes, I'm fine. I'm just...

167
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,995
Earlier today, I was fighting these bandits.

168
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,962
Nothing... too... dangerous.

169
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:04,796
And then, the strangest thing happened.

170
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:06,771
Ah... I had this crazy vision.

171
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:08,818
I think I saw my Mom...

172
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:10,562
... and me, as a baby.

173
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:12,490
Mom?

174
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:14,043
A baby?

175
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:15,211
Dad?

176
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:17,834
What do you mean?

177
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:20,752
How do I say this?

178
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,218
Where did I come from?

179
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:29,764
Well you see...son.

180
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,223
Baby geese come from a little egg.

181
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,082
Don't ask me where
the egg comes from.

182
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:38,687
Dad, that's not what I meant.

183
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,642
I know it's not.

184
00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:43,618
I think it's time I told you something,

185
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,561
I should have told you a long time ago.

186
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:49,194
Okay.

187
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:52,073
You might have been kind of...

188
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:56,945
...adopted.

189
00:12:58,859 --> 00:12:59,746
I knew it.

190
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,569
You knew?
Who told you?

191
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,242
No one.
Come on, Dad.

192
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:06,584
But if you knew,
why didn't you say anything?

193
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:08,128
Why didn't you say anything?

194
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,170
How did I get here, Dad?

195
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,673
Where did I come from?

196
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:16,606
Actually,

197
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:18,500
you came from this.

198
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:25,186
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

199
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,003
Time to make the noodles.

200
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:29,419
I went out to the back,

201
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,116
where my vegetables
had just been delivered.

202
00:13:33,236 --> 00:13:35,083
There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.

203
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:38,163
Only there were no radishes.

204
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,635
Just a very hungry baby panda.

205
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:46,595
There was no note.

206
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,187
Of course, you could have eaten it.

207
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:53,355
I waited for someone
to come looking for you.

208
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:55,355
But no one did.

209
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:20,152
I brought you inside.

210
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,068
Fed you.

211
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:27,605
Gave you a bath.

212
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:32,317
And fed you again.

213
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,292
And again.

214
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:40,917
And tried to put some pants on you.

215
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:53,540
And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.

216
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,322
To make my soup with hot radishes.

217
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:02,443
And to raise you as my own son.

218
00:15:04,618 --> 00:15:07,930
Hsiao Po. My little panda.

219
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:10,850
And from that moment on,

220
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:13,619
both my soup and my life,

221
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:16,274
have been that much sweeter.

222
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:20,235
And my little Po,
that's the end of the story.

223
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:22,970
Look at me.

224
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:24,465
No, don't look at me.

225
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:25,809
That's it?

226
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:27,611
That can't be it!

227
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,553
There’s got to be more, Dad.

228
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:33,186
There was a time you ate
all my bamboo furniture.

229
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,433
It was imported too.

230
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:37,202
One Dumpling, please.

231
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,834
Dragon warrior's size.

232
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:48,426
Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

233
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:49,953
but look how it turned out.

234
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:51,282
You got me,

235
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:52,490
you got Kung Fu,

236
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,409
and you got noodles!

237
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,465
I know but I have so many questions.

238
00:15:56,985 --> 00:15:59,017
Like how did I ever fit
into this tiny basket?

239
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:01,105
Why didn't I like pants?

240
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:05,168
And who am I?

241
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:15,364
Watch your fall.

242
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,531
Good.

243
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:52,565
Shen?

244
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:55,229
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

245
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,374
Now we got the pleasantries
out of the way,

246
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:00,765
please leave my house.

247
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:02,510
Your house?

248
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:05,821
Didn't you see the Peacock
on the front door?

249
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:10,502
There you are, Soothsayer.

250
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:12,798
It seems that your fortune telling skills

251
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:14,709
are not as good as you thought.

252
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,445
We shall see, Shen.

253
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:19,222
Oh, you shall see, old goat.

254
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,165
Where were we?

255
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:22,661
What do you want, Shen?

256
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,693
What is rightfully mine.

257
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,901
Gongmen City.

258
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:30,661
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Master's Council

259
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:33,723
and we will protect it even from you.

260
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:37,485
I'm so glad you feel that way.

261
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,245
Otherwise, I would have dragged
that thing here for nothing.

262
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,524
What is in the box, Shen?

263
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:44,837
Want to see it?

264
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:46,998
It's a gift.

265
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,013
It's your parting gift.

266
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,860
In that it will part you.

267
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:52,700
Part of you here,
part of you there,

268
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,004
and part of you
where you were there...

269
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,515
... staining the wall!

270
00:17:57,788 --> 00:17:58,972
You insolent fool!

271
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:18,187
Show off.

272
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:19,715
That is a warning.

273
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,567
You are no match for our Kung Fu.

274
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:24,063
I agree.

275
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,376
But this is.

276
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:42,977
Are you familiar with the
Master of Gongmen City?

277
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:44,662
Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

278
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,925
Son of the legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

279
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:50,646
And slayer of the ten thousand
serpents in the Valley of Woo?

280
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:52,205
He's died.

281
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,175
That... that's impossible.

282
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,071
Rhino's Horn Defense isn't
pervious to any technique.

283
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,863
It was not any technique.

284
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:00,503
Lord Shen has created a weapon.

285
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:03,024
One that breathes fire
and spits metal.

286
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,038
Unless he is stopped,

287
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,958
this could be the end of Kung Fu.

288
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:11,047
But I just caught Kung Fu.

289
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,007
And now, you must 'save' it.

290
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:15,271
Go! Destroy this weapon!

291
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,486
And bring Lord Shen to justice!

292
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:18,870
Okay, here we go!

293
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,047
Wow...wow...wow!
Wait a second.

294
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:22,974
How can I do this?

295
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:25,687
How can Kung Fu stop something
that stops Kung Fu?

296
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:27,574
Remember Dragon Warrior,

297
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,558
anything is possible,

298
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:31,391
when you have inner peace.

299
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:40,094
Inner peace... inner peace... inner peace.

300
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:41,823
Peace on.

301
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:43,749
Oh Po!

302
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:45,767
Po, I got you a travel pack.

303
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:48,103
I packed your food for weeks.

304
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:49,614
Cookies, buns, vegetables,

305
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,278
and I even packed all your action figures.

306
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:53,877
See!

307
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,268
Oh, I don't know what those are.

308
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:59,013
Never seen them before in my life.

309
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,492
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

310
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,643
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together.

311
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:06,819
Just in case you get lonely.

312
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:08,868
That's you and me making noodles.

313
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:10,828
And that's you and me eating noodles.

314
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,516
And that's me giving you a piggyback ride.

315
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:16,660
Ain't that, cute?

316
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,564
On second thought, I'll hang on to this one.

317
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:20,723
Hey, they're waiting for me.

318
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,836
Of course. You have a job to do.

319
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:25,532
Far from home.

320
00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:27,132
In a strange city,

321
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,468
fill with strange people
and strange noodles.

322
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:30,946
Facing horrible danger

323
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:33,372
from which you might never return.

324
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,829
Don't go Po!

325
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:35,854
I got to go.

326
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,267
I am the Dragon Warrior.

327
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:38,899
It's kind of my job to save Kung Fu.

328
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:40,592
And if I don't.

329
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:42,869
What am I?

330
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:44,249
You're my son.

331
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:48,898
Right?

332
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:51,594
Po, it's time.

333
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:53,802
Goodbye.

334
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:56,929
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

335
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,250
He'll be back
before you can say noodles.

336
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:06,681
Noodles.

337
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,408
Come on guys, let's go!

338
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,744
Yeah!

339
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:45,304
Mama?

340
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,937
Mom? Dad?
Is that you?

341
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:55,081
Mom? Dad?

342
00:22:57,488 --> 00:23:00,040
Oh hi.
Hey, son, you're back.

343
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:01,144
...Uh..?

344
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:03,264
Honey, what are you doing here?

345
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:04,592
But I thought...

346
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,184
We replaced you dear,
with this lovely radish.

347
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:09,880
Radish?

348
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:11,823
It's quiet, polite, and frankly,

349
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,424
it does better Kung Fu.

350
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:16,647
No... No... No!

351
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:21,319
Wait!

352
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:23,407
Ouch!...Hoo..!

353
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:39,662
Radish...Radish...Radish!

354
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:50,199
Inner peace...

355
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:58,140
Inner peace.

356
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,280
Uurrr...

357
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:05,876
Urghh...Urrghh!

358
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:16,814
Inner peace...inner peace...inner peace...!

359
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:26,777
I'm a...training.

360
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:29,460
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

361
00:24:33,425 --> 00:24:34,748
I'm ready.

362
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,964
Okay. So serious.

363
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:44,357
Ha...ha...haa...ouch!

364
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,726
I think I prefer the mast.

365
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:48,598
Apologies.

366
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:51,378
I used to punch the iron wood trees
by the palace.

367
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:53,562
Now I feel nothing.

368
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:56,565
That's severely cool.

369
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:01,181
Again!

370
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:05,551
So, this punching iron wood trees,

371
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:07,694
how long did you've to do that?

372
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:08,951
Twenty years.

373
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:10,334
Oh, twenty years?

374
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:13,591
Is there any faster way,

375
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:16,758
until you don't feel anything?

376
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:17,895
No!

377
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,023
Besides,

378
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:25,639
I don't think hard style is your thing.

379
00:25:30,391 --> 00:25:32,567
Po, why are you really out here?

380
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:35,789
I just found out that my dad

381
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,070
isn't really my dad.

382
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:41,647
Your Dad, the goose?

383
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:45,929
Must have been quite a shock.

384
00:25:46,995 --> 00:25:47,947
Ya.

385
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:49,900
And this bothers you?

386
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:51,714
Are you kidding me?

387
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,211
We are warriors, right?

388
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:54,508
Nerves of Steel!

389
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:56,084
Soul of Platinum!

390
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:57,869
Like you!

391
00:25:58,284 --> 00:25:59,796
So hardcore you don't feel anything.

392
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:06,579
I was...
- So what are you talking about?

393
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,105
Nothing...nothing.

394
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:11,505
Po's having Daddy issues.

395
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:14,171
I'm so lucky, I don't have
any problem with my Dad.

396
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:17,185
Maybe it's Mom ate his head
before I was born.

397
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,270
No, no, no!

398
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:19,997
Mantis, this isn't about you.

399
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,573
Po is the one freaking out.

400
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:24,105
I'm not freaking out.

401
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:25,650
Po!

402
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:27,124
I'm freaking in.

403
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:28,132
Po!

404
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:29,229
What?

405
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:30,404
We're here.

406
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,874
Gongmen City.

407
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:50,587
My father's throne.

408
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,210
He used to let me play
here beside him.

409
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:58,238
Promising someday this throne
would be mine.

410
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:05,338
A little to the left.

411
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:07,711
But it's so heavy, Master.

412
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:10,384
Thirty years, I've waited
for this moment.

413
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:14,104
Everything must exactly
how I envisioned it.

414
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:17,673
And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

415
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,569
Perfect.

416
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:22,533
With the weapon by my side...

417
00:27:23,103 --> 00:27:24,395
... a more bit more.

418
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:28,112
With the weapon by my side,

419
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,783
all of China will bow before me.

420
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:33,567
We move out in three days,

421
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:35,673
when the moon is full

422
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:37,602
and the tide is high.

423
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:41,088
Now you old goat.

424
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:43,033
Why don't you tell me my...

425
00:27:43,424 --> 00:27:44,321
...fortune?

426
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:47,416
The future.
I was going to say 'future'.

427
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Look into your bowl and
tell me what glory awaits.

428
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,792
If you continue on your current path,

429
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:01,442
You will find yourself,

430
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,655
at the bottom of the stairs.

431
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:07,831
I see,

432
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:10,568
I see,

433
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,696
I see... pain.

434
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:15,008
Ouch!

435
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:16,176
And anger.

436
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:17,312
How dare you?!

437
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,462
That is the finest silk in the province!

438
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,740
Followed by denial.

439
00:28:20,095 --> 00:28:21,495
This is not fortune telling.

440
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:23,590
You're just saying what's happening right...

441
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:24,731
...now?

442
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:29,058
The most important time is now.

443
00:28:30,763 --> 00:28:33,198
But if you really want to see the future.

444
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:37,314
Oh, what do you see?

445
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:44,557
A Peacock...

446
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:50,220
is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

447
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:53,460
Nothing has changed.

448
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:02,684
That's impossible and you know it.

449
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:06,139
It's not impossible.
And he knows it.

450
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:07,380
Who?

451
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:09,580
Lord Shen!
I saw a panda.

452
00:29:10,043 --> 00:29:11,212
A Panda?

453
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,516
A Kung Fu Warrior.

454
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:15,388
He fought like a demon.

455
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:16,572
Big and furry.

456
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:18,196
Soft and squishy.

457
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:20,534
Kind of plush and cuddly.

458
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:24,284
There are no more pandas.

459
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:27,439
Even with his poor eye-sight,
he can see the truth.

460
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,457
Why, is it that you cannot?

461
00:29:31,424 --> 00:29:34,994
Find this panda and
bring him to me!

462
00:29:35,386 --> 00:29:36,481
Yes Sir!

463
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:38,425
One panda lives.

464
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:40,745
That does not make you right.

465
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:41,897
You are right.

466
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:44,553
Being right, makes me right.

467
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:48,770
Then I'll kill him and make you wrong.

468
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:52,617
Will you stop that?

469
00:30:05,197 --> 00:30:06,434
That must be Shen's palace

470
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:07,976
on the other side of the city.

471
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,423
Great!
We'll march in and proclaim,

472
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,954
we're the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five.

473
00:30:13,385 --> 00:30:15,203
And we're here to bring you to justice.

474
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:19,791
What are you doing?

475
00:30:20,078 --> 00:30:21,302
This place is crawling with wolves.

476
00:30:27,464 --> 00:30:29,353
Hey, isn't that guy who
hammered you on the face?

477
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:34,303
I do not like that guy.

478
00:30:34,607 --> 00:30:35,676
We need to get to that tower

479
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:37,514
without being spotted by those wolves.

480
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:40,344
Got it. Stealth mode.

481
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,777
Ouch!

482
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:05,559
Ah, get out of my way!

483
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,495
Hmm...and where does this...ouch!

484
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:14,992
Woo!

485
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,245
Hello... I couldn't help...

486
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:19,490
Ouch!

487
00:31:20,123 --> 00:31:21,560
Okay. Anyway, where was I?

488
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:23,589
Where's Po?

489
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:25,005
How come we lose a guy that big?

490
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,370
Guys?

491
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:39,431
Hehe, Po.
- What!?

492
00:31:39,746 --> 00:31:40,377
Sorry.

493
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:41,775
So that was stealth mode, uh?

494
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,125
Let's be honest, it's not one
of my stronger modes.

495
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:45,772
...any gold, nickel or lead...?

496
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:49,561
This rice is raw!

497
00:31:49,881 --> 00:31:51,215
You stole all my metal pots.

498
00:31:52,897 --> 00:31:55,521
Either you cook my rice
or I'll cook you!

499
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,580
Po, do something.

500
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:00,811
How am I suppose to help her
cook rice without getting caught?

501
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:02,910
Wait, I have a better idea.

502
00:32:05,074 --> 00:32:06,162
Hey.
- Hey.

503
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:20,422
We are here to liberate the City
and bring Shen to justice.

504
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:21,373
You will need help.

505
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:22,985
Thank you, brave sheep.
But it is too dangerous.

506
00:32:22,986 --> 00:32:25,453
I can't let you.
- Oh, oh, not me.

507
00:32:25,488 --> 00:32:27,181
It's not safe to speak here.

508
00:32:27,216 --> 00:32:28,006
Right.

509
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,707
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

510
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:37,207
They are in Gongmen jail at
Black Dragon Alley.

511
00:32:37,242 --> 00:32:39,043
What?
They are still alive?

512
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:41,167
They must be in that
jail gathering intelligence,

513
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:43,511
hatching a plot to use their awesomeness,

514
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:44,012
to defeat the weapon.

515
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,318
Okay let's go.

516
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:46,973
Thanks, sheep.

517
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,262
Hey, stop that costume!

518
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:50,814
Get them!

519
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:52,878
Sorry.

520
00:32:53,614 --> 00:32:55,181
Take that!

521
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:57,416
Keep going!
- Faster!

522
00:32:58,338 --> 00:32:59,656
Hey stop!

523
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:10,880
Ah...ha...ha.

524
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,086
Now!

525
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,536
Got you!

526
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:31,423
Spread out!

527
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:32,756
Search everywhere!

528
00:33:32,918 --> 00:33:33,530
Right over there!

529
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:36,264
Is there a part of "everywhere"?

530
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,759
Yes, then search there.

531
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:45,449
They must be close.

532
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,779
I can feel the kung fu
chill riding up my spine.

533
00:33:47,814 --> 00:33:49,644
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

534
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:53,123
Look, Gongmen jail.

535
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:58,219
Oh, it's cute.

536
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:00,826
Cute, uh?

537
00:34:10,244 --> 00:34:11,427
Nice work, Po.

538
00:34:13,444 --> 00:34:15,781
At the first sight of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

539
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:17,339
'Kaka', 'kiki'.

540
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:19,129
You mean like crane does?
- Yes!

541
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:21,849
Excuse me, when have I
ever make that noise?

542
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:23,636
Master Ox!

543
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:25,376
Master!

544
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:28,770
The ferocious Master Croc.

545
00:34:30,817 --> 00:34:33,234
And Master Storming Ox.

546
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,555
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual Legends of Kung Fu.

547
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,874
We are going to free you from those
bondages and injustice. No problem.

548
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:40,074
There's got to be a key around here.

549
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:41,466
No, they wouldn't leave a key around here.

550
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:44,389
Oh good, you found it!

551
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,206
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

552
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:47,798
We're coming for you, Shen!

553
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:55,214
Guys, are we going or not?

554
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:56,605
Do you want to meet us there later?

555
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,877
You do want to take back your city, right?

556
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:00,445
Of course we do.

557
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,141
But if we stand up to Shen,

558
00:35:02,176 --> 00:35:03,979
he'll turn the weapon on the city.

559
00:35:04,554 --> 00:35:05,477
Listen to yourselves.

560
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:06,904
You're protecting Gongmen city

561
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,182
by not protecting Gongmen city?

562
00:35:08,217 --> 00:35:09,803
If we all fight together...,

563
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,957
then the weapon would kill everyone.

564
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:14,343
Oh, would it?

565
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:16,951
Then we use...a sneak attack.

566
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:18,563
We get inside and then...

567
00:35:18,872 --> 00:35:20,067
And then you'll be stopped.

568
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:24,924
By the unstoppable weapon.

569
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,550
Nothing is unstoppable except for me,

570
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:29,149
when I am stopping you from
telling me something is unstoppable!

571
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:43,448
Master Ox, I'm not letting
you stay in the cell!

572
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:45,000
I like to see you get me out!

573
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,005
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

574
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,284
Come on! Whatever
happened being a hero?

575
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,700
The only hero in this
town is a dead one!

576
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:05,539
Like I said, you're not
getting me out of the cell!

577
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,390
Yes!

578
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:12,237
Alright, let's go.

579
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:15,214
I get the top bund.

580
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:19,362
It's time to surrender, panda.
You...

581
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:21,253
'Kung Fu' is dead.
I...

582
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:24,059
I...

583
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:27,291
You...

584
00:36:27,072 --> 00:36:28,975
Kung Fu is...dead?

585
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,559
Fine!

586
00:36:30,551 --> 00:36:32,218
You stay in your prison affair.

587
00:36:32,253 --> 00:36:34,025
With bars made of hopelessness

588
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,182
and all you get is three
square meals of shame!

589
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:39,135
With despair for dessert.

590
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,430
We'll take on Shen

591
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,566
and prove to all those
who're hungry for justice!

592
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,736
And honour, that Kung Fu still lives!

593
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,046
Yeah...

594
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:52,706
Monkey?

595
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,419
You! You're mine!

596
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:57,370
I'll tell you what is going to be yours.

597
00:36:57,405 --> 00:37:00,669
My fist in your plush
cuddly super soft face.

598
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:02,694
Oh-oh.

599
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:04,156
Get him!

600
00:37:05,196 --> 00:37:06,971
Get me out of here!
- Yes Sir.

601
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:08,783
Stop him!

602
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:13,131
Faster.

603
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,721
Go, Po!

604
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:20,426
Loose him!

605
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:22,122
Yes Sir!

606
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:25,239
Viper!
- Hang on!

607
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:36,925
Watch out!

608
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:42,526
It's very uncool!

609
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,883
Try this!

610
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:46,662
Guys!

611
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,776
Maybe something smaller!

612
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,154
No! No!

613
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:56,581
Not in my mouth.

614
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:01,905
We better go this way!

615
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,736
Pardon me!
Okay, pardon me.

616
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:15,132
Fire! Fire!

617
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:17,088
We lost them.

618
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:28,426
Yeah! Again!

619
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:30,587
Cranes, catch.

620
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,306
Guys, guys, give me a shove!

621
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:48,467
Mantis, now.

622
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,331
Is that all you got to defeat us

623
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:06,267
like a big old fluffy cloud?

624
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,610
This cloud is about to bring the thunder!

625
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:12,971
Your turn!

626
00:39:15,098 --> 00:39:18,706
Why are there so many signs?

627
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:35,026
Come here.

628
00:39:35,061 --> 00:39:37,161
I like to squash you!

629
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:40,630
Yes! Taste the defeat!

630
00:39:41,357 --> 00:39:42,920
Let me tell you something.

631
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:46,253
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole army...

632
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,640
Guess nobody told you.

633
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:00,260
You mess with a Wolf,
you get the fangs.

634
00:40:01,288 --> 00:40:02,648
I hit you twice.

635
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:04,727
What are you going to do now?

636
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:09,949
We surrender.

637
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:17,803
You could chain my body but
you'll never chain my warrior spirit.

638
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,203
Hey, don't forget the little guy.

639
00:40:19,238 --> 00:40:20,321
Did you just call me...

640
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:21,608
Po, what are you doing?

641
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,206
Trust me, I got a plan...

642
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:26,018
No way!

643
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:28,158
Eight point acupuncture cuffs?

644
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,518
Just like the ones they held Tai Long.

645
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,147
The more you move, the tighter they get.

646
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:33,744
These are the best cuffs.

647
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:38,057
Greetings Panda.

648
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:39,482
At last we meet.

649
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:42,256
No, no, no.

650
00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:47,593
We meet at last.

651
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:49,551
Yes, that's it.

652
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:52,712
Greetings, Panda. We meet...

653
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:57,344
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I'm not afraid.

654
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:00,368
He's coming to me in chains.

655
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:03,398
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You!

656
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:09,334
Don't even think about it.

657
00:41:22,297 --> 00:41:25,322
I hope this turns out better than your
plan to cook rice in your stomach

658
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,322
by eating it raw and drinking boiling water.

659
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,731
This plan is nothing like that plan.

660
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:32,041
- How?
- Cause this one is going to work.

661
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,471
Keep moving.

662
00:41:52,196 --> 00:41:55,313
Ahh... my old enemy.

663
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:01,635
Stairs.

664
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:31,746
Thanks for carrying me,
these last few flights.

665
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:34,081
I threw up a little bit on the third floor.

666
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:35,824
Someone might want to clean that up.

667
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:38,217
Is there some sort of
evil janitor or something?

668
00:42:38,972 --> 00:42:41,553
Greetings, Panda. We meet...

669
00:42:41,588 --> 00:42:43,134
Hey, how are you doing?

670
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:45,407
Hey...

671
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,551
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

672
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,225
Hey, enough of the poking around.

673
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,265
Strong. Healthy.

674
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,025
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, Sir.

675
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,385
That's a lady.

676
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,394
Oh, sorry.

677
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:03,029
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

678
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:04,537
False avatar.

679
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:06,331
Enough of this nonsense!

680
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:08,370
Bring the prisoners to me.

681
00:43:08,405 --> 00:43:09,598
Sorry, ma'am.

682
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:10,379
Get ready guys.

683
00:43:10,414 --> 00:43:13,511
Keep your eyes peeled for the weapon!

684
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:18,512
Sparrow kick!

685
00:43:20,502 --> 00:43:22,101
We did it!
I just kung fu'ed it?

686
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:23,687
Did you guys see that?
I was all like...

687
00:43:32,584 --> 00:43:36,355
Do you actually believe this is the
warrior destined to defeat me?

688
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:39,433
I do not. I 'know' he is!

689
00:43:40,465 --> 00:43:41,811
Oh, look at him.

690
00:43:41,846 --> 00:43:45,774
A lifetime to plot his revenge
and he comes to me on his knees.

691
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:47,851
What? A lifetime?

692
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:49,352
I didn't have a lifetime.

693
00:43:49,387 --> 00:43:51,733
We only heard of Master Rhino
a few days ago.

694
00:43:51,768 --> 00:43:53,038
And we came to avenge him!

695
00:43:53,073 --> 00:43:56,031
You came to avenge nothing else?

696
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,831
Oh Yes! All the pots
and pans that you stole!

697
00:43:58,866 --> 00:43:59,941
We want those back!

698
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:01,189
Nothing else?

699
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:03,765
Probably did some evil stuffs along the way.

700
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,360
I don't know.
What else did you do?

701
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,300
You don't know?
Know what?

702
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,244
What is so funny?

703
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:12,321
So many things that you
clearly do not know!

704
00:44:12,356 --> 00:44:14,140
Okay, enough of these riddles!

705
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:16,025
Would you guys spill the beans?

706
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,568
First, we come in and the weapon is tiny.

707
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,592
Surprised it's big.

708
00:44:19,627 --> 00:44:22,168
And then the lady over here,
I think is a guy, he's...

709
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:23,354
...Oh!

710
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:26,684
The only reason you're still alive...

711
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:29,202
is that I find your stupidity

712
00:44:29,605 --> 00:44:31,746
...mildly amusing.

713
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,584
Thank you.

714
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:35,155
But I find your evilness
extremely annoying!

715
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,218
Who do you think you are, panda?

716
00:44:37,253 --> 00:44:39,490
Who do you think I am, peacock?

717
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:50,872
Why are we laughing?

718
00:44:51,785 --> 00:44:52,703
Take aim.

719
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,790
Fire!

720
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:12,902
Well, light that... thing!

721
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:14,134
I did!

722
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,740
Fear the bug!

723
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,259
Get the weapon!

724
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:34,681
Tigress!

725
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,105
You... you were there.

726
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,750
Yes... yes I was.

727
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,515
You just let Shen get away.

728
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,022
At least we destroyed the weapon.

729
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:29,857
Fire!

730
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:35,208
Now, he's got way more!

731
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:37,527
Wow..ow!

732
00:46:41,304 --> 00:46:41,986
My wings!

733
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:43,681
Help! Po!
- Coming!

734
00:46:51,229 --> 00:46:52,102
Help me up!

735
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:53,683
No! Get him down!

736
00:46:53,718 --> 00:46:54,919
Use the ropes!

737
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:06,535
Run, run little panda!

738
00:47:08,198 --> 00:47:11,566
Wow!... Ahh!

739
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:19,948
I'll help, come on.
We need you to focus.

740
00:47:19,983 --> 00:47:20,876
I got it! I got it!

741
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:22,155
Bring it down!

742
00:47:25,687 --> 00:47:27,961
We're trapped!
This way.

743
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:32,045
Ha..ha..ha..haa!

744
00:47:32,654 --> 00:47:34,015
Goodbye!

745
00:47:36,963 --> 00:47:38,211
Fire!

746
00:47:40,036 --> 00:47:41,388
Get back!

747
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:51,126
The only way out is up!

748
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,709
Follow me. Come on!

749
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:08,774
Where are they going?

750
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:11,618
To the top. Come on!
- Keep going!

751
00:48:18,476 --> 00:48:20,365
Here we go!

752
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,883
You idiot!

753
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,527
Ouch! My nose.

754
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:44,505
Call in the wolves!
All of them!

755
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,585
I want them ready to move!

756
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,770
The 'Year of the Peacock' begins now!

757
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:51,827
Right now?

758
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,973
Cause it's the middle of the year.

759
00:48:54,008 --> 00:48:55,786
So you only get like a half
of the year of the peacock.

760
00:48:56,722 --> 00:49:00,551
Get the wolves ready.
We load in the ships now.

761
00:49:01,075 --> 00:49:02,492
Now!

762
00:49:02,897 --> 00:49:04,553
Now! Now! Now! Now!

763
00:49:04,397 --> 00:49:07,045
Move! Move! Move! Move!

764
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:24,849
This way.

765
00:49:29,605 --> 00:49:31,440
Come.

766
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:37,404
Oh, you!

767
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,985
What did you do?

768
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:40,424
It's chaos up there.

769
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,983
What happen to stopping Shen?

770
00:49:42,937 --> 00:49:44,584
Yah?

771
00:49:46,395 --> 00:49:48,570
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

772
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:50,272
I meant for him to get away.

773
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:51,870
Cause...

774
00:49:52,542 --> 00:49:53,465
... it was a trick, a plot.

775
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:58,488
I was thinking of figuring
out his plot more.

776
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:01,975
That makes no sense.

777
00:50:02,281 --> 00:50:03,627
Wait a minute... it sure does.

778
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:04,883
Po, the truth!

779
00:50:05,347 --> 00:50:06,723
You had Shen. What happened?

780
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:09,417
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

781
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,678
Ya, okay. He caught me off guard.

782
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,807
The truth.

783
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:18,349
Fine.

784
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:21,465
They will keep you far from danger.

785
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:22,724
Real far.

786
00:50:23,098 --> 00:50:24,195
What?

787
00:50:24,434 --> 00:50:25,587
You're staying here.

788
00:50:26,287 --> 00:50:27,086
Wait!

789
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:29,657
I have to go back!

790
00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:36,111
You're staying here!

791
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:38,599
I'm going and you can't stop me!

792
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:44,477
Okay. I wasn't ready that time.

793
00:50:44,536 --> 00:50:45,805
Guys, don't!

794
00:50:46,284 --> 00:50:47,229
Ready.

795
00:50:48,013 --> 00:50:48,973
Look!

796
00:51:01,693 --> 00:51:03,167
Stay down.

797
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,694
I have to get to him.

798
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:07,342
Then tell me why!

799
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:12,040
He was there, okay?

800
00:51:12,525 --> 00:51:15,097
The Peacock was there,
the last time I saw my parents.

801
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:17,020
He knows what happened.

802
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:18,961
Where I came from.

803
00:51:19,236 --> 00:51:20,772
Who I am.

804
00:51:25,774 --> 00:51:27,169
Look, I'm going.

805
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,664
I have to know.

806
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,869
The hardcore can't understand.

807
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:34,666
Tigress! No!

808
00:51:38,777 --> 00:51:40,888
The hardcore do understand.

809
00:51:42,506 --> 00:51:44,791
But I can't watch
my friend be killed.

810
00:51:46,794 --> 00:51:47,522
We're going!

811
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,931
Hey, maybe you can't
watch me being killed.

812
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:52,127
Stop being a wimp.

813
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:54,425
And she's back.

814
00:51:55,753 --> 00:51:59,892
Don't worry kid.
You're better off here.

815
00:52:09,468 --> 00:52:10,986
You're wrong, Soothsayer.

816
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:13,664
We sail to victory tonight.

817
00:52:14,523 --> 00:52:17,099
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

818
00:52:17,428 --> 00:52:19,906
Are you certain the panda is the fool?

819
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:22,602
You just destroyed your
ancestors' home, Shen.

820
00:52:22,827 --> 00:52:24,395
A trivial sacrifice.

821
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,881
When all of China is my reward.

822
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,679
When will you be finally satisfied?

823
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:33,026
Will the subjugation of the whole world

824
00:52:33,426 --> 00:52:35,061
finally make you feel better?

825
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:36,572
It's a start.

826
00:52:36,813 --> 00:52:39,665
I might as well convert the
basement into a dungeon.

827
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:45,132
The cup you choose
to fill has no bottom.

828
00:52:45,722 --> 00:52:48,184
It is time to stop this madness.

829
00:52:49,411 --> 00:52:51,479
Why on earth would I do that?

830
00:52:51,863 --> 00:52:53,958
So that your parents
can rest in peace.

831
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:57,656
My parents hated me.

832
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,568
Do you understand?

833
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:03,460
They wronged me.

834
00:53:04,304 --> 00:53:07,310
And... I will make it right.

835
00:53:07,438 --> 00:53:08,328
They loved you.

836
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:13,417
They loved you so much that having
to send you away, killed them.

837
00:53:16,043 --> 00:53:18,520
The dead exist in the past.

838
00:53:19,785 --> 00:53:22,042
And I must turn to the future.

839
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,926
Set the soothsayer free.

840
00:53:29,638 --> 00:53:30,805
She's no use to me.

841
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:32,565
Goodbye, Shen.

842
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,912
I wish you happiness.

843
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:37,567
Happiness, must be taken!

844
00:53:39,988 --> 00:53:41,751
And I will take mine.

845
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,133
Hurry it up!

846
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:08,945
If all of those weapons
leave the building,

847
00:54:09,502 --> 00:54:10,597
China will fall.

848
00:54:10,885 --> 00:54:11,950
We bring down the building.

849
00:54:12,278 --> 00:54:12,919
Hey guys.

850
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:14,415
How about this?

851
00:54:16,414 --> 00:54:17,078
Oh!

852
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:18,550
This will work.

853
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:20,133
Alright, let's go.

854
00:54:20,406 --> 00:54:21,255
I can't feel my face.

855
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:39,284
Dumb hell crow... year of the Peacock.

856
00:54:40,222 --> 00:54:40,885
Hey.

857
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:42,221
Hey.

858
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:44,213
Keep it cool, keep it cool.

859
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,205
You!

860
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:46,284
Where are you going?

861
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:49,716
On your feet!

862
00:54:50,044 --> 00:54:51,773
And wipe those stupid
grins off your faces.

863
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:07,997
Move, you dogs! Faster! Faster!

864
00:55:08,732 --> 00:55:09,629
Load them all!

865
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,684
Greetings, Panda.

866
00:55:25,306 --> 00:55:26,585
Tell me what happened that night?

867
00:55:26,873 --> 00:55:27,721
What night?

868
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:29,095
That night!

869
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:31,241
Oh, that night.

870
00:55:31,505 --> 00:55:32,370
Yes!

871
00:55:35,108 --> 00:55:36,132
Yes, I was there.

872
00:55:36,886 --> 00:55:40,328
As I watched your parents abandoned you.
It was a terrible thing.

873
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:42,762
I believe it went something like this!

874
00:55:54,474 --> 00:55:55,625
Happy New Year's gift!

875
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,711
Hope you like it.
Cause you can't return it.

876
00:55:59,887 --> 00:56:00,864
Po?

877
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:02,728
What is he doing here?

878
00:56:03,088 --> 00:56:03,976
Return it! Return it!

879
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:18,544
Are you willing to die
to find out the truth?

880
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:20,055
You bet I am!

881
00:56:20,487 --> 00:56:22,119
Although I prefer not to.

882
00:56:45,399 --> 00:56:46,335
We got them! Go!

883
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:09,879
Looking for me?

884
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,423
I said that too soon, didn't I?

885
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:28,678
Po!

886
00:57:33,606 --> 00:57:34,886
Po, get away from him.

887
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:40,910
No more running, Shen!

888
00:57:41,214 --> 00:57:42,038
So it seems.

889
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:44,326
Now, answers.

890
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:46,317
Oh, you want to know so badly.

891
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:50,477
You think knowing will heal you, uh?

892
00:57:51,445 --> 00:57:54,901
Fill some craters in your soul.

893
00:57:55,797 --> 00:57:56,949
Well, here's your answer.

894
00:57:58,029 --> 00:58:00,077
Your parents didn't love you.

895
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:03,502
But here...,

896
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:06,141
let me... heal you.

897
00:58:12,493 --> 00:58:14,421
No..ooo!

898
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,525
Huh!... Ohhh!

899
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:31,587
Ya, like you can
make me drink that.

900
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:33,157
Argh...arghh...

901
00:59:35,774 --> 00:59:37,379
If I wanted you dead,

902
00:59:37,868 --> 00:59:39,939
I would have left you in that river.

903
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:41,627
Why did you save me?

904
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:44,507
So you can fulfill your destiny.

905
00:59:44,868 --> 00:59:45,803
What are you talking about?

906
00:59:46,755 --> 00:59:47,669
Where am I?

907
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:51,091
What is this place?

908
00:59:52,003 --> 00:59:54,955
I'm surprised you
remembered so little.

909
00:59:55,564 --> 00:59:58,771
But you were so little
when it happened.

910
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:06,139
Perhaps you do remember.

911
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:09,107
Remember what? It's just a stupid nightmare.

912
01:00:09,466 --> 01:00:11,787
Nightmare? Or memory?

913
01:00:42,546 --> 01:00:44,362
This was a thriving village.

914
01:00:44,922 --> 01:00:48,050
Yang Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

915
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:50,666
But he wanted more.

916
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:54,297
I foretold that someone
would stand in his way.

917
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:56,146
A panda.

918
01:00:56,905 --> 01:01:00,049
But I never could have
foretold what came next.

919
01:01:13,722 --> 01:01:15,090
Kill them all.

920
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,266
Take our son and
run away! Go!

921
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:42,273
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

922
01:03:46,103 --> 01:03:49,414
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning.

923
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:52,438
But that does not make you who you are.

924
01:03:53,894 --> 01:03:56,542
It is the rest of your story.

925
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:59,181
Who you choose to be.

926
01:04:31,357 --> 01:04:34,597
So, who are you, panda?

927
01:04:42,965 --> 01:04:44,565
I am Po.

928
01:04:46,293 --> 01:04:47,941
And I am going to need a hat.

929
01:04:57,742 --> 01:05:00,102
Such sad-sad faces.

930
01:05:01,182 --> 01:05:02,745
But now is a time only for joy.

931
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:07,672
You are going to be a part
of something beautiful.

932
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:13,662
Once you reach the harbour,
in front of all the world.

933
01:05:14,151 --> 01:05:18,103
You and your precious
Kung Fu will died.

934
01:05:20,871 --> 01:05:25,551
Then China will know
to bow before me.

935
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,191
Set sail!

936
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:02,530
Honestly guys, I never
thought I'll die like this.

937
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:05,349
I always thought I'll meet
a nice girl and settle down

938
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,722
and she'll eat my head.

939
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:09,427
So sad.

940
01:06:09,755 --> 01:06:10,868
We cannot give up hope.

941
01:06:11,227 --> 01:06:13,124
Po would want us to remain strong.

942
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,155
Hardcored! Right, Tigress?

943
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,331
Lord Shen, what about the bridge?

944
01:06:25,763 --> 01:06:27,819
Nothing stands in my way.

945
01:06:28,539 --> 01:06:29,668
Fire!

946
01:06:39,331 --> 01:06:40,628
You coward!

947
01:06:50,698 --> 01:06:51,651
Po?

948
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:55,340
Po?

949
01:06:57,531 --> 01:07:00,011
How many times
do I have to kill

950
01:07:00,499 --> 01:07:02,618
the same stinking panda?

951
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:13,018
Shen!

952
01:07:13,482 --> 01:07:16,739
A panda stands between
you and your destiny!

953
01:07:18,466 --> 01:07:19,546
What?

954
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:22,770
Prepare yourself for
a hot serving of justice.

955
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,162
And bring the terror to an end.

956
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:26,474
What?

957
01:07:26,794 --> 01:07:28,593
And now... free the Five!

958
01:07:29,097 --> 01:07:30,105
Fist of Destruction!

959
01:07:39,657 --> 01:07:43,201
Okay.

960
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:45,079
Take him!

961
01:07:56,538 --> 01:07:57,386
Ready?

962
01:08:04,536 --> 01:08:05,739
This way now...

963
01:08:12,984 --> 01:08:14,113
... that way...

964
01:08:19,297 --> 01:08:20,264
You can't follow me.

965
01:08:21,113 --> 01:08:22,192
Just get him!

966
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,800
Come on.

967
01:08:36,848 --> 01:08:37,823
No, no, don't shoot!

968
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:39,367
Don't shoot!

969
01:08:39,743 --> 01:08:40,864
Don't shoot!
Shoot!

970
01:08:41,727 --> 01:08:42,927
Shoot!
Don't shoot!

971
01:08:43,817 --> 01:08:49,512
Don't shoot! Cross fire!

972
01:08:49,866 --> 01:08:51,340
Attack!

973
01:08:56,907 --> 01:08:58,075
Catch your freedom.

974
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,167
Monkey!

975
01:09:04,636 --> 01:09:06,004
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.

976
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:06,940
What's your plan?

977
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:08,148
Step one, free the Five.

978
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:09,507
What's step two?

979
01:09:09,851 --> 01:09:11,131
Honestly, I didn't think
I'll make it this far.

980
01:09:11,419 --> 01:09:13,795
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

981
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:21,347
Guys!

982
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:24,586
Viper, puppet of death!

983
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:26,794
Tigress!

984
01:09:35,057 --> 01:09:36,370
Master Ox!

985
01:09:36,818 --> 01:09:37,536
Jump!

986
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:38,739
And Croc!

987
01:09:39,058 --> 01:09:40,089
Vengeance is served.

988
01:09:40,369 --> 01:09:42,674
Why did you...?
Your friend there is very persuasive.

989
01:09:50,842 --> 01:09:51,922
Master Shifu!

990
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:56,171
Quickly!
Use their boats to block the way.

991
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,026
Crane!

992
01:10:09,387 --> 01:10:11,011
Wings of Justice!

993
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:12,409
Kaka!

994
01:10:21,267 --> 01:10:22,234
What?

995
01:10:31,658 --> 01:10:35,618
I..love..you..guys!

996
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:46,681
Why aren't we firing?

997
01:10:47,018 --> 01:10:49,018
They're taking all gunmen, Sir!
And getting close!

998
01:10:52,313 --> 01:10:54,257
Fire then! Go fire that gun!

999
01:10:55,226 --> 01:10:57,114
But Sir!
That's our own...(people).

1000
01:10:57,529 --> 01:11:00,210
I said fire at them! Fire!

1001
01:11:03,032 --> 01:11:03,912
No!

1002
01:11:11,505 --> 01:11:12,457
Po!

1003
01:11:48,489 --> 01:11:49,713
Tigress?

1004
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,885
As you wish,

1005
01:12:41,213 --> 01:12:42,669
let's finish this.

1006
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:07,370
Fire!

1007
01:13:12,759 --> 01:13:15,271
Inner Peace. Inner Peace. Inner Peace.

1008
01:13:42,008 --> 01:13:42,816
Again!

1009
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:55,168
Kill him!
Somebody, kill him!

1010
01:14:17,743 --> 01:14:18,592
What?

1011
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:20,135
No!

1012
01:14:26,703 --> 01:14:29,816
Keep firing! Keep firing!

1013
01:14:50,438 --> 01:14:51,950
Skadoosh.

1014
01:15:21,733 --> 01:15:23,101
How did you...

1015
01:15:24,596 --> 01:15:26,268
How did you do it?

1016
01:15:30,132 --> 01:15:32,707
You just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

1017
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:35,852
Not that. How did you find peace?

1018
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:39,441
I took away your parents.
Everything.

1019
01:15:39,929 --> 01:15:41,926
I scarred you for life.

1020
01:15:43,141 --> 01:15:45,905
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

1021
01:15:46,805 --> 01:15:50,727
No, they don't.
Wounds heal.

1022
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:52,974
Oh, yes. What do scars do?
They fade I guess?

1023
01:15:53,288 --> 01:15:55,130
I don't care what scars do.

1024
01:15:55,948 --> 01:15:57,072
You should Shen.

1025
01:15:57,852 --> 01:16:01,061
You got to let go of that stuff from
the past cause it just doesn't matter.

1026
01:16:02,428 --> 01:16:03,908
The only thing that matters

1027
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,102
is what you choose to be now.

1028
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:07,917
You're right.

1029
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:09,702
Then I choose...

1030
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:11,486
... this!

1031
01:17:03,358 --> 01:17:05,356
That was pretty hardcore.

1032
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,675
Po, come here!

1033
01:17:17,484 --> 01:17:18,386
Don't ever do that again please.

1034
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:22,178
It seems you have found inner peace.

1035
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:24,642
At such a young age.

1036
01:17:26,082 --> 01:17:27,562
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

1037
01:17:48,545 --> 01:17:49,474
What do you mean he's not here?

1038
01:17:50,202 --> 01:17:51,654
It's my son's birthday.

1039
01:17:52,317 --> 01:17:54,559
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

1040
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,221
How about some Tofu
birthday cake instead, uh?

1041
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:59,959
You know, I think we'll just
try again another time.

1042
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:01,950
When do you think he'll be back?

1043
01:18:05,206 --> 01:18:07,454
I don't know, okay?
I don't know!

1044
01:18:07,998 --> 01:18:10,694
Maybe never. I'm worried, okay.

1045
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:12,766
But that's my job. I'm his Dad.

1046
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:14,958
I mean, I was his Dad.

1047
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:17,134
Why did...
- ...he go and save China?

1048
01:18:17,598 --> 01:18:19,510
I know why. But Why?

1049
01:18:20,638 --> 01:18:22,582
He's just one little panda.

1050
01:18:38,124 --> 01:18:40,143
So, how did it go?

1051
01:18:40,608 --> 01:18:41,559
Did you save China?

1052
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:44,151
Yeap.

1053
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,528
Well, I knew you would.

1054
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:48,719
That's why I had new signs made.

1055
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:50,813
My son saved China.
You too can save.

1056
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:52,783
Buy one dumpling get one free!

1057
01:18:54,076 --> 01:18:55,276
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

1058
01:18:55,702 --> 01:18:56,613
Would you like to try one?

1059
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:57,829
Maybe later.

1060
01:19:01,017 --> 01:19:02,172
There's something I should tell you.

1061
01:19:05,928 --> 01:19:07,145
While I was gone,

1062
01:19:08,224 --> 01:19:10,242
I found a village where I was born.

1063
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:14,977
I found out how I ended
up in that radish basket.

1064
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,834
You did?

1065
01:19:18,162 --> 01:19:19,458
I know who I am.

1066
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:21,826
You do?

1067
01:19:24,002 --> 01:19:25,281
I am your son.

1068
01:19:28,073 --> 01:19:30,137
Po.

1069
01:19:31,648 --> 01:19:32,674
I love you, Dad.

1070
01:19:34,529 --> 01:19:35,929
I love you too, son.

1071
01:19:40,265 --> 01:19:41,593
Delicious fat radishes.

1072
01:19:42,536 --> 01:19:43,343
You are probably hungry.

1073
01:19:43,616 --> 01:19:44,646
Let me make you something to eat.

1074
01:19:44,954 --> 01:19:45,940
What are you talking about?
I'll cook.

1075
01:19:46,288 --> 01:19:47,660
No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad.

1076
01:19:48,092 --> 01:19:49,934
This is something I can do.
You saved China.

1077
01:19:50,437 --> 01:19:52,956
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

1078
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:53,997
Po.
- Dad.

1079
01:19:54,285 --> 01:19:55,062
Po!
- Okay.

1080
01:19:55,798 --> 01:19:58,189
Let's both cook...together.

1081
01:19:58,998 --> 01:20:00,282
Together.

1082
01:20:00,531 --> 01:20:02,064
No, I'll cook.

1083
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:39,377
My son is alive!
