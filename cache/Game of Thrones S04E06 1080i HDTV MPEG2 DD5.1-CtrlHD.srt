1
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,913
Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that--

2
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,215
We've been here
since midday.

3
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,344
Easterners have a difference
sense of time, I've often found.

4
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:43,348
Once I was waiting for Salladhor
Saan here in Braavos.

5
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:46,051
Together, we were
going to run

6
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:48,570
three shiploads
of the finest--

7
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:17,983
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

8
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,269
Please, sit.

9
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,378
What can we do
for you, Lord Stannis?

10
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,380
This is Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

11
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,649
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

12
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,618
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

13
00:05:57,473 --> 00:05:59,808
<i>The Iron Throne</i>
<i>is currently occupied</i>

14
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:01,727
by Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

15
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,261
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

16
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:06,181
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

17
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,900
He shares no blood
with me.

18
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,320
He is a bastard
born of incest.

19
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,406
<i>As was his brother</i>
<i>before him.</i>

20
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,192
Yes, we have heard
this story.

21
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,861
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

22
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,248
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

23
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,667
A story about
a jealous uncle

24
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,903
whose attempts to usurp the
throne from the rightful king

25
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:32,874
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

26
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,626
Gold you loaned him.

27
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,864
And you feel your blood gives
you a claim on our gold?

28
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,516
More than any man living.

29
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,469
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

30
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,639
with words like
"usurper" and "madman"

31
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,175
and "blood right."

32
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,345
Here, our books
are filled with numbers.

33
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,564
We prefer the stories
they tell.

34
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,516
More plain.

35
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,986
Less open
to interpretation.

36
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,108
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

37
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,525
4,000.

38
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:09,527
<i>And how many ships</i>
<i>do you have?</i>

39
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:11,797
<i>The ones still afloat,</i>
<i>Ser Davos,</i>

40
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,299
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

41
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,669
32.

42
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,471
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

43
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,840
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

44
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:26,628
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

45
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,649
None.

46
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,518
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up

47
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:36,688
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

48
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,459
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>we must respectfully</i>

49
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,545
<i>decline your request.</i>

50
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:46,698
<i>But we thank you for paying</i>
<i>us the honor of your visit.</i>

51
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,875
My lord.

52
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,628
I'm not a lord,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

53
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,796
You would not be
either here.

54
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:03,748
In Braavos,

55
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,018
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

56
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,586
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

57
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,188
That would be the pirates.

58
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,608
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

59
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,145
This is the payment
that was demanded

60
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,480
by King Stannis
for my crimes.

61
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,932
I consider it
an honest accounting.

62
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,434
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

63
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:25,904
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

64
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,707
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

65
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,075
The war is over.

66
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,577
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

67
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:34,579
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

68
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:36,748
- Ser Davos...
- Humor me.

69
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,385
- <i>Tywin Lannister.</i>
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

70
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,822
- 67. - 67. And when he
dies, who's in command?

71
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,957
A half-grown boy,

72
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:48,260
<i>the product of incest?</i>

73
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,096
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

74
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,798
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

75
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,934
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

76
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,637
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

77
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,307
That is a problem
for another time.

78
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:04,576
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

79
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,747
There's only one reliable
leader left in Westeros.

80
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,582
Stannis.

81
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,483
He's got the birthright.

82
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:14,619
He's in his prime.

83
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,371
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

84
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,656
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

85
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,008
he does it.

86
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,132
<i>The lookout sees a pirate
ship sailing their way.</i>

87
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,167
<i>The captain shouts</i>
<i>to his first mate,</i>

88
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,019
"Bring me
my red shirt."

89
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:34,022
The first mate brings the red
shirt and the captain puts it on.

90
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,974
And when the pirates
try to board,

91
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,360
the brave captain leads
his men to victory.

92
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:41,780
A few days later,
the lookout screams,

93
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,615
"Two pirate ships!"

94
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,452
The crew is shivering
like scared mice.

95
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,454
But the courageous
captain hollers,

96
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,289
"Bring me
my red shirt!"

97
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,541
<i>After the battle,</i>
<i>the first mate asks,</i>

98
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:57,412
"Captain, why do you call for
your red shirt before battle?"

99
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,030
The captain replies,

100
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:02,834
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

101
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:05,086
The next morning
the lookout screams,

102
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,589
"10 pirate ships!

103
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,425
We are surrounded!"

104
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,227
<i>The crew goes silent.</i>

105
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:14,763
<i>They all look</i>
<i>to their brave captain,</i>

106
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,898
<i>waiting for his</i>
<i>usual command.</i>

107
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:18,933
<i>Calm as ever,</i>
<i>the captain bellows...</i>

108
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,386
"Bring me my brown pants!"

109
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,659
You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

110
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,112
Davos.

111
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,531
I heard you were rotting in
a dungeon in Dragonstone.

112
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:35,900
Only half rotted.

113
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:40,588
Join us, my friend.
Join us.

114
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:43,541
This is Lhara.

115
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:45,143
- And this is--
- I am Lhara.

116
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,849
She's an artist,
this one, truly.

117
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,252
No time, I'm afraid.
We sail at sunrise.

118
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,687
We?

119
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,922
You, me-- we.

120
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,228
Once I thought
this man loved me.

121
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:07,399
<i>Now I know</i>
<i>he despises me.</i>

122
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:11,786
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold--

123
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,415
You won't be alone.

124
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,966
And you won't be poor.

125
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,343
There's a chest of the good
stuff left back at your house.

126
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,262
I gave it to your wife.

127
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,967
You're not my friend,
my friend.

128
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,571
I'll see you at sunrise.

129
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,826
"I give you until
the full moon

130
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:55,447
to order all ironborn
scum out of the North

131
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:59,167
<i>and back to those shit-stained
rocks you call home.</i>

132
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,202
On the first night
of the full moon,

133
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,005
I will hunt down every
islander still on our lands

134
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,957
and flay them living,

135
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,659
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

136
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:10,261
I found
at Winterfell.

137
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:14,132
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

138
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:17,668
<i>Theon's favorite toy.</i>

139
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:20,472
<i>He cried when I took</i>
<i>it away from him.</i>

140
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:24,642
<i>Leave the North now</i>
<i>or more boxes will follow</i>

141
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:26,844
<i>with more Theon.</i>

142
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,863
<i>Signed Ramsay Snow,</i>

143
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:32,317
<i>natural born son</i>
<i>of Roose Bolton,</i>

144
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,319
<i>Lord of the Dreadfort</i>

145
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,288
<i>and Warden of the North."</i>

146
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,290
Yes!

147
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,459
<i>They skinned our countrymen</i>

148
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,245
<i>and they mutilated</i>
<i>my brother,</i>

149
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,631
<i>your prince.</i>

150
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,716
<i>Your prince.</i>

151
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:51,503
<i>Everything</i>
<i>they've done to him,</i>

152
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,588
<i>they've also</i>
<i>done to you.</i>

153
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,056
Yes! Yes!

154
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,010
<i>As long as they can hurt</i>
<i>our prince with impunity,</i>

155
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:03,014
<i>the word ironborn</i>
<i>means nothing.</i>

156
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,906
Go left.

157
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,051
- Theon Greyjoy.
- I don't know--

158
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:41,436
I'm here
for Theon Greyjoy.

159
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,804
Take me to the dungeons.

160
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,056
He's not in the dungeons.

161
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,616
- Last cage on the right.
- Thank you.

162
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:16,087
<i>- This way!</i>

163
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,486
We're going home.

164
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,240
No!

165
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,412
It's all right.
It's me, Yara.

166
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,581
You can't trick me.

167
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,783
Tell him. Tell him you
couldn't trick me.

168
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,619
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

169
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,003
Not Theon! Reek!

170
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,788
- Reek! My name is Reek!
<i>- They're here.</i>

171
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:52,290
If they catch us
in here, we're trapped.

172
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,991
Help me with him.

173
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:55,877
No, you can't!

174
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,679
- You can't!
- You're Theon Greyjoy.

175
00:14:57,714 --> 00:15:01,849
No, I don't believe her!
I know who I am!

176
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:05,136
I'm Reek! Reek!
Loyal Reek!

177
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:07,972
Good Reek!
I've always been Reek!

178
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:21,319
This is turning into
a lovely evening.

179
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,220
<i>I'm Reek!</i>

180
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,172
Loyal Reek!

181
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,598
Aah!
Theon!

182
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:07,081
Give me my brother and no
more of your men will die.

183
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:10,118
You've got bigger balls
than he ever did.

184
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,873
But with those big balls
of yours...

185
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,047
how fast can you run?

186
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,527
Make for the ship, now.

187
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,262
But your brother.

188
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,231
My brother is dead.

189
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:50,708
I have a treat for you.

190
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,443
A reward.

191
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,996
Reward?

192
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:57,298
Yes, Reek.

193
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:00,251
Those creatures
who came in the night,

194
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,920
they wanted
to take you away.

195
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:04,889
And you didn't let them.

196
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,325
You remained loyal.

197
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,262
I-- I didn't want
them to take me.

198
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,015
I was so scared.

199
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,350
- I didn't want them--
- Yes, yes, Reek.

200
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,578
It's a bath.

201
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,947
For you.

202
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,670
Remove those rags.

203
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:38,706
Now.

204
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:57,341
The britches, too, Reek.

205
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,976
Take them off.

206
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,899
Do you love me, Reek?

207
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,407
Yes, of course, my lord.

208
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,660
Good.

209
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,046
Because I need you
to do something for me.

210
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,131
Something very important.

211
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,451
There's a castle, you see.

212
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,555
Some bad men
hold this castle.

213
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,759
I need your help
to take this castle back.

214
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:00,064
But how can--

215
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,602
I need you to play a role.

216
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,689
To pretend to be someone
you're not.

217
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,445
Pretend to be who?

218
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,281
Theon Greyjoy.

219
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,172
He is a goatherd.

220
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:08,743
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

221
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:11,379
I thank him
for his prayers.

222
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,879
It was your dragons,
he says.

223
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,466
<i>They came this morning</i>
<i>for his flock.</i>

224
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,589
He hopes he has not
offended Your Grace,

225
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,257
but now he has nothing.

226
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,477
Tell this man I am sorry
for his hardship.

227
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:47,331
- <i> I cannot bring back</i>
<i>his goats,</i>

228
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:52,186
but I will see he is paid
their value three times over.

229
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,788
Send the next one in.

230
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,457
Queen Daenerys.

231
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,542
Tales of your beauty
were not exaggerated.

232
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,628
I thank you.

233
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,664
Mine is one of the oldest and
proudest families in Meereen.

234
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,333
Then it is my honor
to receive you.

235
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,303
My father, one of
Meereen's most respected

236
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,306
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

237
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,642
and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

238
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,193
This pyramid included.

239
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:08,395
For that,
he has my gratitude.

240
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,097
I should be honored
to meet him.

241
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:11,582
You have, Your Grace.

242
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,417
You crucified him.

243
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,721
I pray you'll
never live to see

244
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:19,723
a member of your family
treated so cruelly.

245
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:23,260
Your father crucified
innocent children.

246
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,747
My father spoke out against
crucifying those children.

247
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:29,984
He decried it as a criminal
act, but was overruled.

248
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:33,354
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

249
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:35,840
I am sorry you no longer
have a father,

250
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,243
but my treatment
of the masters was no crime.

251
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:42,029
You'd be wise
to remember that.

252
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:45,015
What's done is done.

253
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,185
You are the queen and I
am a servant of Meereen.

254
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,889
A servant who does not wish to
see its traditions eradicated.

255
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,725
And what traditions
do you speak of?

256
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,727
<i>The tradition</i>
<i>of funeral rite.</i>

257
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:59,096
Proper burial in
the Temple of the Graces.

258
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:03,651
My father and 162
noble Meereenese

259
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,036
are still nailed
to those posts,

260
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,240
carrion for vultures,
rotting in the sun.

261
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,302
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

262
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:23,554
so that they might receive
proper burials.

263
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:27,758
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

264
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,261
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

265
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:33,964
<i>Would you have begged me for
their right to a proper burial?</i>

266
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:36,684
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

267
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,654
I can only speak to you as a
son who loved his father.

268
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:42,940
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

269
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,826
<i>Let me have him brought</i>
<i>to the temple</i>

270
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,361
and buried with dignity

271
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,780
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

272
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:56,670
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

273
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:03,677
Thank you, my queen.

274
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:16,657
How many more?

275
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:19,977
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

276
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,813
212?

277
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,790
Send the next one in.

278
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:37,411
These meetings aren't always going
to be this early, are they?

279
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,547
I was up late last night.

280
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:44,585
So, does this mean I am a
master of something now?

281
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,503
Coins, ships?

282
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:48,756
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

283
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,009
that I shall be the Master
of Ships long before you--

284
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,049
Lord Tywin,
it's a great honor

285
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,518
to have been granted a
seat on this council. I--

286
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:03,553
<i>The trial begins</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

287
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,739
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

288
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,241
Shall we begin?

289
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:09,276
Sandor Clegane
has been spotted

290
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,112
in the Riverlands,
my lord.

291
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,497
A coward and a traitor.

292
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:17,785
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

293
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,537
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

294
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:22,339
Disgraceful.

295
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,208
<i>What would it take to make</i>
<i>the common soldier</i>

296
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,510
stupid enough to try
his luck with the Hound?

297
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,113
10 silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

298
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,965
Make it 100.
What else?

299
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,551
More whispers
from the east, my lord.

300
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:36,136
The Targaryen girl?

301
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,972
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

302
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,626
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

303
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,228
Conquered with what?

304
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,196
<i>She commands an army</i>
<i>of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

305
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,232
Some 8,000 strong.

306
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,567
She has a company
of sellswords--

307
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:51,952
the Second Sons.

308
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:54,405
<i>She has two knights</i>
<i>advising her--</i>

309
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,708
Jorah Mormont
and Barristan Selmy.

310
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,776
And she has
three dragons.

311
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:01,211
Baby dragons.

312
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,380
Larger every year,
Your Grace.

313
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,884
Mormont is spying
on her for us.

314
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,887
No longer. He appears
to be fully devoted to her.

315
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,923
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

316
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,592
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

317
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:17,428
a bit harder
than anticipated.

318
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,346
He's an old man.

319
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,298
He wasn't fit
to protect my son.

320
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,350
Joffrey didn't die
on his watch.

321
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,687
Dismissing him was as
insulting as it was stupid.

322
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,840
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

323
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,444
A child with two seasoned
warriors counseling her

324
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,697
and a powerful army
at her back, Your Grace.

325
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,782
Lord Varys is right.

326
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:41,318
I have been to Essos and seen
the Unsullied firsthand.

327
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:44,855
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

328
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,623
Less so in the bedroom.

329
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:49,460
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

330
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,012
Armies win them
all the time.

331
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:54,298
She must be dealt with.

332
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,350
How, my lord?

333
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:57,718
By force?

334
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,787
Eventually,
if it comes to that.

335
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,892
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

336
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,944
Most certainly,
my Lord Hand.

337
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,897
Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
be a good man.

338
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,648
<i>Fetch my quill and paper.</i>

339
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,721
Prince Oberyn.

340
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:37,174
Lord Varys...

341
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,410
Only Varys.
I'm not actually a nobleman.

342
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,980
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

343
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,848
And yet everyone does.

344
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,820
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

345
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,772
Did you spend much time
in Essos?

346
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,491
Five years.

347
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,109
May I ask why?

348
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,996
'Tis a big
and beautiful world.

349
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,698
Most of us live and die

350
00:30:01,732 --> 00:30:03,417
in the same corner
where we were born

351
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:06,370
and never get to see
any of it.

352
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,006
I don't want to be
most of us.

353
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,041
Most of us
aren't princes.

354
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,879
You are from Essos.

355
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,765
Where? Lys?

356
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,802
<i>I have an ear</i>
<i>for accents.</i>

357
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,520
I've lost
my accent entirely.

358
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,055
I have an ear
for that as well.

359
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:29,109
<i>How did you get here?</i>

360
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:30,727
It's a long story.

361
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:33,763
One you don't like
telling people.

362
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:36,400
People I trust.

363
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:39,486
My paramour Ellaria, she would
find you very interesting.

364
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,822
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

365
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,908
We brought our own wine, not
the swill they serve here.

366
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:48,078
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

367
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,383
You did like boys before?

368
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,337
Really?

369
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,256
Girls? Hmm.

370
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,958
I hope you won't be offended when
I say I never would have guessed.

371
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,427
Not at all.

372
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,296
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

373
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:08,732
- What then?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

374
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,568
Everybody is interested
in something.

375
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,353
<i>Not me.</i>

376
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,606
When I see what
desire does to people,

377
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,574
what it's done
to this country,

378
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,444
I am very glad
to have no part in it.

379
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,915
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>the absence of desire</i>

380
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:28,035
leaves one free to pursue
other things.

381
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,753
Such as?

382
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:07,958
Let me guess,
I've been pardoned.

383
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,009
Really?

384
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,045
Father's orders.

385
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:32,849
Well, we mustn't
disappoint Father.

386
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,195
<i>Kingslayer!</i>

387
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,327
I, Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

388
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,112
<i>First of my Name,</i>

389
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,448
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

390
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:41,084
and Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms,

391
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:44,838
do hereby recuse myself
from this trial.

392
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,008
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King,

393
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,945
Protector of the Realm,
will sit as judge in my stead.

394
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,899
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

395
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,219
<i>and Lord Mace</i>
<i>of the House Tyrell.</i>

396
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:01,605
And if found guilty...

397
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,525
may the gods
punish the accused.

398
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,530
Tyrion of
the House Lannister,

399
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:47,651
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

400
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,321
Did you kill King Joffrey?

401
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,957
No.

402
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,326
Did your wife,
the Lady Sansa?

403
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,795
Not that I know of.

404
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,132
How would you say
he died, then?

405
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,334
Choked on his pigeon pie.

406
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,804
So you would
blame the bakers?

407
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,223
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.

408
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:16,179
The crown may call
its first witness.

409
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:18,348
Once we'd got
King Joffrey safely away

410
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,350
from the mob,
the Imp rounded on him.

411
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,719
He slapped the king
across the face

412
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:25,221
and called him a vicious
idiot and a fool.

413
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:28,992
<i>It wasn't the first time</i>
<i>the Imp threatened Joffrey.</i>

414
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,911
Right here
in this throne room,

415
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:33,830
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

416
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,166
<i>Compared His Grace</i>
<i>to the Mad King</i>

417
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,034
<i>and suggested he'd meet</i>
<i>the same fate.</i>

418
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:39,870
And when I spoke
in the king's defense,

419
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,205
he threatened
to have me killed.

420
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:44,257
Oh, why don't you tell
them what Joffrey was doing?

421
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:47,093
<i>Silence.</i> - Pointing a loaded
crossbow at Sansa Stark

422
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,762
while you tore at her
clothes and beat her.

423
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:51,515
Silence!

424
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,435
You will not speak
unless called upon.

425
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:58,972
You're dismissed,
Ser Meryn.

426
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,097
Basilisk venom,

427
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:10,617
widow's blood,

428
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,903
wolfsbane,

429
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,121
essence of nightshade,

430
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:18,041
sweetsleep,

431
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,160
tears of Lys,

432
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,445
demon's dance...

433
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:26,166
blind eye--

434
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,418
I think you have made your
point, Grand Maester.

435
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,286
You have a lot of poison
in your store.

436
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:32,305
<i>Had,</i> Prince Oberyn.

437
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,258
My stores were plundered.

438
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,593
By whom?

439
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,479
<i>- By the accused,</i>
<i>- Tyrion Lannister,</i>

440
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,932
after he had me
wrongfully imprisoned.

441
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,434
<i>Grand Maester,</i>

442
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:47,487
you examined
King Joffrey's corpse.

443
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:51,825
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

444
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:54,411
Without question.

445
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,283
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard,

446
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:01,902
the king's fool.

447
00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:05,989
He was last seen
spiriting Sansa Stark,

448
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:09,759
the wife of the accused,
away from the feast.

449
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,213
She wore this necklace

450
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,465
<i>the day of the wedding.</i>

451
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,768
<i>Residue of a most rare</i>

452
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:22,772
and terrible poison
was found inside.

453
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,776
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

454
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,863
It was.
The Strangler.

455
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:33,733
A poison few in
the Seven Kingdoms possess.

456
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:38,371
And used to strike down
the most noble child

457
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:41,207
the gods ever put
on this good earth.

458
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,418
<i>"I will hurt you for this.</i>

459
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,220
<i>A day will come when you</i>
<i>think you are safe and happy</i>

460
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:56,673
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

461
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,842
and you will know
the debt is paid."

462
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,479
Your own brother
said this to you?

463
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,650
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

464
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:10,904
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

465
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,175
As it turned out,
when the attack came,

466
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,527
Joff insisted on remaining
at the battlements.

467
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,448
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

468
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,567
Tyrion said,

469
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:27,253
"And you will know
the debt is paid."

470
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,556
What debt?

471
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,542
I discovered
he'd been keeping whores

472
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,377
in the Tower of the Hand.

473
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:36,913
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts

474
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:39,549
<i>to the brothel</i>
<i>where such behavior belongs.</i>

475
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,518
He wasn't pleased.

476
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:46,272
Thank you, Your Grace,

477
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:48,608
for the courage
of your testimony.

478
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:06,659
<i>Do you remember the precise
nature of this threat?</i>

479
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,278
<i>I'm afraid I do, my lord.</i>

480
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:13,249
<i>He said, "Perhaps you should
speak more softly to me, then.</i>

481
00:39:13,283 --> 00:39:15,168
Monsters are dangerous

482
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,637
and just now kings
are dying like flies."

483
00:39:17,671 --> 00:39:20,974
And he said this to you at a
meeting of the small council?

484
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:22,258
Yes.

485
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:25,395
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

486
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,680
He didn't seem gladdened
by the news.

487
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,183
Perhaps his marriage
to Sansa Stark

488
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,652
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

489
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,109
You're excused,
Lord Varys.

490
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:44,197
Father, may I ask
the witness one question?

491
00:39:50,037 --> 00:39:51,955
One.

492
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,093
You once said

493
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,847
that without me, this city would
have faced certain defeat.

494
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:04,467
You said the histories
would never mention me,

495
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:07,137
but you would not forget.

496
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:11,107
Have you forgotten,
Lord Varys?

497
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:15,728
Sadly, my lord,

498
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,481
I never forget a thing.

499
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,627
We will adjourn for now.

500
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,581
Toll the bells
in an hour's time.

501
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,800
<i>Clear the court!</i>

502
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,239
<i>You'd condemn</i>
<i>your own son to death?</i>

503
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:01,441
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

504
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,992
This isn't a trial.
It's a farce.

505
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,328
Cersei has manipulated
everything and you know it.

506
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:06,779
I know nothing
of the sort.

507
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,332
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

508
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,201
As did I.

509
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,786
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

510
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:16,689
<i>To bring him your head.</i>

511
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:19,209
I saved your life so you
could murder my brother?

512
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,011
- It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
- Justice?

513
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:25,215
I'm performing my sworn
duty as Hand of the King.

514
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,301
If Tyrion is found guilty, he
will be punished accordingly.

515
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,920
- He'll be executed. - No,
he'll be punished accordingly.

516
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,526
Once you said family
is what lives on.

517
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,561
All that lives on.

518
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:42,065
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

519
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:44,984
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

520
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,904
I'm a Kingsguard,

521
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,822
forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

522
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,574
I'm well aware
of your oath.

523
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:53,710
What happens to your name?

524
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:57,113
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

525
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:59,082
Your nephews?

526
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:00,717
Lancel Lannister?

527
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,969
Others whose names
I don't even remember?

528
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:04,671
What happens to my dynasty

529
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,940
if I spare the life
of my grandson's killer?

530
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:09,559
It survives through me.

531
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,930
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

532
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,766
I'll take my place
as your son and heir

533
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,652
if you let Tyrion live.

534
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:21,154
Done.

535
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,276
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

536
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,027
Tyrion will be given
the chance to speak.

537
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:32,081
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow
him to join the Night's Watch.

538
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:36,652
<i>In three days' time, he'll
depart for Castle Black</i>

539
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,338
<i>and live out his days</i>
<i>at the Wall.</i>

540
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:40,957
<i>You'll remove your</i>
<i>white cloak immediately.</i>

541
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,992
<i>You will leave</i>
<i>King's Landing</i>

542
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,211
<i>to assume your rightful</i>
<i>place at Casterly Rock.</i>

543
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,680
You will marry
a suitable woman

544
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:50,767
and father children
named Lannister.

545
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:54,687
And you'll never turn your
back on your family again.

546
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,311
You have my word.

547
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,146
And you have mine.

548
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:29,389
Not going well,
is it?

549
00:43:29,423 --> 00:43:31,891
- You're going to be found guilty.
- Oh, you think so?

550
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:34,710
When you are, you need to
enter a formal plea for mercy

551
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:36,980
and ask to be sent
to the Wall.

552
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,982
Father's agreed to it.

553
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,734
He'll spare your life and allow
you to join the Night's Watch.

554
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:44,404
Ned Stark was promised
the same thing

555
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:46,406
<i>and we both know</i>
<i>how that turned out.</i>

556
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,358
<i>- Father is not Joffrey.</i>
<i>- He'll keep his word.</i>

557
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,193
How do you know?

558
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,915
Do you trust me?

559
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,454
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.

560
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,539
This will all be over soon.

561
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:22,392
The crown may call
its next witness.

562
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:58,928
State your name.

563
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,930
Shae.

564
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,149
Do you swear
by all the gods

565
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:05,735
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

566
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,604
I swear it.

567
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:10,440
Do you know this man?

568
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:21,350
Yes.
Tyrion Lannister.

569
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,202
How do you know him?

570
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,506
I was handmaiden
to his wife Lady Sansa.

571
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,626
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

572
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,845
What do you know of this?

573
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,766
I know that he's guilty.

574
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,186
He and Sansa
planned it together.

575
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,006
<i>Silence!</i>

576
00:45:44,024 --> 00:45:46,526
<i>Continue.</i>

577
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,479
<i>She wanted revenge</i>
<i>for her father,</i>

578
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,013
<i>her mother, her brother.</i>

579
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:53,816
<i>She blamed their deaths</i>
<i>on the king.</i>

580
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,235
<i>Tyrion was happy to help.</i>

581
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:59,906
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.

582
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,975
He hated you, my lord.

583
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,195
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

584
00:46:06,213 --> 00:46:08,064
to put in Joffrey's wine.

585
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,633
<i>How could you possibly</i>
<i>know all this?</i>

586
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:14,470
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

587
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:18,524
I wasn't just her maid.

588
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,012
I was his whore.

589
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:26,015
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

590
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,716
You said you were his...

591
00:46:27,734 --> 00:46:29,569
His whore.

592
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:34,907
How did you come
to be in his service?

593
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:36,242
He stole me.

594
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:37,777
I was with another man,

595
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,362
a knight in
your lordship's army.

596
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,914
But when Tyrion arrived
at the camp,

597
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,167
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

598
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:48,704
<i>He broke the knight's arm</i>
<i>and brought me to Lord Tyrion.</i>

599
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:51,240
"You belong to me now,"
he said.

600
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:55,211
"I want you to fuck me like it's
my last night in this world."

601
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:00,683
Silence.
Silence!

602
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:03,603
And did you?

603
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:06,138
Did I what?

604
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,858
Fuck him like it was
his last night in this world.

605
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,362
I did everything
he wanted.

606
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,565
Whatever he told me
to do to him.

607
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,533
Whatever he felt
like doing to me.

608
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,768
<i>I kissed him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

609
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:21,320
<i>I licked him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

610
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,440
<i>I let him put himself</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

611
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,375
I was his property.

612
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,628
I would wait in his chambers
for hours

613
00:47:28,662 --> 00:47:30,496
so he could use me
when he was bored.

614
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:34,467
He ordered me to call
him "my lion," so I did.

615
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:38,170
I took his face
in my hands and said,

616
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,257
"I am yours
and you are mine."

617
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:46,512
Shae.

618
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,767
Please don't.

619
00:47:53,987 --> 00:47:56,322
I am a whore.

620
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:58,941
<i>Remember?</i>

621
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,945
That was before
he married Sansa.

622
00:48:02,979 --> 00:48:05,615
After that,
all he wanted was her.

623
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,200
But she wouldn't let him
into her bed.

624
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,455
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

625
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,666
Father,

626
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:26,302
I wish to confess.

627
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:30,839
I wish...
to confess.

628
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,478
You wish to confess?

629
00:48:37,364 --> 00:48:38,981
I saved you.

630
00:48:40,734 --> 00:48:43,035
I saved this city

631
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:46,572
and all your
worthless lives.

632
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:50,126
I should have let
Stannis kill you all.

633
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,795
Tyrion.

634
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,167
Do you wish to confess?

635
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:04,307
Yes, Father.

636
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,842
I'm guilty.

637
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,845
Guilty. Is that what
you want to hear?

638
00:49:09,879 --> 00:49:11,981
You admit you poisoned
the king?

639
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:14,567
No, of that
I'm innocent.

640
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:18,604
I'm guilty of a far
more monstrous crime.

641
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:22,108
I am guilty
of being a dwarf.

642
00:49:23,276 --> 00:49:25,728
You are not on trial
for being a dwarf.

643
00:49:25,746 --> 00:49:27,964
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

644
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:32,201
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

645
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,121
Have you nothing to say
in your defense?

646
00:49:35,155 --> 00:49:36,555
<i>Nothing but this--</i>

647
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,542
I did not do it.

648
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,511
I did not kill Joffrey,

649
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,847
but I wish that I had.

650
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,717
<i>Watching your vicious</i>
<i>bastard die</i>

651
00:49:47,768 --> 00:49:51,854
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

652
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:59,228
I wish I was the monster
you think I am.

653
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:04,200
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

654
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:06,402
I would gladly
give my life

655
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,738
to watch you all
swallow it.

656
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,790
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.

657
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,459
Escort the prisoner
back to his cell.

658
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:19,382
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

659
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,635
<i>And I know I'll get</i>
<i>no justice here.</i>

660
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:25,921
So I will let
the gods decide my fate.

661
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,810
I demand a trial
by combat.
