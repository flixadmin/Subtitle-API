513
00:38:06,803 --> 00:38:08,805
I couldn't take off.

514
00:38:10,348 --> 00:38:12,557
I mean, the truth is...

515
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:15,352
...I'm stuck here...

516
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,771
...in Central City.

517
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:23,485
Fear has kept me in that living room
for 14 years.

518
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,405
[SIGHS]

519
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,657
Joe, I'm....

520
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:33,077
I was mad at you for being scared.

521
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:35,620
But...

522
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:40,125
...I mean, the truth is,
I was the one that was scared.

523
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:45,505
I've been afraid of the man in yellow for...

524
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:47,548
...my whole life.

525
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,592
That's why I lost.

526
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:56,889
When you first moved in with us,
I thought it was gonna be too much.

527
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,184
I'm already a single dad...

528
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:04,063
...finances were tough, and you were
a little boy who just lost his mother.

529
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,899
[CHUCKLING]
But, man, was I wrong.

530
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:10,152
Within two weeks you had changed
the whole dynamic of the house.

531
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:12,903
Suddenly the house was filled with this...

532
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:15,114
...light...

533
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:17,533
...this energy.

534
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,619
I mean, you brightened up everything.

535
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:24,165
You'd seen more darkness
than any man will in a lifetime...

536
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,542
...and you never let it dim your soul.

537
00:39:27,877 --> 00:39:33,674
So there I was thinking that
I'm changing your life by taking you in...

538
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:35,926
...but the truth is...

539
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:40,681
...you changed mine.

540
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,726
So don't lose that light now, Barr.

541
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,062
The world may need the Flash...

542
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:54,069
...but I need my Barry Allen.

543
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:05,539
-Let's go home.
-Yeah.

544
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:18,510
-Hey!
-Hey.

545
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:21,261
-What are you guys doing here?
-I invited them.

546
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:24,264
Where's Dr. Wells?

547
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:26,850
CAITLIN: Uh, he wasn't feeling up
to a social gathering...

548
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:29,186
...but he appreciated the invitation.

549
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:31,980
-Eggnog?
JOE: Yes.

550
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:37,860
-Merry Christmas, Barry.
-You too, Eddie.

551
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:40,403
Hey, I....

552
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:44,740
I just wanted to say...

553
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:47,910
...I heard you're moving in together...

554
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:51,372
...and I'm really happy for you.

555
00:40:53,082 --> 00:40:54,750
Thanks.

556
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:58,170
Merry Christmas. Heh.

557
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:02,383
JOE:
Mm.

558
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,595
A day like today, Grandma Esther's eggnog
seems a little light on the bourbon.

559
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:12,433
-Hey, Joe.
-Mm?

560
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:15,811
-I saw something weird tonight.
-Yeah, Cisco, I saw it too.

561
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:18,021
No, I mean...

562
00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:22,025
...when the Flash and the man in yellow
were going bumper cars on each other...

563
00:41:22,192 --> 00:41:24,695
...I was watching the electricity
coming off of them.

564
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:26,780
Yellow and red electricity.

565
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:28,155
When Barry was a kid...

566
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:31,784
...he saw red and yellow lightning
in his house the night his mother died.

567
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,912
There were two of them.

568
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:40,417
The man in yellow
may have killed Barry's mother...

569
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:43,712
...but there was another speedster there
that night.

570
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:49,425
IRIS:
Dad, it's time.

571
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:57,433
Okay, let's see.

572
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:06,150
[ALL LAUGH]

573
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,927
[IN REVERSE FLASH'S VOICE]
Merry Christmas.
