1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,016
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,554
I have to keep you safe. Go!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,456
<i>You've had Mona
in custody this whole time?</i>

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,630
You have the Kaupe, too?

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,360
Sara, you need to bring in that fugitive
before someone gets hurt.

6
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:12,371
Step away
from the creature, miss.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
You murdered him!

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,576
Today, I asked you for one thing.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,159
- Ava, don't do this.
- Just go.

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,096
<i>So, I'll head to the Bureau
and do some digging.</i>

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,430
Hank is torturing prisoners off-site.

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,079
Keep digging.
I wanna know everything.

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,072
What do you mean
you couldn't capture the asset?

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,436
<i>Blame it on your son's
time-traveling pals, sir.</i>

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,311
<i>Now, let me just say this.</i>

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,835
<i>And I wanna say this
for the television audience.</i>

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,959
The people have a right to know,

18
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,436
whether or not
their President is a crook.

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,114
Well, I am a crook.

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,954
It actually felt good
to get that off my chest.

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,236
What other secrets
have I been holding back...

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,597
Oh, yes. Despite the constant
reassurances of my wife,

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,320
I know that I'm certainly
only an adequate lover.

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,856
- <i>Mr. President?
- Mr. President?</i>

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,176
<i>The President won't be taking
any more questions at this time.</i>

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,398
That is more about Tricky Dick
than I ever needed to know.

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,536
<i>And it's more than
the public needed to know.</i>

28
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,176
<i>In the days following
the news conference,</i>

29
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,591
<i>Nixon found himself unable to
tell a lie, resulting in global chaos.</i>

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,993
Nixon's blathering fouled up ongoing
peace talks and trade agreements...

31
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,357
Without the release of
<i>All the President's Men,</i>

32
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,113
Robert Redford's career floundered.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,671
What? No Redford?
No Sundance. No indie film.

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,076
No artful nudity? We have to fix this!

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,710
The only thing nastier
than a politician lying,

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,519
is when he says how he really feels.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,056
Now, there's no way he'd tell the truth
without a magical assist.

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,753
I hope the Watergate has vacancies,

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,992
because we need to make sure
that Nixon still cheats the press.

40
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,958
Captain's orders and all,

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,555
but you think it's really the best time
to be back on mission?

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,109
Yeah, I mean,
might do well to take a beat.

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,113
I appreciate your concern,
but I'll be fine.

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,476
Just because Ava and I
had a disagreement,

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,040
doesn't mean that I can't do my job.

46
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,839
I was actually talking about the fact

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,758
that we're on the outs
with the Time Bureau.

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,519
Yeah, and I was talking about Mona.

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,672
I mean, Hank's gonna be after us since
her boyfriend offed that agent, and...

50
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,480
Well, we can't
just stash her away forever.

51
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,350
Right.

52
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,231
Well, it has been eventful, but things
are gonna blow over with the Bureau.

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,392
We'll find a safe place for Mona,
and in the meantime,

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,957
I feel like we should be doing
what we do best.

55
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,759
- Am I right?
- Right.

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,309
Save Redford and independent film!

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,673
That's the spirit!

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,037
- Done it for worse reasons.
- Why not?

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,871
Director Sharpe, you look terrible.
What happened?

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,310
Joke acknowledged, Nathaniel,
but tighten up.

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,296
Director Sharpe is taking a leave of
absence to get her priorities straight.

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,118
I'll be acting as
Director of the Bureau.

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,590
Wait, so, you're gonna be
in charge from now on?

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,955
- That's... It's great.
- Great.

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,656
Looking forward to working with you,
Director Heywood.

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,353
Glad to have you on board, Agent Tomaz.

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,109
Though my first job is a sensitive one.

68
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,439
I need to catch the Legends.

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,234
This is the last time
they will thumb their nose at authority,

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,879
and get away with it.

71
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,552
I know they are your friends.
So, you wanna sit this one out?

72
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,440
No, no, Dad. You know what?
We have your back.

73
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,393
Agreed. I stand by the Time Bureau,
and by my man.

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,914
Thank you, babe.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,116
Glad to hear it.

76
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,432
We'll pinpoint the location
of the <i>Waverider,</i> and pay it a visit.

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,794
We'll meet in the situation room, 0900.

78
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,678
Yes, sir, copy that.

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,276
We need to expose what Hank's up to
before he drops a hammer on the Legends.

80
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,471
Did you just call me "babe"?

81
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,280
Yeah, I was riffing,
I was trying to keep this thing afloat.

82
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,194
Anyway,
now that we are stuck with Hank,

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,636
we can't go through his phone ourselves.

84
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,918
With Ava gone,
there's no one here left to trust.

85
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,755
Well, there's one person we can trust.

86
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,357
Gary, we need to talk.

87
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,397
Is this about what happened
between Sara and Ava?

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,631
Wait. You're working at the Bureau?

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,716
Yes, and...
I need you to do something for me.

90
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,840
And you're my boss! Which is great.
You know, I'm happy for you.

91
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,992
- No one deserves it more.
- Damn it, Gary, focus.

92
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,231
Hank is causing total chaos here.

93
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,471
Did you notice him
using Director Sharpe's mug, too?

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,837
- I was gonna say something.
- It goes much deeper than that.

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,436
Mona was right.
Hank is running some secret project.

96
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,797
Now that he's in charge of the Bureau,
he's trying to shut down the Legends.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,275
Nate and I cloned his phone.

98
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,456
We're going to keep him busy.
You need to go through his activity,

99
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,976
find out what he's been up to
so we can end his time with the Bureau.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,118
Use this to stay in touch
without being monitored, okay?

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,159
I've always wanted
to untangle a conspiracy.

102
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,776
I'll need a bulletin board, index cards,

103
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,696
I already have yarn,
I've been getting into crochet.

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
- Yeah, me, too.
- We should start a club.

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,920
We'll talk.

106
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Okay.

107
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,190
<i>Konane! No!</i>

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,829
Kid, you okay in there?

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,792
Sorry, I never used a future
tech toilet before. So many buttons.

110
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Hmm.

111
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,316
Give it time.
You'll learn to live with it.

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,476
Oh, uh...

113
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,789
Don't touch the red button.

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,956
Oh, Captain,
I wanted to talk to you.

115
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,394
Good. I need to talk to you, too.

116
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,496
So, as far as the Bureau is concerned,
you're a fugitive.

117
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,536
I need you to stay on the ship,
and not draw any attention.

118
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,233
It's not just that. Um...

119
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,556
- When we were in Mexico...
- When we were in Mexico,

120
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,400
a man got murdered by Konane
because you said we could trust him.

121
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,392
No, Konane didn't...

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,639
He didn't mean to.

123
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,351
Look, Mona, whatever it is,
it's in the past.

124
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,836
Now it's on to the next problem.
That's how this works.

125
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,496
Mick, Nixon's supposed to give his
"I'm not a crook" speech tomorrow.

126
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,671
We need him back
to his lying self by then.

127
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,831
You and John stay on the ship,
look after Mona,

128
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,176
and make sure
she doesn't get into any trouble.

129
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,080
And make sure
she doesn't touch that red button.

130
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,751
I'm telling you I'm not crazy.

131
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,036
In fact,
I've never felt better in my life.

132
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,953
And that's the truth!

133
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,398
Hear that? "The truth." Something
is very wrong with the President.

134
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,836
And he's supposed to be
at Disney's Contemporary Hotel

135
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,037
to address the entire
American press corps tomorrow.

136
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,395
We'll take care of it.

137
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,039
I'll update the VP.

138
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,954
All right, sir.
We'll start off with a little sedative.

139
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,916
I don't know why you lot
are relying on my powers.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,639
They're still all mucked up.

141
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,790
It'll be fine.

142
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,759
We'll get him to the ship, fix what's
wrong, and we'll be right back.

143
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,516
Now, let's see
your Nixon impression.

144
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,673
Nice.

145
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,432
We got the cargo. We're on our way.

146
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,070
Let's figure out what loosed his tongue
and get the hell out of here, shall we?

147
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,400
Listen, you guys can't be here.
The Bureau's on to you.

148
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,159
Good, time for a pig roast.

149
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,336
No one's roasting anyone,
and it's not just the Bureau,

150
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,536
it's my dad, and he's got backup. Go!

151
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,676
No, not again.

152
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,797
Guys, we're working on
stopping Hank for good.

153
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,216
In the meantime, you need to find
the team and stay ahead of him.

154
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,560
On it.

155
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
What's going on?

156
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,680
Nate's old man commandeered the ship.

157
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,074
There they are!

158
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,997
Okay, take the stairs. Get Nixon.

159
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,720
Come on.

160
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,056
<i>We have eyes on the Legends,
and they have the President.</i>

161
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,436
They've gone too far again!

162
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,910
Siri, what... Alexa!

163
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,635
Gideon, fire up the engine!

164
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,829
The Legends must have bricked the ship.

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,037
Oh, they think of everything.

166
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,160
Nicely done.

167
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,032
I want our men watching every time jump,
listening to every comm.

168
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,936
How are we gonna make distance
with five of us, and a kidnapped Nixon?

169
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,270
There. There's our getaway.

170
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,234
That's a bit on the nose, no?

171
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,233
We left subtlety back in Mexico.
Gotta go.

172
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,176
<i>The Legends
are in the wind, Director.</i>

173
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,120
Damn it!

174
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:21,137
<i>They must have stolen a vehicle
and hit the road.</i>

175
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,389
You know what?

176
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,639
I've never needed a <i>Waverider</i> before,
and I don't need one now.

177
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,910
You give me a dragnet.

178
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,478
I want agents at every rest stop, diner,
store along the highway. Move!

179
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,197
And you, set up a police scanner.

180
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,159
If the Legends
so much as forget to signal,

181
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,640
we'll hear about it.

182
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,280
They'll slip up eventually.

183
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,999
That's probably accurate.

184
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Okay.

185
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,036
Captain, you should know that
me and tight spaces might not mix.

186
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,230
Do you think any of us
want to be stuck in this RV?

187
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,835
Punch buggy! No punch backs.

188
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,957
Mona, the team's back
is up against the wall.

189
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,496
And right now,
you are a part of this team,

190
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,656
and if you want it to stay that way,
then you need to help,

191
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,751
- not create more problems.
- Okay.

192
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,956
Great.

193

No, I'm not Patricia, Dick.

drugged the President,
and I'm stuck in the back with her.

Now, what are we gonna do?

204
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,200
We are going to Disney World.

205
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,633
Haven't we been tortured enough?

206
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,474
I mean, we are going to fix Nixon

207

in time to get him to Florida
to lie his ass off.

208
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,872
We are not gonna let anything stop us
from what we set out to do.

209
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,270
Mick, watch our tail.

210
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,670
John, see if you can figure out
what's wrong with Nixon,

211
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,433

Yeah, bloody right!

215

Mr. President?

216
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,430
No, no, no! Okay!
Quick, quick, quick, Charlie!

217
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,200
Mr. President, are you okay in there?

218
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,514
Just checking in, Mr. President.

219
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,439
You check in again, you'll be lucky
to be guarding a shopping mall.

Um...

221
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,552
- Okay, make your next left.
- Okay.

222
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,477
No, your next right.

223
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,912
Hey guys, looks like Nixon over here
is finally winning the war on drugs.

224
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,234
Good God,
I've been kidnapped by hippies!

225
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,392
What is it you want?
Money, power? I'll do anything.

226
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,791
- Look, we're here to help you.
- Let's talk about money.

227

shot at getting back to your right self.

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,314
Yep! Okay.

231
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,951
What the hell are you babbling about?

232
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,476
Ugh!

233
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,396
It's a roach.

234
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,790
I've been bugged!

235
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,354
This is an agent of Ma'at,

236
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,636
the goddess of truth
in the Egyptian pantheon.

237
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,235
You see, the creature,
it feeds off lies,

238
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,836
and whoever it eats at,
has nothing but truth left to tell.

239
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,550
No wonder it found its way to Nixon.
You must've been a feast.

240
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,035
No, no!

241
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Sorry.

242
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,669
Put him in the closet.

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,957
- Come on, Dickie!
- Yeah.

244
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,751
Let's put Dick in a box!

245
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,720
Um...

246
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,559
Captain, can we talk?

247
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,075
A lot's been going on, and...

248
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,879
And the truth roach, well...

249
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,474
That's gonna be a wrinkle.

250
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,155
Look, Mona, I have
a really big responsibility for you.

251
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,072
I need you to watch the roach.

252
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,310
Me? But, um...

253
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,776
Your job was to take care
of creatures, right?

254
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Who better than you?

255
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,879
Hey, little guy, bet you're hungry.

256
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,519

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,431
I am way out of my league.

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,072
No, it's "Gary."

Hmm.

265
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,256
I notice you're reading

266
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,480

Because you might be in trouble.

272
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,151

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,312

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,590
Your foot, Ray!

288
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,277
Got it.

289
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,716
Who called the cops?

290
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,029
Cops?

291
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,355
I've never been pulled over before.
What do I do?

292
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,312
You just pull over.

293
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,631
All right, just be cool, you got this.

294
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,390

- Yeah.

298

What is it? Drinkin'?

299
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Drugs?

300
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,799
No, sir. No, sir, we're just, uh...

301
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,196
Just driving and having
a little steering-wheel problem.

302
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,056
Tell me some more about
this steering-wheel trouble.

303
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,719
Well, it's a real doozy.

304
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,589
So, I'm here with my family,
and we're on our way to North Carolina

305
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,876
to see the largest chest of drawers.

306
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Ray!

307
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,271
So, the steering wheel was a little
loose, and so, I turned to my wife,

308
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,876
Claire, and I said...

309
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,151
My friends and I here
are time travelers.

310
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,800
We've kidnapped Nixon,
and we're headed to Disney World.

311
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
Like I thought.

312
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,877
You're high as a Goodyear blimp.
I'm calling this in.

313
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,951
Get this out of me!

314
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,280
How'd it even...

315
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Mona!

316
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,754
<i>I'm at Exit 244.</i>

317
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,958
<i>I got an RV full of hopheads
who claim they're from the future.</i>

318
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
See?

319
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,439
Come on, son, let's go grab
our guys the old-fashioned way.

320
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,440
Mmm-hmm.

321
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:16,319
Wait, Nate. I tuned this to a frequency
Hank can't read.

322
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,471
And I think I know a way
to contact the team.

323
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,280
It's a little old-school,
but it should work.

324
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,200
I'll be in touch.

325
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,176
I can't have a ticket
on my record.

326
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,714
I can't have a ticket on my record!

327
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,016
Nabbin' Nixon is gonna give you
more than a bloody ticket, mate.

328
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,633
Gun it! I'm bored.

329
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
He's right. Gun it.

330
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,240
- But then we'll become fugitives!
- We're already fugitives.

331
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,033
- Move.
- Hey!

332
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,354
You come back here!

333
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,795
Officer, we heard
your report from up high.

334
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,030
Where are the offenders?

335
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,998
Uh... I was fixing to call it in.

336
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,152
You let them get away?

337
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,114
You're gonna have to find another
way home because that's my car now.

338
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,636
There's a new sheriff in town.

339
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,834
Let's ride.

340
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,433
Nice moves, Palmer.

341
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,956
They're gaining.

342
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,158
Yeah, I don't think
that's the cops on us, mate.

343
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,271
Whoa! Hank! This car has no airbags
or traction control.

344
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,754
Exactly!

345
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,917
Nothin' but pure V8 power!

346
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,800
Whoa! Okay.

347
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,154
We gotta lose Hank.
You got something for this, John?

348
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,954
I might. But I'll need you
to get us off the road quick, squire.

349
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,556
Where the hell did they go?

350
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,152
What is with the radio?

351
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,596
<i>The heat's heavy
on the highway tonight,</i>

352
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,036
<i>and that's no weather report.</i>

353
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,396
<i>But lucky for you, you're not alone,</i>

354
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,633
<i>because you've got DJ Z to guide you
past those bad vibes.</i>

355
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,632
"DJ Z." That sounds like Zari.

356
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,713
Right now, the beat on the street
is to lay low.

357
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,032
But while you park it,
here's a hit to keep you safe.

358
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,591
All right, you heard her.
We should keep a low profile.

359
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,576
If we leave by night,
we should be able to make it.

360
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,276
In the meantime, no drawing attention,
and no altering the timeline.

361
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,829
Well, we best keep that bug
bottled then, eh?

362
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,920
The only way to keep it contained is
for everyone to stay completely honest.

363
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,672
What the hell is going on here?

364
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,996
Checkers!

365
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,790
Maybe it's best if
we all just don't talk.

366
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,958
Now, we just enter a command line
to a mirror site...

367
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,551
And we can get into his email.

368
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,075
His email's linked to a private server.

369
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,674
Must be where he's got his dirt.

370
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,991
We need a password.

371
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,596
Uh... Or we can reset it.
I forget my passwords all the time.

372
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,990
Those memory flashers
have a lot of side effects.

373
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,230
Password reset question.

374
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,117
We'll need some personal info from Hank.

375
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,070
What's the word?

376
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Sorry.

377
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,919
Gary, what's the word?

378
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,832
I'll need some scoop on Hank.

379
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
<i>Stand by, Gary.</i>

380
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,839
<i>Hey, Nate, we need to know the name
of your dad's childhood pet.</i>

381
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,471
<i>And whatever you do,
keep your dad off the FM.</i>

382
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,994
I'm on it, Z.

383
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,277
That's a pretty cool trick.

384
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,035
You drink a lot of Cokes
when you were a kid?

385
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Yeah.

386
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,273
Mom used to give me a quarter

387
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,536
for the corner store,
let me pick out whatever I wanted.

388
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,096
With her raising me on her own,
a quarter was more than I even knew.

389
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,430
You never really talked
about your childhood much.

390
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,598
Like, I'm not sure I know
where you were born.

391
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,832
Hackensack. In New Jersey.

392
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,958
Like the Billy Joel song.
We should turn on the radio.

393
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,952
1973, great year for music.

394
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,636
Actually, why don't we, uh, talk?
You know, get to know each other.

395
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,912
- You're right, Nathaniel.
- You could call me "Nate."

396
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,680
You have a dog?

397
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
A lab.

398
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,638
You know, named him Silver.

399
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,633
- After the Lone Ranger...
- Lone Ranger's horse, yes.

400
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,359
Yes, yes, yes.

401
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,397
You used to show me old episodes.

402
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,753
Well, at least I taught you something.

403
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,956
Huh.

404
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,998
You know, my mom used to take me
on road trips, stop for ice cream...

405
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,193
Without Dad around,
she really had to play both roles.

406
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,591
She didn't know how to be a father,
but... She did her best.

407
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,158
Guess I could say the same for myself.

408
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,473
Well, it's nice we get
to make up for some lost time. Huh?

409
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,191
But we should get back to the ship.
See if Zari's back online.

410
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,430
Actually, um,

411
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,354
why don't we forget the Legends
for a minute and go get some ice cream?

412
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,400
Fine idea, Nathaniel.

413
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,389
Nate.

414
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:35,241
<i>Hey, Gary, the answer is "Silver."</i>

415
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,753
"Silver." I'm in!

416
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,395
Hackers do say that in real life.

417
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,080
What is this?

418
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,912
Property deed in Hank's name from 1912?

419
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,633
It's a shipment for dwarf-star alloy...
From 1837?

420
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,315
He's using time travel
for personal gain?

421
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,230
That is against Bureau creed.
I have a copy in my wallet.

422
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,960
Somebody's coming!

423
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,151
Who was that?

424
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,874
Are you okay?

425
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,470
You have to take this to Zari,
and stop digging.

426
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,918
I'll go back to my cell.

427
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
And, Gary...

428
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,916
Be careful.

429
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,637
I got an alert that someone recovered
your password from the Time Bureau,

430
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,359
and they're accessing your accounts.

431
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,116
But who would...
How would they even...

432
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Thanks.

433
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,199
It won't happen again.

434
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,320
You know, I was just thinking that
even though we've had some setbacks,

435
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,353
that this road trip has really been
a great bonding experience.

436
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,432
I think you're an idiot.

437
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,759
Well, look,
we've dealt with a lot lately,

438
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,356
and I think this is a very needed chance

439
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,114
for us to sit,
and really talk about how we feel.

440
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,079
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
No, wait, I mean...

441
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,416
I don't give a damn if you're happy,
and I certainly don't trust you lot

442
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,296
in helping me face Neron, no matter
how many go-team prep talks you give.

443
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,391
Well, you can't keep me down.

444
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,718
Actually, ever since I met you,

445
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,156
I sometimes lie awake at night,

446
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,836
staring into the dark thinking,
"I am it, and it is me."

447
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,520
Also, I don't think Han shot first.

448
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm gonna go sit up front.

449
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,256
Also, I used the strategy guide

450
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,160
to beat the Water Temple
in <i>The Legend of Zelda.</i>

451
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,515
I think it's a cool look, but the whole
loosened tie is a little try-hard...

452
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,758
Yeah, well, it's not like
I went and loosened it myself.

453
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,496
Yeah, well, at least
I don't go and make up

454
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,319
my own silly superhero names
like Atom and Heat Wave.

455
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,480
Like I care what you think.

456
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,389
I wanna grow my hair out
to look like Fabio.

457
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,994
Right, I think that'd be good.

458
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,318
So, honestly,
even as much as I trust Sara,

459
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,551
this has been
one disaster after another,

460
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,109
and I really think that this time,
we are totally screwed.

461
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:58,151
Captain, we're okay, right?

462
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,835
I mean, we just
have to focus on the mission.

463
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,718
Yeah, Mona, we're gonna be fine.

464
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,437
Of course we're not fine, Mona!

465
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,514
Nothing is fine,
and I am definitely not fine.

466
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,717
Ava and I didn't just
get into an argument.

467
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,430
She asked me to leave, and she
hasn't answered any of my calls since.

468
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,753
And she was my one chance,
my one chance, Mona, at something real.

469
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,912
And now, I don't have a ship,
I don't have a girlfriend,

470
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,756
and I am the captain of an RV,
and it is all your fault!

471
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,477
Well, I won't be your problem anymore.

472
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,792
Mona! Mona, wait!

473
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,992
Mona, come back!

474
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,159
Mona, come back!

475
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,712
Look, I meant everything I said,
but if you stay here in 1973,

476
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,314
you'll never survive!

477
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,397
John, get this thing out of me!

478
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,871
All right, you guys
get Nixon to Florida.

479
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,576
If you leave now,
there'll be time to spare.

480
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
What about you?

481
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:25,161
Mona's out there alone,
and we don't leave our people behind,

482
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,232
no matter how much
they bug the crap out of us.

483
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,471
I'd say no pun intended,
but that would be a lie.

484
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,576
- Here you go, mate. Hold that, will you?
- What? Where are you going?

485
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,069
I just need to stretch my legs, squire.

486
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,075
You all right, Dad?
You didn't finish your ice cream.

487
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,676
- Put on your seat belt.
- What's the hurry?

488
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,238
The Legends' RVwas spotted
just outside Richmond.

489
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,075
My men are setting up a blockade.
They won't get away this time.

490
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,479
That's great. That's great!

491
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,275
This is what I dreamed about
when I joined the Bureau.

492
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
Stealing a cop car?

493
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,277
You and me working together.

494
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Uh, yeah, well... Ooh.

495
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,479
You know what, Dad,
that ice cream is not agreeing with me.

496
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,598
Can you, uh...
Can you pull over?

497
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,392
<i>Z? Z, can you hear me?</i>

498
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,960
Nate, is that you?

499
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,872
Hey, listen, I need you
to warn the team.

500
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,310
Hank's got a blockade on the highway
north of Richmond.

501
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,040
They gotta find another route.
You got it?

502
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,480
Roger. Over and out.

503
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,312
There you go, hon.

504
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,016
- All right, what do you want?
- Whatever's fast and cheap.

505
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,759
Oh, no, please, no.

506
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,635
Can I get six Daphne House burgers
and a round of sodas?

507
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,550
Comin' up.

508
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,119
Sara, hold up. Hey!

509
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,797
How do you even know where she went?

510
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,270
Bike treads went this way,
we passed a diner a while back,

511
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,397
- she's probably headed there.
- Hmm.

512
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,750
Go ahead.

513
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,118
I know you've been dying to say,
"I told you so," so, just do it.

514
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,591
It was quite the opposite, actually.
I wanted to see how you're holdin' up.

515
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,040
Honestly, I'm freaking out.

516
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,910
With the Kaupe dead and Mona in
the wind, and then there's Ava, and...

517
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,714
What happened?

518
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,678
I went to go talk to her and...

519
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,440
And I thought everything was
gonna be fine, 'cause it's always fine,

520
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,240
and... It was bad, John.

521
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,594
I don't know how to convince everybody

522
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,235
that everything's okay
when I'm not okay.

523
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,936
Well, you know, if we were
in each other's shoes right now,

524
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,270
then you'd be giving me
some rubbish speech

525
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,636
about how you don't have to
shoulder the burden myself,

526
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,076
when I have friends around me
to help me carry it.

527
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,279
Not that I believe you for a second,
but that doesn't mean it's not true.

528
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,040
Thanks.

529
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,200
Even if you're just lying
to make me feel better.

530
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,840
No, I definitely am.
Hope it worked, though.

531
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,120
- You all right there?
- Yeah. I'm great.

532
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,993
Let's grab some tunes.

533
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,311
- No, no, no.
- Hey!

534
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,998
<i>I just got a white-hot tip.</i>

535
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,309
That voice sounds familiar.

536
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,959
I don't recognize her... Or him.

537
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,156
I don't hear gender.

538
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,516
<i>There's a smoky checkpoint
outside Richmond.</i>

539
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,671
<i>If you wanna make it
to your final destination,</i>

540
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,277
<i>do yourself a favor and take Route 301
all the way home, bandits.</i>

541
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,720
Sounds like we're takin' a detour.

542
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,639
Dad, Dad, Dad!

543
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,031
Are you insane?
You could have got us killed.

544
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,496
Yeah, you're still here, ain't ya?

545
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,877
- Yeah, but we're going the wrong way!
- No. We're right on target.

546
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,600
All units,
Legends are headed down Route 301.

547
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,718
<i>Reroute all units to converge
on their location, now!</i>

548
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,237
Come on. I'm not gonna miss a chance
to get back at the Legends for Mexico.

549
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,296
They're gonna get what they deserve
for trying to protect that wolf bastard!

550
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,073
His name was Konane.

551
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,756
What?

552
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,477
Wait. I remember you.

553
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,676
You're the one Director Heywood fired.

554
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,274
You're the reason that mutt got out

555
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,272
of the containment facility
in the first place.

556
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,717
I said, his name was Konane.

557
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,678
There's Mona's bike. Where is she?
Where is everybody?

558
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,958
Yeah. I know this kind of quiet,
and it never means anything good.

559
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,880
Everybody out!

560
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,476
Mona.

561
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,671
I'll do it. I'll shoot!

562
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,513
The Kaupe must have scratched her.

563
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,155
She tried to tell me...

564
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,674
And I didn't listen.

565
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,434
- Mona, put him down!
- Come on, love, this isn't you.

566
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,235
- Stop the RV!
- Step out of the vehicle!

567
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,995
What are we gonna do?

568
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,656
- We can't drive through 'em.
- Kill 'em.

569
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,600
- What?
- Kill 'em all.

570
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:11,520
- No!
- Yes.

571
00:32:11,521 --> 00:32:12,439
- No!
- Yes!

572
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
- No! No...
- Yes!

573
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,635
Nate's here.
I'm sure we can talk this all out.

574
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,999
You wanna do the honors, son?

575
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
Damn right, Dad.

576
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,154
All right. Don't worry, buddy,
I'll get you out of this.

577
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,957
Hey, Mr. Heywood,
if we could just talk about this,

578
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,636
I'm sure we can explain and show you how
this is just one big misunderstanding...

579
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,119
How's that
for a misunderstanding, you pig!

580
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,119
By the power vested to me
by the United States government,

581
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,591
I hereby arrest both of you
on five charges of treason,

582
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,831
- two of conspiracy, and...
- Uh... Sir?

583
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,593
Mr. President, are you all right?

584
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
No!

585
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,758
These two men and their
co-conspirators kidnapped me.

586
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,476
They've besmirched my good name
and I've done nothing to deserve it.

587
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Uh-oh!

588
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,710
Well, actually, there is nothing good
about my name.

589
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,639
If you were born with
the name "Dick Milhous,"

590
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,275
you'd grow up to be a bastard, too.

591
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,434
What the hell?

592
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,438
Listen to me, Mona.
No one else needs to get hurt.

593
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,600
I'm sorry about that, love.

594
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Bloody hell!

595
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,037
Mona, can you hear me?

596
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,434
Come on, I know you're in there!
Look, it's me! It's Sara.

597
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,238
I know it's you, Sara.
I remember everything.

598
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,471
You pretended to be a friend.

599
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,875
- I looked up to you!
- Mona...

600
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,320
It was all lies.

601
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,079
Mr. President, what is going on?

602
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,949
I don't know! I'm supposed
to be in Florida, lying to the press.

603
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,111
He ingested a truth bug.

604
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,955
See, these blunders are the exact reason
why we should lock up the Legends.

605
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,752
Nathaniel, are you all right?

606
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,431
No, I'm not.
I've been keeping secrets from you.

607
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,910
You think I don't know that?

608
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,670
But it's more than
your secret Pentagon side project.

609
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,896
It's always been like this, Dad.

610
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,594
The lying,
and the hiding of the feelings...

611
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,336
Now that I'm getting to be honest,

612
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,398
I just wanna tell you I love you,
but you just make it so damn hard.

613
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,840
Look, son, you don't understand.

614
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,896
And I like working with you
at the Time Bureau, side by side.

615
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,673
I've never felt closer to you.

616
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,436
But now, I'm having like a hard time
even looking in your face.

617
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,236
Just tell me why.
Why are you doing all this?

618
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,154
Why are you pretending
that we are on the same side?

619
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,434
I can't.

620
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,878
But everything I've done
has been for you.

621
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,912
And the fact that it's hurting you,
Nate, it's killing me.

622
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,434
But I wanna make this right.

623
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,720
Okay.

624
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,631
You let the Legends walk.

625
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,712
That, or you lock me up, too.

626
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,277
Because if you don't trust them,
then you and I are not on the same side.

627
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,077
Stand down!
The Legends are free to go.

628
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,229
From now on, we work together.
No more lies.

629
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,679
Watch yourself, love.
She's not in her right mind.

630
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,717
No, that's the problem.

631
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,075
She is.

632
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,637
Mona, look, please stop.

633
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,797
I should've never blamed you
for everything.

634
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,556
Look, Ava, the ship, Konane,
none of it was your fault.

635
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,998
And I am so sorry
that I told you to ignore your feelings.

636
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,878
It was because I thought...

637
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,496
Look, I thought that if I could
forget the way that I was feeling,

638
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,239
then maybe, it wouldn't hurt so bad.

639
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,795
Look, Mona, I was wrong. I was so wrong.

640
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,760
And you don't have to
bury your feelings.

641
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,479
You can let them out.

642
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,272
And if you ever need a shoulder
to lean on, I will be there.

643
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,958
You promise?

644
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,032
I promise.

645
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,999
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes. No, I don't know.

646
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,675
First time in my adult life,
I told my dad I love him.

647
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,680
Years of therapy
couldn't even get me to do that.

648
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,992
Hey, speaking of, I love you so big,
I love you so big...

649
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,799
- I love you so big.
- Aw!

650
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,792
Look, I don't always
agree with you, but, uh...

651
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,639
If Nathaniel trusts you, then so do I.

652
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,758
You're free to fly if
you can get that ship of yours working.

653
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,555
<i>Someone ask for a lift?</i>

654
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,554
Ship was never broken, was it?

655
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,399
Nope, it was Zari the whole time.

656
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,000
Is she even your girlfriend?

657
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,349
Nope, but I'm open to it.

658
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,318
Fat chance.

659
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,392
Come on, you poor bastard,
let's delouse you

660
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,711
and get that truth bug
contained for good, yeah?

661
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,520
And Nixon here
has an important speech to deliver.

662
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,671
Let's get you back to Orlando.

663
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,719
You know,
the truth really does set you free.

664
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,392
After spending a few days
with all of you,

665
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,075
I know that I can be a better leader.

666
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,755
And even more so, a better man.

667
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,640
Ah... History needs you, crooked Dick!

668
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Who are you?

669
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,792
I really think
I'm gonna miss this thing.

670
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,031
Yeah, if I had to be
stuck on a road trip,

671
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,349
at least it was with you guys.

672
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,791
You know, maybe that's what family is.

673
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,674
The people you don't mind
being annoyed by.

674
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,119
So, you don't mind being annoyed by me?
Are you saying I can stay?

675
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,271
We could always use
another shoulder to lean on.

676
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,195
Besides, you're not the first magical
creature that we've taken in.

677
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:42,841
- We forgot Charlie!
- We forgot Charlie!

678
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,040
Hey, Nate, hold up.

679
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,840
Gary, he surprisingly got
to the bottom of things.

680
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,076
It's not good.

681
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,989
Your dad's embezzling funds for some
black-site operation in Baltimore.

682
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,551
But he's not just taking the fugitives,
he's testing on them.

683
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,560
But why?

684
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:03,599
I don't know, but I've seen this
before with A.R.G.U.S.

685
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,952
This is what they were doing to metas
to turn them into supersoldiers.

686
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,715
- You okay?
- Yeah.

687
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,075
Now, I know who my father really is.

688
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,595
Hank says he's doing this for me.

689
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,240
I want nothing to do with it, or him.

690
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,752
Hey, I'm sorry.

691
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,110
Yeah.

692
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,755
You called.

693
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,560
A little late for a meeting.
This better be good.

694
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,032
When you came to me,

695
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,917
I agreed to this plan

696
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,879
because I saw the potential
in your vision, and I still do.

697
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,556
Don't tell me
you're having second thoughts.

698
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,758
I mean no disrespect.

699
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,354
I value the work that we've done,

700
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,239
and I understand why it needs
to remain top-secret.

701
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,392
But I have a new partner now.

702
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,874
My son.

703
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,156
And I can't let anything
come between us.

704
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,475
What are you saying, Henry?

705
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,958
I'm saying that
I don't need you anymore.

706
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
If that's the case,
I don't need you anymore, either.

707
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
No!

708
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,519
You're gonna have to let me
out of here.

709
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,517
You need to let me out of here! Gary!

710
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,194
Anybody!

711
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,080
No! No!

712
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,554
Please, no! No.

713
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,319
Somebody help me.

714
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,113
<i>Help me!</i>

715
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,470
No! No, no, no!

716
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,755
Dad?

717
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,390
Nate!

718
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,519
- What did you do?
- I didn't...

719
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,516
What did you do?

720
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,231
Nate. Listen... Listen to me.

721
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,390
She's right there.

722
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,280
I'm sorry.
