1
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,333
Is it not peculiar
that one feels the greatest aversion

2
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,416
towards the very people
who are most similar to oneself?

3
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,916
I want to know how to get back home.

4
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,375
Get dressed.

5
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,750
JUNE 25, 2020

6
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,416
TWO DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

7
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,250
Wait.

8
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,458
I have to show you something.

9
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,000
We've got an appointment.

10
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,208
Maybe you'd better sit down.

11
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,333
Can we do this some other time?
We really have to go.

12
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,250
It's... I...

13
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,416
I have to tell you something.

14
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,333
It sounds totally crazy, but I have
to know what you think about it.

15
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,958
Are you nuts?

16
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,416
You've hardly spoken to us in months
and now you want to know what we think?

17
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,625
Look around you.

18
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:18,416
We're the kids, but you've been acting
like one for months.

19
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,875
Mom,
you act as if you're alone with this shit.

20
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,875
But we lost them too.

21
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,541
No.

22
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,875
So you want to talk,
that doesn't mean we do!

23
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,583
Why is he so interested
in the nuclear power plant?

24
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,875
Find someone at Criminal Investigation
who knows this Clausen guy.

25
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,791
What does he really want here?

26
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,750
Call me as soon as you know something.

27
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,458
Bartosz isn't here.

28
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,875
His bed hasn't been slept in.
He wasn't here all night.

29
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,458
-Maybe he's with Martha.
-They're not together anymore.

30
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,125
They must've made up. Have you called?

31
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,958
No one's answering.

32
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,291
I'm sure it's nothing.

33
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,916
Tell me it'll all be fine.

34
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,833
It'll all be fine.

35
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,958
You good, Inspector?

36
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,375
FORMER WINDEN CHIEF INSPECTOR
EGON TIEDEMANN

37
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,750
FOUND DEAD ON JUNE 26, 1987

38
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,458
CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING HIS DEATH STILL UNCLEAR

39
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,083
Ms. Tiedemann?

40
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,875
The French delegation.

41
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,875
They're all waiting.
I think you'd better get going.

42
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,166
Reschedule.

43
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,541
What?

44
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,541
Reschedule.

45
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,000
But I can't just...

46
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,416
Why am I here?

47
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,458
A person lives three lives.

48
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,291
The first ends with the loss of naïveté,

49
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,416
the second with the loss of innocence,

50
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:48,125
and the third
with the loss of life itself.

51
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,916
It is inevitable
that we go through all three stages.

52
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,416
You will turn into your older self,

53
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,708
and your older self

54
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,750
into what you see before you.

55
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,958
I don't have time for this shit.

56
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,000
I have to go back home. To my time!

57
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,416
I've seen what will happen.
I've seen their graves.

58
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,375
You still have lots of time.

59
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,208
This is the year 1921.

60
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,708
Strictly speaking,
you still have 99 years.

61
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,083
Here. A fresh snack.

62
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,041
People can say what they like,

63
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,833
but Reagan is a first-rate guy.

64
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,541
The Olympic Games in East and West Berlin.

65
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,291
I call that visionary.

66
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,125
I have the whole speech on VHS.

67
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,666
You haven't been here in a long time.

68
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,833
I just wanted
to quickly check how you are.

69
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,375
It's fine.

70
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,833
Claudia.

71
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,166
You do know that I'm proud.

72
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,625
Of all you've accomplished.

73
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,125
And your mother would be, too.

74
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,416
I've got to go.

75
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,125
The real reason I came...

76
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,958
I want you to move in with us.

77
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,916
You wouldn't be so alone.

78
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,791
And Regina would be happy
to see more of you.

79
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,625
Tomorrow would be best.

80
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,250
Tomorrow?

81
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,916
You're acting
like I'm almost on my deathbed.

82
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,750
Think it over.

83
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,750
All right?

84
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,708
Katharina?

85
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,708
What do you want?

86
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,625
Is he here?

87
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,375
Jonas?

88
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,708
He has vanished.
I have no idea where he is.

89
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,708
You said you saw Mikkel.

90
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,833
You were there. How do I get to him?

91
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,208
He has this kind of...

92
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,375
device.

93
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,166
I guess it's like a...

94
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,583
time machine.

95
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,125
A time machine.

96
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,125
And do you know how it works?

97
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
Even if I did, it wouldn't help.

98
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,375
He took it.

99
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,375
He was always here.

100
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,916
Right in front of me.

101
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:35,333
I just can't believe you slept
with my husband and my son.

102
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,041
But you always did want
what belonged to me.

103
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,083
You're like a parasite.

104
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,250
Did Ulrich ever actually tell you
he loved you?

105
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,291
In the end, he would always choose us.

106
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,666
Hello.

107
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,291
Hello.

108
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,333
You missed your appointment yesterday.

109
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,375
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

110
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,416
must have forgotten.

111
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,833
Hard to believe you'd forget it
when your own child is missing.

112
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,083
Mrs. Nielsen.

113
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,041
You were the last person
I expected to see here.

114
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,583
But since you're here...

115
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,291
Do you know who this is?

116
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,458
No, I don't.

117
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,208
And you?

118
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,958
Do you know this person?

119
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,041
No.

120
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,375
Do you know everything that will happen?

121
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,416
I know when wars begin and end,

122
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,541
what discoveries will be made
in the years ahead,

123
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,000
what shares I should invest in.

124
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,583
But I don't know
what my counterpart will do

125
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,333
as long as I haven't seen his future.

126
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,750
But you know my future.
You know what I'll do.

127
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,208
I am your future.

128
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:16,250
There must be a way to change it all.
So things happen differently.

129
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,291
A loophole.

130
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:24,333
It took me 66 years to find out how,

131
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,875
to find a way to escape this hell.

132
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,916
I've been here almost a week.

133
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,750
And I get the impression
no one is telling the truth.

134
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,666
Everyone's trying to hide something.

135
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,375
Although I'm not sure
if you're all hiding the same thing

136
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:51,291
or if everyone is trying
to keep their own skeleton in the closet.

137
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:58,916
Does he pay you?

138
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,166
Aleksander Tiedemann.

139
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,791
I don't quite follow you.

140
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:14,041
You worked as his physiotherapist.
You no longer do so, right?

141
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,708
Yet he still transfers you
the same amount every month.

142
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:25,500
One would normally expect
a service in return, so what is it?

143
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,666
What you don't get is
we stick together here.

144
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,750
We support each other.

145
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,750
My son disappeared.

146
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,250
Aleksander helps me with the money.

147
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,125
That's it.

148
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,291
Nothing beats a good neighborhood.

149
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,250
It's remarkable that Mrs. Nielsen
feels the same way about that.

150
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,583
Oh, well,
maybe that's how small towns are.

151
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,625
People share not only secrets,

152
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,041
but also money and beds.

153
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,541
-I want to know what you know.
-Fine.

154
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,083
Who is Noah?

155
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,291
He's one of them.

156
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,875
A traveler.

157
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,333
He's Adam's puppet.

158
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,500
He killed the children.

159
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,125
Mads, Erik, Yasin.

160
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,041
I think

161
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,041
all of this has to do with me.

162
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,625
Do you know who my parents are?

163
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,875
No.

164
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,541
But I knew your grandfather.

165
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,083
He's not my real grandfather.

166
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,458
I just grew up with him.

167
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,666
Did he know all this?

168
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,958
Is he one of them?

169
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,458
A traveler?

170
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,875
He's just a pawn, like most of us.

171
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,083
Claudia.

172
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,583
She used him.

173
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,666
Just like she used me, Peter
and the others.

174
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,125
She had him build this.

175
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,833
You know what will happen.

176
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,833
In the future.

177
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,250
Yes.

178
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,958
What is this?

179
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,333
Want to spend another night here?

180
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,166
Man, Bartosz, look at us.
What are we doing here?

181
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,833
Why won't you tell us what's going on?

182
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,916
I would if I could.

183
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,208
I'm not allowed to.

184
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,750
Even if I did tell you,
you wouldn't believe me.

185
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,333
Why not?

186
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:33,083
The human body
can go three days without liquid.

187
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,625
You're nuts. You can't do this!

188
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,916
You want to leave me here to die or what?

189
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:49,875
Hey, Martha.

190
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,750
Martha, wait. Please.
Martha, you can't do this!

191
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:53,916
Martha!

192
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,625
Okay.

193
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,416
It's a time machine.

194
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:07,500
What?

195
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,291
Are you screwing with me?

196
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,625
I said you wouldn't believe me.

197
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,791
Come on. We're leaving.

198
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,333
No. Wait.

199
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,541
Then show us how it works.

200
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,125
I need a phone.

201
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,291
-There's no reception here.
-That's irrelevant.

202
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,958
It just needs
to search for a signal, that's it.

203
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,208
ARIADNE

204
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,458
You need to come closer.

205
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,000
The incident last summer.

206
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,291
You told me it was from a reaction
in the volume control system.

207
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,500
I checked the data.

208
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,291
Everything was normal.

209
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,541
So...

210
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,416
What really happened?

211
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:02,125
I knew you wouldn't be able
to let it rest.

212
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:09,458
After the incident
I had a sample taken and analyzed.

213
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,000
What you see there are the results.

214
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,125
These values, they aren't possible.

215
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,208
I initially thought that too.

216
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,208
So I had the tests repeated.

217
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,083
The results were identical.

218
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,750
If this data is correct, then...

219
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,791
-Is this what I think it is?
-Possibly.

220
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:37,166
In many respects it corresponds

221
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,083
to Englert, Brout
and Higgs' calculations in 1964.

222
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,666
But not entirely.

223
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,083
The God Particle.

224
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,750
The particle
that gives all things its mass.

225
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,625
This is a sensation.

226
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,166
If this data is correct,
we have to go public with it.

227
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,166
I already told you

228
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:07,375
some sleeping dogs should be left to lie.

229
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:14,041
If we go public with it
people will want to know how we found it.

230
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,333
The nuclear power plant

231
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,125
is my legacy.

232
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,000
Do what you like with the data,

233
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,250
but leave my name

234
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,666
and the power plant out of it.

235
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,791
At least as long as I'm alive.

236
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,791
Can I help you?

237
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,333
Are you not well?

238
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,708
-Hello, Ines.
-Ina!

239
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,958
Hello.

240
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,833
We're out of iodine again.

241
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,125
Have you heard?

242
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,916
A guy escaped from the loony bin.

243
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,125
They say he killed two kids in the 1950s,
and beat another half to death.

244
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:06,750
He's on his last legs himself now,
but they say to be vigilant.

245
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:26,750
Thanks.

246
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:51,125
You seem familiar somehow.

247
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:07,041
I've waited over 33 years for this moment.

248
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,333
The question is not how,

249
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:26,541
but when.

250
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,500
You said that.

251
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:33,958
Remember?

252
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,000
Dad.

253
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:53,083
In the future
there's a prophecy about a new world.

254
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,916
That Sic Mundus
will lead people into paradise.

255
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,708
Is this that?

256
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,708
A religion?

257
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:07,083
We're the exact opposite of that.

258
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,708
We've declared war on time.

259
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,750
Declared war on God.

260
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,541
We're creating a new world,

261
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,541
without time,

262
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,375
without God.

263
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,291
What does that mean?

264
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:29,958
It means that what people
have worshipped for millennia,

265
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,333
the God who holds everything together,

266
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:36,041
that God is nothing more than time itself.

267
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,625
Not a thinking, acting entity.

268
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,083
A physical law

269
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,958
with which one can negotiate
as little as one can with one's own fate.

270
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,333
God

271
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,583
is time.

272
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,666
And time is not merciful.

273
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:59,875
We are born,
and our life is already trickling away

274
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,625
like the sand in this hourglass.

275
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:04,083
Death is forever inevitably before us.

276
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,791
Our fate

277
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,083
is nothing
but a concatenation of cause and effect.

278
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:12,833
In light

279
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,041
and in shadow.

280
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,250
Charlotte.

281
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,083
What do you want?

282
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,500
-I'm Noah.
-I know who you are.

283
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,708
You killed the children.

284
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,916
I can no longer change
what you think of me.

285
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,875
But...

286
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,416
maybe one day you'll understand

287
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,750
that I only did this
so that it will one day no longer happen.

288
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:07,875
So you're not taken from me again.

289
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,583
And neither is your mother.

290
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,875
When you were born
they didn't give you much of a chance.

291
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,583
You were premature. You were tiny.

292
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,833
But you wanted to live.
You were so strong.

293
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:38,458
Your little hand grasped my finger
and wouldn't let go.

294
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:39,625
Stop.

295
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:43,708
That's impossible.

296
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,125
Your mother took that picture.

297
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:59,041
I promised her I'd bring you back.

298
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,250
I've looked for you all these years.

299
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:07,416
But you were here the entire time.

300
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,958
Adam knew it was you.

301
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,416
He knew it all the time.

302
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,041
He's preparing for what comes afterwards.

303
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24,625
I read the last pages.

304
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:28,083
The nuclear power plant, Jonas.

305
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,125
It'll all happen again. The apocalypse.

306
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,458
In two days.

307
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,625
But I now know

308
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,458
what I must do.

309
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,541
I have to end Adam.

310
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,875
So everyone lives.

311
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,833
Not just those in the bunker.

312
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,541
Who is my mother?

313
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,333
She loved you very much.

314
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,958
She still does.

315
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,875
What happened here?

316
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,666
The armchair is gone.

317
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,750
-What's going on?
-I didn't believe it at first either.

318
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:14,083
But then he told me things
that would happen.

319
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,666
And they did, just as he said.

320
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,375
That...

321
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,416
you and Jonas kissed.

322
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:28,083
He told me that before you did it.

323
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,625
That my mother would get cancer.

324
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,083
That Jonas would vanish.

325
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,875
Who told you that?

326
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:40,541
Noah.

327
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:41,708
Noah?

328
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,375
The priest with the big blue eyes?

329
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,708
-You know him?
-I don't.

330
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:47,958
But Elisabeth does.

331
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,625
Okay, what's going on?

332
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,125
Noah said it was about a war.

333
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,208
And about ruling over time.

334
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:01,125
That my grandma is involved in it
and that Jonas will return and...

335
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,083
Jonas?

336
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,708
Jonas is coming back?

337
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,166
Yes.

338
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,708
He's part of the war.

339
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,625
I'm going home.

340
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,416
You have to believe me.

341
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:34,791
Michael?

342
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,791
Michael?

343
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,500
Michael?

344
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,041
Egon, it's Ines.

345
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,583
I know it sounds strange, but...

346
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:06,916
I just got home
and Michael isn't here and...

347
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:11,333
The man who broke out
of the psychiatric ward...

348
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,833
Which man from the psychiatric ward?

349
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,000
It was on the radio today.

350
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,958
Do you remember

351
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:21,666
the children
on the construction site in 1953?

352
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,208
That man, he escaped.

353
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,541
I'll call the police station at once.

354
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,458
I might know where they're heading.

355
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,583
I'll come pick you up.

356
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,875
Stop! Freeze!

357
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,916
-Michael!
-Let the boy go!

358
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,916
-No!
-Get on the ground!

359
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,875
Michael!

360
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:10,083
-You don't get it!
-Get down!

361
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,333
-He's my son.
-I said get down now!

362
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,000
-Mikkel.
-Michael! Michael.

363
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,666
Mikkel, I'll be back. I'll take you home.

364
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,583
I promise.

365
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:24,666
I promise.

366
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:29,125
It's all your fault. It always has been.

367
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:32,291
I swear, next time I'll kill you.

368
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,291
Come on!

369
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,125
Mikkel!

370
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:42,958
Mikkel.

371
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,875
Michael.

372
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,000
Our father

373
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,875
is just a small part of a knot

374
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:52,916
that is infinitely larger
and more convoluted.

375
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,916
The entire universe

376
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,833
is nothing but a gigantic knot
from which there is no escape.

377
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,416
If that's so,

378
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:06,041
if everything is perpetually in that knot,

379
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,083
if nothing can be changed,

380
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,833
then you've already had this conversation?

381
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:14,416
And posed that very question.

382
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,708
My whole life, I was convinced

383
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,416
that this moment

384
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,666
could never be repeated in this way.

385
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,750
I could never speak the words

386
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:31,666
that my older self said to me back then.

387
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,666
Because I could not understand

388
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:41,916
how I could ever in my life want
what he wanted.

389
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,500
Now,

390
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,500
66 years later, I understand it.

391
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,500
Some moments change us forever.

392
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,791
Some pain you never forget.

393
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,166
But there is a way

394
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:17,625
that leads us out
of all of this cruel futility.

395
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:22,916
But if that's true, if there is a way,

396
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:27,291
why does it all happen as it always has,
why have you changed nothing?

397
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:49,666
Every development
builds on the previous one.

398
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,166
First you have the wheel, then the car.

399
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:56,791
I can't be me
without previously having been you.

400
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,333
You saw the passage, in the bunker.

401
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,375
The chair, the device.

402
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:06,958
The thing in the future.

403
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,416
But that is not the end of the chain.

404
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,625
Thanks for taking the time.

405
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,750
I'd like...

406
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:29,333
you to analyze this for me.

407
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:31,375
And not a word,

408
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,750
to anyone.

409
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:41,750
What is it?

410
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:45,291
If it's what I think it is,

411
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:49,750
it'll revolutionize
our understanding of the world.

412
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:27,416
MODERN TALKING
ALBUM TOUR, 1987

413
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,916
PRESERVE CREATION
GAIN THE FUTURE

414
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,583
Stop! Wait, stop! Pull over!

415
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,666
Those are my children!

416
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,125
Magnus! Martha!

417
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,750
Do you believe me now?

418
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,458
You're back!

419
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,958
Where have you been?

420
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,333
Did this ever mean anything to you?

421
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,625
Did you ever actually love Dad?

422
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:02,625
I know you had an affair with Ulrich.

423
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:08,208
If you could choose
between Dad and Ulrich now...

424
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:20,875
With all this shit, I thought you were
the only person I can trust.

425
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,958
I ruined everything,

426
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:47,708
I know.

427
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,625
Maybe you always have.

428
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,541
Jonas.

429
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,208
You need no one.

430
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,125
Just yourself.

431
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:08,166
It's not the same
as what lies in the future.

432
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:12,041
It is, in a manner of speaking, it's twin.

433
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:17,166
It is a part of the infinite.

434
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,666
It pervades everything.

435
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:26,958
People have given it a myriad of names
over the centuries,

436
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:31,083
ether, dark matter, the Higgs field.

437
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:32,791
How did it come to be?

438
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:38,958
The one in the future, via the disaster
in two days you so dearly want to prevent.

439
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:43,708
This one here we produced ourselves.

440
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:47,833
It is the end
of a technological evolution.

441
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:49,750
And...

442
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:53,083
it will be the end of the knot.

443
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,541
This right here
will take you to the exact day

444
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,208
that you want to travel to.

445
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,458
It breaks the 33-year cycle.

446
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:10,541
That's why I'm here.

447
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,041
That's what you want from me.

448
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,291
There is a way to stop it all
if I stop the beginning.

449
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:19,625
That there is.

450
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,708
The question is only,
when is the beginning?

451
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,458
And what sacrifice must we make?

452
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:34,041
June 20, 2019.

453
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,875
The day before it all happened.

454
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:41,916
Before Dad took his own life.

455
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:47,833
Before it all fell apart.

456
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:53,166
If you can prevent him
from taking his life,

457
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:58,333
then everything that follows
will not occur.

458
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:02,958
Mikkel will not travel back.

459
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:06,708
You...

460
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:08,291
I...

461
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,250
We won't be born.

462
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,208
But everyone else will live.

463
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,625
Martha will live.

464
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,125
If you succeed

465
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:05,333
we will reorder the world.

466
00:55:56,083 --> 00:56:01,125
