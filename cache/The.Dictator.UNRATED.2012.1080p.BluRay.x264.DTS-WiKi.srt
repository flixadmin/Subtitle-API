1
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,716
<i>Tensions are rising as the stand-off</i>

2
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,803
<i>between the world community and the
rogue North African nation of Wadiya</i>

3
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,096
<i>intensified today</i>

4
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,142
<i>as U. N. weapons inspectors were once
again refused access to the country</i>

5
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:00,478
<i>by Wadiyan leader,
Admiral General Aladeen.</i>

6
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:04,691
I will take no options
off the table. And I mean what I say.

7
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,861
<i>Tonight we ask...
Who is General Aladeen?</i>

8
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,071
<i>According to
Wadiyan propaganda,</i>

9
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:13,283
<i>Haffaz Aladeen
was born in 1973.</i>

10
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:19,789
<i>He did not know his mother,
who died in childbirth.</i>

11
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:25,086
<i>General Aladeen was born
the only son of the Colonel Aladeen,</i>

12
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,464
<i>himself a savage
and violent dictator.</i>

13
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:32,302
Next!

14
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,055
<i>Known for his iconic beard,</i>

15
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:38,641
<i>he is protected
by 30 female guards,</i>

16
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,643
<i>who he maintains
are virgin.</i>

17
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,489
<i>Thrust into power
at age seven,</i>

18
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:56,326
<i>he may just be the most dangerous
man in the entire world.</i>

19
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:58,328
All right,
let's get right to it.

20
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,331
Do you have
nuclear weapons?

21
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,585
What was the question?

22
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,130
Do you have
nuclear weapons?

23
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,423
Sorry, I can't hear you.

24
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:12,217
Are you developing
nuclear weapons?

25
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,385
No, I literally
can't hear you.

26
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,013
I'm going to
another question.

27
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,265
Oh, I can hear you now.

28
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,393
<i>Eccentric and with
unlimited oil wealth,</i>

29
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,896
<i>he recently hosted
his own Olympic Games...</i>

30
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,398
<i>On your mark, get set.</i>

31
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,535
<i>...at which he won
fourteen gold medals.</i>

32
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,374
Aladeen! Aladeen!

33
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,709
<i>Often described
as ignorant,</i>

34
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:50,630
<i>he changed
over 300 Wadiyan words to "Aladeen, "</i>

35
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:54,509
<i>including the words "positive" and
"negative," causing mass confusion.</i>

36
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:59,847
Do you want
the Aladeen news or the Aladeen news?

37
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,476
The Aladeen news?

38
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,814
You are HIV-Aladeen.

39
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,204
<i>With pressure mounting,</i>

40
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,832
<i>Aladeen addressed
his nation today.</i>

41
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,334
Aladeen! Aladeen!

42
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,117
People of Wadiya,

43
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,995
I come before you today

44
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:08,708
to tell you that the world shall
kneel before our great nation.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,963
We are two months away from
enriching weapons-grade uranium

46
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:21,554
to be used
for peaceful purposes.

47
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:32,857
It will be used
only for medical research

48
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:36,319
and clean energy.
It will, it will.

49
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:39,155
And will certainly
never be used

50
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,991
to attack ls...
Oh, boy.

51
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:46,996
<i>With that speech, today,</i>

52
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,666
<i>the international community
is asking one question:</i>

53
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,503
<i>Does the Mad Dog of Wadiya
have nuclear weapons?</i>

54
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,181
Now, show me
my nuclear weapons!

55
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,017
I can't wait!
I can't wait!

56
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:26,327
This is the Beard
of Doom rocket?

57
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,664
This is my weapon?
I will be a laughingstock!

58
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,625
All my friends
have got nuclear weapons.

59
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,377
Even Ahmadinejad!

60
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,922
<i>And he looks like
a snitch on Miami Vice.</i>

61
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:40,550
Would it kill him
to wear a tie?

62
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,011
I mean, is every day
in Iran casual Friday?

63
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,891
Where is the Head of my Nuclear
Program and Procurer of Women?

64
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:51,060
Where is Nuclear Nadal?

65
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,730
You had Nadal executed,
Supreme Leader.

66
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,189
Why did <i>I</i> do that?

67
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:01,988
Supreme Leader!

68
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,573
NadaL

69
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:06,993
We are just months away
from refining weapons-grade uranium,

70
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,912
and we are set
to test the missile next week.

71
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:14,459
It is too round on the top.
It needs to be pointy.

72
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,754
Round is not scary.
Pointy is scary.

73
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,006
This will put a smile
on the faces of the enemy.

74
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:23,593
They will think that it is a huge robot
dildo flying toward them.

75
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,052
No, Supreme Leader.

76
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,889
The shape of the missile top
has nothing to do with aerodynamics.

77
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,682
It is about
the payload delivery.

78
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:31,934
No. It sticks in the ground,
and then kaboom.

79
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,895
Supreme Leader,
I think perhaps

80
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:37,440
some of your information
about bombs is coming from cartoons.

81
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,859
Nonsense.
They were research films.

82
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,612
And in them,
the victims of the bomb

83
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,780
would get
very sooty faces

84
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,867
and then a see-through
version of themselves

85
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,579
started rising up towards Heaven
while playing a harp.

86
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:55,041
In this film,
just one question,

87
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:59,045
was there a duck who,
when the explosion is happens,

88
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:02,340
his bill goes
around to the back of his head,

89
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,551
and then in order to talk,
he has to put it back this way?

90
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,263
There was somebody
who suffered a deformity like that.

91
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:10,598
Okay.

92
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:14,018
I am now 100% sure
that you are watching cartoons.

93
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,312
Have you spoken to
the experts about this?

94
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,315
- Have you consulted Professor Bobeye?
- Who?

95
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,818
Professor Bobeye, the one
with the incredibly strong forearms

96
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:24,946
that are miss-sized
for his body.

97
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,448
The man you are discussing
is called Popeye.

98
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,492
- Bobeye.
- He is not a professor.

99
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:33,371
Popeye is, as the song
tells us, a sailor man.

100
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:37,250
Indulge me. For one second,
pretend that I'm an idiot.

101
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,376
Okay. I'm there.

102
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,671
And explain to me
how this bomb

103
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,549
will not land in Israel

104
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,344
and then, literally,
bounce right back and blow up Wadiya.

105
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,304
Supreme Leader,
let me explain to you.

106
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,514
You've lost me.

107
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,892
This is the missile
in Wadiya,

108
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:57,687
you push the button, "Boop!"

109
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:02,275
Israel...

110
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,948
"No!

111
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,244
Nuclear winter.

112
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,704
The reality is...

113
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,543
<i>Oy Vey!</i>

114
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,921
Us.

115
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,844
Believe me, sir, if I could make
the device even a little more pointy,

116
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,430
I would,
but I simply cannot.

117
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,518
Okay. You know what?

118
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,313
Let's just agree
to disagree, my friend.

119
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,731
Okay.

120
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:45,318
What? Why? No!

121
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,404
- Don't you remember?
- Of course I remember!

122
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:51,657
How dare you question my
memory? I remember everything!

123
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:54,577
No, I would never do that!
Never! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that.

124
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:57,288
Don't worry, it's fine.
Well done, my friend.

125
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,748
Thank you.

126
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,542
Wait! Wait!
Where are we going?

127
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:04,754
Admiral General,
what if we just tell the United Nations

128
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,172
we have no nuclear weapons?

129
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,632
They will lift
the sanctions.

130
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,967
We'll be free
to sell oil rights to the Jalabiya desert.

131
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,636
Uncle Tamir.

132
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,929
Do you not remember
what my saintly father

133
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,890
made me promise him
on his deathbed?

134
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,560
It was never
to sell Wadiya's oil.

135
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,605
You remember that
was when he gave me power

136
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,649
instead of you,
the rightful heir.

137
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,400
You've been so cool about it.

138
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:28,778
Now, let's go back
to the palace.

139
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:30,237
It's the season finale

140
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:34,033
<i>of Real Housewives
of Shachahmahahfalimitahlicch!</i>

141
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:38,704
Aladeen! Aladeen!

142
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,764
Death to the tyrant!

143
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,735
Looks like we need
to find a new double.

144
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,404
Because this one is...

145
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,448
You know, I don't know
if he's going to get better.

146
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,826
Oh, he's not going
to recover, sir. He's dead.

147
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,788
Send his wife some
chocolate covered almond nuts

148
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,791
in a cellophane wrapped box.
Delicious.

149
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,920
We're going to send
your wife some almonds.

150
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,214
Chocolate covered
versions of these.

151
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,346
Maroush, I think I dropped
an almond in his head.

152
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,848
Can you take it out?

153
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,727
What I don't want to do is
send the body to the family

154
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,521
and then they discover
an almond in his head,

155
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,982
and they say,
"Why is there an almond in his head?"

156
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,233
Take it out.

157
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:52,528
Clean it!

158
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,613
How am I gonna eat that?

159
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:59,410
- Don't eat it.
- Oh, Maroush!

160
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,705
Listen, everything
is gonna be just fine.

161
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:04,582
I don't want you to
worry about anything.

162
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,877
Yeah, how 'bout looking in my eye
when I'm speaking to you?

163
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,797
It's very rude not to look at somebody in
the eye when they're talking to you.

164
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,884
It's okay. Don't worry.
You're having a rough day.

165
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,229
We shot the wrong man.

166
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,858
I can fix this. I have a new
plan. We need to find a new double.

167
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,903
One that is simple enough to
be manipulated completely.

168
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,920
I think we found
what you are looking for.

169
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,473
You think this man
looks like me?

170
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,267
You have
a very big barn.

171
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:09,063
You must have
many happy goats, hmm?

172
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,482
What the fuck
does that even mean?

173
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:16,070
Uncle Tamir,
this thing is an idiot.

174
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,072
What makes you think
he can do the job?

175
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,076
May I remind you that his only real job is
to be shot in the head.

176
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,412
Very well. Put him
through the process, okay?

177
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,207
Clip his nails,
file his teeth,

178
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,085
bleach his skin,
and shorten the penis.

179
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,424
Megan! Megan!

180
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,427
You now have herpes.

181
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,849
Megan, you were
worth every penny.

182
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,685
You were super hot.

183
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,270
Is my jet ready?

184
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:52,439
Yes, but do you
want to stay the night?

185
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,275
You know, I really
want to do some cuddling.

186
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,526
No. Your time is up.

187
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,611
I have to be
with the Italian Prime Minister tomorrow.

188
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,322
Okay. Maroush,
give the goodie bag!

189
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:01,740
Thanks.

190
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,242
I trust
everything is in there,

191
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,035
as your manager requested?

192
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,204
Katy Perry said she got
a diamond Rolex.

193
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,957
That's because she let me
Aladeen in her face.

194
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,961
Okay.

195
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,297
Right. Are you sure you don't want
to stay for some cuddles?

196
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,381
- No.
- But, please.

197
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,966
I really want
someone to cuddle.

198
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,199
<i>Breaking news now.
Just moments ago,</i>

199
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,450
<i>the U. N. Security
Council voted</i>

200
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,911
<i>to authorize NATO
air strikes against Wadiya,</i>

201
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:33,207
<i>unless Admiral General Aladeen
agrees to address the U. N. in person.</i>

202
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,209
<i>And now, the world waits.</i>

203
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,543
<i>What will Aladeen do next?</i>

204
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:01,151
Next. No, no, no. No. Boring,
boring. Come on. Come on.

205
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,613
Beloved Oppressor,
I have just received disturbing news

206
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:07,032
<i>Welcome
to the Munich Olympics.</i>

207
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,701
<i>Shalom?</i>

208
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,036
<i>Oy vey!</i>

209
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,788
Supreme Leader,

210
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,164
the United Nations
demands that

211
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,543
you address their concerns
about our nuclear program,

212
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,795
or they will vote to
authorize military action.

213
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:21,797
Summon my generals.

214
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,632
I'll join you after
I finish this level.

215
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,634
<i>Bonus round. Mass grave.</i>

216
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:42,568
Those gangsters at the UN
want me to address them.

217
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,613
Fine! I'll address them like they've
never been addressed before.

218
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,073
How much time
have they allotted me?

219
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,742
Seven minutes, sir.

220
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,536
I'll talk for 14 hours!

221
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,748
And three of those
will be untranslatable.

222
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,249
Literally, baby noises.

223
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,547
Okay. Let's rehearse this.
Role play, role play.

224
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,674
You, come on.
This'll be fun.

225
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,802
So, Secretary General,
your soldiers will weep...

226
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:13,474
I'm so sorry!
Listen, it was not my fault.

227
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:16,101
I mean, somebody had
set the safety catch

228
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,020
to "Aladeen"
instead of "Aladeen."

229
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,355
Look, I mean,
this whole gun...

230
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,525
It's gonna be fine.
You just need to ice it.

231
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,068
You got to ice.

232
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,737
Promise me
you're going to ice?

233
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,113
Okay. Tamir!

234
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,616
Inflate my neck pillow

235
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,077
and pack my book
of medium-level Sudoku.

236
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,331
We're going to America!

237
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,484
America!

238
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,071
The birthplace of AIDS.

239
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:17,246
Supreme Leader, I took the liberty
of hiring some extra security.

240
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,831
This is Mr. Clayton.

241
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:22,042
Admiral General,
I am here for your protection 24/7.

242
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,210
Okay.

243
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,880
But in the interest of full disclosure, I
have to say I hate A-rabs.

244
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,883
Well, that's fine,
because I'm not an Arab.

245
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,929
Well, you're
all A-rabs to me, the blacks, the Jews,

246
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,765
those blue tree-hugging
queers in A-vatar.

247
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,771
In fact, anyone from outside of
America is technically an A-rab.

248
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,023
Listen, while you're here,

249
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:48,402
I highly recommend a visit
to the Empire State Building,

250
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,572
before you or one of your
sand-monkey cousins takes it down.

251
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,701
Also, if you're interested in taking
in a Broadway show while you're here,

252
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,494
and you don't mind
the homo stuff,

253
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,830
<i>I highly recommend
Billy Elliot.</i>

254
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,417
You know what, I like this guy
despite his liberal views.

255
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,710
Very good, sir.

256
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,594
Supreme Leader, the suite has been
renovated to your specifications.

257
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,269
Twenty dollars a day
for Internet? What the fuck?

258
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:27,316
And they accuse me
of being an international criminal?

259
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,569
Beloved Oppressor,
try to get some sleep.

260
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,279
Tomorrow is
your big speech.

261
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,365
Nobody touch the minibar!
It's a fucking rip-off!

262
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,929
Rise and shine.

263
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,181
Who are you?

264
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,850
We've actually
already met.

265
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,518
Hello, Aladdin.

266
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,771
Clayton? I thought
we were friends.

267
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,357
Nice to see you, too.

268
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,026
Here's the deal.

269
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,362
I'm gonna kill you,
and then I'm gonna burn your body.

270
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,571
No,no,no.
Please, don't.

271
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:18,825
But before I do I have
one very important question for you.

272
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,578
<i>Did you get a chance
to see Billy Elliot?</i>

273
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,164
Yes.

274
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,374
And?

275
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,210
I found it heartwarming
and life-affirming.

276
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,047
Thank you!
How great is that show?

277
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,632
It is.
It's great, yeah.

278
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,218
You know, he's got like
an artist inside himself,

279
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:40,055
but he's in this working class place
and no one understands him.

280
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,141
He's just like...
I'm gonna express myself in my dance.

281
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,643
And he expresses himself...

282
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,772
And he doesn't wanna use violence,
but he puts his violence into his dance.

283
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,148
You should try that.

284
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,653
Okay. So, we gotta get down
to business. Enough chit-chat.

285
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,238
I'm being paid to kill you.

286
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,031
But I'm gonna
torture you for free.

287
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,162
Are you serious?

288
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,580
Where'd you get
those relics?

289
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,250
From the Shah of Iran's
garage sale?

290
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,668
Yeah, right.

291
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,169
I mean, I know there's
nothing more annoying

292
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,754
than a backseat torturer,
but, please, come on.

293
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,423
This is great stuff.

294
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,926
It's not great stuff.
That's like 1972, hello.

295
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:23,181
You won't be talking
so much smack with this up your butt.

296
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,852
That's the Anal Umbrella.
It's a good device, I grant you,

297
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,854
but where's
the splash guard?

298
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,897
You're going to kill me
and your white shirt.

299
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,941
It didn't come
with a splash guard.

300
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,027
You're gonna get chara
on your trousers.

301
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,195
I can see it has
a screw hole for one.

302
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,697
Apparently,
I didn't get it.

303
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,074
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,

304
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,368
check out this bad boy.

305
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,912
Oh, that's not bad.
The Kandahar Cock Wrench.

306
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,372
Okay, so, now
we're getting somewhere.

307
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:50,292
It's actually been banned in Saudi
Arabia for being too safe.

308
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,795
You know,
this is totally depressing.

309
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,464
Listen, just show me
another one.

310
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,300
You know, honestly, I don't even want
to show you anything any more.

311
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,302
Don't be like that.

312
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,804
You know, I don't even think
you want to be tortured.

313
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,222
I don't want
to be tortured.

314
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,557
You're just, like,
taking all the fun out of it!

315
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,809
You just want me to say
compliments all the time.

316
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,812
So either you want the truth
or you want compliments. Decide!

317
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,399
It'd be nice if I got just a little bit
of positive feedback about my tools.

318
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,359
What else you got?
I'm gonna love the next thing!

319
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,569
I will be supportive.

320
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,154
All right.

321
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,032
Just this. This pours
hot fire out on you.

322
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,201
Oh,
the Fallujah Firehose!

323
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,036
Someone's got
a friend in Syria!

324
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,579
I am pretty proud of it.

325
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,247
There is a new model,
you know.

326
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,792
I've got one that
works by Bluetooth.

327
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,420
Screw it. Screw it!
Screw it!

328
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,047
I'm going to enjoy this now.

329
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,882
No, don't. Don't.
Don't. Please, don't!

330
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,310
No one will recognize
the body without this!

331
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,813
The Supreme Beard!
You will be cursed!

332
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:54,022
No, no, don't do it!

333
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,899
Come on!
Why won't this catch?

334
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:59,820
You foolish man! There is no earthly
fire that could ever light...

335
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,115
The flames
of the righteous attack the unjust!

336
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,878
I'll be back with help!
J.K.! Just kidding!

337
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,718
My Speech.

338
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,557
Yo!
Average American shopper!

339
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,725
I do not have
any money on me,

340
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,185
but if you give me
your clothes

341
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,397
I'll make a sizeable donation
in your name to al-Qaeda.

342
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,947
Hey, hey, oh, oh!
Aladeen has got to go!

343
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,617
Hey, hey, oh, oh!
Aladeen has got to go!

344
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,288
Hello. I am
Admiral General Aladeen.

345
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,582
I am here to
deliver my speech to the United Nations.

346
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,500
Look, Admiral,
it's too hot for crazy.

347
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,793
How dare you?

348
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,004
Listen, Tamir is
coming right now.

349
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,423
You're going to
be in big trouble. Here he is.

350
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,216
Tamir! Tamir!

351
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,352
Tamir, it was you, you snake!

352
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,900
He's not the
legitimate leader!

353
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,818
He's not
the legitimate leader!

354
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:25,155
He's not the
legitimate leader!

355
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:29,492
You have rehearsed the
speech I prepared for you?

356
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:32,579
Yes. But when is
the General coming?

357
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:33,997
He's feeling ill.

358
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,333
<i>Does he have worms in his shilshul?</i>

359
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,584
Very possibly.

360
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,670
Admiral General Aladeen
preparing

361
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,839
<i>to address the General
Assembly of the United Nations.</i>

362
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,924
<i>An historic moment.</i>

363
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,675
<i>He's approaching the podium.</i>

364
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,261
<i>And he's walked
right past the podium.</i>

365
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,429
What is he doing?

366
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,848
You are making
a fool out of me!

367
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,184
Let's bring in Denise,
our U.N. correspondent.

368
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,477
What do you make of that?

369
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,188
Well, I have to say,
he's got their attention.

370
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,690
<i>Every eye in the room
is on him right now.</i>

371
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,193
<i>And he's returning
to the podium.</i>

372
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,862
<i>And he's fallen
off the stage.</i>

373
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,614
<i>What do you make
of that, Denise?</i>

374
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:12,535
You know, he's clearly implying that the
U.N. must fall before him.

375
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,455
<i>Drinking from the
pitcher of water directly,</i>

376
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,083
<i>as opposed to
the glass that I'm sure must be up there.</i>

377
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,209
<i>What do you think
that means?</i>

378
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,336
<i>Again, it's another
attempt to say,</i>

379
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,630
<i>"Listen, I'm not going
to play by your rules. "</i>

380
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,382
<i>And he seems to have
a pitcher of urine out.</i>

381
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,134
<i>I believe he just
urinated in the pitcher.</i>

382
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,554
<i>He is now drinking
his urine.</i>

383
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,473
<i>It looks to be
his own urine.</i>

384
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,266
Sorry. You want?

385
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,852
Trying to force it
on the Israeli delegation.

386
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,854
<i>That might be
the ambassador.</i>

387
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,942
<i>He is dumping the urine
on the Israeli delegation.</i>

388
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,443
Oh, that's a good one.

389
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,114
Okay, he's returning
to the podium.

390
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:54,035
Much has been made
of the hostility between our countries.

391
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,871
With the help
of the U.M.,

392
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:00,542
I will draft a new
constitution for Wadiya

393
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:05,880
and sign it in five days,
on Wadiya's Independence Day.

394
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,215
No,no,no.

395
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,217
<i>This new constitution</i>

396
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,094
<i>will end the dictatorship...</i>

397
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,178
No!

398
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,724
...And it will
turn Wadiya into a

399
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,559
democracy.

400
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,897
No! Democracy? Never!

401
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:24,983
Never!

402
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:29,237
The Wadiyan people
love being oppressed!

403
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,532
Dictatorship forever!

404
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,374
Come on! Come with me!

405
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,209
Hurry!

406
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,884
Hello, person. Person.

407
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,469
Black person.

408
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,804
The double that
you found is good.

409
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,639
He is almost as dumb
as the real guy.

410
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,392
So, Wadiya will
become a democracy.

411
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,062
China is a democracy,
too.

412
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,774
Once that constitution
is signed,

413
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:09,069
I will be able
to sell Wadiya's oil rights. Gazprom,

414
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,696
you will have control of
Wadiya's southern oil fields.

415
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,573
B.P., you will
control the north.

416
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,075
Exxon, you will have
all offshore rights,

417
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,410
provided you do not
use B.P.'s drilling rigs.

418
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:21,498
And, Mr. Lao of PetroChina, you will
have the lease on our shale reserves.

419
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,541
Some of those reserves are
in densely populated areas.

420
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,252
Then unpopulate them.

421
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:29,631
After you've paid me
my 30% finder's fee, of course.

422
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,424
Gentlemen.

423
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,428
So, you're going
to make billions.

424
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,514
What will you do
with all those dollars?

425
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:41,643
I will buy the house on Lake Como
next to George Clooney's.

426
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:43,812
I love George Clooney!

427
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,939
He's an old-fashioned
movie star.

428
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,816
He gay?
He suck my dick?

429
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:52,278
No, those are just rumors.
Are you a homosexual?

430
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,115
No, no, no, it's more
of a power trip with me.

431
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:56,741
Everybody has a price.

432
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,911
Tommy Lee Jones let me roll it in my
fingers for two hundred grand!

433
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,796
Oh, my gosh,
that was so crazy!

434
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,298
I am so honored
to be able to help you.

435
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,551
Finally, somebody
who knows who I am.

436
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,052
Yeah, of course!

437
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,806
You're the Wadiyan dissident who was
standing up to that asshole Aladeen.

438
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,808
It was so brave of you.

439
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:24,144
- My name is Zoey.
- I don't care.

440
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:25,353
What's yours?

441
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,314
My name is Ala...son.

442
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,650
- Allison?
- Right. Allison.

443
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,819
What's your last name?

444
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,073
Burgers.

445
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,909
Nice to meet you,
Allison Burgers.

446
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,703
- You know, I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

447
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,124
Allison, could you
please take your hands off my breasts?

448
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,543
Those are breasts?
I thought you were a boy.

449
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,757
- Where are you taking me to?
- To Brooklyn!

450
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,311
So, yeah,
this is my store!

451
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,854
This is the Free
Earth Collective.

452
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,441
We are a vegan, feminist,
non-profit cooperative operating

453
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,776
within an anti-racist,
anti-oppressive framework

454
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,528
for people of
all or no genders.

455
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,948
We are
a pure democracy,

456
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,117
just like Wadiya's
going to be soon!

457
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,161
Get me clothes,
little man.

458
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,205
Oh, you know what, there's some in
the Earthquake Relief box

459
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,831
in the lesbian bathroom,
right there.

460
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,124
Right.

461
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,628
So, Allison,
we're the only store in New York,

462
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,922
other than that fascist
superchain Green World,

463
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,007
that sells your nation's
specialty fruit, mafroom,

464
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,551
which I know
you people eat a lot of.

465
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,678
Oh, I hope that didn't come off
like a cultural stereotype.

466
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,223
Because I'm, like,
the furthest thing from a racist.

467
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:46,184
I pretty much haven't
had a white boyfriend since high school.

468
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,228
Well, the darker races
are less choosy.

469
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,856
Okay, that came off
as kind of offensive.

470
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,441
Thank you.

471
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,694
Anyway, let me give
you the grand tour.

472
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:59,614
Up on the roof,
we have this amazing organic garden...

473
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:02,450
Boring! Do you sell
any assault rifles?

474
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,536
Oh, wait. I got it.
Humor. Right?

475
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:08,289
I took a feminist
clown workshop once.

476
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,583
Help! Help! I'm trapped
under a glass ceiling!

477
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,585
What the fuck?

478
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,837
I wasn't the best
student, but...

479
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,382
We've got this wellness center
downstairs in the basement,

480
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:20,760
where we do water birth.
Have you ever seen a water birth?

481
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,388
Not a water birth,
but I've seen a water death.

482
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,139
Wow. Was it moving?

483
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,183
There was actually
very little movement.

484
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:30,311
A little wriggling,
then two bubbles, and then a big bloop

485
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:31,688
and the wallet floats up.

486
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,565
You seem educated.

487
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,442
Yes.
I went to Amherst.

488
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,778
I love it when
women go to school.

489
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:41,864
It's like seeing
a monkey on rollerskates.

490
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:45,118
It means nothing to them,
but it's so adorable for us.

491
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,620
Okay. Well, hey, Allison,

492
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,957
you know, we'd love to have you work
here if you ever wanted to.

493
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,211
All of our employees
are political refugees, just like you!

494
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,462
There's Hannah over here.

495
00:29:56,587 --> 00:30:00,466
She's from El Salvador. She's a really
useful member of our team.

496
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:05,555
Useful as what?
A coat hanger?

497
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,641
- Come on.
- Allison, that's not funny.

498
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:11,978
Okay. I tell you what,
get back to work, Captain Hook!

499
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,480
-"Captain Hook." It's funny.
- No, it's not funny.

500
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:15,732
Who's that?

501
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:16,983
Oh, this is Joteph.

502
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,485
He's from a Sudanese tribe
that has no concept of money.

503
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,988
His entire village
was ransacked.

504
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,322
Hey, Sub-Saharan!

505
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:28,161
Do you think you could get me 100
child soldiers here by 5:00 p.m.?

506
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,287
No!

507
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,663
Okay. Time out! Time out.

508
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:31,956
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

509
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,916
Shave your under-the-arms!

510
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,086
I dread to think what kind of jungle
you have on your malawach!

511
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,921
That is very inappropriate.

512
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,924
Don't tell me what
to say and what not to say, little boy.

513
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,260
You need to put
that finger away.

514
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,720
I won't put my
finger away because...

515
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,305
Look, I've got
two fingers now.

516
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:48,431
Okay.

517
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:52,101
If you do not stop using hateful
language, you cannot work here.

518
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,479
All right. I promise.

519
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:55,772
Okay.

520
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,776
I tricked you,
Wolverina.

521
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,780
Justin Bieber's
chubby double!

522
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,867
Hairy Potter!

523
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,460
Good-bye, old friend.

524
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,968
When will the Supreme
Leader be better?

525
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,095
In time.

526
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:31,599
He's resting in his bedroom
and must never, ever be disturbed.

527
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,518
Time for bed.

528
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,858
Being Aladeen has its perks,
does it not?

529
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,696
Dropped your belt.

530
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,172
What are you doing?

531
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,465
She tried to milk me!

532
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:05,716
No.

533
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,136
They are trying
to pleasure you.

534
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,055
Allow the girls to use
their many talents.

535
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,732
No!

536
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:24,318
Supreme Leader!
The girls!

537
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:27,321
Girls, show him
your bosoms.

538
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:56,851
Let me in! I have
85 rooms at this hotel!

539
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,020
It's me, Admiral
General Aladeen!

540
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,396
I lost my beard!

541
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,106
You don't got a pass,
you don't get in.

542
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,526
But I'm staying here! I paid twenty
dollars for the fucking Internet!

543
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,197
How much do you charge
for assassinations?

544
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,636
Why is this
happening to me?

545
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,890
All I ever did was
steal my country's wealth

546
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:39,393
and execute anybody
who did not agree with me,

547
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,145
and many who did.

548
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:42,897
Why me?

549
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:47,026
Why is it always
the good guys? Why?

550
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,243
Nadal?

551
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,624
Welcome to
the Death to Aladeen Restaurant.

552
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,086
Wait. You look
very familiar.

553
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,754
Do I know you?

554
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,216
Sorry.

555
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:53,634
Sorry.

556
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,219
So sorry, Supreme Leader.

557
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,221
Don't worry.
I'm 50% to blame.

558
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,101
No! No! Supreme Leader!

559
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:04,937
Definitely not.
I must be going.

560
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,147
No, no. Stay, please.

561
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,566
If you hate Aladeen
and you like good food,

562
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,652
this is the place for you.
This way. Here we go.

563
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,668
Enjoy it.

564
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,631
No! No!

565
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,357
For you.

566
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:51,817
What is your name?

567
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,444
Allison Burgers.

568
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,989
That's a made-up name.
What's your real name?

569
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:01,744
Ladis.

570
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,079
Ladis what?

571
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,373
Ladis Washerum.

572
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,587
So your name
is like the sign. "Ladies Washroom"?

573
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,381
That is a made-up name.

574
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,299
What is your real name?

575
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:18,511
I am interested.
We are interested.

576
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,766
Emploice.

577
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:25,434
Emploice what?

578
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,187
Emploice...Muswashans.

579
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,274
That is a made-up name.

580
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:35,694
Okay.

581
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,905
What is your real name?

582
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:39,865
Max.

583
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:41,242
Max what?

584
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,204
Imumoccupancyu
One-hundred-and-twenty.

585
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,501
There's a number in the name?

586
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,212
Who are you?
An Aladeen sympathizer?

587
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:56,173
No,no,no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. No, no, no!

588
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:57,258
No!

589
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,760
It's Aladeen!
It's Aladeen without the beard!

590
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,887
No! It's not Aladeen!

591
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:03,806
Hasan, lock the door!

592
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,353
Wait, wait, wait, no!
There you are, cousin!

593
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:12,148
This is my cousin.
I see you've all met him.

594
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:15,151
He's very simple
and backwards. I'm sorry.

595
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,360
- Sorry.
- It's okay, sit.

596
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:17,778
- Okay.
- Sit and eat.

597
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,613
Have a seat, cousin.

598
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,616
Very sorry.
My apologies. Enjoy.

599
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:25,911
What are you doing here?
And what has happened to your beard?

600
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,540
I've been replaced by this body
double who's a total imbecile.

601
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:31,292
How are you alive?

602
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:34,128
How am I... Wait.
You don't know?

603
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,337
No.

604
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:38,799
Every single person
you had executed is still alive.

605
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,218
We all live here
in Little Wadiya.

606
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:43,762
The executioner, he is
a member of the Resistance!

607
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:45,347
You mean I never
executed anybody?

608
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,474
No.

609
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,559
Like, honestly, zero people.

610
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:54,398
Nadal, you must help me
get back into power.

611
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,317
What? No.
Why would I do that?

612
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,777
I have a perfectly
good job here. I'm a Mac Genius!

613
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,614
What do you do?

614
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:06,952
Mostly, I clean
semen out of laptops.

615
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,206
Congratulations.
Living the American dream.

616
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:13,417
Okay, fine. I will help you.
On one condition.

617
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,752
Name it.

618
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,462
You reinstate me
as Head of Nuclear Research,

619
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,839
so I can finish
building my bomb.

620
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:20,216
Deal.

621
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,676
One last thing.

622
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,429
You will let me build
a round nuclear weapon.

623
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,015
Never. It must be pointy.

624
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,684
- Wait a minute. This is...
- Whoa.

625
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:34,480
Okay, compromise. Conical.

626
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,315
- Round. Round.
- Teat-shaped.

627
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,651
Okay.

628
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,277
- Okay. Deal.
- Deal.

629
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:45,449
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

630
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:48,744
our Supreme Leader
is indisposed to answer your questions

631
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:52,748
as he is currently
drafting Wadiya's new constitution,

632
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,084
which is scheduled
to be signed

633
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:58,254
at the Lancaster Penthouse
Ballroom in three days.

634
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,005
Thank you.
No further questions.

635
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,480
There is no way we're going to
get anywhere near this hotel

636
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,941
without a security pass.
This is ridiculous.

637
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:21,360
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

638
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,612
Hiding from that
lesbian hobbit.

639
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:25,197
That woman,
you know her?

640
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,408
I cannot begin to tell you
what an honor it is

641
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,368
to be able to provide
all of the catering...

642
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,744
Well, of course.

643
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,121
...And the <i>mafroom</i>
for this signing.

644
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,872
You just paid
this month's rent!

645
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,000
She offered me a job.

646
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,836
Can you imagine that?
Me? Working?

647
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:42,381
Listen, hold onto that badge. It's the only
thing that'll get you past security.

648
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,424
Okay, thanks.

649
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:44,967
Wait a minute.

650
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:49,179
Wait, her company is catering the
event. She has a security pass!

651
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,557
That is the answer.
This is the plan.

652
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,143
Okay? You will take that
job and you will work for her.

653
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,313
I will get you
an identical beard and costume.

654
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:58,814
And then on
the day of the event,

655
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,984
you enter the Lancaster
as a member of her staff.

656
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,069
You will find the double,
switch with him,

657
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:06,613
then rip up the constitution
in front of the whole world.

658
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:10,284
Me? Work for that
hairy titted yeti?

659
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:28,385
Kimberly?

660
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,220
Zoey.

661
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:31,513
Who cares?

662
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:34,516
I've come here
to apologize

663
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:38,187
about some of the comments
I may have made about

664
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:40,314
Captain Hook and Blackie.

665
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,275
Great!

666
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,903
And I accept your job offer
as general manager.

667
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:48,030
Well, you can't be the manager,
because I am the manager.

668
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:49,490
Well, I can
if I killed you.

669
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,244
I think I'm starting
to get you.

670
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:56,455
All right, then...
I will get you.

671
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,041
Great!
Let's get you to work!

672
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,126
Yeah?
Hold on one second.

673
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:04,004
Hey, my man!
Excuse me. Hairnet!

674
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,130
Yeah.

675
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,133
I need a little of the
quinoa salad, please,

676
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:11,136
and throw a couple of
extra cranny-b's on top, if you could,

677
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:14,139
and I kind of need you
to hurry up, chief. Chop-chop.

678
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,268
Next!

679
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,147
Whoa, whoa!
Occupied!

680
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,525
Out. I have to clean.
Come on, out you go, out you go.

681
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:25,901
- What? You're hurting me!
- Out. Come on.

682
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:29,405
Hey, Allison,
can you take out the garbage? Thanks.

683
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:39,957
Look! One of the
customers left a tip of

684
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:44,628
some Nair and some female razors.
Does anybody want to use it?

685
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,093
Stop that.

686
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,387
Suck it, loser.

687
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,728
Clean-up on aisle four!

688
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,034
Hey, buddy, I saw that.

689
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:18,454
That is very disrespectful
to your leader.

690
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:19,746
Whatever, dude.
Who are you,

691
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,291
Osama bin Laden's
best friend?

692
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,002
No, he is not
my best friend!

693
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,879
Though he has been staying
in my guest house

694
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,047
ever since they shot
his double last year.

695
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,967
Now the guy won't leave.

696
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,261
I know why this guy's
the most hated man in the world.

697
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,346
You just have to go
to the bathroom after him.

698
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:38,390
You go to the bathroom
after Osama,

699
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:41,226
you will realize
the true meaning of terrorism.

700
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:01,705
Here is the plan.

701
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,540
We're going to take
this helicopter tour

702
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:06,084
and fly over
the Lancaster to spot its weaknesses.

703
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:10,005
Remember, we're just two
ordinary American tourists

704
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:12,341
looking at the sights.

705
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:15,844
Don't worry, nobody gonna suspect
anything. It's a great plan, pointy.

706
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:17,804
Don't do anything
to arouse any suspicions.

707
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:20,724
Don't worry.
I am Wadiya's number one actor.

708
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,477
You don't win four
Wadiyan Golden Globes for nothing.

709
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,896
Yes, you do,
because you gave them to yourself!

710
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:29,066
<i>My performance in
Aladeen Jones and the Temple of Doom</i>

711
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,192
was outstanding.

712
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,652
I give it thumbs down.

713
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:33,445
<i>Have you seen
You've Got Mail Bomb?</i>

714
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:36,406
Yes, I've seen them all!
They're all terrible movies!

715
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,866
Listen to me. Okay?

716
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:40,035
You are a terrible actor.

717
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:44,248
I urge you, right now,
keep your performance small and real.

718
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,250
All right, can you
get me a cloak?

719
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,334
VVhy?

720
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,169
Because I think
my guy would be wearing a cloak.

721
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:53,465
No, your guy wears an American flag
sweatsuit and a sheriff's badge.

722
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:54,550
I need the sheriff's badge.

723
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,051
For what?

724
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,427
You're sheriff
of American douche-town!

725
00:43:58,178 --> 00:43:59,179
That's rude.

726
00:43:59,263 --> 00:44:00,264
Listen.

727
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:04,226
We're going to walk over
there, act very inconspicuous.

728
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:05,727
- Okay. No problem.
- This has to work.

729
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,521
Don't worry.
Just relax.

730
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,275
Are you okay?

731
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:12,693
My guy has a limp.

732
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:16,280
I fell off me horse
at the old Bull & Bush Pub

733
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:17,531
because
I am a cockney.

734
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:18,865
Listen! Listen, okay?

735
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,743
You need to focus up right now
and be prepared

736
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,121
to deliver a small,
subtle performance.

737
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:25,622
- Okay, great, okay.
- Okay, good.

738
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,249
Okay. So, when
we go to fly...

739
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,001
Don't do that
with your eyes!

740
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:30,752
You can't be
a Chinese person on this thing, okay?

741
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:32,129
I'm not chink,
I'm Chinese-American!

742
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:33,297
No, but you cannot
hold your eyes!

743
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,590
Nobody is going to think
you're Chinese-American

744
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:35,632
because you hold
your eyes like that!

745
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:37,175
It's racist,
what you are doing!

746
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,803
Do you know it's a fact
that they cannot pronounce their R's?

747
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,054
They pronounce them
as L's.

748
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:43,015
So instead you know
what "rabbit" is in Chinese?

749
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:44,224
I don't know
how to speak Chinese.

750
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:46,518
- It's "labbit."
- It's not "labbit"!

751
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:49,229
<i>Yes! Who Shot Loger Labbit
was a huge hit in China!</i>

752
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:50,314
Nobody...
It's stup...

753
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:51,440
All right, I don't care.
This is stupid, okay?

754
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:54,484
Okay, I'll do Filipino.
I like to work, I like to talk.

755
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:55,819
- Doni
- I like the shit, I do the kids.

756
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:56,903
Stop that.

757
00:44:57,738 --> 00:45:00,490
Your Filipino
is the same as your Chinese!

758
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:02,367
Now who's being a lacist?

759
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,911
- You're being lacist now.
- I'm not being racist!

760
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:06,663
Right now we have to
get on this helicopter

761
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,915
and we have to act
like true Americans.

762
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,792
I guess you don't want me
to play black then.

763
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:13,253
Of course I don't want you
to play black.

764
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,088
Okay. Just throwing it
out there.

765
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,757
Okay. Don't.

766
00:45:18,008 --> 00:45:19,092
Okay, don't do that.

767
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,094
- I see what you're doing.
- That's how they walk.

768
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:22,137
I see what you're doing,
it's not cool.

769
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:23,263
It's how they walk.

770
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,071
I love being
an Americans!

771
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,656
America is number one!

772
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,451
Oh, lam from U.S.A.!

773
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:46,912
My father also
from U.S.A.

774
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:51,375
My great-grandfather fought
in the American Civil Jihad.

775
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,711
I am very proud
to be an American.

776
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:57,422
I am America's
number one douche.

777
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,761
I've fooled them. Job done.

778
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:06,390
So, how are things back at the Palace?

779
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,602
Fine, but guess
who's still living in my guest house?

780
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:12,646
Ooh, Bin Laden?

781
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:15,357
Yes, Osama.

782
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,068
Bin Laden flooding the bathroom
every time he showers...

783
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:22,030
And how hard is it to put a bath mat
down, Bin Laden?

784
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:27,035
Hey, do you remember
my favorite sports car?

785
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,662
You mean your Porsche?

786
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:30,247
Yes... the 911.

787
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,749
911, it's the best!

788
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:37,337
So I was driving my 911 near the
palace one day...

789
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,631
and I totally crashed!

790
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,012
It's ok, I've already ordered a new one.

791
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:49,015
A brand new 9112012.

792
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:54,354
You know, while you are here, you
should try to see some of the sights...

793
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:57,566
such as the Empire State Building...

794
00:46:57,649 --> 00:47:00,527
and Yankee Stadium.

795
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:05,198
And I'd love to see the fireworks
over the Statue of Liberty.

796
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:12,372
Hey, have your old back problems been
bothering you?

797
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:16,168
Oh, it's been terrible! It got so bad that
I made myself a back brace.

798
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:20,797
- Really?
- Yes, look, I'm still wearing it.

799
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:24,843
Hey, my English is getting good...

800
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:28,555
...I bet I can count down from five
faster than you can!

801
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:30,807
Five, four,
three, two, one!

802
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,523
Allison! Are you okay?

803
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,066
I... Yes.

804
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,777
You know what?
You people, you make me sick!

805
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:45,322
You see a Middle Easterner
on an aircraft

806
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:48,450
and you just assume
that he's hatching some violent plot?

807
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:53,079
Allison Burgers is a persecuted
dissident, not a murderous madman!

808
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:55,999
He was reported saying, "Let's take out
the guards at the Lancaster."

809
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,543
Guess what?
We deliver to the Lancaster!

810
00:47:58,627 --> 00:47:59,628
Good one!

811
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,797
Maybe he wanted to
take the guards out for a falafel!

812
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:04,132
That's a bit
of a stereotype,

813
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:07,344
but I get the idea.
Great idea! Yeah. You...

814
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:10,430
You know what?
Is it a crime to care about your job?

815
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:11,681
Yeah! Well,
it is in Wadiya.

816
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:15,268
Where did you get your diversity
and sensitivity training, huh?

817
00:48:15,352 --> 00:48:16,561
The Stasi?

818
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:20,649
Let's see how you feel about racial
profiling when white people...

819
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:34,788
And I know
what I'm talking about

820
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:37,415
because I majored
in Fem Lit!

821
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,459
Come on.

822
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:42,796
Hey! What are you doing?
Where are you going?

823
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:43,880
Don't worry!

824
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:46,049
Just suck the fatoot
of the biggest guy, you'll be fine.

825
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,133
You're really
fucking me here, man!

826
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,471
The police here
are such fascists!

827
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:52,681
Yeah, right,
and not in a good way.

828
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:54,391
It just makes me so mad!

829
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:57,227
You know, Zoey,
you were great back there.

830
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,937
Thanks. I just...

831
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:01,106
I don't know,
I just feel so sorry

832
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,566
that wherever
you go in the world,

833
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,317
you're the victim
of police abuse.

834
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:05,485
Well, not always the victim.

835
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:09,948
Come here.
I'm just so sorry! You're okay now.

836
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:11,283
All right?

837
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:13,743
And I'm not gonna
let anything bad happen to you.

838
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:15,537
You know what? Let's get you
back to the collective, okay?

839
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,289
Come on.

840
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:18,373
No, a bit more.

841
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:20,292
Okay.

842
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,961
- Come on, let's go. I need to go to work.
- I feel so sad!

843
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:25,714
Let's do another hug, okay?

844
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,507
Allison, why are you sad?

845
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,010
The brutality?

846
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:32,095
Did you suffer
from sexual abuse?

847
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:35,307
Yes, they raped me in
a very unprofessional way.

848
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,643
Oh, no.
We have to get you to the Rape Center.

849
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:40,562
You have a center
for rape here?

850
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,897
Great! I'd love to go!
Maybe another time, you know.

851
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:46,276
Hire a limo, have some
cocktails, bring my raping shoes.

852
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:56,328
Can you get me that one?

853
00:49:57,537 --> 00:49:58,538
Which one?

854
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:00,790
The one with
the "fuck-me hooves."

855
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,835
You're bizzare. I'm going to have
to change the channels now.

856
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:07,088
<i>...Tour from hell
for an Ohio couple earlier today when,</i>

857
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,465
<i>...with shades of 9/11,</i>

858
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:11,593
<i>their helicopter tour
of the Manhattan skyline was cut short</i>

859
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:15,805
<i>by what police are now
calling a "terrorism misunderstanding"</i>

860
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:19,726
<i>involving a man named
Emer Gencyexitonly.</i>

861
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:21,519
Etra.

862
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,397
We have a problem.

863
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:31,821
Hannah, that guy from the
Lancaster's coming tomorrow morning,

864
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:33,698
so why don't you take
the mafroom downstairs

865
00:50:33,782 --> 00:50:35,784
and make some sort of
a nice display?

866
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:38,453
I just want everything
to be perfect.

867
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:40,163
Zoey?

868
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,414
Allison. Hi.

869
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,167
To thank you for what you did
today at the police station,

870
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,503
I have decided to
bestow upon you a gift.

871
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,214
- That's sweet. What is it?
- Yeah.

872
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:59,265
I don't know
what that is.

873
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:02,143
It's fine.
Please, gobble up my little mouse.

874
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:04,187
Snack on my
tiny raisin.

875
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:05,897
Give her
a mouth bath. Go.

876
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:09,901
Oh! No!

877
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:13,446
No, I am not
going to do that.

878
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,990
I'm getting a lot of this
and not much of this...

879
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,830
Listen, I understand
that you're having urges, okay?

880
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:22,956
Right.

881
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,625
But you need to
take care of them by yourself.

882
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,752
Myself? What? How?

883
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:29,546
You need to
touch yourself.

884
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,382
I don't touch myself.
Do you touch yourself?

885
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:35,009
I think most
healthy people do, yes.

886
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:38,430
Yeah, you touch your own
malawach? Disgusting! Yuck!

887
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:39,597
Yuck!

888
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:43,268
Stop joking, all right?
You've never jerked off?

889
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,855
Okay, come with me.

890
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,940
Where are you taking me to?
The Rape Center?

891
00:51:52,986 --> 00:51:54,487
This is silly.

892
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,156
Okay...

893
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:59,576
Take your penis out
and put it in your hands.

894
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:00,702
This is silly.

895
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:06,624
Now, slowly move your hand
up and down.

896
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:07,792
Okay.

897
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,795
I told you already,
this is...

898
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:15,300
Wait.

899
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,552
What sorcery is this?

900
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,680
<i>Some people
wait a lifetime</i>

901
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:25,477
<i>For a moment like this</i>

902
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,813
<i>Some people
wait a lifetime</i>

903
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:31,816
<i>For a moment like this</i>

904
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:37,238
<i>Whoa, I can't believe
it's happening to me</i>

905
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:40,241
<i>Some people
wait a lifetime</i>

906
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:45,830
<i>For a moment like this</i>

907
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,797
<i>I can't believe
it's happening to me</i>

908
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:59,052
I did it!
I just jerked it completely off!

909
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:00,595
I did it all by myself!

910
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,014
With this hand right here!

911
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:06,309
I grabbed my bilbul
like I was strangling a bird.

912
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,561
And I smacked it
and I smacked it and I gave it a flick,

913
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:09,979
and out came
my own Iabeneh!

914
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,231
Zoey?

915
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:14,984
Zoey! You have
changed my life!

916
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:19,572
Give a man a vagina
and he will <i>shpichs</i> for a day.

917
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:23,368
Teach a man to use
his hand as a vagina,

918
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,411
<i>and he will shpichs
for a lifetime.</i>

919
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,997
Oh. No, no. Thank you.

920
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,417
Allison, you may need to keep
your voice down because...

921
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,462
We've got a lot of customers.
You may want to go wash up.

922
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:35,588
Fine.

923
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:38,341
Joteph, go and hose down
my Crocs.

924
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:41,844
I've done my Iabeneh
all over the wellness center.

925
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:47,517
Okay.

926
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,897
The guy from the Lancaster
is going to love this.

927
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,732
Okay.

928
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:56,276
Good night, Allison.

929
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:58,152
I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

930
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:00,905
Good night! Thank you again.

931
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,620
This is nice. Or lovely.

932
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:14,294
- Who is it?
- Nadal.

933
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:15,420
<i>What are you doing?</i>

934
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:17,130
I've discovered
this amazing thing.

935
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,048
I have to show you
how to do it.

936
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:20,967
It's called self juicing.

937
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:24,053
You put your hand
on your <i>bilbul</i> and you rub it,

938
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:26,389
<i>and then you can make
your own labeneh come out.</i>

939
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:27,849
<i>You don't have to
spend any Rolexes.</i>

940
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:29,767
<i>You don't have to give
any dirty diamonds.</i>

941
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:32,687
<i>I cannot believe I'm having this
conversation with an adult man.</i>

942
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,355
What do you mean?
You knew about this?

943
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,815
<i>Everybody knows about this.</i>

944
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:39,819
<i>We all know about this
from the age of 12, 13.</i>

945
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:41,988
Why does nobody
ever tell me anything?

946
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:44,949
<i>Because you have everybody executed
who tells you anything.</i>

947
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:47,660
Listen, I'm thinking of
revealing my true identity

948
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,662
to the hairy titted ape woman.

949
00:54:49,746 --> 00:54:51,956
Whoa! No, what?
Why would you even do that?

950
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,583
I think she'll be
cool with it.

951
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,293
<i>She will not be cool with it.</i>

952
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:58,463
<i>How is she to judge?
She shaves her armpits once a year,</i>

953
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,174
and she takes lovers
outside of her ethnic group.

954
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,259
Are my crimes any worse
than hers?

955
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,511
<i>Remember, you hate her.</i>

956
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:07,221
And everything
she stands for.

957
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:09,599
- Okay.
- I have to go now.

958
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:11,934
I despise you.

959
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:14,187
You know, sometimes you say
some very hurtful things.

960
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:15,855
Anyway, I'm going to
hang up on you.

961
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,858
No, come on. This is
like a real opportunity for me.

962
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,026
I want to hang up first.

963
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:21,819
I've hung up.
I hung up already.

964
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,782
That is your voice
doing that noise. You have not hung up.

965
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,533
I am hanging up. Click...

966
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:29,952
Nadal, are you still there?

967
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,706
- Nadal, are you still there?
- I win.

968
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,167
No wonder you're a Mac Genius.

969
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:38,503
What a fucking idiot.

970
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,594
Zoey!

971
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,309
Zoey!

972
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:57,897
Zoey.

973
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:10,243
Zoey?

974
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:13,955
Etra.

975
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:16,749
Etra...

976
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,778
Etra, is this because
you're the only virgin guard

977
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:47,029
that I left a virgin?

978
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:18,830
One, two...

979
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:21,999
Bloop.

980
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,752
Text book.

981
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:29,298
Thank you so much
for meeting me early, Mr. Ogden.

982
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:31,384
I cannot wait for you
to sample our mafroom.

983
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,344
You are gonna swear
that you're in Wadiya.

984
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:36,264
Excuse me.
What is that over there?

985
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:38,516
That is a "C"
in your window.

986
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,852
No, no, no... They're totally
biased against this. They hate us.

987
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,687
No, it's not.
I know what a "C" means.

988
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:43,980
It's not a very good...

989
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:49,569
Oh, my God!

990
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:52,196
Allison, what happened?

991
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,492
I don't know, I...

992
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:59,245
I was downstairs
self juicing.

993
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,039
All night?

994
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:03,332
Yes.

995
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:04,792
I'm sorry,
you were doing what?

996
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:06,419
Doing the jerk off.

997
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,546
Jerking myself to totally off.

998
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,172
- I'm sorry?
- Let me show you.

999
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:11,591
- No.
- She taught me.

1000
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:12,842
Oh, she taught you, did she?

1001
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:15,344
- No...
- Well, thank you very much.

1002
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:16,679
The contract is canceled.

1003
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:17,763
- That's it!
- No.

1004
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:19,265
No, I'm going to Green World.
It's over.

1005
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:20,850
- No, Mr. Ogden.
- Remember, I have to pay that...

1006
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,895
- Please, no, no.
- Self juicing. Filth!

1007
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,022
Oh, my God...

1008
00:59:26,439 --> 00:59:27,523
Zoey...

1009
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,317
We must get
that contract back.

1010
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:30,776
We can't!

1011
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:33,905
It's impossible.
We can't compete with Green World.

1012
00:59:34,614 --> 00:59:36,449
We will see about that.

1013
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:39,660
But from now on,
it is my way

1014
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:44,415
or the <i>highwahahtmaa-
fferrohshelechnichway.</i>

1015
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:47,460
There has been
a regime change!

1016
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,879
Yo! You are
stocking the shelves.

1017
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:52,715
You, senile
Romanian accountant.

1018
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,467
You are on
the cash register.

1019
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:58,554
<i>The CEO of Green World
does not drive a hybrid!</i>

1020
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,975
<i>The chemicals
in Green World produce</i>

1021
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:05,394
<i>made this boy
grow tits!</i>

1022
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:13,235
You promise not
to steal again?

1023
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:14,987
I won't. I won't!

1024
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:16,948
Give him one more
for fun, Viktor.

1025
01:00:36,968 --> 01:00:38,386
Good choice.

1026
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:54,777
Hi, Viktor.

1027
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:12,378
Supreme Grocer.

1028
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:14,213
The radicchio
has been washed and sorted,

1029
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,048
and the spray hose
has been tightly coiled.

1030
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:17,800
Very good. Now go upstairs

1031
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:20,136
and finish composting
the wheatgrass tailings, okay?

1032
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:21,470
Yes, Supreme Grocer.

1033
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:24,807
Zoey!

1034
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,143
What? Look...

1035
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:28,811
Wow!

1036
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:30,896
It's amazing!

1037
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,733
Oh, it's not amazing.
It's just a little less shit.

1038
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:35,818
Well, thank you.

1039
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:38,779
- Sorry.
- Oh, of course.

1040
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:41,741
- Personal.
- Thank you. Thank you again.

1041
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,828
- Hello?
- I have some very good news.

1042
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:46,954
<i>What is it?</i>

1043
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:50,666
I managed to buy some beards at the
wig store today that are perfect.

1044
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,960
<i>No, Nadal,
it must be real hair.</i>

1045
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:55,087
<i>- And from the head of a great man!
- What?</i>

1046
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:56,839
<i>Like Castro or Gandalf.</i>

1047
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,174
No...

1048
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,679
Well done, Nadal.
This beard is perfect.

1049
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:10,936
Those are lovely flowers.

1050
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,938
You know, Zoey is
thinking of opening

1051
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:15,357
an eco-friendly
flower section to the store.

1052
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:18,736
This is the fifth time you've mentioned
her today. What is going on?

1053
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,488
The signing
is in two days.

1054
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,406
Tell me you're not
falling for this woman!

1055
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:25,534
Of course I'm not.
This is silly.

1056
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:28,871
Okay, good. All we need to do
is slip into this chapel...

1057
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,122
And yet, it's strange.

1058
01:02:30,206 --> 01:02:32,124
The other day,
I asked her to, you know,

1059
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,877
gobble on my <i>bilbul</i>
and she said, "No."

1060
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,962
So obviously
I wanted to execute her.

1061
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:40,299
But the thought of
her decapitated head actually upset me,

1062
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,134
-so I decided not to do it.
- No.

1063
01:02:42,218 --> 01:02:45,554
When the thought of someone's
decapitated head upsets you,

1064
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:47,389
that is love.

1065
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,643
- I swear, I don't even like her at all.
- You don't like her?

1066
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,562
She has the body shape
of a 14-year-old boy.

1067
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:57,650
Well, that is
a particular weakness of yours.

1068
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,652
Need I remind you of
the Menudo incident?

1069
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,612
Those boys had
their eyes open.

1070
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:02,988
They knew exactly
what they were doing.

1071
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:04,573
We made them
have their eyes open.

1072
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:06,826
You made me hold
one of their eyes open,

1073
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:08,536
so they'd see what
you were doing to them.

1074
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,163
They seemed to be having
a pretty good time.

1075
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:13,707
They were not.
Those boys were crying.

1076
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,251
Three of them
killed themselves!

1077
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:17,378
Nothing to do with me.

1078
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,839
Everything to do with you!
A lot of them wrote notes.

1079
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:22,591
In their suicide notes
they named you by name!

1080
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,135
It's all a rumor.
And you're being silly.

1081
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,054
Hello, gentlemen.
How you doin'?

1082
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:28,848
Are you guys
friends of the deceased?

1083
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:30,933
How do I put this?

1084
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:32,685
He was my nigger.

1085
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,478
No, that's not
the way to put it.

1086
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:36,230
- Whoa, whoa!
- No?

1087
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,773
He was my negger.
Nigger. Nagger?

1088
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:39,191
- No, no, no.
- What is that?

1089
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:40,568
- Negar. Nigger? Nagur?
- No, no.

1090
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:41,819
Please stop. Please.

1091
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:42,945
I told you,
before we came in.

1092
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:45,531
One word, do not say.
ls the exact word you're using now.

1093
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:46,991
- No, I said Nuga...
- One dozen times.

1094
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,119
Please relate to him that there could be
two funerals today.

1095
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,204
I... Believe me
when I tell you,

1096
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,624
we are here only
to pay our respects to a great man.

1097
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,043
Okay, Eldridge's casket
is laying in the chapel right now.

1098
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,879
We're gonna have the
viewing in a few minutes.

1099
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:01,380
Thank you very much.

1100
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:04,383
I love your music,
by the way.

1101
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,926
No, it's not.
He's not a musician.

1102
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:09,930
I'm so, so sorry that
Whitney turned out like she did.

1103
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,307
- It's not Bobby Brown.
- Hey...

1104
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:18,230
- Go there.
- Okay. Here we go.

1105
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:28,949
Hello?
Somebody in here?

1106
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,160
Nadal!
The Sub-Saharans have discovered us!

1107
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:32,828
- What? Okay, okay, okay!
- Hurry, hurry!

1108
01:04:32,912 --> 01:04:34,413
- Just a moment!
- What you doin' in there?

1109
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:36,540
Jerking off.

1110
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:38,125
Open this door!

1111
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,502
- No, no, no!
- Open the door now!

1112
01:04:40,753 --> 01:04:43,088
Quick! Plan B! Plan B!

1113
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:53,766
Why did you
chop off his head?

1114
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:54,934
You said Plan B!

1115
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:56,810
Plan B was to have
coffee and regroup,

1116
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:59,229
it was not to
chop his head off!

1117
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:09,073
Good morning, Nadal!

1118
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:12,284
Wake up!
Good morning, Nadal!

1119
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,413
No,no,no,no,no,no!

1120
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,623
Get this away from me!

1121
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:18,958
You know, me and you
are quite a team.

1122
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,042
No, no.

1123
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,543
You know who else
makes a great team?

1124
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:24,088
<i>Ebony and ivory</i>

1125
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:25,589
No,no,no!

1126
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:27,049
<i>Live together
in perfect harmony</i>

1127
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,133
What is wrong with you?
Get it out of here!

1128
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:30,177
Good one.

1129
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,600
<i>Splish splash
I was taking a bath!</i>

1130
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,144
No! Get it out of here!

1131
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:41,981
Oh, that is weird.

1132
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:48,320
I threw in some carob-covered goji
berries, just as a treat. Enjoy.

1133
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:53,075
Thank you. That's very kind of
you. You're a very nice man.

1134
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,661
What the fuck
did you call me?

1135
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:58,497
I said you were nice!

1136
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:07,423
Allison! The Lancaster just
called! We got the contract back!

1137
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:09,591
- Great! Whatever!
- I know!

1138
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:12,011
Green World is shutting down
their Manhattan store!

1139
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:14,221
I wonder what
could have happened?

1140
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:18,267
Be careful with that,
sweetheart. Be careful.

1141
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,353
Oh, yeah, we're going to
have a nice big salad.

1142
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:23,897
Celebratory cuddle?

1143
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:26,608
Well done!

1144
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:28,193
- You smell bad.
- I know.

1145
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:29,778
Help!

1146
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:32,072
Somebody help!
My wife is in labor!

1147
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,033
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1148
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,994
Baby? The ambulance can't
be here for 20 minutes. Can you hold it?

1149
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:38,746
I can't hold it!
It's coming out!

1150
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:40,164
It's coming out!

1151
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:42,958
Does anyone have
any medical experience?

1152
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:46,795
I was Wadiya's Chief Surgeon
for the last 22 years.

1153
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:48,881
Please.
Please help us. Please.

1154
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:51,133
- Allison, they need your help. Come on.
- Okay, fine.

1155
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:52,760
Come on.

1156
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,344
Are you okay?

1157
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:57,473
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

1158
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:58,932
Sorry! Old habits die hard.

1159
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:01,060
All right, I'm going in.

1160
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,021
That's the wrong hole!

1161
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:06,065
- What?
- You just put your fist up the wrong hole.

1162
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:07,858
If I had a dollar for
every time I heard that.

1163
01:07:09,735 --> 01:07:10,778
Get it outta there.

1164
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,489
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

1165
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,240
Still my asshole!

1166
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:16,992
What is wrong
with you, man?

1167
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,535
You just put it in
my asshole again!

1168
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,120
Just go up
from where you are.

1169
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:23,457
The good news is,
your prostate is completely healthy.

1170
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:26,085
That's good. That's good.

1171
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,711
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

1172
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:32,591
Hold on.

1173
01:07:33,926 --> 01:07:34,968
What are you...

1174
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:38,847
Allison, stop it!
You need two hands!

1175
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:40,349
But I'm in the middle
of the text.

1176
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:42,184
It's coming out!

1177
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:48,816
- Where is that coming from?
- What?

1178
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:56,115
I'm really sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this call.

1179
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:57,658
Is there a phone
in my body?

1180
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,284
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1181
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,786
I'm in
the Lincoln Tunnel.

1182
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,330
<i>What? Okay, look.
We need to talk for a minute.</i>

1183
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:05,624
Hello, Nadal.
Listen, I can't speak now.

1184
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,209
I'll speak to you later,
okay? Bye!

1185
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:09,461
Stop talking to my vagina!

1186
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:13,465
Zoey, the baby's stuck. I need you to put
your hand in and help me.

1187
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,008
- What? No...
- Come on! Put it in!

1188
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:16,802
- No, don't be scared. Put it in.
- Okay. Okay.

1189
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:18,387
- I'm sorry.
- Put it right there on the right side.

1190
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:20,389
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!
- Pushin.

1191
01:08:21,557 --> 01:08:22,683
I think I feel an arm!

1192
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:25,310
That's my finger.

1193
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:41,243
Excuse me. You guys
make a really cute couple together.

1194
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:42,953
But maybe could you finish doing this

1195
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,997
when you're not elbow-deep
in my pussy!

1196
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,541
Okay, Allison,
you've got the head?

1197
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,585
- I've got the head.
- Okay, it's coming out.

1198
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:50,711
Come on, push!

1199
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:56,008
Where are the rebel bases?
Where are the rebel bases?

1200
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:57,885
Sorry, sorry.

1201
01:08:58,177 --> 01:09:01,138
Wait, I can see the head!
I can see the head!

1202
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:02,347
I can't push any more!

1203
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:09,271
YOU did it!
YOU did it!

1204
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:18,864
I sentence you

1205
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,699
to life.

1206
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:24,286
It's still attached!

1207
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,371
Sorry. Oh, no.

1208
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:27,873
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

1209
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,583
It's bad news.

1210
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:31,043
It's a girl.

1211
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,213
Where's the trash can?

1212
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:36,423
No,no,no,no!
That's what we wanted!

1213
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:38,383
We'll take her,
we'll take her.

1214
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:39,468
Oh, baby.

1215
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:46,808
You were so
amazing down there.

1216
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:49,228
You saved
a little person's life.

1217
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,988
It feels so nice
to kiss you.

1218
01:10:00,072 --> 01:10:01,490
I know. It's nice
to kiss you, too.

1219
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:03,075
I love the hugging.

1220
01:10:03,492 --> 01:10:04,910
I just came.

1221
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:09,665
I don't care.

1222
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,167
Lie back.

1223
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:13,293
Okay.

1224
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:15,045
This is going to be
amazing for you.

1225
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:16,463
Okay!

1226
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:31,061
You have such
a small stomach.

1227
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:33,522
It's like
a 10-year-old boy's.

1228
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,068
Normally, I don't kiss
a 10-year-old boy's stomach.

1229
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:39,486
They kiss mine.

1230
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:41,863
See you in 15 minutes.

1231
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:46,326
Okay.

1232
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:56,712
Wait, wait.

1233
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:58,380
Wait.

1234
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,509
Allison,
before we go any further,

1235
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:05,470
there's something
that I want to tell you.

1236
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:08,307
You've got a dick.
I knew it.

1237
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:11,184
Allison,
I don't have a dick.

1238
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:12,686
Great!

1239
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,439
And I've never been
with a guy with a dick.

1240
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:16,940
Or any guy.

1241
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:19,651
Or boys.

1242
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:22,988
Just girls.

1243
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:25,449
And children.

1244
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:28,785
Not male ones.
Female ones.

1245
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:34,708
What I wanted to
tell you was this.

1246
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,961
I really want
to be with you, Allison Burgers.

1247
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,047
Zoey,

1248
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,925
I'm not really
Allison Burgers.

1249
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:47,679
I'm actually
a little somebody called

1250
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,682
Admiral General

1251
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:52,642
Aladeen.

1252
01:11:57,064 --> 01:11:59,232
No, what's your real name?

1253
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:01,193
Wait, this will
convince you.

1254
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:04,071
Look, it's me!

1255
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:08,158
The weapons inspectors
will bathe in their own blood!

1256
01:12:09,576 --> 01:12:11,036
That's your beard?

1257
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,163
No,no,no!
It's not my beard.

1258
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,290
My friend chopped the head
off Morgan Freeman.

1259
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:18,043
It's a hilarious story.
I'll tell you later, okay?

1260
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:21,880
You are out of your mind.
You're insane!

1261
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:24,966
Well, you download songs
illegally from the Internet.

1262
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:27,052
So let's not
throw stones, okay?

1263
01:12:27,803 --> 01:12:29,137
You're a murderer!

1264
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:31,515
No,no,no!
Zoey,Zoey,Zoey!No.

1265
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:34,851
You were just using me
to get access to that hotel!

1266
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:36,144
No!

1267
01:12:36,228 --> 01:12:39,815
Zoey, I'm attracted to you
in a really fucked-up way.

1268
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:42,317
Oh, my God!

1269
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:45,195
I'm canceling that
contract tomorrow!

1270
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:47,906
No, Zoey! What have
I ever done wrong?

1271
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:50,158
You lied to me!

1272
01:12:50,242 --> 01:12:52,661
And you're wanted
for war crimes!

1273
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,329
That stuff never sticks.

1274
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:56,623
You need to leave now.

1275
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:01,128
You have broken my heart
into Aladeen pieces.

1276
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:26,111
<i>With the signing of the
constitution tomorrow morning,</i>

1277
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:28,697
<i>democracy in Wadiya
is just hours away,</i>

1278
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:31,116
<i>and people are
in the streets celebrating.</i>

1279
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:32,868
<i>Kill Aladeen,
kill Aladeen, hey!</i>

1280
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,454
<i>Kill Aladeen,
kill Aladeen, hey!</i>

1281
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,626
<i>What do you think of
Admiral General Aladeen?</i>

1282
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,670
<i>We hate him. We hate him.</i>

1283
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:46,298
<i>You know,
when we think of him, we...</i>

1284
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,967
<i>We vomit, and we spit
and we don't want him.</i>

1285
01:13:49,176 --> 01:13:51,303
<i>What would you say to General
Aladeen if he were watching this?</i>

1286
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:53,180
<i>I have a message
for Aladeen.</i>

1287
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:54,890
<i>Sue vel.</i>

1288
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:57,642
<i>Sue vel. Sue vel.</i>

1289
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,246
- Good-bye!
- Stop, stop, wait!

1290
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:19,331
What are you doing?

1291
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:21,666
How did you find me?

1292
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,336
You texted me, like,
seven times.

1293
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:27,923
I am executing myself!

1294
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:29,591
What? Why?

1295
01:14:29,758 --> 01:14:31,301
Because no one
has ever loved me!

1296
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,720
Your father would
be ashamed of you!

1297
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,431
No, I've realized
I don't want to be like my father!

1298
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:39,059
In fact,
I don't want to be a dictator any more!

1299
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,310
What's that now?

1300
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:43,313
I've been on a spiritual journey,
man, like Eat, Pray, <i>Love.</i>

1301
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:46,233
Have you gone insane?

1302
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,526
I now know that
on the outside,

1303
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:49,986
I am a bit of
a cocksucker.

1304
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:53,156
- Yeah.
- But deep down I'm nice.

1305
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,742
- Not really.
- Yes, I am! I'm like mafroom.

1306
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:58,161
Hard and spiky
on the outside,

1307
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:00,330
but soft and
really mushy on the in.

1308
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,875
You're not like
mafroom at all. You're like an onion.

1309
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,127
An outer layer
of cocksucker,

1310
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:07,629
and when you
peel it away,

1311
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:10,423
there is 10 more layers
of cocksucker underneath.

1312
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,885
You are such a schmuck!

1313
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:16,721
- Why are you speaking Yiddish?
- I picked it up.

1314
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,307
What do you mean,
"I picked it up"? Who picks up Yiddish?

1315
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:20,558
I'm in New York!

1316
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:22,894
We're trying to erase
that country off the map!

1317
01:15:22,978 --> 01:15:25,063
I don't like the people,
but I like the way that

1318
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,816
their words really sound like
what they're meant to be.

1319
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:30,735
Oh, I'm sorry! Did I not get the
Evite to your bar mitzvah?

1320
01:15:30,819 --> 01:15:31,987
Oh, my God!

1321
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,114
You've got real
chutzpah saying that!

1322
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:36,408
Look, where has being
a nice guy gotten you, huh?

1323
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,910
Standing on the edge
of a bridge about to commit suicide?

1324
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:40,078
Still wearing Crocs?

1325
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,163
What's wrong with Crocs?

1326
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:45,250
They are the universal symbol of a
man who has given up hope!

1327
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:48,336
You might as well
put sweatpants on

1328
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,338
and go to Applebee's
for the rest of your life!

1329
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:53,341
I'll give you that one.
I do look ridiculous.

1330
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:57,262
Yes! Listen, if you won't
come down from there for yourself,

1331
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:58,596
do it for your country.

1332
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:00,515
If this constitution
is signed,

1333
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:03,810
there will be free press,
women drivers, civil rights!

1334
01:16:04,019 --> 01:16:05,103
What are "civil rights"?

1335
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,647
I'll tell you later.
They're hilarious.

1336
01:16:08,148 --> 01:16:11,609
Look, you alone can stop
these terrible things from happening.

1337
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,487
You are the last
great dictator!

1338
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,073
All of the others
are gone! Qaddafi,

1339
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:19,784
Saddam, Kim Jong, Cheney.

1340
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:23,288
You are right, Nadal.

1341
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:25,832
I will become
the greatest dictator of all,

1342
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,917
the envy of madmen
everywhere!

1343
01:16:28,126 --> 01:16:29,711
Yes, Supreme Leader!

1344
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:33,173
From the mountaintops of North Korea
to the jungles of Zimbabwe,

1345
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:37,510
let every child laborer
and sweatshop factory worker sing,

1346
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:40,263
"Oppressed at last!
Oppressed at last!

1347
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:43,433
"Thank Aladeen,
I am oppressed at last!"

1348
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,684
Yes! Whoa!

1349
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:46,061
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1350
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:47,520
- No, no, no, no, don't fall.
- I'm not doing anything.

1351
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:50,273
Just do like a pull-up.
You know how you do pull-ups?

1352
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:51,566
I invented the pull-up.

1353
01:16:55,862 --> 01:16:58,948
<i>If you're just joining us, we
are at the Lancaster Hotel,</i>

1354
01:16:59,032 --> 01:17:00,742
<i>where in about 20 minutes,</i>

1355
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,662
<i>General Aladeen will be signing the
new Wadiyan constitution.</i>

1356
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:06,581
<i>Dignitaries from
around the world</i>

1357
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:09,584
<i>are arriving now to witness
the creation of a democracy</i>

1358
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,462
<i>that will undoubtedly change
the political landscape</i>

1359
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,255
<i>of the entire region.</i>

1360
01:17:14,506 --> 01:17:17,509
<i>As Wadiya goes,
so goes North Africa.</i>

1361
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:26,810
Eddie Norton, next time,
you pee on me.

1362
01:17:27,102 --> 01:17:28,186
Whatever.

1363
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,522
And tell Viggo Mortensen
he is on my radar.

1364
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,360
How do you say,
"Fly is in the soup"?

1365
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:37,278
Gentlemen, Tamir.

1366
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:39,781
Let me introduce you
to my beautiful wife.

1367
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:42,742
Mrs. Lao, it is my
very great pleasure.

1368
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:44,994
No,no,no,no.
She does not speak English.

1369
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:46,287
Watch this.

1370
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,623
You ugly horse!

1371
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,333
She doesn't know.

1372
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:55,130
"Ohhh." See?
She goes "Ohhh" all the time. Watch.

1373
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:57,340
Shaved ape.

1374
01:17:57,924 --> 01:17:58,967
"Ohhh."

1375
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,483
Wait. That is how you intend to get me
across to the Lancaster?

1376
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:16,818
Absolutely.

1377
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,236
- Where'd you get that?
- I built it.

1378
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:20,905
When I was going
to assassinate you.

1379
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,407
You mean my double.

1380
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:26,453
Sure. Yeah.

1381
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,129
Bingo!

1382
01:18:39,174 --> 01:18:40,175
Love it!

1383
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:41,301
- Here's what you do.
- Okay.

1384
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:44,387
Zipline across,
kill the double,

1385
01:18:44,471 --> 01:18:47,056
and then rip up the constitution in
front of the world's media.

1386
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,141
Piece of cake.

1387
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,782
Hello, Lancaster!

1388
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,043
I don't understand
what has happened.

1389
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:17,212
My calculations
were very precise.

1390
01:19:17,879 --> 01:19:19,839
If you lose enough weight,
then the zipline will work.

1391
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:21,633
Do you have anything
in your pockets?

1392
01:19:21,716 --> 01:19:23,384
Let me check.

1393
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:27,555
What is that?

1394
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:28,932
It's Vita Coco water.

1395
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:31,059
Why do you have
Vita Coco water?

1396
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:33,811
Because it has
as much potassium as three bananas.

1397
01:19:33,895 --> 01:19:35,480
The line is
still too heavy.

1398
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:37,982
Is there anything else in your pockets
that could be weighing you down?

1399
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,820
You're kidding. So then why did
you bring three bananas?

1400
01:19:42,904 --> 01:19:46,533
Because I don't trust the
advertising. I'm naturally suspicious.

1401
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,661
Is there anything else you're
carrying? You're still too heavy.

1402
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:50,870
Just this.

1403
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,831
What is that, a brick?

1404
01:19:53,915 --> 01:19:56,334
All this time you've had a
brick? Why do you have that?

1405
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,336
Well, to balance out
the weight from the other one.

1406
01:19:58,419 --> 01:19:59,671
You have two bricks?

1407
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:00,797
Yes!

1408
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,382
Throw them down
immediately!

1409
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:09,389
Oh, my God!
There's a little goat eating the wire!

1410
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,269
You need to lose
weight immediately!

1411
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:17,230
My pockets are empty.
I could poo.

1412
01:20:17,605 --> 01:20:19,190
That won't be enough
to make a difference.

1413
01:20:19,274 --> 01:20:21,818
Yes, it will.
I haven't gone since Wadiya.

1414
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,529
Losing power
has stopped me up like a cork.

1415
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:25,905
Hurry!

1416
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:28,575
Come on, Supreme Leader!
Make it rain! Make it rain!

1417
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,412
It's out!
And it's pointy!

1418
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:34,747
Somebody stop that man!

1419
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:37,625
Yes!

1420
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,169
What? No, no, no, no!

1421
01:20:40,962 --> 01:20:41,963
No,no,no!

1422
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:07,780
Supreme Leader!

1423
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,328
Get out of here
before Tamir kills you.

1424
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,163
Who is Tamir?

1425
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,956
Tamir...

1426
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,751
The bald bastard
who did all these terrible things to us!

1427
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,253
I thought
his name was Dennis.

1428
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:28,468
How would you
even make that leap? Tamir to Dennis?

1429
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:31,679
- Go on, get out! Get out!
- Come on, Montzi!

1430
01:21:31,763 --> 01:21:32,764
Quick!

1431
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:37,518
Just jump.
It's not that far.

1432
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:39,937
Efawadh.

1433
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:41,689
It is almost time.

1434
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,861
I like goats.

1435
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:50,490
I am very stupid.

1436
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,535
<i>This is
an historic moment.</i>

1437
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:57,455
<i>Admiral General
Aladeen of Wadiya</i>

1438
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,040
<i>is going to be signing</i>

1439
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:02,794
the first democratic
constitution in the history of his nation.

1440
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:06,839
<i>Across the globe,
people are glued to their television sets.</i>

1441
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:09,509
<i>The people of Wadiya
are celebrating</i>

1442
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:12,428
<i>what will be
a new chapter in their country.</i>

1443
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,182
<i>Just moments away now
from putting his signature</i>

1444
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,643
<i>on the first
democratic constitution.</i>

1445
01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:22,230
<i>That's Tamir Mafraad,
AIadeen's trusted adviser,</i>

1446
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:25,316
<i>sharing a lighthearted moment with
Chinese businessman, Xiang Lao.</i>

1447
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,276
<i>Any thoughts on
what they might be saying, Mike?</i>

1448
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,238
I thought I made out
the words "Harvey Keitel."

1449
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:34,450
<i>Don't know
what that meant.</i>

1450
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:37,286
Maybe they shared
a hot dog together, I'm thinking?

1451
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:41,749
That would make sense. He's wiping the
mustard off his face and chest.

1452
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:43,126
Excuse me!

1453
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:44,669
You have to let me in.
You don't understand.

1454
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,421
He's trying to
stop the signing!

1455
01:22:46,504 --> 01:22:48,047
Tamir is now speaking.

1456
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:49,132
Today,

1457
01:22:49,841 --> 01:22:51,592
we begin a new era.

1458
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:55,179
<i>Wadiya will be
open to the world.</i>

1459
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:56,848
Open to the future.

1460
01:22:56,931 --> 01:22:58,433
And open for business.

1461
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:03,354
The document is
ready to be signed, Supreme Leader.

1462
01:23:11,946 --> 01:23:14,699
What are you doing?
This man is an imposter!

1463
01:23:14,782 --> 01:23:19,245
No! This traitor tried to kill me
and had my beard removed!

1464
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,539
Look!

1465
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:24,041
Arrest the viper Tamir!

1466
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,835
<i>And now in another</i>

1467
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:29,547
amazing turn of events,
Tamir Mafraad is being taken away.

1468
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:32,175
This constitution

1469
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,927
is nothing
but a license for oil companies

1470
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:38,514
and foreign interests
to destroy my beloved Wadiya!

1471
01:23:38,598 --> 01:23:42,268
Wadiya will remain
a dictatorship!

1472
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,404
Oh, be quiet.

1473
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,783
Why are you guys
so anti dictators?

1474
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:59,869
Imagine if America
was a dictatorship.

1475
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:04,457
You could let 1% of the people
have all the nation's wealth.

1476
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:06,250
You could help
your rich friends

1477
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:08,878
get richer by
cutting their taxes

1478
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:12,215
and bailing them out
when they gamble and lose.

1479
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:16,969
You could ignore the needs of the poor
for health care and education.

1480
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:18,721
Your media
would appear free

1481
01:24:18,805 --> 01:24:22,934
but would secretly be controlled
by one person and his family.

1482
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:27,271
You could wiretap phones,
you could torture foreign prisoners.

1483
01:24:27,355 --> 01:24:29,524
You could have
rigged elections.

1484
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:31,692
You could lie about
why you go to war.

1485
01:24:32,235 --> 01:24:34,028
You could fill your prisons

1486
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:37,740
with one particular racial group
and no one would complain!

1487
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:41,452
You could use the media
to scare the people

1488
01:24:41,536 --> 01:24:45,456
into supporting policies
that are against their interests.

1489
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,918
I know this is hard
for you Americans to imagine,

1490
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,962
but please try.

1491
01:24:51,045 --> 01:24:53,297
I will tell you
what democracy is!

1492
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,842
Democracy is the worst!

1493
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:58,845
Endless talking
and listening to every stupid opinion!

1494
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:01,013
And everybody's
vote counts,

1495
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:04,767
no matter how
crippled or black or female they are.

1496
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:07,061
Democracy...

1497
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,111
Democracy

1498
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:20,616
has hairy armpits
and could lose five pounds.

1499
01:25:21,826 --> 01:25:25,121
Democracy looks like
a midget in a chemo wig.

1500
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:29,917
Democracy, your mother
called the other day

1501
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,168
and I forgot to
give you the message.

1502
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:35,381
It was something very important
about your grandmother.

1503
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:39,719
Democracy kisses you
because she wants to,

1504
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:43,681
not because her father
is in the next room chained to a radiator

1505
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,892
with electrodes
attached to his nipples.

1506
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:51,063
Democracy is flawed!
She is not perfect!

1507
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,232
But democracy,

1508
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:57,778
I love you.

1509
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:01,991
And that is
why I call for real democracy!

1510
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,868
A real constitution!

1511
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,911
And real elections
in Wadiya!

1512
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:14,545
Oh, no!

1513
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:16,589
Come on!

1514
01:26:23,471 --> 01:26:26,641
Democracy,
I will make you one of my wives.

1515
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:30,144
Okay, only wife.
We'll vote on it.

1516
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:32,688
I'll shave
my armpits for you.

1517
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:34,857
Praise be to the Creator!

1518
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,360
And please stop using
that organic deodorant.

1519
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:39,654
You could gas the Kurds
with that stench.

1520
01:27:06,806 --> 01:27:08,724
You died
protecting me, Efawadh.

1521
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:10,476
Hello!

1522
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:11,769
You are alive?

1523
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,939
Of course!
It is my job to be shot in the head.

1524
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:20,486
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

1525
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:23,155
Luckily the bullet
hit him in the brain.

1526
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:26,117
So,

1527
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:28,619
what now?

1528
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:32,248
I return to Wadiya
to participate in fair elections.

1529
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:47,763
Let's now look back
at the wonderful events of the past year.

1530
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:50,641
<i>After Wadiya's
first free elections,</i>

1531
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:53,686
<i>President Prime Minister
Admiral General Aladeen</i>

1532
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:56,355
<i>won 98.8% of the vote.</i>

1533
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:02,486
<i>But the big story today is the
marriage of President Prime Minister</i>

1534
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:06,323
<i>Admiral General Aladeen
and his new bride, Zoey.</i>

1535
01:28:10,578 --> 01:28:13,205
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1536
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:25,259
Are you okay, my love?
What did you step on?

1537
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,635
Oh, yes! No, no.

1538
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:30,389
It's my people's tradition.
We always smash a glass at weddings.

1539
01:28:30,473 --> 01:28:32,308
- I'm Jewish!
- What?

1540
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:33,684
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

1541
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:39,732
Are you okay?

1542
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:43,402
That's fine.
I don't mind. It's great!

1543
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:45,571
Come here, my love.

1544
01:29:05,299 --> 01:29:07,176
Jachnoon, President
Prime Minister Aladeen.

1545
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,554
Jachnoon. Nadal. I have to be back
at the palace in an hour.

1546
01:29:10,638 --> 01:29:12,932
Zoey thinks I'm at yoga.

1547
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:14,350
I have great news.

1548
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:17,228
We are just days
away from testing the new missiles.

1549
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:19,271
I have re-engineered
the oxidizing ducts

1550
01:29:19,355 --> 01:29:20,815
and the payload
delivery systems.

1551
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:25,611
But you'll be happy to know,
the missile is now pointy!

1552
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,823
Who cares if it's pointy?

1553
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:30,074
What?

1554
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:32,868
You do.
You care if it's pointy.

1555
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,620
Why would I care
about such a trivial detail?

1556
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,956
Are you serious?
Are you serious right now?

1557
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:38,040
Of course I'm serious.

1558
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:39,583
That's why you
had me executed!

1559
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:42,962
The shape of the missile has nothing to
do with the payload delivery.

1560
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:45,464
That's what I said!
That's what I said the first time!

1561
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:46,966
No, that's what I said,
and you went crazy.

1562
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:49,260
No! You said
Professor Popeye this...

1563
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:51,178
Professor Popeye
is a cartoon.

1564
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,555
No, I know this!

1565
01:29:57,226 --> 01:30:00,396
So, we're opening
300 Women's Centers,

1566
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:04,567
but I'm going to have to take a
break for a little bit because

1567
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:06,610
I'm pregnant.

1568
01:30:06,694 --> 01:30:07,862
What?

1569
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:14,076
Are you having a boy
or an abortion?

1570
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:38,684
Hello, gentlemen.
How you doin'?

1571
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,311
Are you guys friends
of the deceased?

1572
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:43,188
Do you want me to say this
in front of his widow?

1573
01:30:43,272 --> 01:30:44,315
I was his lover.

1574
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:45,900
No. That is
not true.

1575
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:48,319
I saw him perform
with the Globetrotters.

1576
01:30:48,402 --> 01:30:50,905
I thought
he was outstanding. I befriended him.

1577
01:30:50,988 --> 01:30:53,115
No, it's
a different person.

1578
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:56,535
His message
of don't worry and being happy

1579
01:30:56,619 --> 01:30:57,786
was so powerful.

1580
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,122
No, this is
Bobby McFerrin. I told you this outside.

1581
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:02,458
Whatever the scandal
you went through,

1582
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:04,376
you're still
the best golfer in the world.

1583
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,628
Let's go.

1584
01:31:07,171 --> 01:31:08,547
O-M-G.

1585
01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:11,008
Oh, my God.

1586
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:15,179
Oh, my...

1587
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:19,642
Oh, my...

1588
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,107
Zoey.

1589
01:31:28,609 --> 01:31:30,819
That's some good head!

1590
01:31:33,072 --> 01:31:35,199
That is called payback
and it feels so good!

1591
01:31:35,282 --> 01:31:37,576
How did it feel for you?
How did it feel for you?

1592
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:39,453
I prefer it with goats.

1593
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:41,705
Where is
the Supreme Leader?

1594
01:31:41,789 --> 01:31:42,790
No, no.

1595
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:45,292
Now that is
called payback!

1596
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:46,835
Ch, great!

1597
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:55,302
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

1598
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:57,096
You don't have
to touch it.

1599
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:58,222
Sorry. I was...

1600
01:31:58,305 --> 01:32:00,140
Just give us...
We don't...

1601
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:03,143
Just give me
a couple of millimeters to myself.

1602
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:41,041
