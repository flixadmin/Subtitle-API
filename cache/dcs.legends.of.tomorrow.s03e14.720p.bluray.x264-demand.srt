1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,747
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,123
Good job out there.

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,251
- Are you sticking around?
- Wally. Ready to leave?

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,957
I'm actually gonna stay.

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,917
The hunt for the six Totems
has begun.

6
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,053
No!

7
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,740
<i>We'll fix this.
We'll get your Totem back.</i>

8
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:17,257
<i>Nora was possessed by Mallus.
He seemed scared of my Totem.</i>

9
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,175
<i>You're one of the six.</i>

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,517
The good news is we already
have the Air, Earth and Fire.

11
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,643
<i>Kuasa has the Water Totem.</i>

12
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,226
Which leaves us with the final Totem,
which is still a complete mystery.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,400
Good point.
"Way to go, Ray."

14
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,456
Hello, sir.

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,877
Um, I've been saving up for a while,
and I think it's time...

16
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,049
I'm here to buy a guitar.

17
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,127
I know it ain't much,

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,259
but what do you think I can get
with what I got?

19
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:01,180
I'm sure we can find you something.

20
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,429
You know, a boy picking his
first guitar is a sacred moment.

21
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:09,943
In fact, some say
the instrument chooses you.

22
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,199
- I'll take that one.
- Oh.

23
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,118
You don't want that guitar.

24
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,128
What happened to the instrument
choosing me, sir?

25
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,160
I was just, uh, building a moment.

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,337
Besides, you can't afford it.

27
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,290
Well, I'll get the money.
I'll come back.

28
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,797
Look, I gotta tell you the truth.

29
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,465
Before that guitar
found its way here,

30
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,048
it belonged to a one Robert Johnson.

31
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,008
- The Robert Johnson?
- Uh-huh.

32
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,782
Legend said he sold his soul to
the devil to play as good as he did.

33
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,313
Legend also says that guitar
is cursed because of it.

34
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,187
I ain't afraid of no guitar, sir.

35
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,734
You gotta let me try it at least.

36
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,950
It must be messing
with the power lines outside.

37
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,283
With a sound like that,
how could it be cursed?

38
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,695
You know what? The guitar's yours.

39
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,605
You just take it away from here.

40
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,074
Thank you, sir. Much, much obliged.

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,202
An instrument as good as this,

42
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,156
I promise, one day, you'll be hearing
my name on that radio.

43
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,584
Hey.

44
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,747
What is your name, son?

45
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,631
Presley, sir, Elvis Presley.

46
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,305
...which brings us to the kitchen.

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,433
We divvy up cleaning duties
by Ray's chore wheel,

48
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,231
which uses a complex system
I pretend to not understand

49
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,479
till he eventually does
my chores for me.

50
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,269
"Wipe down the food fabricator."

51
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,104
Bet you thought time travel would be

52
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,064
seeing Woodstock, saving Shakespeare,

53
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,901
and having ethical debates,
while standing over baby Hitler.

54
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,031
Trust me,
it takes time to get used to life...

55
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,367
Cool. So, what's next?

56
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,500
It's gonna take time for me to
get used to life with a speedster.

57
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,546
This is my room.

58
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,457
Guess you and me are bunkmates

59
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,713
while we help move you
into Stein's quarters.

60
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,672
You just moved yourself in,
didn't you?

61
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,428
I figured, why bother anyone else?

62
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,342
I was gonna
invite you to be my player two,

63
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,303
but you're officially
not my problem anymore.

64
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,685
Wait, who beat all my high scores?

65
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,169
Oh, you see, the thing with Miss Pac-Man

66
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,775
is you gotta just ignore the fruit.

67
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,589
All the points come
from digging out the ghost.

68
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,731
Yeah, I know that, but nobody
could beat these scores without...

69
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,950
Without lightning-fast fingers.

70
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,756
You better not have messed
with <i>Guitar Hero.</i>

71
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,202
What's <i>Trombone Hero?</i>

72
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:19,170
Hold on, Axl, sammie's coming.
Just gotta find the damn mayo.

73
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,376
Come on, Mick.

74
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,588
What did I say about
having him in the kitchen?

75
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,888
- Not to.
- Yes.

76
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,300
Would you toss me
the walnuts, please?

77
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,926
Thank you.

78
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,860
I'm gonna need some brain food
if I'm gonna fix the Fire Totem.

79
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,931
You know, Nora thought
using cold fusion

80
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,641
to reboot it was a crazy idea, but...

81
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,021
Don't care!

82
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,147
Where's the mayo?

83
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,405
The new kid.

84
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,943
The new kid.

85
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,242
Uh, I saw him speed-moving in
to Marty's old quarters.

86
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,615
Too much change on this damn ship.

87
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,198
That's what I love about old Axl.

88
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,327
Doesn't change.

89
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,540
"Josh Groban"?

90
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,587
Who the hell is Josh Groban?

91
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,212
Who the hell
changed the name of my rat?

92
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,942
All right, kids,
it's anachronism o'clock.

93
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,802
- What you got?
- How about this one?

94
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,132
It's a category two
during the Belle E' poque in Paris.

95
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,262
Sounds romantic.

96
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,469
Hmm. Or this category three,

97
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,555
which is the launch
of the Spirit of St. Louis...

98
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,603
I always wanted to join the Mile
High Club. It's when two people...

99
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,106
Hey, really cute that you guys
are crazy in love,

100
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,358
but date night
is going to have to wait.

101
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,031
If these anachronisms
are loosening Mallus' cage,

102
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,153
we need to double down.

103
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,446
Mmm-hmm.

104
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,778
What happened to your hair?

105
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,288
What are you talking about? What?

106
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,116
What? What is it?

107
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,169
What happened to my trademark
volume and sheen?

108
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,872
Who changed my rat's name?

109
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,748
Yo. Who switched my game?

110
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,716
Gideon?

111
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:48,843
<i>A scan of the timeline reveals
a change in Memphis, Tennessee, 1954.</i>

112
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,386
Says here,
Memphis became a ghost town

113
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,686
after a mysterious bout of
mass hysteria in July 1954.

114
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,263
That's what caused the changes.

115
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,474
Memphis is the birthplace
of rock 'n' roll.

116
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,184
If rock never makes it
out of Memphis,

117
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,940
then none of these things exist.

118
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,816
Your pet rat's namesake.

119
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,863
Electric guitar.

120
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,320
- Your hair gel.
- It's not hair gel, Wally.

121
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,903
It's Royal Crown pomade,
it's the same product used by...

122
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,205
- Elvis Presley.
- She knows what I'm talking about.

123
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,998
No, dodo, look.

124
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,121
"While the population
fled in hysterics,

125
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,123
"one person was left standing
in the aftermath.

126
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,705
"A local teen named Elvis Presley."

127
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,318
Don't tell me
they messed with the King.

128
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,208
Whatever he saw, drove him crazy.

129
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,090
He was taken to the
Boulevard State hospital.

130
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,179
Treated for insanity.

131
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,506
If Memphis is abandoned in '54,

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,080
then rock doesn't hit the mainstream,

133
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,510
which means there's no
Howlin' Rain, no Little Richard.

134
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,604
The Elvis sandwich.

135
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,181
Peanut butter, banana,
fried in greasy bacon fat.

136
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,641
The man was a visionary.

137
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,352
But if it didn't show up
on the anachronism map, then...

138
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,527
Darhks.

139
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,405
The only people evil enough
to wanna kill rock 'n' roll.

140
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,824
Oh. And I bet you,
that sick bastard likes ska.

141
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,402
All right. Let's go check this out.

142
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,612
We need to find Elvis
before panic sets in.

143
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,040
<i>Elvis Presley's uncle preached
to the Church of Zion every Sunday.</i>

144
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,412
<i>The boy never missed a service.</i>

145
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,709
You heard the lady.

146
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,459
What?

147
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,630
Why are you staring at me?

148
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,334
Well, you know, waiting for you
to do the thing you do.

149
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,428
What thing?

150
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,129
You usually send us into
the field with a little more pizzazz.

151
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,183
All right, Legends.
Put on your Sunday best

152
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,056
because we are going to church.

153
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,145
That's pretty good.

154
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,267
Amen.

155
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,497
Oh, this is uncomfortable, and I'm not
just talking about the dress.

156
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,795
Yeah, I guess these people didn't get
the whole "Love thy neighbor" talk.

157
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,793
- Shh.
- Shush yourself, lady.

158
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,152
Have you heard your singing voice?

159
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,133
Just keep Mick away
from the collection tray

160
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,132
and the communion wafers.

161
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,016
It's not bread!

162
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:07,398
There is a sickness
coming over this town.

163
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,061
I see it

164
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,943
in the schoolyard,
as I pass in the morning.

165
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,610
And to my horror,

166
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:20,620
I see it in this very church
on Sundays.

167
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,701
It infects the mind.

168
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,624
It drives people crazy.

169
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,749
Maybe the righteous Reverend
is on to something.

170
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,136
They call it "rock 'n' roll."

171
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,507
I call it "the Devil's music!"

172
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,764
Never mind. He has no idea
what he's talking about.

173
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,723
Now, I would like
to invite my nephew,

174
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,775
Elvis, to play for us,

175
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:54,115
and encourage you all to attend our
first annual Heavenly Night of Hymns.

176
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,988
Elvis.

177
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,870
Remember what we talked about, son.

178
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,322
Keep it godly.

179
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,497
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,002
Can you believe this?

181
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:12,341
The first show
we see together is Elvis live.

182
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,384
You're not the only one
who's excited.

183
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,854
This one's called...

184
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,398
<i>Onward, Christian Soldiers.</i>

185
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,316
Okay.

186
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,082
So, this is rock 'n' roll?

187
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,588
I mean, it's no Benny Goodman, but...

188
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:56,135
No, we did not come all this way to
listen to Elvis play grandma songs.

189
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,471
That's it, Elvis.
Put a little sauce on it.

190
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,892
Yeah, swivel.

191
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,320
Satan's got a hold of her!

192
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,650
What the hell's going on?

193
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,111
My Totem,
it's reacting to something.

194
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,572
Be gone, Satan!

195
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,157
Well, I think she's talking to us.

196
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,625
Behold,

197
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,833
what you have seen
with your very eyes,

198
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:36,384
witnessed in this house of God!

199
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,920
That is the act of Satan!

200
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,928
The Elvis sandwich.

201
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,971
I guess Elvis is
the King of rock 'n' roll.

202
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,556
One hip shake and Z loses it.

203
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,016
Yeah, tell me about it, sister.

204
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,102
I didn't lose control
because of Elvis' hips.

205
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,481
Yeah, me neither.

206
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,528
My Totem was glowing,
and so was Elvis' guitar.

207
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,410
- But that means that Elvis is...
- Yep.

208
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,451
Elvis is a Totem bearer.

209
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,164
So, Elvis is the bearer
of the long-lost sixth Totem.

210
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,715
Consider me all shook up.

211
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,626
- So, he has to join the team, right?
- No.

212
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,133
I mean, we can't defeat Mallus
unless we have a full set.

213
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,303
We could get Gideon

214
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,790
to fabricate him a spangling jumpsuit
and he'll fit right in.

215
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,514
What Totem would choose
a guitar-toting choirboy

216
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,345
- as its bearer?
- Isn't it obvious?

217
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,791
It's Elvis we're talking about.
It's gotta be...

218
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,101
Sandwich Totem.

219
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,899
I was gonna say "Music."

220
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,693
Just imagine what the Music Totem
would do for my upper register.

221
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,611
I can finally give
local theater a shot.

222
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,781
That is after we use it
to destroy Mallus.

223
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,953
So, we're gonna vanquish a time demon
with our killer harmonies.

224
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,120
It's gonna go great.

225
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,245
Every Totem is growing stronger
in response to Mallus' threat.

226
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,871
What if the preacher was right,

227
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,499
and Elvis' music
literally drives Memphis insane?

228
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,501
Then we have to get it
before that happens.

229
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,842
I got it. Elvis' guitar Totem.

230
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,073
So I'm not the only one
who finds that annoying, right?

231
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,158
- So annoying.
- Yeah.

232
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,718
Okay, come on.
We're good to go, right?

233
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,089
Are we? 'Cause Elvis hasn't recorded
his first single yet.

234
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,904
And without that guitar,
he may never record,

235
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,207
which means
rock 'n' roll history is...

236
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,597
Josh Groban.

237
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,961
What if we have Gideon
fabricate a ringer guitar

238
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,442
and drop it off to the future King?

239
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,395
Great idea. I call a mission.

240
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,092
Amaya, come with me. I will teach you
what rock 'n' roll's all about.

241
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,199
Till then, everyone,
shake, rattle and roll.

242
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,181
Beale Street was the heart

243
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,321
of the music scene

244
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,371
in Memphis in the 1950s.

245
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,954
Brothels, churches, juke joints.

246
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,832
All next to each other,
all black-owned.

247
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,665
This, this was
the spirit of rock 'n' roll.

248
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,134
There he is.

249
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,089
- It was right here.
- Hey, kid.

250
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,452
I don't think you wanna keep this
lyin' around.

251
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,578
Something tells me it's special.

252
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,843
You have no idea.

253
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,998
There's no way I'd ever be able
to thank you for this.

254
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,479
If you wanna write a song about me

255
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,057
there are several words that rhyme
with "Nate."

256
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,525
Just knock 'em dead.

257
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,903
I can't wait for you
to see Elvis live.

258
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,985
It's going to change your life.

259
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,154
You really believe that my life
can be changed by one song?

260
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,662
Of course. Music is so much more
than just a song.

261
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,076
Music is about identity.

262
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,126
It's hearing a track
for the first time,

263
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,173
and you think to yourself,
"Wow, this is who I am."

264
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,836
I don't care how long it takes.
We're gonna find your music,

265
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,421
whether be it rock 'n' roll or,
God forbid, ska.

266
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,679
<i>Debuting tonight, y'all,
give it up for Elvis Presley!</i>

267
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,555
I guess it's time
to have my life changed.

268
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,681
Yep.

269
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,847
How you folks doing tonight?

270
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,232
Ow!

271
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,482
If it's all right with y'all,
I'mma play a little song for my mama.

272
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,379
Now, you...

273
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,504
Wait. Don't go.

274
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,036
Why? You all wanna make fun
of my playin' like everybody else?

275
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,517
No, actually, we're, uh...

276
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,886
We're music managers.

277
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,055
And we think you're very talented.

278
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,266
So, uh, what happened up there?

279
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,277
This doggone guitar ain't working
how it's supposed to.

280
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,946
Y'all gonna think I'm crazy, but...

281
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,740
My guitar, it's more
than just a guitar.

282
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,179
Now that it ain't
working right, I just...

283
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,115
You don't feel like yourself anymore?

284
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,946
Yes, ma'am.

285
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,953
And I'll tell you why,
usually when I play...

286
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,205
I got my twin brother, Jesse,
up there to back me up.

287
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,036
You have a twin brother?

288
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,380
Yeah, he ain't with us no more.

289
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,082
Passed when he was a baby.

290
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,214
But this guitar of mine,
used to connect me to him.

291
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,138
- Told you, you'd think I'm crazy.
- No. Not at all.

292
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,138
I've always believed that objects
can connect us to our ancestors.

293
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,561
Yeah, I guess we call it
a "spirit life."

294
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,647
But on stage...

295
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,520
On stage, just now, for the
first time, Jesse wasn't with me.

296
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,527
I mean, he's gone all of a sudden.
I just don't know where he is.

297
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,817
Whoa. That was weird.

298
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,824
Yeah, you feel that?

299
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,955
It's freezing.

300
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,408
<i>I am detecting an
EMF reading of six milligauss</i>

301
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,494
<i>that is disturbing the ship's
electrical service.</i>

302
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,874
- EM... What?
- Electromagnetic field.

303
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,831
It's a scientific term
that's been wrapped up

304
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,713
in a bunch of paranormal nonsense.

305
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,757
Paranormal, as in...

306
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,731
Ghosts.

307
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,116
Whoever you are,
just put the guitar down.

308
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,876
Doesn't look like
he's taking requests.

309
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,128
Maybe the preacher was right
about rock 'n' roll.

310
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,540
You know what never hurt anyone?

311
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:08,798
A nice show tune.

312
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,893
I got it!

313
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,986
Okay, Axl, time to break the seal.

314
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,580
- Axl, come back!
- What the hell is going on?

315
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,991
Guitar hit me in the head.

316
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,119
Oh, that explains nothing.

317
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,464
I got ya.

318
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,669
- The guitar, it's haunted!
- We know.

319
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,597
But by who?

320
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,716
That's what's so strange
about my brother.

321
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,851
I ain't never met Jesse,
but somehow,

322
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,228
I've missed him all my life.

323
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,976
Until you bought your first guitar.

324
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,602
Man at the store said it was cursed.

325
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,980
He's only half-right,
it's also a blessing, too.

326
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,984
I don't know if my brother's
out there, somewhere without me.

327
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,485
I can't imagine he's too happy.

328
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,326
Excuse me.

329
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,034
Guys, Elvis' guitar is haunted.

330
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,413
- We know.
- We know.

331
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,647
Yeah, and I'm guessing it's gonna do

332
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,065
whatever it takes
to get back to Elvis.

333
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,421
Good guess!

334
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,042
- Where is Axl?
- About that ghost...

335
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,677
It's Elvis' dead twin, Jesse.

336
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,763
Jesse, stop!

337
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,096
We know your brother.

338
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,056
I know this all sounds like hogwash.

339
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,934
Magical guitars, the ghosts
of gone family members.

340
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,807
But I can't play without them.

341
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,689
I got a session to record
at Sun Studios tomorrow.

342
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,145
I saved up to buy it.

343
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,599
It's your first recording session?

344
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,152
You're gonna keep that appointment.

345
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,655
- And we're gonna get you Jesse back.
- You will?

346
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,369
We will?

347
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,324
All right, so I talked to Constantine
about our Totem.

348
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,621
He compared it with his notes,
and this...

349
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,335
Is what he found.

350
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,167
Death Totem, badass.

351
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,840
Yeah, and whoever wields it
has domain over the dead.

352
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,720
Which is why we need to keep this
Totem with us and safe at all times.

353
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,341
Elvis needs his Totem back.

354
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,015
You have no idea
what we are dealing with.

355
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,301
"The Death Totem.

356
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,219
"The most volatile of all
of the Totems.

357
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,398
"Lost for eons, along with
the sixth tribe of Zambesi."

358
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,313
Maybe they suffered the same fate
that's about to befall Memphis.

359
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,714
- You don't understand.
- No.

360
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,882
You don't understand.
We are talking about a Death Totem,

361
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,523
and it could turn this
whole place into a ghost town.

362
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,326
Elvis has a session at Sun Studios.

363
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:45,076
That's where he cuts his first demo.
That's how he gets discovered, okay?

364
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,080
We do not have the time
for Elvis to get his groove back.

365
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,161
- Jesse has to be there.
- Nathaniel.

366
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,588
I understand
how important this is to you,

367
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,132
but we can't give Elvis a Totem
just to save his music.

368
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,550
It's not about the music, okay?

369
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,176
Rock has inspired
many historic milestones,

370
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,881
protests, revolutions.

371
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,682
Me losing my virginity.

372
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,814
Elvis doesn't need a Totem forever.

373
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,270
Just one song that changes the world.

374
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,436
Please.

375
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,868
Fine.

376
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,570
You take it to him,
you let him record with it,

377
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,781
and you stay with it at all times.

378
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,748
At all times!

379
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,250
At all times!

380
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,843
All right, son. Are you ready
to lay this down on wax, or what?

381
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,511
I've been waiting all my life, sir.

382
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,157
Now, that's rock 'n' roll.

383
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,492
What do you think?

384
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,709
It's okay.

385
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,919
I just don't see
how it's worth risking

386
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,342
the most volatile of Totems for.

387
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,172
Wow. I thought that was gonna be
our music moment.

388
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,805
"Our music moment"?

389
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,258
One of those times
where the right song comes on,

390
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:32,146
and ties everything together
so perfectly, that it becomes...

391
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,559
It becomes a story.

392
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,937
We already have plenty of stories.

393
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,483
We saved the world together,

394
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,607
we saw dinosaurs.

395
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,737
There was that time
that I discovered Netflix

396
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,907
and we watched every episode
of <i>Friends</i> in one week.

397
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,950
All stunning accomplishments, yes.

398
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,823
But the music moment is different.

399
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,241
You'll see.

400
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,624
How was that?

401
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,918
Whoo, boy! Now, that's a record.

402
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,263
We gotta get this straight down
to WHBQ.

403
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,510
You're gonna be on the radio.

404
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,887
- Whoo, boy!
- Yeah.

405
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,056
Uncle Lucius.
What are you doing here?

406
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,887
Well, well, well.

407
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,600
You missed choir practice.

408
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:21,229
Then, I hear, 'cause you're down
at Sun Studios.

409
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,779
Well, no kin of mine

410
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,777
is gonna record the Devil's music.

411
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,950
Not after what we saw in church.

412
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,244
I got talent. My manager says so.

413
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,246
You got my nephew into this?

414
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,706
Yeah.

415
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,216
- Hey, that ain't yours to take.
- Give me that.

416
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,790
I knew you'd put up a fight!

417
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,213
Sheriff!

418
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,540
Get him out of here.

419
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,671
Let's see if a night
in the jailhouse

420
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,218
rocks some sense into you.

421
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,282
That record's gotta make it
on the radio tonight.

422
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,284
- Get him out of here, too.
- You're making a huge mistake.

423
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,095
Get behind me, Satan.

424
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,637
White Stripes, great album.
At least it was.

425
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,147
Your mama's been too easy
on you, boy.

426
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,820
Look at the sort
you got mixed up with.

427
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,235
These are the types that go on down
to Beale Street

428
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,889
and dance the hoochie koo
like heathens.

429
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,663
You keep on preaching hate.

430
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,540
I'm only trying
to bring folks together.

431
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,243
As the Lord destroyed the wicked,

432
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,503
I must do the same with this record.

433
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,879
I'll make an example of you
at the Heavenly Nights of Hymns.

434
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,052
That ought to teach them
young folks a lesson.

435
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,299
Reverend, you don't know
what you're messing with.

436
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,053
- The music your nephew made...
- Has turned Memphis

437
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,724
into Sodom and Gomorrah.

438
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,554
I will not allow it
to be the ruination

439
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,436
of that boy's soul, too.

440
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,519
Don't worry,
we'll get you out of here.

441
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,197
All I ever wanted to do
was make my mama proud.

442
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,071
Now, she ain't never gonna hear
my song on the radio.

443
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,624
At least I still got you, Jesse.

444
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,126
Guys, we have a bit of a setback.

445
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,440
- We're listening, what's up?
<i>- Uh, long story, funny ending,</i>

446
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,626
Amaya, Elvis and I
were thrown in the slammer.

447
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,379
So, just steel up and break out.

448
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,801
Yeah, I know I can, but I'm afraid
my work here isn't done.

449
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,740
- What do you need?
<i>- I need you to go back to the church,</i>

450
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,084
<i>get the record from the Reverend,</i>

451
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:16,135
and bring it to WHBQ
and make sure it debuts tonight.

452
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,309
On it.

453
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,623
Despite everything you've seen,

454
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,625
I really think my powers
could come in handy right now,

455
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,729
because I could just go
grab that record, and then...

456
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,642
Okay, if this were a Central City
bank robbery,

457
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,457
sure, you could just speed in,
save the day,

458
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,716
the mayor would give you
a key to the city.

459
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,593
That actually happened, you know.
Barry and I...

460
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,949
History is different.

461
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,652
You can't be a chainsaw,
you need to be a scalpel.

462
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,612
You need to get in there,
talk to people.

463
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,072
Find out what they really need.

464
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,916
Now, let's go talk to the preacher
like human beings.

465
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,169
Okay, Axl,
I know how to draw you out.

466
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:50,177
With a nice little snack.

467
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,267
Mick? Mick, don't panic.
You just forgot to chew again.

468
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,733
Axl.

469
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,438
Is this one of your
stupid science experiments?

470
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,568
- Looks like Josh Groban...
- "Axl!"

471
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,948
...had something even more lethal
than your Elvis sandwich.

472
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,953
I'm sorry, buddy.

473
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,451
Look, the life expectancy of a rat

474
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,204
is one and half to two
and a half years, so, you know,

475
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,786
the little guy really beat the odds.

476
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,041
And you know what?

477
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,568
We can pick you up another one
in the next time period we stop in.

478
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,211
Because what's one more change
on this ship?

479
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,425
<i>Jailhouse</i>

480
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,602
<i>Jailhouse party</i>

481
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,805
Getting warmer.

482
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,599
There's gotta be a song
in here somewhere, Jesse.

483
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,810
Okay, songwriting time-out.

484
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,777
Listen, um...

485
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,485
There's no easy way to say this,

486
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,781
but when we get out of here,

487
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,984
you're gonna have to give us
that guitar.

488
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,411
It has power,
and it can be dangerous.

489
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,786
No. I mean,
I can't play without Jesse.

490
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:06,249
I mean, before he came along,
sure there were songs,

491
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,622
but there wasn't ever any music.

492
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,504
Look, even after he's gone,
you're gonna have the music.

493
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,004
I mean, that's why you play, right?

494
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,091
The real reason music matters,

495
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,924
is because it keeps things alive
long after they're gone.

496
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,136
Any idea why Ray needs us?

497
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,513
No clue.

498
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,896
Whatever this is, I don't like it.

499
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,480
Wait. What is that?

500
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,312
We are gathered here

501
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,068
in remembrance
of our dear friend, Axl.

502
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,400
Right. I'm out of here.

503
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,029
- I'm with him.
- Wait, you need this.

504
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,071
We all need this.

505
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,949
Fine, but when I mourn, I drink.

506
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,833
Fair enough.

507
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,461
Charles Dickens once wrote,

508
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,249
"Life is made
of ever so many partings

509
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,925
"welded together."

510
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,298
Axl is once such parting.

511
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,423
And while we may lose some,
they're never really gone,

512
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,637
and they certainly can't be replaced.

513
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,807
They'll live on in the memories
we shared with them,

514
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,604
and the lessons they taught us.

515
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,893
And it's because of that,

516
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,525
that we can embrace the change.

517
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,938
I still remember
the first time I met Axl.

518
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,318
It was in the vents.

519
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,484
I was tiny Atom, he was a big rat.

520
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,110
And he tried to eat me.

521
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,862
I knew we'd laugh
about it one day together.

522
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,161
Sara, I believe it's customary
for the captain

523
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,412
to share a few words.

524
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,795
- Oh, no. You're doing a great job.
- Thank you.

525
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:35,254
Well, then, please join me
in a chorus of <i>Sweet Child of Mine.</i>

526
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,126
Mmm-mmm.

527
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,011
All right, I'll say something.

528
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,301
Mmm.

529
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,556
Axl was a friend.

530
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,766
Our friend.

531
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,857
Some might say he was the best of us.

532
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,447
Can we have a word?

533
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,030
And not the good word,
we just wanna talk.

534
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,956
What could you possibly
wanna talk about?

535
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,999
We need to talk about your nephew
and his record.

536
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,418
You can't destroy it.

537
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,541
People need to hear it.
That includes you.

538
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,214
How do you all know
what I need to hear?

539
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,760
I might actually know
what you are going through.

540
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,221
You see, my dad,
he came into my life pretty late.

541
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,141
We couldn't always
figure each other out.

542
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,640
We didn't always know how to fit
into each other's lives,

543
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,516
until I knew that I just had to go

544
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,564
and set out on my own.

545
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,480
Truly sorry to hear that, son.

546
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,821
I think you might be afraid
that you're losing your nephew.

547
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,779
But if you both could just try
to understand each other,

548
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,361
you might actually find something new
between you two.

549
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,367
You might even find something
really special.

550
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,687
Now, I know someone
that would love to play that record

551
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,202
if you're ready to give it a chance.

552
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,960
And a lot of young souls
would be moved

553
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,130
by your nephew's voice.

554
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,047
Hmm.

555
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,853
Mysterious ways indeed.

556
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,904
Okay, so, we walked real far,

557
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,098
and it took a long time,
and then we got thrown around...

558
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,456
History is at stake.
You better run fast.

559
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,793
<i>Hoo-wee. Daddy-O Dewey here
with a new record</i>

560
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,549
<i>literally burning my fingers,</i>

561
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,302
<i>by a young local boy
name of Elvis Presley.</i>

562
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,223
<i>Remember where you heard it first.</i>

563
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,385
How on Earth?

564
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,606
My nephew is on the radio.

565
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,314
My nephew is on the radio!

566
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,400
Well, I'll be...

567
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,652
The kid kept his promise.

568
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,783
<i>So I'm gone</i>

569
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,574
<i>Yeah, I'm gone</i>

570
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,456
<i>I'm gone, gone mama</i>

571
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,873
<i>It would seem that Ms. Tomaz
and Mr. West have succeeded.</i>

572
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,296
<i>I'm gone, gone mama</i>

573
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,884
To Axl.

574
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,465
For Axl.

575
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,494
<i>I'm going to get me
a big pink Cadillac</i>

576
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,347
Been ages since I've seen
so much life in this place.

577
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,140
Maybe you ain't so ungodly
as I thought.

578
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,109
You know, you and I
might have different names for God,

579
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,653
but I'm guessing
we have a lot in common, too.

580
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,364
- What took you so long?
- Seriously?

581
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,290
Hey, um, what does dancing
look like in the future?

582
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,494
- Oh, um... Pretty much the same.
- Hmm.

583
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,463
Oh, no.

584
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,034
Great. Well, we'd love
to stick around for hymn night,

585
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,207
but we should head back to...

586
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,751
On second thought,
how about those hymns?

587
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,256
That music, it's summoned the dead.

588
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,827
This time,
he actually might be right.

589
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,037
Don't tell me you're converting.

590
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,644
Elvis recorded that song
with the Death Totem.

591
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,689
It must have given his music
the power to literally raise spirits.

592
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:00,775
You're kidding.

593
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,067
This must've been what drives
everyone out of Memphis.

594
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,827
Right, ghosts can go
through anything.

595
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,612
It's kind of their thing.

596
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,342
Okay, Mick, time to send him off.

597
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,061
What?

598
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,393
Axl lives.

599
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,487
You just had to throw
a rodent funeral, didn't you?

600
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,867
Where's it going?

601
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,325
Remember, the real points come
from taking out the ghosts.

602
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,456
Let's make Miss Pac-Man proud.

603
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,791
How's that for a high score?

604
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,548
Impressive, but I think it's
gonna be game-over soon.

605
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,052
At least you got to hear yourself
on the radio.

606
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:19,432
Don't go quoting this to my uncle but
I sound pretty damn good, don't I?

607
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,852
Hey, what's going on out there?

608
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,461
The whole town's been
overrun by ghosts!

609
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,351
- Well, let us out!
- Let me in!

610
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,614
- The Death Totem.
- Death Totem.

611
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,959
Well, I'll be...

612
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,048
It worked.

613
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,708
You can command spirits.

614
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,907
Well, if you can raise them,
maybe you can also lead them away.

615
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,220
Lead them where?

616
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,746
How about back where they came from?

617
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,591
The cemetery
outside your uncle's church.

618
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,482
You were right.

619
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,651
His music really does have power.

620
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,571
Could have stood being wrong
on this one.

621
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,611
Well, we need to get
past them somehow.

622
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,404
Don't be scared.

623
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,703
The dead don't want nothing
but to be acknowledged.

624
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,101
I mean, is there anything
this guy can't do?

625
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,570
I knew I should have smashed
that record when I had the chance.

626
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,528
Now your song has gone
and let the Devil into my church.

627
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,863
This ain't the Devil's doing.

628
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,449
And you're right,
music has a power.

629
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,456
Brings life to the lifeless,
soothes the souls of the restless,

630
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,378
but it ain't just rock 'n' roll,
either.

631
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,167
And I would like to prove it.

632
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,965
Put an end to all this
while I'm at it?

633
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,382
Now,

634
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,634
get on up there, boy.

635
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,643
Now, I know y'all can hear me.

636
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,690
Come on in.

637
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,275
All are welcome here.

638
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:51,292
<i>Amazing grace</i>

639
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:55,625
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

640
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,802
<i>That saved</i>

641
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:03,223
<i>A wretch like me</i>

642
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,971
Should we take 'em out?

643
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,431
No, it's okay.

644
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,183
I think I understand what they need.

645
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:14,774
<i>I once was lost, but now am found</i>

646
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,647
<i>T'was blind</i>

647
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:22,948
<i>But now I see</i>

648
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,327
<i>T'was grace</i>

649
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,867
<i>That taught</i>

650
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,422
<i>My heart to fear</i>

651
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,254
I actually know this one.

652
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,100
Care to dance?

653
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,578
Axl.

654
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,790
I'm sorry,
your corpse is starting to stink.

655
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,371
I didn't think you'd mind.

656
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:20,419
I, uh, saved you a sammie.

657
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,355
Axl, what's wrong?

658
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,965
I think it's time, brother.

659
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,919
I've got a feeling this goodbye
ain't gonna be forever.

660
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,095
Thank you, Jesse.

661
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,632
Thank you very much.

662
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:41,461
I think we just found our moment.

663
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,273
Better make yourself comfortable.

664
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,595
Something tells me you'll be spending
a lot more time in here,

665
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,406
especially after that show
you just put on.

666
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,658
Yeah, something came over me,
I guess.

667
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,831
I was up there,
looking at those ghosts,

668
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:17,376
I realized, one day, this is all
gonna be over for all of us.

669
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,545
Might as well get the most
out of life that we can.

670
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,209
You know what?

671
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,792
I think you just discovered
the spirit of rock 'n' roll.

672
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,092
And I think that this...

673
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,842
Is probably gonna be safer with you.

674
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,094
That was fun and all, but...

675
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,180
I don't soon want
to be raising the dead again.

676
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,513
Promise me you'll keep playing
even without your brother.

677
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,521
Oh, Jesse ain't really gone.

678
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,026
The things he taught me,
the love that we had,

679
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,774
is gonna live on with my music.

680
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,160
Can I ask you a question?

681
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,330
You ain't really
a music manager, are you?

682
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,200
Busted.

683
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,411
Well, something tells me,
you're gonna be just fine.

684
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,505
Even without this.

685
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,373
Thanks to you.

686
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,878
I think I'm just about ready.

687
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,634
Go get 'em.

688
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,804
All right, gentlemen,
how are y'all doing?

689
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,386
I say we start it off
with some little bit of fast tempo.

690
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,472
Okay, fellas,
get your fingers going.

691
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,313
You're ready, Captain?

692
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,150
Hello, gorgeous.

693
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,610
- Look at that volume.
- Don't touch it.

694
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:33,889
- I think you...
- I'm serious, don't.

695
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,576
Well, well, well.
Look who got his swagger back.

696
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,453
Hey, just because
I saved rock 'n' roll

697
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,383
and reinstated the King
to his proper throne...

698
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,255
Doesn't give you an excuse
to hog our one bathroom.

699
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,423
- Some of us need to get...
- Celebrate the fact that

700
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,250
we beat the Darhks
to the Death Totem.

701
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,864
Although I don't imagine
our acquisition

702
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,254
will stay off the radar for long.

703
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,758
Well, think of it like this.

704
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,262
We're four Totems up
in the fourth quarter.

705
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,760
Time's running out for those idiots.

706
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,266
Yep, even though
they still have mine.

707
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,835
There will be time to send them back
to whatever hell they came from

708
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,100
once we get your Totem back.

709
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,504
Yeah, and in the meantime,
we need to make sure

710
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,360
we keep that Death Totem on lock.

711
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:08,697
Box.

712
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,106
Lockboxes.

713
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,819
I got it covered.

714
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,361
I made encrypted lockboxes
for each one of the Totems.

715
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,037
Well, good.

716
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,366
The Death Totem's powers
are not to be taken lightly.

717
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,838
<i>Perhaps you need
some assistance, Ms. Jiwe.</i>

718
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,465
Just give me a moment,
Gideon, please.

719
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,209
I've sabotaged Axis tanks.

720
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,171
I am sure I can figure out
a stupid playlist.

721
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,510
Hey, Gideon said you wanna see me?

722
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,887
I wanted to say thank you.

723
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,058
Oh, you know...

724
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,015
Check you out.

725
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,312
You got a playlist going.

726
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,640
As soon as I'm done uploading
all The Smiths' music,

727
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,670
we'll do a deep dive
into the Morrissey solo stuff...

728
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,731
Actually, I thought it was time
for me to teach you

729
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,357
about my music.

730
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,651
Okay.

731
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,613
Like some big band stuff?

732
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,282
I think I'm at a point where
I can appreciate a trumpet solo.

733
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,989
No, this is the music of Zambesi.

734
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,625
Gideon helped me locate
some supposedly lost tracks.

735
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
You like it?

736
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,710
Oh...

737
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,212
I love it!

738
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:12,386
So good.

739
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,462
Now you know
how I feel about rock 'n' roll.

740
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,671
What's that?

741
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,885
I said you're almost
at the good part.

742
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,474
You mean this isn't the good part?

743
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,603
I love you, Nathaniel.

744
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,932
What?

745
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,194
I said, there's a lot more
where that came from.

746
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,396
It's a good thing we got time.
