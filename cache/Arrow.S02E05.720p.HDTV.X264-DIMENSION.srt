1
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:02,964
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:05,874
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,744 --> 00:00:09,962
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:12,748
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,720
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:19,621
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:22,591
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:27,129
I must be something else.

9
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:28,606
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:30,891
We would like to serve
notice to the defense,

11
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:32,976
pursuant to rule of
criminal procedure 15.

12
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:34,227
I would like to have
a conversation with you

13
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,064
before you seek
the death penalty.

14
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:38,849
Moira, what don't I know?

15
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:40,517
There are some things

16
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:43,070
that must never
be spoken of.

17
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:46,490
He's beaten me twice, and I
don't know how to stop him.

18
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:52,996
Who are you?

19
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:55,198
Once you know, your life
will never be the same.

20
00:00:57,368 --> 00:01:00,103
Sara?

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,182
Yeah, Dad,
college is great.

22
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:15,802
No, me and my new roommate
totally hit it off.

23
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:18,188
We're like besties.

24
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,057
Ok. Yeah, dad,
I got to get back to chem lab.

25
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:22,008
Yes. It looks like
I got a long night ahead of me.

26
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,861
Psst. Get off
the phone!

27
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:26,563
Love you, Dad. Bye.

28
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:28,398
Ollie.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,867
You are trouble.

30
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,286
How is
Detective Lance?

31
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:35,322
Ah, he's clueless,
as usual.

32
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:40,660
Guess I was thirsty.

33
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:43,714
Did you hear that?

34
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:47,217
1, 2, 3...

35
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,387
It's getting closer.

36
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:53,090
That's not very
scientific.

37
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:56,393
And what would you know
about science,

38
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:59,429
Mr. Ivy league drop out?

39
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,982
I happen to know
a lot about science.

40
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:04,818
I know...
Fermentation.

41
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,938
I know...Biology.

42
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,574
♪ I'm tearing up
this joint, ready or not ♪

43
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,659
♪ in with my crew
and we're turning heads ♪

44
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:15,028
♪ you play it right,

45
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,730
Mmm. Laurel's
going to kill me.

46
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:19,666
She's so going to kill me.

47
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:22,919
Your sister
will never know.

48
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,421
Just come here.

49
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:29,426
Ok, that one was really close.

50
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:31,211
Sara.

51
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:33,547
We're going
to be fine.

52
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:49,696
Sara?

53
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:52,315
Sara!

54
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,458
Help! Help!

55
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:06,463
Sara!

56
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:10,717
Oliver!

57
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:18,558
In sports, the international
basketball league was busy

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,127
last night with seven games
on the schedule.

59
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,180
The Cavaliers came up
with a surprise upset...

60
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:24,714
Can't sleep?

61
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:26,733
I don't do well
with my eyes closed.

62
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:29,503
Hey, thanks
for letting me stay here.

63
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:31,054
I know you got a lot
going on with your mom.

64
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:32,956
Thea's mostly staying
at her boyfriend's.

65
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,660
So...don't worry about anyone
finding out that you're back.

66
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:38,912
Thanks for understanding.

67
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:41,832
I don't understand.

68
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,417
You know, not a day goes by
that your family doesn't miss you.

69
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:48,405
Yeah? How do you know?

70
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,190
Because I missed you.

71
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,711
I don't think they'll be as happy
to see me as you think.

72
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:56,546
How can you say that?

73
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:59,099
I know how hard it is

74
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:01,685
to come home when you've
been gone for so long.

75
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:05,222
I'm guessing my father
and Laurel

76
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:06,773
weren't too happy to see you.

77
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:09,776
No.
No, not at first.

78
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:13,446
I wasn't sure if you
and she ever got back together.

79
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:15,682
We tried.

80
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:18,235
It's too much.

81
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:22,622
Yeah some things, you know,
it's better left in the past.

82
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:32,799
I'm done waiting for Mr. Queen.
Let's get started.

83
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,135
Sorry I'm late.

84
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:39,038
There's an old friend...
In town.

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,874
I just finished explaining
to your mother and sister

86
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:43,810
that Miss Lance will be
sitting second chair

87
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:45,145
for the prosecution.

88
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:46,813
This is a conflict of interest.

89
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:48,565
Miss Lance practically
grew up in the Queen house.

90
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,433
I think
you're overstating matters.

91
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:53,153
Oh, we'll see when I move to conflict
Miss Lance off this case.

92
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:56,556
Maybe there won't be
a case much longer.

93
00:04:56,558 --> 00:04:58,909
I come here not just
with Miss Lance,

94
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:01,361
but also
with a plea offer.

95
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:04,915
Life, with
the possibility of parole.

96
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,899
No.

97
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:09,286
We are not pleading out.
Mrs. Queen is innocent.

98
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:11,621
She aided
and abetted 503 homicides.

99
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:15,308
Under duress from a homicidal maniac
named Malcolm Merlyn.

100
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,477
She also withdrew
from the criminal conspiracy

101
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,630
prior to its execution.
Five minutes prior.

102
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:22,515
With Malcolm Merlyn
dead, a jury's going

103
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:24,384
to want to have
to blame someone.

104
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:25,685
If she doesn't
take the deal,

105
00:05:25,687 --> 00:05:27,754
then she's facing
the death penalty.

106
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,723
Sounds a lot
like blackmail.

107
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,808
Try reality.
And here's some more--

108
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,945
we've subpoenaed over a decades'
worth of phone messages,

109
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,280
phone records,
letters and emails.

110
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:41,785
I'm willing to bet I find something that
crushes your duress defense

111
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:43,486
to powder.

112
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,574
Mr. Donner...

113
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:52,629
If you don't mind, I'd like a few days
to consider your offer.

114
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:54,631
Of course.

115
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:59,502
Excuse me.

116
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:02,722
I'll be right back.

117
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:05,842
Laurel?

118
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:10,930
I'll meet you
at the car.

119
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:17,070
You're prosecuting
my mother?

120
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:20,440
I didn't ask for this case.
I was assigned.

121
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:23,243
So say no!
It's a new job, Oliver.

122
00:06:23,245 --> 00:06:25,578
I don't have a lot of pull.
And what pull I do have,

123
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,781
I used to get that
plea bargain for your mother.

124
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:30,250
This was your idea?

125
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:32,151
Life in prison?

126
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:35,872
The D.A. is serious
about the death penalty, Ollie.

127
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:38,425
We both know what it's like
to lose someone.

128
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:43,513
So think about it
and save your mother's life.

129
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,935
Are you ok?

130
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:51,054
In case I wasn't clear
last week...

131
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:53,640
I'm done answering
that question.

132
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:50,747
Help!

133
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:52,282
Help!

134
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:54,667
Over here!

135
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:04,127
Sara?

136
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,980
Sara.

137
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:08,798
You ok?

138
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,383
How did everything
go with your mother?

139
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:13,853
I ran into your sister.
She's working on the case.

140
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:15,472
You didn't tell her...
No.

141
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:18,858
I know a little something about
keeping secrets

142
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,978
and respecting them,
even though I don't...

143
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,898
totally understand why
you're keeping yours.

144
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:29,101
Is this--

145
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:31,938
is it because of what happened
on the island?

146
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:36,142
No.

147
00:08:36,144 --> 00:08:38,962
After.

148
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:41,965
There were things
that I did;

149
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,467
things that I had
to do to survive.

150
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:47,587
Things that there's
no forgiveness for.

151
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:50,173
Well, that's the thing
about forgiveness--

152
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,393
you can't get it
until you ask for it.

153
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:01,151
Merlyn?

154
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:41,274
Who are you?

155
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:44,093
Just a warrior. Like you.

156
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:48,180
Why are you dressed
like Malcolm Merlyn?

157
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:51,401
Huh? Who sent you?!

158

I remember the first time
I saw this hood.

161
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,584
Shado was wearing it.

This is quite the set-up
that you got here.

163
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,591
Where you're launching
your one man war for starling.

164
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:30,125
I'm not one man.

165
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:31,844
These are my friends.

166
00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:35,147
This is John Diggle
and Felicity Smoak.

167
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,149
Guys. This is Sara.

168
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,235
Welcome home, Sara.

169
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:41,487
I was happy to hear
you're not dead anymore.

170
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:44,657
I mean, I didn't know you before
you didn't die the first time.

171
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:47,142
I'm still glad you're alive.
Thank you.

172
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:49,311
We just had an uninvited
guest in the Queen mansion.

173
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:52,081
Trained. Highly skilled.

174
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,982
And he was dressed like Merlyn.

175
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:55,785
Well, the last I checked
Malcolm Merlyn was dead,

176
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,453
courtesy of an arrow
jammed through his heart.

177
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,855
It wasn't him.
It was a follower, an underling

178
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:02,708
bent on revenge.
Whoever it was...

179
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,510
He knows who I am.

180
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,462
Gee, I didn't
get you a bag of dirt.

181
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,881
I found it in the house.
Copycat Merlyn tracked it in.

182
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:11,333
I want you to analyze it.
Hopefully it'll lead me right to him.

183
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:12,968
Then what?
If this pretender

184
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,687
wants to follow
Malcolm Merlyn so badly,

185
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,106
he can follow him
right into a grave.

186
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:19,725
Sara? We'll find this guy.

187
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:22,728
I don't want you to.

188
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:26,148
What do you mean?

189
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,450
He wasn't after you, Ollie.

190
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:29,752
He's after me.

191
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:31,620
Who is he?

192
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:35,324
He's called Al Owal,
"The First."

193
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:38,694
And he's a member
of the League of Assassins.

194
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:40,746
The League
of Assassins?

195
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:42,698
I thought they were a myth.

196
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,466
What's the League of Assassins?
And please,

197
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:46,585
don't say it's a league
made up of assassins.

198
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:49,255
No, it's an urban legend.
I heard about them in Afghanistan

199
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:51,056
from a tribal leader.
He claimed there was

200
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,908
an ancient sect of assassins,

201
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,945
deadly warriors that killed
and vanished like ghosts.

202
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:59,515
Thought he was smoking
what he was selling.

203
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:03,102
I tried to tell you, Ollie,
but you wouldn't listen.

204
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:04,987
That's where you've been
the past four years.

205
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:08,090
That's where
you learned to fight.

206
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,000
You're one of them.

207
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:12,312
After the freighter,

208
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:14,749
a member of the league
rescued me; Took me in

209
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:17,073
and brought me
to Nanda Parbatt.

210
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:20,093
They remade me
into what I am.

211
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,929
And I swore them
my allegiance.

212
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:26,299
Why are they kicking down doors
trying to find you now?

213
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:29,602
Because I left.

214
00:12:29,604 --> 00:12:32,188
And there's only way
that you leave the league.

215
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:37,444
Is that why you didn't want
to see your family?

216
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:43,283
A year ago,
I was in Guyana.

217
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:46,703
I was sent there
for a man named Suarez.

218
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:48,538
He was a local diplomat.

219
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:52,659
And I slit his throat.

220
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:55,111
In his bed.

221
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:57,797
And his kids...

222
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:01,801
They found his body
in the morning.

223
00:13:04,138 --> 00:13:07,307
I'm a murderer, Ollie.

224
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,142
You think that my family

225
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:11,895
will be happy to see me?

226
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:21,704
I have to go
to Iron Heights.

227
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:25,141
Felicity, I need you
to find this Al Owal.

228
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:37,170
Thank you,
thank you.

229
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:39,822
What were you doing out there?

230
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:42,342
The boat that I was on,

231
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,878
and we got caught
in the storm.

232
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,497
Wait, wait, wait, guys!

233
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:51,217
Wait! I--Robert Queen.
Robert Queen.

234
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,886
It was his boat,
and--and--

235
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:56,523
he'll pay whatever
you want, please!

236
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:08,401
Please, please!

237
00:14:08,403 --> 00:14:11,070
Please, no!

238
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:15,041
Please, please!

239
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:19,379
Please, no! No!
You've made a mistake.

240
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:20,863
Please let me out.

241
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:24,033
Why won't you let me--
no, please, come back!

242
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:26,970
Let me out!

243
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:30,056
You cannot be serious!

244
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:32,509
What's going on here?
She wants to take the deal!

245
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:34,727
Whoa! If this is
about the death penalty...

246
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,879
I've been explaining
this to your mother.

247
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:39,065
Even if we ever get
to sentencing,

248
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:41,734
you were acting under duress.
I have everything I need

249
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:44,220
to keep them from
sentencing you to death.

250
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:46,055
The death penalty
doesn't scare me, Jean.

251
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:48,024
Then why aren't you
fighting?

252
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:50,276
I have my reasons.
Name one.

253
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:51,528
Because I'm tired of fighting.

254
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,446
I am not confident
that I can win

255
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:55,748
over a jury.

256
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,235
And I'm not altogether certain
that I deserve to.

257
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:00,736
That was actually three.
Thea...

258
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:04,040
No, seriously, you're just ready
to give up?!

259
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:08,261
Just take your medicine and
spend the rest of your life in here.

260
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:09,629
We still need you.

261
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:12,248
I still need you.

262
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:15,935
I--I can't take this.

263
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:32,902
Growing up...

264
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:37,624
I didn't think that there were
secrets kept between us.

265
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:39,776
Last year
I learned different.

266
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:41,411
And I've gotten
pretty good

267
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:43,630
at knowing when you're hiding
something from me.

268
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,332
So, Mom...

269
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:51,454
What are you
hiding now?

270
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:57,343
Help your sister
come to terms with my choice,

271
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:59,812
because it's made.

272
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:06,853
Sorry if I upset you before.

273
00:16:06,855 --> 00:16:09,772
We all join clubs
we wish we hadn't.

274
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:12,408
It took me a year to get out
of that gym membership.

275
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:15,978
Thank you.

276
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,280
For what?

277
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:19,315
Not making me
feel like what I am.

278
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:22,669
Oliver's lucky to have you
both as friends.

279
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,872
He hasn't always
had the best luck in that area.

280
00:16:25,874 --> 00:16:28,324
How'd it go with your mother?
Not well.

281
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,877
Have you found somebody
for me to hit yet?

282
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,596
Could be. Spectro analysis
of the dirt from your house

283
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:35,651
had trace amounts
of aldicarb in them.

284
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:36,939
What?
It's a pesticide.

285
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,436
Starling City used to have
its own aldicarb plant,

286
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:42,055
but per the EPA,
it was shut down three years ago.

287
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:44,524
What's it being used for now?
Nothing. It's abandoned.

288
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:45,808
But my guess is,
it's the homebase

289
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,978
to one League
of Assassins assassin.

290
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,980
He will kill you.

291
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:53,733
Like you, I am not that
easy to get rid of.

292
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:55,351
This is my fight.
He made it my fight

293
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:57,737
when he came
into my house.

294
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:01,207
And when he threatened
somebody that I care about.

295
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:28,735
Arrows.

296
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:32,605
Such an ineffective
projectile.

297
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:37,610
I find it strange anyone
who still fears them.

298
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:39,112
I'll show you why--

299
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:41,164
if you don't leave
Sara Lance alone.

300
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,615
This is your only warning.

301
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:45,118
And it would be
effective,

302
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,920
were you to pose
a threat to me.

303
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:50,573
You barely defeated
Malcolm Merlyn

304
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:54,410
at nearly the cost
of your own life.

305
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:59,265
What hope would you have
against the man who trained him?

306
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:02,251
Helps that I didn't
come alone.

307
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:09,859
The child of Ra's al Ghul
awaits your return.

308
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:11,861
I'm not going back.

309
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:13,112
That's not your choice.

310
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,782
I have orders
to return you...

311
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:17,617
Alive or dead.

312
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,335
You're not going to kill me.

313
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:21,804
You overestimate
your importance.

314
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:25,324
Regardless, you're
coming back with us.

315
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:28,461
Us?

316
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:32,331
Like you,
I did not come alone.

317
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,375
If you will not return
willingly,

318
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:20,062
we'll stay to bury your family.

319
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:30,001
You're not even
flinching when he...

320
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,871
Pain and I came to a little
understanding few years back.

321
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,492
Done.

322
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,736
The League of Assassins.

323
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:53,407
Why wouldn't she tell me
what happened to her all those years?

324
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,810
Probably the same reason
why you didn't tell us

325
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:57,862
what happened to you
on the island.

326
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,684
We need to protect the Lances.

327
00:20:03,686 --> 00:20:05,736
I'll take Laurel.
What can I do?

328
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,206
Nothing. You're hurt,
and you need to stay here.

329
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,074
What about
my father?

330
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,342
I'll go talk
to Detective Lance.

331
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,577
Tell him he needs

332
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,745
to get out town for
a couple of days.

333
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,216
Please don't tell
him about me.

334
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,801
I can keep a secret.
Just ask him.

335
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,477
You three are quite the team.

336
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,714
We have our moments.

337
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,562
Get back.

338
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:50,498
No, no, please!

339
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,900
Please, please, no!

340
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:55,503
The more you struggle...

341
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,404
The more it'll hurt.

342
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:59,457
No, no, please!

343
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,758
Please!

344
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,910
Wait.

345
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:05,546
Let her go.

346
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:07,247
You don't give me orders.

347
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:09,083
No, that would be
the Captain.

348
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:10,718
But he works for me.

349
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,687
Doesn't he?

350
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:17,257
Help me, please!

351
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,093
Come here.

352
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,034
Laurel, listen,
it's your father--again.

353
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,869
Ok, now listen,
I know you're still mad at me

354
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,271
after what I said when
you got pulled over last week,

355
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:32,823
but it's not right,
us not talking.

356
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,000
So please, just--
just call me, ok?

357
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:36,000
Detective Lance!

358
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:38,025
I knew you'd be
getting home around now

359
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,114
because your shift
has ended.

360
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:43,000
Which I knew because
I kind of pinged your cell phone.

361
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,752
Miss Smoak.

362
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,337
You have cockroaches
and they mean business.

363
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,055
Since when did you start
making house calls?

364
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,473
Since you're in danger.

365
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,675
I'm not afraid
of cockroaches.

366
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:53,427
Yes, you're in real danger!

367
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:55,963
You need to get out of town
for a couple days.

368
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:58,799
Listen, I'm in danger
every time I put on this uniform,

369
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:00,818
so you're going
to have to be a little more specific.

370
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,803
There's an organization
called the League of Assassins

371
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:05,106
and three of its members
are targeting you.

372
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:07,742
It...sounded a little less
crazy in my head.

373
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,494
I doubt it.
Malcolm Merlyn was apparently a member.

374
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,413
That should give you
some sort of idea

375
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,165
about the type of people
we're dealing with.

376
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,650
Ok, I'll bite.

377
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:18,869
What did I do
to piss them off?

378
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,088
That...um...

379
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,323
Is a really long story.

380
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:27,044
You just...
You need to trust me.

381
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,263
You're not safe here
in Starling City.

382
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,182
Smoak,
nobody's safe, ok?

383
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,499
Especially not us cops.

384
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,501
We get shot at
for a living.

385
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:37,688
And my shift?
It just ended.

386
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,357
Detective Lance!
Good-night.

387
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,891
Wait, you need
to listen to me!

388
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,560
Good night,
Miss Smoak.

389
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,862
So I guess this means
you're not leaving town?

390
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:51,685
Evening.

391
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:54,071
I should have
said this earlier,

392
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,457
but it's not appropriate for us
to be discussing your mother's case.

393
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,209
Actually, I was in the neighborhood,
so I thought that I would

394
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,044
swing by and see if I could
give you a ride home

395
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,912
and maybe get a bite to eat.

396
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,215
It's been a long day.
I don't need an even longer night

397
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,051
of you trying to talk me
out of your mother's plea agreement.

398
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,637
Laurel.

399
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:14,058
I promise, this has nothing
to do with my mother's case.

400
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,396
You've had a rough
couple of weeks.

401
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,949
You really going to tell me
you couldn't use a friend?

402
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,886
Come on.

403
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,409
Hey.

404
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,727
How'd it go?
Badly.

405
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:36,363
He either didn't believe me
or didn't take me seriously.

406
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:38,082
In hindsight,
I probably shouldn't have led

407
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,750
with League of Assassins.

408
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,453
What do we do now?

409
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:45,055
What are you doing?
Oliver told you to stay put.

410
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,625
I thought you didn't want
your father to know you're still alive.

411
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,877
I don't. But it's better
than him not being.

412
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:52,880
Where do you think you're going?
With you.

413
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:55,883
I'm not going to let you go out there
without any back-up.

414
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:58,085
Dig, you may be
a three tour Special Forces veteran,

415
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,354
but I was trained by the people that
make the Special Forces

416
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,190
look like a kindergarten class.
So step aside

417
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,810
or get put down.

418
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:11,398
It's your funeral, Sara.

419
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,868
It wouldn't be my first.

420
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,620
No, it can't be.

421
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,455
It can't be Sara.

422
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:11,091
It's me. It's Sara.

423
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,493
Daddy...

424
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:16,430
It's ok.

425
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,222
Sara?

426
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,857
Sara?

427
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,279
Sara!

428
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,363
You speak Chinese now?

429
00:25:57,365 --> 00:26:00,332
Picked up a couple things
in the past few years.

430
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:03,335
Yes.

431
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:06,705
Why didn't you let us know
that you were alive?

432
00:26:06,707 --> 00:26:10,075
I mean, your mother
and I, we...

433
00:26:10,077 --> 00:26:12,461
We missed you.

434
00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:14,263
And your sister
did, too.

435
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:15,598
You know that,
right?

436
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,100
I know you got divorced.

437
00:26:18,102 --> 00:26:20,302
Yeah.

438
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:22,438
But it wasn't
your fault.

439
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,607
That was on me.

440
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:26,308
Because of me.

441
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,443
I'm sorry.
It's all right.

442
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:29,145
None of that matters
now. You know why?

443
00:26:29,147 --> 00:26:31,480
'Cause you're home,
sweetie, you're home.

444
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:47,129
Are you in trouble?

445
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:49,798
Huh?

446
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,885
No, Dad.

447
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:55,221
You are.

448
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:02,528
You sent Felicity Smoak
to warn me to leave town.

449
00:27:04,181 --> 00:27:07,199
You know the Arrow.

450
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:16,158
You're the girl in the mask.

451
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,663
You've been kicking the crap
out of creeps in the Glades.

452
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,001
You've been home for weeks.

453
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:29,872
Tell me something--

454
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:31,674
if these assassins,
if they hadn't shown up,

455
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:33,592
would you have ever let us know
that you were alive?

456
00:27:33,594 --> 00:27:35,895
No.

457
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:45,187
Felicity said that these guys were
part of a league of something.

458
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:46,972
What do they want
with you.

459
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:49,692
What all assassins want--
to terminate their objective.

460
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:51,694
Oh, this is crazy.

461
00:27:51,696 --> 00:27:54,213
Dad, we have to go.

462
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:55,648
No, we are not
going anywhere.

463
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,199
Not until you sit down
and you tell me exactly

464
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:58,500
what you've gotten
yourself into.

465
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:01,070
You are an amazing cop
and you are strong

466
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:03,272
and decent and honest.

467
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:06,425
But these men, they will cut you
down before you can lift a finger.

468
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:09,695
Now please.
Come with me.

469
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:27,346
I'm afraid it's not
much, but, uh...

470
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:29,598
It's home.

471
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:37,906
Why did you
lock the door?

472
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:41,076
No, no, no, no.
It's not because...

473
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:46,031
It's just a habit. My shipmates aren't
exactly the nicest bunch.

474
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:49,067
Please, come in.
Have a seat.

475
00:29:08,305 --> 00:29:11,089
My name is Ivo.

476
00:29:11,091 --> 00:29:13,776
Dr. Anthony Ivo.

477
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:15,978
And you are?

478
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,446
Sara.

479
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:20,065
Nice to meet you,
Sara.

480
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:22,985
Why do you keep those people
down there in those cells?

481
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:26,205
It's my work.
I need them.

482
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,623
What work?

483
00:29:32,462 --> 00:29:37,299
I am going to save
the human race, Sara.

484
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:40,302
Maybe you can help me.

485
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:50,896
I noticed you didn't have
a drink at dinner.

486
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:53,315
No. I didn't.

487
00:29:53,317 --> 00:29:55,967
So will you now
admit that you and my father

488
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:57,403
overreacted
last week

489
00:29:57,405 --> 00:29:59,621
when you thought
that I was becoming a drunk?

490
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:02,524
I am prepared to admit
that I care about you.

491
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:04,777
Is that why
you insisted

492
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:06,528
on walking me
to my door?

493
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,830
You know me.

494
00:30:07,832 --> 00:30:09,998
I just wanted
to make sure you were safe.

495
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,317
This is safe.

496
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,836
This...

497
00:30:13,838 --> 00:30:16,221
We shouldn't.

498
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,758
Then why did you come
all the way up here?

499
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,777
I'm really sorry if I was
sending the wrong message.

500
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:26,799
No! No, no,
I got the message.

501
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:30,269
I get it loud
and clear every day.

502
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:33,355
Run.

503
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:35,357
Run, run away
from Laurel,

504
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,060
run as fast
as you can.

505
00:30:38,062 --> 00:30:40,479
Laurel, come on.
Sara...

506
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:43,365
She got on
"The Gambit" with you.

507
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,651
My father, he--

508
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:48,036
he climbed
into a bottle.

509
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:50,739
My mother, she--she
climbed into her car

510
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:54,226
and she drove away,
and then Tommy...

511
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:03,585
What is so wrong with me
that everybody leaves?

512
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:06,221
I will never leave you.

513
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:10,592
Until you do.

514
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,651
I thought I locked that.

515
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:25,240
Stay here.

516
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,175
Ollie?

517
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:45,177
Anything?

518
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,946
All good.

519
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,482
I have to go.

520
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:52,718
Listen, I'm sorry
about what I said--

521
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,254
Don't be.

522
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:57,523
Just stay here.

523
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,329
Felicity, Al Owal
was at Laurel's place.

524
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:22,498
What? Is she ok?

525
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,466
She's fine. Looks like he moved out
before we got there.

526
00:32:24,468 --> 00:32:25,634
But if Laurel's
not his target...

527
00:32:25,636 --> 00:32:27,135
He's after Lance,

528
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:30,138
and I need a location now.

529
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:38,981
Well, I can't believe
I didn't think to look for you up here.

530
00:32:38,983 --> 00:32:41,817
It's a good vantage point.
You can see the whole city.

531
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:43,936
Like a bird on a wire.

532
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:46,271
Where I was, they have
you choose a new name.

533
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:49,324
I chose
ta-er sah-fer.

534
00:32:49,326 --> 00:32:52,778
It's arabic.
For Canary.

535
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,647
I bought you that Canary
when you were ten.

536
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:58,617
I was as far from home
as you can get,

537
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:01,820
but I never forgot
where I came from.

538
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:05,824
You know how they say
the first thing

539
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:08,260
you forget about somebody when
they're gone is their voice?

540
00:33:08,262 --> 00:33:11,346
You can remember their face,

541
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:13,515
and the way they move,

542
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:16,518
but you can't hold on
to the way they sound.

543
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,855
I never forgot
your voice, Dad.

544
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:21,640
Sweetheart...

545
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:23,058
We're out of time.

546
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:31,700
So, this is where you wanted
your father to die.

547
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:45,831
What the hell, Sara,
who are these guys?

548
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:49,185
Associates of your daughter,
Officer Lance.

549
00:33:49,187 --> 00:33:50,686
Well, she always did have
the worst taste in friends.

550
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:52,021
Did you really think

551
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:53,523
we weren't going
to find you here?

552
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:55,358
No.

553
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,343
I knew you would.

554
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:59,178
Go.

555
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:16,629
You should be mindful
of your surroundings.

556
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:48,727
Guns are a coward's weapon.

557
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:51,596
What are you
without your side arm?

558
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:54,449
A guy with a spare.

559
00:34:55,985 --> 00:34:59,154
You think because
you are the beloved

560
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:01,606
you will be granted
your freedom?

561
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:05,944
There's only one freedom.
Let me grant you yours.

562
00:35:08,664 --> 00:35:12,084
You don't have to do this.

563
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:14,469
It's over!
Not yet.

564
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:16,121
Sara, baby, don't...
Tell Ra's al Ghul

565
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:19,841
that my family is off limits.
His quarrel is with me.

566
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:30,702
I'm sorry you saw that.

567
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:33,572
I can't imagine what
you must think of me.

568
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:36,474
I think
you're a survivor.

569
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:39,361
I think you're one of the
bravest people I've ever known.

570
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:43,865
You're my daughter.

571
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:48,003
It's time for you
to come back home.

572
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:50,488
I can't.
Why not?

573
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,592
They are never going
to stop looking for me.

574
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:56,011
I'll protect you.
We'll protect you.

575
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:57,462
Tell her it's safe to stay.
Dad...

576
00:35:57,464 --> 00:36:00,165
If they hurt you
or Laurel or mom,

577
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:02,217
then I really would die.

578
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:03,819
But they need to know.

579
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:06,104
They can't. They can't, Daddy.
Why not?

580
00:36:06,106 --> 00:36:09,524
You know why! I came back
to make sure that my family was safe,

581
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:12,110
and you are.
But if they knew I was alive,

582
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:13,728
Laurel and mom,

583
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,231
they would never
stop looking for me,

584
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:18,834
and that could get them
both killed.

585
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:32,581
I can't let you go.

586
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:37,719
I can't let you go!

587
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:42,390
I have to--Dad,
I have to--I have to go.

588
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:48,263
I love you.

589
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:51,366
Keep them safe.

590
00:36:51,368 --> 00:36:54,402
Detective...

591
00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:56,555
She's right.

592
00:36:56,557 --> 00:37:00,659
You have to keep
her secret.

593
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:04,279
It's already the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

594
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:09,901
How do you live like this?

595
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:19,345
I never mind getting
a visit from my children,

596
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,323
but I know why you're here.

597
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:22,883
We just have
one more thing to say.

598
00:37:22,884 --> 00:37:24,567
Oliver, we've already
been through this.

599
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:26,069
I am not going
to change my mind.

600
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:28,772
This is about me
changing mine.

601
00:37:28,774 --> 00:37:31,057
Because I thought that you
didn't want to go to trial

602
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:34,427
over...a secret.
Then I caught up

603
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:36,880
with an old friend,
and I watched as she struggled

604
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:41,835
to tell her family hers,
because she was afraid...

605
00:37:41,837 --> 00:37:44,904
That they wouldn't love her
if they knew the truth.

606
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:47,373
Whatever you are
worried about,

607
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:51,077
it will not make us
love you any less.

608
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:53,947
You don't know.
Who do you think you raised?

609
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:57,617
You taught us
to be strong.

610
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:01,454
That we could overcome
any obstacle that we faced;

611
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:03,422
to fight.

612
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:07,460
Do you really think that we
are going to scare that easily?

613
00:38:07,462 --> 00:38:08,895
Whatever comes out...

614
00:38:08,897 --> 00:38:11,264
You won't lose us.

615
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:14,534
Ever.

616
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:21,658
Wow.

617
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,880
I'll instruct Jean
to reject Mr. Donner's offer.

618
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:49,802
Hey.

619
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:51,971
Dad.

620
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:53,990
I know I owe you
a phone call.

621
00:38:53,992 --> 00:38:55,525
I have a lot
of work. Can we--

622
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:56,643
can we do this
another time?

623
00:38:56,645 --> 00:38:58,161
I just had to see you, Laurel.

624
00:38:58,163 --> 00:39:00,479
Did something happen?
Are you ok?

625
00:39:01,582 --> 00:39:03,199
One day, honey,

626
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:04,918
when you have
a daughter of your own,

627
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,686
you'll understand
that being a parent,

628
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:09,505
it means you just never
stop worrying about your children.

629
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:12,425
Dad, I'm--I'm sorry
I didn't call you back.

630
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:16,095
I've--I've had
a really long week,

631
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:18,431
and--and I'm tired.

632
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:20,083
Are you all right?

633
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:26,189
I don't know.

634
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:28,174
I wish that
there was--

635
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:30,059
there was
something, a...

636
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:32,562
A sign that
it gets better.

637
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:34,564
It does, honey.

638
00:39:34,566 --> 00:39:36,716
It gets better.

639
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:38,517
How do you know?

640
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:42,121
I wish I could tell you,
sweetie.

641
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:46,743
I wish I could tell you.

642
00:39:57,555 --> 00:40:00,039
Where's Sara?

643
00:40:01,058 --> 00:40:03,593
She left.

644
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,398
You cool with that?

645
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,516
I didn't have
much of a choice.

646
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:13,486
An old friend
gave this to me.

647
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:17,223
Said I would know when it
was the right time to drink it.

648
00:40:18,892 --> 00:40:21,361
And now's
the right time?

649
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:23,579
I'm not sure.

650
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:28,567
But I need a drink.

651
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:33,756
Prochnost.

652
00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:40,296
Hmm. That's...

653
00:40:40,298 --> 00:40:42,432
So you were right.

654
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:43,850
Yeah, I usually am,
Oliver.

655
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:48,587
About what,
specifically?

656
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:51,724
No matter how hard I try,
Diggle, my past...

657
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:55,945
It doesn't want to stay buried.

658
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:58,247
I don't want to try
so hard anymore.

659
00:41:07,908 --> 00:41:13,379
The five years
that I was gone...

660
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:16,299
I wasn't always on the island.

661
00:41:20,954 --> 00:41:22,505
Aah!

662
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:45,912
How are you--

663
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:50,483
Prisoners do not speak.

664
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:55,508
