1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,323
BARRY: <i>Previously on</i>
The Flash <i>and</i> Supergirl...

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,726
THE FLASH: <i>What just happened to him?</i>

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,804
Wally has taken my place
in the Speed Force.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,291
THE FLASH: <i>It's okay. We're going home.</i>

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,848
BARRY: <i>What Wally saw,
it's gonna haunt him for a while.</i>

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,764
I proposed

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,570
because I thought it would save you.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,767
What does that mean?

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,570
I think we need some space.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,610
I owe you the truth. My name is Mon-El.
I'm the former Prince of Daxam.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,728
I deserve better than being lied to.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,206
I've been looking for you.

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,841
Toodles!

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,211
I told you. Everything's better in song.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,768
When you speak, it's just words,

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,364
but when you sing, you open up your soul
and let who you really are shine through.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,404
Thanks, Mom.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,564
- I love you, my beautiful boy.
- I love you, too.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,881
This?

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,681
Again?

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,170
What, are you gonna spend
the rest of your life

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,526
- sitting around on the couch? Come on.
- No...

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,409
You've been doing this for days.
Let's do something.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,891
- Let's go out.
- No, man, I'm sorry. I'm...

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,166
I don't feel like going out.

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,051
What is it with you
and musicals these days, anyhow?

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,690
Everything's better in song.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,001
Listen, dude, I know you've been going
through a tough time

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,527
since Iris broke off the engagement,

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,727
- <i>or I guess...</i>
- What?

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,723
Technically, since you
broke off the engagement.

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,042
Whoever broke off the engagement,
it doesn't matter.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,407
I just... I don't know, man. I wanna help.

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,011
Nothing you can really do.

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,251
Really? I guess I'm just gonna
have to let Mr. Gene Kelly take over

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,641
'cause, Lord knows,
I can't do anything about that!

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,001
It's H.R.

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,681
Yeah.

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,368
B.A., someone's coming through.

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,851
Could be Gypsy.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,844
Yeah, could be, or could be...

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,641
Supergirl?

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,881
Kara.

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,328
- What happened to her?
- We don't know,

45
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,211
but whoever did it has come to this world.

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,841
Her vitals are low.

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,168
- How long has she been like this?
- A few hours.

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,242
Okay, we need to find
whoever did this to Kara

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,688
and punch him repeatedly until he
reverses whatever spell he put on her.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,166
And I get to punch him first.

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,401
Who are you, exactly?

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,967
My name is Mon-El. I'm Kara's...

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,201
Friend.

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,290
Her more-than-friend?

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,726
We've been kissing a lot.

56
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,042
Oh! She never mentioned
she had a boyfriend.

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,690
It's a recent thing, so...

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,570
I thought you two broke up.

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,644
I tell you what. I know enough not
to mention the breakup between Barry and...

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,287
- H.R.
- H.R.: Sorry.

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,367
Look, hey, whatever's going on
between me and Kara,

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,091
I cannot leave her like this, okay?
I need to get her back.

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,730
We will, I promise.

64
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,449
So what happened to her?

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,444
An alien prisoner escaped our custody.
He did something to her.

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,806
Put her in some kind of a coma.

67
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,201
Then he disappeared.
We tracked him here and followed.

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,364
Okay, but why would he come to this Earth?

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,602
Well, we believe, for you.

70
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,685
- Me, why?
- We don't know.

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,046
<i>But his last words before he disappeared</i>

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,521
were about finding the fastest man alive.

73
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,050
Okay, well, clearly,
we're talking about a breacher here.

74
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,568
And if there's one thing I can do,
it's find breachers.

75
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,648
So what else can you
tell us about this guy?

76
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,168
Not much. It's like he just
materialized out of thin air.

77
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,163
You mean like this clown just did?

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,001
I'm gonna go.

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,561
Wallace.

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,169
I understand what you've been through.

81
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,721
Stuck in the Speed Force,
the things you saw, I get it.

82
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,724
I also know that sometimes
the old adage is true.

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,326
When you get bucked from the horse,
best thing you can do,

84
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,443
get right back on the damn thing
and ride, Wallace. Ride!

85
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,810
Hello, Barry Allen.

86
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,170
- How do you...
- Know your name?

87
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,320
I know a lot of things,
and I can do a lot of things, too.

88
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,726
Wally West made it here, too.
This is exciting.

89
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,363
It's good of you to join the party,
Kid Flash. I'm happy to have you.

90
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,521
What do you want with Supergirl?

91
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,207
The same thing that I want
with both of you.

92
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,370
To teach you all a lesson.

93
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,122
Is that all you got, Kid Flash?
I mean, you look a little scared.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,286
And you're too slow.

95
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,691
Nighty-night, Flash.

96
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,641
What the hell?

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,201
<i>You know her?</i>

118
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,005
Yeah, I do.

119
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,361
- Barry?
- Hey!

120
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,841
Barry, it's you. Thank Rao!

121
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,601
- Wait, it's really you, right?
- Yeah, this is me. Yeah.

122
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,046
- Good.
- What is...

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,124
- Where the hell are we? What's going on?
- I was hoping you could tell me,

124
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,567
or maybe explain to me
why I just pulled an Audrey Hepburn

125
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,290
and sang at a nightclub.

126
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,403
- Maybe we're dreaming?
- The same dream?

127
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,041
Yeah, that's... What's the last thing
you remember before you got here?

128
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,890
I was at the DEO.

129
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,442
They had just brought in
an alien prisoner. He got loose and...

130
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,044
- It was really weird. He had this red...
- Pocket handkerchief?

131
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,441
- Yes.
- I saw you on my Earth.

132
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,967
You were in a coma.
Your boyfriend brought you to us.

133
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,167
He is not my boyfriend.

134
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,520
He's just a boy who is not my friend.

135
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,290
- He's my nothing.
- Okay.

136
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,168
All right. Well, whoever he is
said that this guy whammied you,

137
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,243
and then he escaped to my Earth.
He showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs.

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,164
I went after him to try to get him
to wake you up...

139
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,651
- And then you got whammied.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,325
- So where are we?
- I don't know.

141
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,922
I mean, it could be a parallel dimension,
or maybe just some elaborate illusion.

142
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,445
We just need to figure a way out.

143
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,002
I guess I could
click my heels together three times?

144
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,930
- Yeah.
- I was kidding.

145
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,089
Okay, all right, well...

146
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,641
Come on, let's...

147
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,562
- You're a really good singer, by the way.
- Hey, thanks.

148
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,087
My sister says
I put the "Kara" in "karaoke."

149
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,241
MALCOLM: <i>There you are</i>!

150
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,641
Merlyn.

151
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,801
"Who?
"Who?

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,207
Malcolm Merlyn, former head
of the League of Assassins?

153
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,447
The what of the what?

154
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,601
<i>What the hell are you talking about, kid?</i>

155
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,043
My name's Cutter Moran. I own this club,
and both of you work for me.

156
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,201
- We what now?
- We what now?

157
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,204
I pay you to sing,
not pepper me with questions.

158
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,965
And I hope you got
something better in your songbook

159
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,770
than what you were
belting out up there, blondie.

160
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,651
- Hey! Don't call me "blondie"!
- Now, look, I don't know who you are...

161
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,290
But obviously you're someone
who's quick with a knife.

162
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,960
You'll have to excuse my friend.
He doesn't think before he talks.

163
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,964
Yeah, I had a cousin like that.
I had to slit his throat, too.

164
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,121
Oh...

165
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,209
Grady, get these two set up!

166
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,807
And nothing I've heard before.
I want something original.

167
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,131
Barry, I don't have my powers.

168
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,327
Me neither.

169
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,121
Winn?

170
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,321
Winn, you're here, too?

171
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,330
Who's Winn? The name is Grady.
I tickle the keys around here.

172
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,847
Say, you realize how he got
the nickname "Cutter," don't you?

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,082
- No.
- Because he likes to cut people.

174
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,846
You ask me,
I think he's all talk.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,367
Cisco. Not Cisco. Hello.

176
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,811
I pray that one day you do not find out
how very, very wrong you are, Pablo.

177
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,122
- Now, go do your job.
- All right.

178
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,243
You see, Grady doesn't know this,
but one day I'm gonna be somebody.

179
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,327
I'm gonna be somebody, and it's gonna
happen right there on that stage.

180
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,687
You'll see. I just need my one shot.

181
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,205
- It's just curiouser and curiouser.
- Yeah.

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,845
- Yeah, it's like <i>The Wizard of Oz!</i>
- Yeah.

183
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,769
"And you were there, and you were there..."

184
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,685
Except it's not really them.
They're all playing characters

185
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,126
- in a musical.
- Musical.

186
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,566
Barry, where are we?

187
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,120
I don't know.

188
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,770
MUSIC MEISTER: <i>Well,
you know what they say.</i>

189
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,641
<i>The show must go on.</i>

190
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,801
Ah!

191
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,009
<i>Supergirl, I loved your rendition
of</i> Moon River, <i>such a beautiful song.</i>

192
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,208
<i>You were a little flat in places,
but I'm willing to let it slide</i>

193
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,010
just because you're so cute.

194
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,844
Hold on. What did you do to us?

195
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,964
Oh, nothing much.
Just put a little song in your heart.

196
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,400
"Put a little..."

197
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,846
Why did you bring us here?

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,604
I didn't bring you anywhere.

199
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,563
We're inside your heads.
You created this world.

200
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,406
And we got lucky because it could've been
a war movie or a space opera,

201
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,403
but thanks to your love of musicals,

202
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,882
what with the countless times
you watched, um, <i>Wizard of Oz</i>

203
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,929
- with your adoptive parents.
- How did you know that?

204
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,051
And you, all those rainy nights watching
Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra with mom.

205
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,361
Well, where else would we be?

206
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,965
All right, all right.

207
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,404
Whoa! Swing and a miss.

208
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,051
I didn't tell you. I'm not really here.

209
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,568
See, I'm out there in the real world.
Central City's mine for the taking.

210
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,722
- Huh. We're gonna stop you.
- Yeah.

211
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,888
You're welcome to try that

212
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,526
if you can get out of here.

213
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,603
How do we get out of here?

214
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,330
You're in a movie musical,

215
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,371
so all you have to do is just follow the...

216
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,601
The Yellow Brick Road?

217
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,127
- No, the script.
- Oh. Yeah.

218
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,048
Reach the end of the plot,
and, presto change-o, you get to go home.

219
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,407
One little detail, though,
I should mention.

220
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,325
If you die in here, you die out there.

221
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,481
Lovely.

222
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,449
I've reached my limit with magical creeps.

223
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,968
In the meantime, I hope you're both ready
to get the rust off those pipes of yours.

224
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,406
- We're not singing for you.
- No.

225
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,443
- Uh. Anymore, I mean.
- Anymore.

226
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,963
Come on, now, maybe just one
little fun opening number, just to...

227
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,281
Leave your jacket on.

228
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,970

267
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,761
I don't know.

268
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,367
Come on, let's find him. Huh?

269
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,165
KARA: He's gone.
BARRY: Yup.

270
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,089
- So what do we do now?
- I don't know.

271
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,801
I mean, I guess we just...
We do what he says, right?

272
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,611
We have to figure out what the plot
of the musical is and follow the story.

273
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,730
Okay. Uh...
So what do we know so far?

274
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,241
We're singers.

275
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,607
And apparently, we work for a gangster.

276
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,127
Yes, who wants us to perform for him.

277
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,964
I mean, honestly,
it's pretty straightforward.

278
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,281
- Right?
- Yeah.

279
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,923
- Oh. Hello.
- Hi. I miss being bulletproof.

280
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,923
- You're coming with us.
- Says who?

281
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,290
Says me.

282
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,123
- KARA: <i>Barry, are you okay?</i>
- Oh...

283
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,520
Please stop yelling.

284
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,125
I'm not yelling.

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,490
Wait. Where are we?

286
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,161
I don't know.

287
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,043
All right, well,
I'm sure everybody at S.T.A.R. Labs

288
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,685
is working on getting us out of this.

289
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,490
Yeah, I'm glad they brought me
to your Earth.

290
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,210
Mon-El seems like
he really cares about you.

291
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,125
Mon-El only cares about himself.

292
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,048
He lied to me about
who he really is for nine months.

293
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,690
- Mmm.
- I can't shake it.

294
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,650
I thought
it was gonna be something special

295
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,001
like what you have with Iris.

296
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,965
That is off track.

297
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,527
I'm sorry.

298
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,091
I asked her to marry me.

299
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,686
You did? That's great.

300
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,288
- Did she not say yes?
- No, she said yes,

301
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,125
but I guess I did it
for the wrong reason, and...

302
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,204
I mean, I love her,
but I was trying to change the future.

303
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,445
Then I pushed her away
so I could focus on saving her,

304
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,011
and it's just a mess now.

305
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,241
Mmm...

306
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,363
Everything's so simple when I'm running.

307
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,646
Or flying-

308
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,202
Shut up! Both of you.

309
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,241
Stein?

310
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,243
Who's Stein?

311
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,961
Right.

312
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,407
This them?

313
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,561
Yeah.

314
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,881
Hmm.

315
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,040
Do you know who I am?

316
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,283
Not Joe West, I'm guessing.

317
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,166
Digsy. Digsy Foss. I run this town.

318
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,165
So you're the Mayor?

319
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,564
The mayor may have gotten the vote,

320
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,411
but I got the power.

321
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,326
I got a situation
that you two are gonna help me with.

322
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,926
We would love to help you with it.

323
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,241
Really love to.

324
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,041
My daughter, Millie, she's missing.

325
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,885
The last she was seen, she was
heading into Cutter Moran's place.

326
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,361
Have you seen her in there?

327
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,447
- "Millie," did you say?
- Yeah. Why?

328
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,763
- We haven't seen her. I haven't see her.
- I haven't see her.

329
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,850
- Yeah, we haven't...
- She's the only thing that is good

330
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,202
and decent about my life.

331
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,570
If anything happened to her,
this town will run red with blood.

332
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,131
Starting with yours.

333
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,250
We wouldn't want that now. Right?
So, um, how can we help you?

334
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,606
You two sing for Cutter?

335
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,081
- We sure do.
- Yes, we do.

336
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,242
You could poke around
and see if you can find her.

337
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,401
BARRY: Mmm-hmm.

338
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,961
So are you gonna do this for me?

339
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,881
- What do we do?
- Follow the script.

340
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,121
- DIGSY: Hey!
- Hey.

341
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,962
- We're gonna find her, sir.
- KARA: Mmm-hmm.

342
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,005
Good.

343
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,563
Okay. This is the place. Apartment 4B.

344
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,810
This is where we can find Iris?

345
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,486
- Millie.
- Millie. Right.

346
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,165
Yeah, she's in there, all right.

347
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,441
Now, you two listen to me.

348
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,128
Don't you go telling anyone
I showed you this.

349
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,367
No. Yeah, we promise.

350
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,171
Word to the wise,
you go digging around in this dirt,

351
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,490
you might not like what you find.

352
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,841
Okay.

353
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,041
Okay, so, remember, she might
look like Iris, but she is not Iris.

354
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,010
- I know. This is gonna be weird.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

355
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,162
I'm glad we haven't seen someone
that looked like Mon-El.

356
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,525
I'd probably just punch him
in the face for the fun of it.

357
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,523
WOMAN: <i>Oh, my God!</i>

358
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,087
That's her. Sounds like she's in trouble.

359
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,406
Here. Stand back.
I'm gonna kick the door in.

360
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,766
No, you stand back. I'll kick the door in.

361
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,082
I didn't mean it like a gender thing.
I just wanted to kick it in...

362
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,770
- Barry.
- All right, together. All right?

363
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,570
- One, two...
- Three!

364
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,364
What the hell is going on?

365
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,200
All right, you caught us.

366
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,961
We're in love.

367
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,371
Gross.

368
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,845
Guys, we have a problem.
Well, another problem.

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,890
The Speed Force levels in Barry's cells
have been severely depleted,

370
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,281
as has the amount
of solar radiation in Kara's body.

371
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,845
What exactly does that mean?

372
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,243
They're being drained.
The guy who did this to them,

373
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,482
I think he's stealing their powers.

374
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,291
Power up.

375
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,367
We've got to bring him in.

376
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,928
No, not "we." Me.
I'm the reason Barry got whammied.

377
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,845
We win and we lose as a team.
I'm coming with you.

378
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,321
I'm coming, too.

379
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,931
Look, J'onn, I respect this whole
special-agent situation you got going on,

380
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,447
but this problem right here
needs someone with...

381
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,047
Green skin and a sick-ass cape.

382
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,609
Call me the Martian Manhunter.

383
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,527
Think you'll find that J'onn's a lot more
than just a pretty face.

384
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,606
Guys. Hello. Uh...

385
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,005
Also, Barry and Kara's vitals
are all over the place.

386
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,446
Let's go.

387
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,041
All right.

388
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,845
Hello, friends.

389
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,245
Kid Flash, oh, I'm so glad
you could join the party.

390
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,761
I'm such a huge fan of your work.
But I have to say,

391
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,608
recently, your work's been a bit off.
You know what I'm talking about?

392
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,684
I think maybe
it's just that you're a little scared

393
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,565
from what happened in the Speed Force.
Is that it?

394
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,767
No, and I'm not afraid of anything.

395
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,641
Prove it.

396
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,127
Uh, Cisco, they're heading towards
4th and Aspen.

397
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,369
Got it. This way.

398
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,604
All right, J'onn, how do you feel
about a little one-two combo?

399
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,684
I'm gonna open a breach. You be ready to
hit something really hard on the B-side.

400
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,285
Hitting hard, I can do.

401
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,051
Wally, get ready to do
the same thing on the ground level.

402
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,361
Copy.

403
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,201
Now!

404
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,886
Nighty-night.

405
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,206
Who are you? Your names, now.

406
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,244
I'm Kara. This is Barry.
We're singers at your dad's nightclub.

407
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,961
Yeah. Uh, Millie, your dad thinks
you've been kidnapped.

408
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,122
Well, clearly, he's mistaken.

409
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,645
He really wants you to come home.

410
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,763
- Listen, I am never going back there.
- Mmm-mmm.

411
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,890
Why not? There's no place like home.

412
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,450
Tommy Moran is my home.

413
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,886
And besides, if our geezers
ever caught wind of this,

414
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,041
they'd go to war.

415
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,447
It'd be the end of more than just us, huh?

416
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,045
MILLIE: <i>Yeah, Tommy's right.</i>

417
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,805
Our fathers hate each other.

418
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,811
Our love is forbidden.

419
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,569
This is just like <i>West Side Story.</i>

420
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,210
I was thinking more of <i>Fantasticks,</i> but...

421
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,646
MILLIE: <i>Look, the point is,</i>

422
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,810
we ain't telling nobody nothing,
and neither are you, <i>capisce?</i>

423
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,081
<i>Capisce.</i>

424
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,881
- Can you give us a second?
- Oh, um...

425
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,361
MILLIE: Sure.

426
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,171
Okay, look, he says
we need to follow the script.

427
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,370
We're in a musical, so I think
if we convince them to tell their fathers

428
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,124
that they're in love,
maybe that'll get us out of here.

429
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,807
And back home to being single.

430
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,201
- Yay!
- At least we'll be single together.

431
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,289
Saying that never made anyone feel better.

432
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,481
Debatable.

433
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,690
Okay, so, look...

434
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,325
your fathers aren't perfect, right?

435
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,284
Love isn't perfect.

436
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,649
No, but you can't let
your love for somebody

437
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,485
cause you to be afraid
of what might happen.

438
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,801
You've got to take the good with the bad,

439
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,047
- no matter what.
- Right.

440
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,046
And that includes telling your fathers
how you two feel about each other.

441
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,887
All right, you make a convincing argument.

442
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,041
- You do.
- We'll do it!

443
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,201
MILLIE: We'll tell them about us, right?

444
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,361
TOMMY: <i>Well, we should go now.</i>

445
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,965
- Okay!
- Gee, thanks, kid.

446
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,001
TOMMY: Here you go.
MILLIE: Thank you.

447
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,889
Wow.

448
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,127
Okay. Uh. Convincing people in musicals is

449
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,530
- really easy.
- Yeah.

450
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,047
Let's hope getting out of one
is just as easy.

451
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,363
Digsy, she's back!

452
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,887
- Oh!
- MILLIE: Mmm.

453
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,966
DIGSY: Thank God you're safe.

454
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,049
Well, of course I'm safe.

455
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,449
Barry and Kara told me
that you sent them to find me.

456
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,840
We were concerned.

457
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,281
Dads, there's no reason to be concerned.

458
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,401
"Dads"?

459
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,804
- You got a problem with that?
- You got a problem with that?

460
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,045
No. I love musicals, so...

461
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,841
Okay.

462
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,930
Look, Dads, there's something
that I need to tell you.

463
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,841
Hmm?

464
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,607
I'm in love!

465
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,250
Who is the, uh... The lucky boy?

466
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,561
Um...

467
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,086
Tommy Moran.

468
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,925
Oh... You mean, Cutter Moran's kid?

469
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,445
Dad, look, we're in love.

470
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,483
- The hell you are.
- He's a hooligan.

471
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,246
- His father's a hooligan. His mother is...
- <i>Hey!</i>

472
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,926
Not in front of the girl.

473
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,050
And you're not loving that boy.

474
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,125
Have you lost your mind?

475
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,648
She is the daughter of my enemy!

476
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,764
Digsy Foss is a dirty rotten scoundrel,

477
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,365
and the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

478
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,729
- Dad, if you'd just let me explain...
- There's nothing to explain, Tommy!

479
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,362
I knew you were keeping something from me.

480
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,286
I never imagined
it was something like this!

481
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,882
She isn't your little girl anymore.

482
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,406
Well, she isn't.

483
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,688
She's an incredibly brave, strong woman.

484
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,805
One look, and you can see that.

485
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,769
And she wants to be with him.

486
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,408
No matter how scared she was to tell you,

487
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,483
no matter how dangerous it is
to be with him,

488
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,969
all that matters is they're together.

489
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,283
And when you find a love like that,
well, you've got to hold on to it,

490
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,330
no matter who's trying to stop you.

491
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,645
That's clear to me now.

492
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,806
I think you're being
a little tough on your son.

493
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,007
Excuse me?

494
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,401
Well, it's obvious why
he didn't tell you right away.

495
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,449
I mean, look at the way you're reacting.

496
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,841
Maybe if you just listen
and hear his reasons

497
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,731
and try to see things
from his point of view...

498
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,121
Maybe...

499
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,729
Maybe you'd understand
why he didn't tell you before now.

500
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,160
Baby doll, it's just...

501
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,362
You'll never understand
what it means to be a father.

502
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,126
Millie, my darling,
we've always taken care of you.

503
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,930
We just want you to be happy.

Thanks for telling us the truth, baby.

534
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,769
I love you both so much.

535
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,450
BOTH: We love you.

536
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,847
Thanks.

537
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,246
Okay.

538
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,169
So what do you wanna do?

539
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,401
Uh...

540
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,647
Gather up the boys. We're going to war.

541
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,001
I had a feeling.

542
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,448
I appreciate your honesty, son.

543
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,729
- Thanks, Dad.
- Come here.

544
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,524
Get the boys. We are going to war.

545
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,129
Well, well, well,

546
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,365
if it isn't the two people
I was hoping would visit me the most.

547
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,528
Fix them, now.

548
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,762
I'm sorry. I can't.

549
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,050
If you ever wanna get out of that cell,
that's exactly what you're gonna do.

550
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,485
You don't get it.

551
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,045
You don't understand, big guy.
That's just not how it works.

552
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,168
My powers don't work that way.

553
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,810
What do you mean?
You're the one who did this to them.

554
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,407
Yes, but they're the only ones that are
in control of what happens to them now,

555
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,083
as are the two of you.

556
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,609
Us? What does that mean?

557
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,208
How much do you love him, Iris?

558
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,725
And, you, Mon-El,
how much do you love her?

559
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,405
So the question is,
is that strong enough to save them?

560
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,607
You want Kara and Barry
back from the world they're in?

561
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,251
<i>You can go get them yourselves.</i>

562
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,603
You have that power.

563
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,086
- How?
- How?

564
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,524
Ah. I can't tell you. Sorry.
You've got to figure it out yourself.

565
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,405
<i>Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna just chill</i>

566
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,080
in this wonderfully decorated
little cell of yours.

567
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,489
<i>Bye, guys. Good luck.</i>

568
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,611
Love will find a way. You can do it.
The power of love, and all that.

569
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,966
What do we do now? We got...

570
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,081
We got Millie and Tommy to tell
their fathers that they're in love.

571
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,567
Which I know we're
in a musical and everything,

572
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,961
but seeing Mon-El
in love with someone else was...

573
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,162
It was hard to watch, I know.

574
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,001
Anyway, I mean,
what are we supposed to do?

575
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,403
What do you think this
Music Meister needs us to do now?

576
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,561
Uh...

577
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,407
Ah! There you are. You two ready?

578
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,801
Ready for...

579
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,291
For rehearsal, you dolt.

580
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,844
Mr. Moran told me that you got
more songs in your repertoire.

581
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,122
- Ah. Yeah.
- We have to finish the musical.

582
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,124
Uh, do you happen
to know anything original?

583
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,521
As a matter of fact, I've been
working on something all day.

584
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,365
Wow.

585
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,124
Things really are easier in musicals.

586
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,446
Yeah.

587
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,481

Like he said, a cold, cold day.

632
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,488
You took the words right out of my mouth.

633
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,201
Come on.

634
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,881
Stop!

635
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,246
Barry!

636
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,961
Oh, my God.

637
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,688
- What's wrong?
- I think we're losing them.

638
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,161
Can you stop it?

639
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,651
Not if I don't know why.

640
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,160
Then what are we gonna do?

641
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,321
Um...

642
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,930
We need to go
to whatever world they're in.

643
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,011
How are we gonna do that?

644
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,046
Look, he said, if we loved them enough,
that we could save them wherever they are.

645
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,325
Cisco, you can vibe us there.

646
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,006
I don't think it works that way.

647
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,766
You sent me into the Speed Force.
You sent Barry and Wally into the future.

648
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,366
- You can do this, too.
- What is she talking about?

649
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,809
- What's a vibe?
- CISCO: I'll explain later.

650
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,327
Come on, just grab on to my shoulders.

651
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,964
Let's hope this works.

652
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,843
Barry... Barry.

653
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,567
Kara.

654
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,202
- Barry!
- Kara!

655
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,601
Hey. It's me. It's Iris. I'm here, hon.

656
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,881
Hi.

657
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,089
MON-EL: Stay with me.
I'm gonna get you out.

658
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,201
There's no time.

659
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,401
We have to go. We have to get them out.

660
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,809
Come on, Barry. Barry!

661
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,207
No.

662
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,729
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

663
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,249
I forgive you.

664
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,406
I love you.

665
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,608
No, Barry... Barry, you're gonna be okay.

666
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,447
Barry, no!

667
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,526
I love you.

668
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,241
Iris?

669
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,931
Mon-El.

670
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,487
Hi.

671
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,766
They're back!

672
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,328
Bravo! Round of applause. Standing O.
That was so good!

673
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,130
I loved it. That was a hell of a show.

674
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,966
And you two, I guess your love
really was strong enough after all.

675
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,446
Beautiful.

676
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,284
Man, how did you get out of the cell?

677
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,848
Cisco, do you really think that cell
is gonna just, like, hold me?

678
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,246
No, I'm sorry. What's going on?
Why did you do this to us?

679
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,971
I did it because
I believe in the good guys.

680
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,649
I told you when we first met,
it was to teach all of you a lesson.

681
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,649
<i>'Cause I see everything,</i>

682
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,485
and I saw two people
with two broken hearts.

683
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,642
So the lesson was...

684
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,801
Love, Supergirl.

685
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,806
Love is about letting yourself be saved.

686
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,723
It's not just about saving other people,
even if you are superheroes.

687
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,447
Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to, like,
mess with you a little bit.

688
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,604
I was just trying to get you
to play the game, do the song and dance.

689
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,247
Are you from another, uh, Earth,
multi-verse, universe, or something?

690
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,768
Yeah, you wouldn't even
understand where I come from.

691
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,921
Uh...

692
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,040
Wait. I'm sorry. That's it?

693
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,680
You're just gonna teach
somebody else a lesson?

694
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,444
- Yeah, it's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- Oh.

You got whammied by some guy named...

700
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,047
Music Meister.

701
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,090
Damn, Barr, I'd have paid good money
to see you singing and dancing.

702
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,241
No!

703
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,808
Uh. Well, he's holding out on you
because Barry has an amazing voice.

704
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,007
- He does.
- Uh-uh.

705
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,565
I've actually seen him sing.

706
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,721
What, you have?

707
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,848
How have we not made a GIF of that?

708
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,890
Well, technically, I'm not even
the only one here who can sing.

709
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,881
Thank you, B.A.

710
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,087
Well, I was talking about Kara.

711
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,044
Oh. You, too?

712
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,807
Kara. Of course Kara can sing.

713
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,770
Well, her name <i>is</i> Supergirl.
It's kind of implied, right?

714
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,483
Well, we better be getting going.

715
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,007
We promised Kara's sister
we'd get her back in one piece.

716
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,083
We couldn't have done this without you.
Thank you.

717
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,287
Thank you.

718
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,280
- How you guys doing?
- Yeah, I think we'll be okay.

719
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,089
Although, if you lie to me again,
I will drop a mountain on you.

720
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,924
Wow. You mean, figuratively?

721
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,048
- No, I mean, geologically.
- Okay.

722
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,520
What about you guys?

723
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,081
We'll see.

724
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,045
You didn't change anything
when I moved in with Cisco.

725
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,408
I, um, couldn't bring myself to do it.

726
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,885

Yes.

Yes.
