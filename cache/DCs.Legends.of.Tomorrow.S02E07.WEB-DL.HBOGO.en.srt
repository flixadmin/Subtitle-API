00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
<i>Previously on</i>The Flash...

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,440
Arrow <i>and</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,840
Since we learned of them,

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,480
we've been calling them
the Dominators.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,760
- You can't do this alone.
- I don't plan to.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,240
Guys, thanks for coming.

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,120
This is Kara Danvers. Supergirl.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,040
I went back in time
to change the timeline.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
It's called Flashpoint

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,280
and now things here are different
than before I left.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,920
You just erased a daughter
from my life?

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,320
He took it upon himself
to change the timeline

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,120
and because of it,
my brother was killed.

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,640
There's no amount of feeling bad
that could ever make up for that.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
<i>I'm having memories of a stranger
but she's not really a stranger.</i>

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,040
What if, when you interacted with
your younger self in 1987, you...

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,040
Inadvertently changed my past.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,960
You're back!
Oh, it's okay to see you.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,600
I love you, Dad.

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,720
Call Lyla.

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,120
Tell her these Dominators
aren't here peacefully.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,840
Maybe they chose us
because we couldn't fight back

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,640
because none of you are meta-humans.

24
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,520
What is their plan?

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,440
<i>The phrase loosely translates to...</i>

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,880
<i>"We are nearing completion
of the weapon."</i>

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,240
{\an5}I can't believe that you guys
escaped an alien spaceship.

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,160
Key words, alien spaceship.
I have questions.

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,320
They can wait.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,680
Thanks for helping me
get my sister home.

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Yeah, man.

32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,960
What's our status?

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,240
{\an5}Nothing since the Dominators
paid their little visit

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,600
to mess with our heads.

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Why would they do that?

36
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,320
{\an5}What if they were trying
to pit us against each other

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,880
{\an5}in order to gain intel
about meta-humans?

38
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,760
Man, I wish they would just send us
an IM with a questionnaire.

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,800
Well, metas pose the biggest
threat to their invasion.

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,840
{\an5}It would make sense they'd want
to get to know their enemies.

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
By kidnapping people.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,640
{\an5}Perhaps they were searching
your minds for potential

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
meta-human vulnerabilities.

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,160
I think it's time
we return the favor.

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,840
What do you want to do?
Kidnap one of them now?

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
Ever since we fought off
that one ship,

47
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,040
they've kind of been in short supply.

48
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,680
Actually, I know where to find one.

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,160
I've been reviewing old Army footage

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,320
{\an5}of their first encounters
with the Dominators.

51
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,800
And I think I pegged the fight to...

52
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,960
{\an5}- Redmond, Oregon.
- 1951.

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,880
You're suggesting we travel to 1951,

54
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,760
{\an5}abduct a Dominator and interrogate it
to determine their intentions.

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,440
They kidnapped us.

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,960
Seems fair.

57
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,080
{\an5}- Time travel. I'm definitely in.
- Okay. Hold on, though.

58
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,000
{\an5}Professor Stein and Caitlin
have been talking about a way

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
to take down the Dominators.

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,520
{\an5}- They could probably use your help.
- Pass.

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Yeah, I mean, I'm with him

62
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,160
{\an5}mostly because I just don't want
to lose my geek cred,

63
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,320
but time travel!

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
I could take Amaya and Mick.

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,640
- Do it.
- Okay.

66
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Yeah!

67
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,200
And the new president called,

68
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,880
which would be cool

69
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,680
{\an5}under different circumstances,
but she wants to meet with us.

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
Let's bring Ray and Sara as backup.

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,920
What about me? I can do backup.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,360
Can I talk to you for a second?

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,120
I don't know.

74
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,360
{\an5}I would like to minimize
your involvement in this.

75
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,280
Why? Because I'm an alien?

76
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,880
{\an5}I also happen to be
your biggest weapon.

77
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,080
You are an unknown quantity
and this is not personal.

78
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,880
Except that's exactly how this feels.

79
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,640
Kara, when I started living this life

80
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
it was just me.

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,680
I was going up against human threats

82
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
that I could handle.

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
Then it was meta-humans
and I can handle that.

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,560
Now I learn that
there are multiple Earths

85
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,600
and I was brainwashed
aboard an alien spacecraft...

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,400
I am sure that was unnerving.

87
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,840
I totally don't get unnerved.

88
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,640
{\an5}But when I go up
against something new,

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,000
I push back.

90
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,560
{\an5}Right or wrong, it is who I am
and it is what I do.

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,360
{\an5}So I'm asking
for a little bit of space,

92
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,400
{\an5}because I have to draw
the line somewhere.

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
I need to claw back
a sense of normalcy.

94
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,080
Please stay here.

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,920
This ship is everything!

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,600
{\an5}What type of propulsion system
does it use?

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
{\an5}- No idea.
- Oh, my God.

98
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
{\an5}That construct on the bow
looks like it could be

99
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,400
{\an5}- some sort of time sphere.
- Yeah, no idea.

100
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
To operate a ship of this size,

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
{\an5}the deep link nets
would have to be...

102
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,800
Oh, my God. You'd have to use

103
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,600
{\an5}- like, a quantum neural chipset...
- Hey, guys. Guys.

104
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,120
{\an5}Amaya and Rory are waiting
for us on the bridge.

105
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,160
Can we just keep moving this along?

106
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,400
{\an5}- This ship is...
- Automatic?

107
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,920
{\an5}- Supersonic.
- Hypnotic.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,880
- Funky fresh.
- Funky fresh.

109
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,880
Professor?

110
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
{\an5}It's highly unlikely
we can fashion a weapon

111
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,120
{\an5}with sufficient force to overcome
the Dominators.

112
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,400
I was thinking the exact same thing,
which is why I invited...

113
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,040
So, what if, instead,

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,480
we try to attack them with something
infinitesimally small?

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,040
I'm... I'm sure you're familiar
with the story of the lion

116
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
with the thorn in his paw.

117
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,640
You used to love telling me
that story when I was a kid.

118
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,080
Hello.

119
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,360
{\an5}The lion with the thorn
in his paw is a parable,

120
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,920
a story about a big,
ferocious creature

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,080
that is felled by something small.

122
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,320
So, what do you need help with?

123
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,440
I'm afraid it's... it's classified.

124
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,640
Oh, juicy.

125
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,880
Some sort of secret government
space weapon, no doubt.

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
{\an5}Something like that,
only this sort of work

127
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,360
is slightly out of my wheelhouse.

128
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,640
{\an5}Yeah, if only you knew someone
with a PhD in nanotechnology.

129
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
Unfortunately,

130
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,520
{\an5}Raymond's busy
working on other things.

131
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,040
I was talking about me.

132
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Did the six years I spent at MIT
magically slip your mind?

133
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,640
Of course not.

134
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,520
Good. Okay. Let's get to work.

135
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,360
We made it. This is the '50s. Sick.

136
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
Severe time jumps can cause nausea,
temporary deafness...

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,000
Linguistic disorientation.

138
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,360
You. Clean it up.

139
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,160
- We're gonna kidnap an alien.
- Okay.

140
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,480
I know I did not just
travel through time

141
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,920
so we could stay on the ship.

142
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,120
Ponytail, you're staying on the ship.

143
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,640
I'll take that as,
"Have fun storming the castle."

144
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,440
Oh, for real?

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,400
You're gonna use
"Princess Bride" against me?

146
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,640
Against me?

147
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,400
Okay. I got you, girl.

148
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,760
Celebrating July 4th early?

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,880
Ray made it for me.

150
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,240
You look like a star-spangled idiot.

151
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,800
We need to find the Army.

152
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,040
I think we found them.

153
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
What are we waiting for?

154
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,840
Let's grab an alien
and get out of here.

155
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,800
Just waiting for one of the weaker
ones in the herd.

156
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,160
I don't think there are
any weak ones.

157
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

158
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,040
It's a real-life Spielberg movie

159
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
and we're stuck in here.

160
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,720
Okay.

161
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,440
I think I know what's really
bothering you.

162
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,960
I'm having the worst case of FOMO

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,080
while everyone else is out there
kidnapping an alien?

164
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,280
No.

165
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,840
I think you escaped 2016
to get away from Barry.

166
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,240
Excuse me. I escaped 2016

167
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,200
so that I could come
see the Waverider

168
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,040
and so that I could time travel.

169
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
And?

170
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,360
And also, yes,

171
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
I wanted to get away from Barry.

172
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,080
You realize that's insane, right?

173
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,440
You're holding a grudge
against your best friend

174
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,000
when the world is potentially
going to end.

175
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm sorry. My "best friend"?
He only killed my brother.

176
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,240
- He didn't kill...
- Okay, you're right.

177
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,480
He didn't literally kill my brother.

178
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,400
What I mean to say is,
he was responsible.

179
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,520
Okay? He just needed
to save his family

180
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,920
and in doing that,
he ended up destroying mine.

181
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
You know, all this time traveling,

182
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,320
fighting aliens, this is the stuff

183
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,040
I used to dream about as a kid.

184
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,080
Yeah, me too.

185
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,880
But it doesn't feel like a dream.

186
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,480
It just feels weird.

187
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,640
Well, exactly,
and it's only gonna get weirder.

188
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,600
So that's why we have to be
able to rely on our friends.

189
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
I really wish I could right now,
Felicity.

190
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,080
But he's not my friend.

191
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
- They're taking off.
- I don't get it.

192
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,720
Why are the Dominators
attacking us, then just leaving?

193
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,120
It's an RIF mission.
"Reconnaissance in force."

194
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
Look.

195
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,800
A straggler.

196
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,000
We need him alive, Mick.

197
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
I'm just gonna rough him up a little.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,240
Hey!

199
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,880
Squeal, you pig!

200
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,920
Hey, Dad?

201
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,160
- Dad.
- What? Oh, I'm sorry.

202
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,920
Can you hand me
those induction clamps?

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,080
Yes.

204
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,440
You know,
this reminds me of that time

205
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,720
we stayed up all night

206
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,160
building my seventh grade
science project.

207
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
Remember how mad Mom got
when she found out

208
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,000
you let me drink coffee
to stay awake?

209
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
No.

210
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,960
I mean, no. No, I should never

211
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,520
never have let you do that.

212
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,160
Are you okay, Dad?

214
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm just preoccupied
with my work, that's all.

215
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,600
You know, you're really taking
this whole absent-minded professor

216
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,200
thing to a new level.

217
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,160
I don't know what you mean.
Your daughter.

218
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,840
Ever since you've come back,

219
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
you've treated her
like a total stranger.

220
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,440
That's because
she is a total stranger.

221
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,560
I'm sorry. It's just that,
when I last left 2016

222
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,080
that young woman did not exist.

223
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,480
Wait, you're saying Lily
belongs to another timeline?

224
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,000
That, when Barry created
Flashpoint, she...

225
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
Unfortunately, this is all my fault.

226
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,720
You see, a month ago, I interacted

227
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
with my younger self back in 1987

228
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,360
and unwittingly motivated him

229
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,080
me-o sire a child.

230
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,640
So it's...

231
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,320
because of my carelessness
that this Time Aberration exists.

232
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,280
She is not an Aberration.

233
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,120
She is brilliant and funny,
and a lot like you

234
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
just a little less uptight.

235
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,320
Please stop talking
about her like this.

236
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,960
She is not a real person.

237
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,440
She is a real person.
She's your daughter.

238
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,840
Wait.

239
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,280
When we finish fighting
the Dominators

240
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,440
you're gonna go back in time
and erase her?

241
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,040
No.

242
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,640
I am going to restore the timeline.

243
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,560
Unlike your friend Barry,

244
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,720
I have the luxury
of fixing my mistakes.

245
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
Well done.

246
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,560
I see that you've managed
to catch us a specimen.

247
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,880
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to keep this one.

248
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,160
Who are you?

249
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,000
Just a humble civil servant.

250
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,840
I don't like guys with badges.
Easy, Mick.

251
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,680
We just want to ask a few questions.

252
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
We'd love to answer them but...

253
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,280
- We're in a bit of a hurry.
- So are we.

254
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,720
You don't understand.

255
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
We're here to save the future.

256
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,280
And you can tell me all about it

257
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,400
when you wake up.

258
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Crap. Crap, crap, crap.

259
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
{\an5}Where do you think
they're taking them?

260
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,840
{\an5}Those "Men in Black" types
are probably gonna take them

261
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,280
{\an5}to a secret lab
and run experiments on them.

262
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,000
- Have you seen "Stranger Things"?
- Maybe too much TV, Cisco.

263
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,560
Life imitates art, Felicity.

264
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,280
Either way,
whether you like it or not,

265
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,560
we're gonna have to be
the ones to rescue them.

266
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,680
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But we're the tech support.

267
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,080
No. This is tech support.

268
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,000
Set your phasers to "stun."

269
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,160
This is why I hate the government.

270
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
Can't you two use your powers
and get us out of here?

271
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,160
Whatever they tranqed us with
is screwing with our powers.

272
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,080
Hey, he's still alive.

273
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Although something tells me

274
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,560
none of us are gonna be
alive for long.

275
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Wait.

276
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,880
This is the exact opportunity
we've been looking for.

277
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,080
To get captured?

278
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,600
No.

279
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,600
To talk with one of the Dominators.

280
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,400
And find out what they want
with our planet.

281
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,120
Well, this is a first.

282
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,000
Talking with an alien.

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,960
Excuse me, Mr. Alien Guy.

284
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,520
So where's the president?

285
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,520
She's late.

286
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,520
{\an5}Well, you got to figure
she's got a lot on her plate,

287
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,720
what with the whole
alien invasion thing.

288
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,000
And her predecessor getting killed.

289
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
Hey, what'd you say to Kara earlier?

290
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,200
She seemed pretty angry.

291
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,160
I didn't know she was capable
of being angry.

292
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,640
We've got movement.

293
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,040
I'm sorry.
President couldn't make it.

294
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,480
Who are you?

295
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,720
If I tell you

296
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
I'll have to kill you.

297
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,840
Look.

298
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,880
We just want to know
why you attacked our planet.

299
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,160
I mean, we're just down here
minding our own business

300
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,720
then you guys just drop
from the sky and attack us.

301
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
Why?

302
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,520
There has been a recent emergence

303
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,200
of meta-humans on your planet.

304
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,360
Wait, he's talking about the JSA.

305
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,120
We are here to determine

306
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,040
if your kind are a threat.

307
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,880
Let's start with him.

308
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,080
Rest of you will have
to wait your turn.

309
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,440
I think we have a misunderstanding.

310
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,200
See, we're the good guys.

311
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,080
The president invited us here.

312
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,040
Barry, I think it's time
we do something.

313
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,120
And fast.

314
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,920
- Sniper!
- On it.

315
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,800
We're trying to help you.

316
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,240
This is how you thank us?

317
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,320
You don't understand.

318
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,840
The reason the xenomorphs are here...

319
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,680
Because they have a beef
with the meta-humans.

320
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,360
Tell us something we don't know.

321
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,520
Like what exactly
have we done to them?

322
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,080
Nothing. Yet.

323
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,400
But they see individuals
with powers such as yours

324
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,520
as a future threat
and frankly, so do I.

325
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,040
What do you think
they're doing to him?

326
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,480
Same thing they're gonna do to us
unless we get out of here.

327
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,920
Oh, yeah! You all call
for tech support?

328
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,880
Great. Saved by geeks.

329
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,120
Waverider's ready
to take us back to 2016.

330
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,560
If we leave him here,
they're gonna kill him.

331
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,320
So, what? He's an alien.

332
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,120
Just because they're douches
doesn't mean we have to be.

333
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,320
- Well...
- We got to send him home.

334
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,760
How?

335
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,520
Don't we have one of their ships
aboard the Waverider?

336
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Yeah, but it's damaged.

337
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,160
- Felicity's gonna help me fix it.
- I am?

338
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,520
I'm gonna help him fix it.

339
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,640
See?

340
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,160
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

341
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,360
Guys, it's up to us
to show the Dominators

342
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,720
we're better than this.

343
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,480
Fascinating.

344
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,880
The creature's nervous system
is not unlike our own,

345
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,480
which means it must be capable
of experiencing pain.

346
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,600
Maybe that's why he's screaming.

347
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,160
Don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of here.

348
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,960
Bye.

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
He didn't even say thank you.

350
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
What is that?

351
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,160
I think it's a transponder.

352
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,360
Where'd you get that?

353
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,680
I may or may not have stolen it.

354
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,080
From his ship.

355
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,240
What does it do?

356
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,560
I think we can use it
to communicate with him

357
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,800
when we get back.

358
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,920
Oh, my God, like an alien pen pal.

359
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,960
- Exactly.
- You kids finished?

360
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
- Gideon.
<i>- Yes, Mr. Rory?</i>

361
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,720
Prepare for, time jump. Time jump.

362
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,600
<i>Course plotted for Central City,
2016.</i>

363
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,240
If you're such BFFs
with the Dominators...

364
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,840
Then why don't you call them off?

365
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,480
We know you sent them packing
once before, back in 1951.

366
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,280
That was just
a reconnaissance mission.

367
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,600
What brought them back?

368
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,160
You did, Mr. Allen.

369
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
He knows who you are.

370
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,080
You threatened the entire universe
when you used your powers

371
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,280
to upset the normal course of time.

372
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,880
You're talking about Flashpoint?

373
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,000
- How do you even know about...
- They told us.

374
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,520
I made a mistake. Okay?
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

375
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
For the past 60 years

376
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,440
we have enjoyed a truce
with your so-called Dominators.

377
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,480
You broke the truce.

378
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,480
What do they want?

379
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,760
I've negotiated a deal with them.

380
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,680
If Mr. Allen surrenders himself...

381
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
they will leave us in peace.

382
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
You really want to save the world?

383
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,640
Here's your chance.

384
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,960
I can't see. Why can't I see?

385
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,360
At least you're not throwing up.

386
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,320
- What's it doing?
- I don't know.

387
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,560
Either our food's ready
or this guy's trying to call us.

388
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,440
Hey, how... how do, how do I answer?

389
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,120
Hey. Oh, my God. It's him.

390
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,440
He's even uglier than the last time
we saw him.

391
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,880
<i>Sixty five of your years ago,</i>

392
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,760
<i>you saved me from capture.</i>

393
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,160
- Listen, you don't need to thank us.
- Yeah, he does.

394
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,600
He can thank us by turning around
and heading home.

395
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,040
<i>I will show you my gratitude
by sparing your lives,</i>

396
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,800
<i>but I cannot do the same
for Barry Allen.</i>

397
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,320
<i>If your friend does not
turn himself in</i>

398
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,320
<i>we will have no choice
but to deploy a weapon</i>

399
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,320
<i>that will exterminate
all meta-humans.</i>

400
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,280
It's a trap.

401
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
If they're that threatened
by meta-humans

402
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
it's hard to believe they'd be
satisfied with just one.

403
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
Yeah, well, if I know Barry,
he's gonna want to be that one.

404
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,120
Well, Oliver's trying
to talk him out of it.

405
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,480
And if he does, what's the collateral
damage of the meta-bomb?

406
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,640
Projected casualty count

407
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
is around two million
non-meta-humans.

408
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,480
Okay, so what
if we negotiated with them?

409
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Yeah, I don't know if you noticed

410
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
but our last chat with him
didn't go so well.

411
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,560
Well, what've we got to lose?

412
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,680
Look, maybe we should contact them.

413
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,200
Then make it fast.

414
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,080
We've got incoming.

415
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,480
Dominator ships
are coming in worldwide.

416
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,200
Including Central City.

417
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,320
Yeah, but they're not
moving or anything.

418
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
- They're just sitting there.
- For now.

419
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,920
So much for the truce
Secret Agent Man negotiated.

420
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,080
They're trying to leverage us
into handing Barry over.

421
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,840
Contact the Dominators.

422
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,080
Looks like your friend's
not calling you back.

423
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,920
No, he's not but I got a plan B.

424
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,040
- Okay.
- If this came from the dropship

425
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,360
and the dropship came
from the mother ship.

426
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,520
Theoretically, I could use it
to vibe us up there.

427
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,240
And if you can't?

428
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,080
Then I'd be vibing us into the cold,
unforgiving vacuum of space.

429
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,520
- So let's not do that.
- Yeah, let's not. Okay.

430
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,320
What an unusual gift.

431
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,600
You appear to be
a meta-human as well.

432
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,320
Yeah, well, I figured
you'd cut me some slack

433
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,280
seeing as how we saved you
back in 1951.

434
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,000
- Remember that?
- Much has changed on your planet

435
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,960
in the last 60 years.

436
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,880
The threat of your kind
has become imminent.

437
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,080
Listen, ET. We're not a threat.

438
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,920
Metas are protecting this planet.

439
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,920
And besides, the guy
who tortured your ugly ass

440
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,840
back in 1951 was human.

441
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:25,360
But what happens when a man like him
inherits abilities like yours?

442
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,200
We have seen it happen
on countless other worlds

443
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,200
which is why we must
exterminate your kind

444
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,040
before the scourge of your planet

445
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,080
becomes the scourge of ours.

446
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,200
Well, he's out of his giant mind.

447
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,280
What if he's right?

448
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,720
What if, in using our powers
to make the world better

449
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,320
we actually end up destroying it?

450
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,080
- Dude, I get it. Barry screwed up.
- Yeah, so did we.

451
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,080
Back in 1951.

452
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,440
We messed with time
when we freed the Dominator.

453
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,120
Who's now coming to kill us.

454
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,360
This whole time,
I've been mad at Barry,

455
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
and now I'm the one
who messed with time.

456
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,800
I just wanted to make things right,

457
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,400
and we ended up making them worse.

458
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,720
I'm an idiot.

459
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,800
Can't stabilize
the nanomolecular reaction.

460
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,560
Damn it!

461
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,360
Well.

462
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
Speaking as a daughter,

463
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,760
I'm not sure that outburst had
anything to do with our project.

464
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,240
What? You think it's related to me?

465
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,280
She doesn't know that you think
she's an Aberration.

466
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,960
All she knows is that her father
is keeping her at arm's length.

467
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,520
The world is being invaded by aliens.

468
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
I don't think this is the time
for family therapy.

469
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,880
It is when the world's best chance
at a workable weapon

470
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,280
is focused on getting her
daddy to love her.

471
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,840
Lily?

472
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,560
I'm sorry.

473
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,120
Mom always said
I got my temper from you.

474
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,560
No, no. I'm the one
who owes the apology.

475
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,520
If it feels like I've been
keeping my distance.

476
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,960
I assure you, it's nothing personal.

477
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,240
Yeah, it feels personal.

478
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,600
No, I mean,

479
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,840
it's not personal to you.

480
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
I'm sorry. I wish I could explain,

481
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,480
but my life has gotten
rather complicated lately.

482
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,720
So?

483
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,760
You raised me to enjoy complexity.
That's...

484
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,560
The nanomolecular reaction
keeps breaking down

485
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,560
because the replication
is sequential, not...

486
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,960
Exponential.

487
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,720
The reaction requires
greater complexity.

488
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,840
Yeah.

489
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,920
Why are you looking at me like that?

490
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,160
Because I truly

491
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,760
believe I'm seeing you
for the first time.

492
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,960
What is it?

493
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,320
My friend Barry.

494
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
He's about to do something terrible.

495
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,960
This isn't up for debate.

496
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,840
It's not even a close call. I mean...

497
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
Turn myself over to the Dominators,

498
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,080
they leave the rest
of the world alone.

499
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,560
- Simple.
- No, it's not simple.

500
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,280
Barry, it doesn't matter
what you've done.

501
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
You can't do this.

502
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,000
It's been an honor
to know all of you,

503
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,920
to fight alongside of you.

504
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,480
Now, it's up to you
to keep our home safe.

505
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,960
Barry!

506
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,720
I'm not letting you leave.

507
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,280
No offense, Oliver
but you and what army?

508
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
This one.

509
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,720
Listen, Red. I don't like you.

510
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,880
But when you got a crew,

511
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,920
you don't take a hit for the rest.

512
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,880
That was actually pretty inspiring.

513
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,640
I mean, up until the point
that Mick compared us

514
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,840
to a bunch of criminals but...

515
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,320
According to the Dominators,

516
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,160
we might as well be.

517
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,280
And maybe they're right.

518
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,040
Maybe we do more harm than good

519
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,760
but this is our chance to find out.

520
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,400
We're not letting you
sacrifice yourself.

521
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,120
There's no way.

522
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,800
I don't care if that's what
it means to be a hero.

523
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,360
You're not a hero to me.

524
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,160
You're my friend.

525
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,280
Yo. Guys.

526
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,280
You know that ship
that landed in Central City?

527
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,960
It's opening up.

528
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,280
Here we go.

529
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,720
Reading reports of ships
opening all over the world.

530
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,080
- Oh, frak.
- Talk to me.

531
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,120
Something from the Dominators
mothership just broke Atmo.

532
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,760
And, not to get too technical
but it's really, really big

533
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,080
and falling to Earth really,
really fast.

534
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
It's the meta-bomb.

535
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,400
Why would the uglies drop ships on us

536
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,000
if they're just planning
on blowing us up?

537
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,880
Because the ships were a distraction

538
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,600
to keep us from stopping
the meta-bomb.

539
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,240
Too bad, because we're gonna stop it.

540
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,880
We're gonna stop it, right?

541
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,200
Let's hope.

542
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,200
We have to keep
the Dominators at bay.

543
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
This might help.

544
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,640
I've mass-produced a small device

545
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,760
that, when placed
on individual Dominators,

546
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,760
will cause indescribable agony.

547
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,240
Not the nicest invention
but this is war.

548
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Nice going.

549
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,440
The caveat, of course,
is that if we activate the weapons

550
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,320
before all the devices
are placed on the Dominators.

551
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,600
They'll know what we're up to.

552
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,440
Well, we got to do it fast.

553
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,000
Only way I know how.

554
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,720
Damn, that's big.

555
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,320
I didn't think
it was gonna be so big.

556
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,080
- What are we gonna do?
- You got me.

557
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,040
I only know how to stab, punch,
or skewer things.

558
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,520
Fry, you freaks!

559
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,600
See you later, Dominator.

560
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,080
This thing has to have
a tractor beam, right?

561
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,320
Yep.

562
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,480
It's slowing down but like, barely.

563
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,640
Thank you, Cisco. I haven't noticed.

564
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,800
Strap in.

565
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,360
Firestorm, if you're done playing
with your friends out there,

566
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,680
we could really use your help.

567
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,960
I'm on it.

568
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,360
Good work planting
Professor Stein's nano-weapons,

569
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,560
but we still got Dominators
all over the country.

570
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,000
This looks like a job for Supergirl.

571
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,640
<i>Thanks, Felicity.</i>

572
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,160
<i>I'm not the least bit insulted.</i>

573
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,040
Sorry. I meant Supergirl and Flash.

574
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,600
This is totally a job
for the both of you.

575
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,440
That's what I meant.
Supergirl and Flash.

576
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,480
Firestorm, we're holding it up.

577
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,040
- But like, barely.
- Not helping, Cisco.

578
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,560
- Firestorm, do it now!
- Do what?

579
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,040
I believe Ms. Lance intends for us

580
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,440
to transmute the meta-bomb
into something harmless.

581
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,320
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

582
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,320
All right, devices are being planted.

583
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,160
Let me know
when I can bring the pain.

584
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,800
Come on, Firestorm.

585
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,440
Grey, I can't do it, man.
It's too big.

586
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,320
Still waiting on that signal.

587
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,280
Do it!

588
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,640
Done.

589
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,120
It's working.

590
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,400
What about the superhero bomb?

591
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,880
I can't! I can't do it!

592
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,200
You must, Jefferson.

593
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,320
I have a daughter.

594
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,320
Her name is Lily
and she's counting on you.

595
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,000
She's counting on both of us.

596
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,400
They did it!

597
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,200
They can do that?

598
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,480
They did that.

599
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,080
Ground, what's your status?

600
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,880
They're retreating.

601
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,720
It's not just them.

602
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,200
It's all around the world.

603
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,200
He did it.

604
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,760
No, Oliver.

605
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,520
We all did it.

606
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,240
Many responsibilities
have fallen to me

607
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,000
since the president's passing
at the beginning of this crisis.

608
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,920
Sobering, sad responsibilities.

609
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
This is not one of them.

610
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,840
Today, it is my distinct honor
to bestow upon you

611
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,640
a small acknowledgement
of the great debt

612
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,760
that the world owes to you all.

613
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,720
Is it just me, or is she really hot?

614
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,360
Although your brave efforts
must remain a secret...

615
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,480
She's hot.

616
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,320
Know that, meta-human or not,

617
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,520
masked or not,

618
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,320
each and every one of you is a hero.

619
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,840
Thank you.

620
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,160
Thank you.

621
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,800
Let's go drink.

622
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,440
Cheers.

623
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,480
It's like looking into a mirror.

624
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,520
Yeah, you know what's funny?

625
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,600
She really kind of looks
like my cousin.

626
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,800
- Hey, hey. Guys.
- Hey.

627
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,640
Either of you ever save
the world before?

628
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,280
Last year.

629
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,960
- It doesn't get old, does it?
- Nope.

630
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,720
It sure beats screwing up the world.

631
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,680
Hey, you are too hard on yourself.

632
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,160
That's what people usually tell me.

633
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
And for good reason, I'm sure.

634
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,720
But back on my Earth,
it's just me and my cousin.

635
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,360
Between the two of us,
we're more powerful than...

636
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,800
Yeah, everybody
in this room combined.

637
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
No, no. That's the point.

638
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,280
That's what you've all proven here.

639
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,960
Meta-humans or not,
superpowers or not,

640
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,320
you are Earth's mightiest heroes.

641
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,440
I owe you an apology.

642
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,520
Keeping you at arm's length
was the wrong move and...

643
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,480
Well, the truth is that this Earth

644
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,520
could probably use a Supergirl.

645
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,280
Well, that's... that's funny,
because I was just thinking

646
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,240
my Earth could use an Oliver Queen.

647
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,320
I know you said
you don't get unnerved...

648
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,560
But if you did,

649
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,560
I think hardship is what
makes us stronger.

650
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,720
That's probably why these people
look to you as their rock.

651
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,360
- You guys feeling the group hug?
- No.

652
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
Come on. Come on.

653
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,480
All right.

654
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,800
Hey, Kara.

655
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,760
- I made you something.
- What?

656
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,200
- Cisco.
- Yeah.

657
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,240
What...

658
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,120
- what is it?
- Oh, it's a...

659
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,040
it's an inter-dimensional
extrapolator.

660
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,240
It creates small breaches,

661
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,440
so you can use it to cross
over to our universe

662
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,760
any time you need to.

663
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,520
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

664
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,720
I also included communication
functionality.

665
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,400
So if you ever need any help,
you can always contact the team.

666
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,520
Hey, Skirt.

667
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,000
Call me.

668
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,280
All right, Grey. Spill.

669
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,240
How is it you have a kid?

670
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,000
I didn't think I had to explain
such matters to you, Jefferson.

671
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,400
Come on. You know what I mean.

672
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,520
When we traveled back to 1987,

673
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,320
I gave my younger
self a lecture about

674
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,440
neglecting Clarissa and he...

675
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,520
And he followed your advice
all the way to pound town.

676
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
Wait.

677
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,280
You created an Aberration.

678
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,440
Which is why you cannot
tell the team.

679
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,680
If you don't want me to tell the team

680
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,880
that means you...

681
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,680
I do not want to lose my daughter.

682
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,760
Something tells me
you weren't invited here.

683
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
- Dr. Heywood.
- Don't "Dr. Heywood" me.

684
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,040
What the hell are you doing here?

685
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,600
I like parties and I'm here
for the mop-up.

686
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,760
Cover-up.

687
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,640
But you can't cover this up.

688
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,960
Agent Smith!

689
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,680
It's so funny seeing you here.

690
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,200
I was just having the loveliest chat
with your president about you.

691
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,400
I was telling her, on my Earth,

692
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,680
we have a Department
of Extranormal Operations

693
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,360
which deals specifically with aliens.

694
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,000
She thought it was an excellent idea.

695
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,160
She also loved my pitch

696
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,640
about reassigning you to Antarctica.

697
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,080
Maybe next time,
you're a little nicer

698
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,200
to strange visitors
from another planet.

699
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,720
Pack a jacket!

700
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,000
You ready to see
if Cisco's gadget works?

701
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,200
Ready.

702
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,680
And remember,
if you guys ever need me,

703
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,160
I'm just a call away.

704
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,400
Same here.

705
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,240
It's weird to think
that all of this started

706
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,600
with the two of us.

707
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,720
You ever think what it would be like

708
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,120
if we never got on that boat?

709
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,840
I don't know
if I have to think about it.

710
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,400
I mean, maybe
the Dominators showed us

711
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,760
what our lives would have been like.

712
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,280
I know it was a prison
but in a way...

713
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,200
In a way, it was a gift.

714
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,320
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah.

715
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,200
There she goes, off to her spaceship

716
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,960
time traveling
as if it's totally normal.

717
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,120
Well, John, it's like you said.

718
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,040
Normal sort of went out the window
when this one arrived.

719
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,080
I may never understand you, man but

720
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,480
you're one of the best men I know.

721
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,600
Thanks, Dig.

722
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,560
So you forgive me for what I did?

723
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,240
Barry, it's like
I keep telling this guy.

724
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,760
You have to forgive yourself.

725
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,960
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

726
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,640
Yeah, thanks.

727
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,440
Well, we got to do this more often.

728
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,400
Get together, I mean.

729
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,680
I don't know
if the world could take it.

730
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,040
I meant, like, without the world
being threatened.

731
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,760
If the world wasn't being threatened

732
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,480
what would we do?

733
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,560
I'm just saying, next time,
I'm gonna get you.

734
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,960
I'm just saying, I beat you twice.

735
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,680
The first time was a tie.
And the second time?

736
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,600
There were no witnesses
the second time.

737
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,080
Superspeed arrow duels.

738
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,840
Our lives aren't exactly normal.

739
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,080
I told Kara that I was looking
to reclaim some normal.

740
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,520
Thinking on it now,
I'm...I'm not so sure.

741
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,080
I know what you mean.

742
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,080
We both got a look at what life
would look like normal.

743
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,400
It would've been happy.

744
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,320
But not full.

745
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,840
No. No, nowhere close.

746
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,800
To things not being normal.

747
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,840
To life being full.
