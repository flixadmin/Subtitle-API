1
00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:01,770
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,461
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,463 --> 00:00:08,513
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:11,466
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:16,521
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:18,523
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:21,526
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:24,946
I must be something else.

9
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,800
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:30,485
As much as I would love
to make this city safer,

11
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:33,605
my first obligation is
to Queen Consolidated

12
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:34,990
and yours is, too.

13
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,107
I did some reading up
on Lawton.

14
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,409
Lyla, listen--

15
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:38,543
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out

16
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:39,711
that he killed
your brother?

17
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:41,079
That you were using me?

18
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:42,714
I need to see
this guy in a bag.

19
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:44,282
You, of all people,
should get that.

20
00:00:44,284 --> 00:00:46,084
Long time

21
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:48,303
particularly
for Bratva captain.

22
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:49,921
Mr. Queen.

23
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:51,590
Anatoly Knyazev,

24
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:53,558
he speaks
very highly of you.

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,477
He should.
I saved his life.

26
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:12,977
You were supposed
to sign this report

27
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,344
at last night's board meeting.
You know why you didn't?

28
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:17,179
Probably because I didn't
attend last night's board meeting.

29
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:18,764
Where were you?

30
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,982
I have other interests
outside of this company.

31
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:22,134
I don't.
Mr. Queen--

32
00:01:22,136 --> 00:01:23,269
I thought you were serious

33
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:25,004
when you said
we were partners.

34
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:26,756
Isabel, I missed
one meeting.

35
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:28,274
This week.

36
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:29,476
Last week, it was
two meetings.

37
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:30,643
Mr. Queen.

38
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:33,529
Companywide revenue
is at double digits

39
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:34,513
since you and I
took over.

40
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:35,731
Oliver!
Yes?

41
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,985
I'm sorry
to interrupt your...

42
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:39,986
Grr!

43
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:41,520
Um, I need to talk to you

44
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:44,290
about your plans
for this evening.

45
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:45,825
With Mr. Harper?

46
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:50,796
You'll have
to excuse me.

47
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:52,164
We have work to do.

48
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,132
It's important.

49
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:56,002
So are
my evening plans.

50
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:58,004
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:00,556
We are going to have
to work on your excuses.

52
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:02,141
You're right.

53
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:21,192
You should be
more careful.

54
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:23,178
You're
completely exposed.

55
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:25,997
I knew you were there.

56
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,499
What, you wanted me
to tell you

57
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,334
when the funny money guys
were ready to make a sale?

58
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:30,869
Here we go.

59
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,171
Not "we." Go home.

60
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,873
I already have help.

61
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:39,210
Here's the fake.

62
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,599
Let's see the real.

63
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:09,107
You got two
right above you.

64
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:14,963
Another at your six.

65
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,839
Stay where you are,
don't move!

66
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:27,142
I want to make a citizen's arrest.
Don't move.

67
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:32,130
That's it. I'm clear.

68
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,818
Aah!

69
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:39,688
Task force X to Mockingbird.

70
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,940
We have the prize,
we're coming home.

71
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:45,965

73
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:05,597
Who are you people?

74
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,165
NSA? CIA?

75
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:10,852
My name
is Amanda Waller.

76
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:14,656
I thought you A.R.G.U.S. guys
were supposed to be more subtle.

77
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:16,608
For us,
this was subtle.

78
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,727
Then I want to see Lyla Michaels.
So do I.

79
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:20,295
Agent Michaels
has gone dark.

80
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,447
Lyla's missing?

81
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,349
What happened?

82
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,568
She was running down
a lead in Moscow.

83
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,353
She's missed two
of her scheduled call-ins.

84
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:30,488
Well, what are you
doing about it?

85
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,023
Speaking to you.

86
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:34,409
Even if we knew
where in Russia Lyla is,

87
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:36,594
my superiors believe sending in
an extraction team

88
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:38,530
could cause
an international incident.

89
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:39,848
As far
as they're concerned,

90
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,049
she's already
a framed picture

91
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,501
on our lobby wall.

92
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:47,005
Why are you
telling me all this?

93
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:53,645
Because I know how you and
Oliver Queen spend your nights.

94
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:57,515
And I know
your passport is up to date.

95
00:04:57,517 --> 00:05:00,025
It would help to start
with what Lyla

96
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,522
was doing in Moscow
in the first place.

97
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,859
What was this lead
she was tracking down?

98
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:07,142
A line on the whereabouts
of Floyd Lawton.

99
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:09,894
Deadshot.

100
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:13,865
Lyla
was in Russia for me,

101
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:17,735
Agent Michaels is an asset
I can't easily replace.

102
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:22,507
I know you find her
similarly irreplaceable.

103
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,009
Bring her home,
Mr. Diggle.

104
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:38,139
Thanks.

105
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:40,141
It's been a while
since I arrested you.

106
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:42,060
I'd forgotten
how good it feels.

107
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:46,097
I was working
for...him.

108
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:47,866
Him who?

109
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:49,901
The guy who cost you
your shield.

110
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:54,656
I'm on his team.
You are, too.

111
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:57,408
Anybody else
having serious deja vu?

112
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:02,647
That's all right,
we're letting him go.

113
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,884
Our mistake.

114
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,007
He was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

115
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,844
Ok, uh, let's just
get out of here

116
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:18,963
before anyone
changes their mind.

117
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,287
The potentially
catastrophic risk

118
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:27,972
of turning on this machine

119
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:30,474
far outweigh any scientific gain
that might come from it.

120
00:06:30,476 --> 00:06:32,810
The people need to understand
just how dangerous

121
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,746
technology like this is.

122
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:38,666
And the very real possibility
of a cataclysmic event.

123
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,488
Where'd you go?
Is everything ok?

124
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,042
Yeah. Just need
a few personal days.

125
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:50,662
What's going on?
Have to help a friend.

126
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:53,181
Who?

127
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,832
Lyla Michaels.

128
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,951
It's his spy girlfriend
that works for A.R.G.U.S.

129
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:59,771
She went to Russia
looking for Deadshot,

130
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:02,957
for me. Now she's missing.

131
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,626
Felicity...

132
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:07,595
I think it's time we visited our
Queen Consolidated

133
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:10,698
subsidiary in Moscow.
Yeah.

134
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,784
Oliver, what are you doing?

135
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:14,118
Just need
to help a friend.

136
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,370
I can't ask you to do that.

137
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:17,322
You didn't.

138
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,336
Sara...

139
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:33,905
My name's Ivo.

140
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:36,808
What's your name?

141
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,560
Tommy.

142
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,930
So.

143
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:44,015
How did you come
to be on this island, Tommy?

144
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:46,401
I assume it wasn't
by choice.

145
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:50,154
My, uh...

146
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:53,041
Boat was shipwrecked here.

147
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:55,994
And I was the only survivor.

148
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:58,663
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

149
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:02,100
Did you explore
the island much?

150
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:04,035
Some of it.

151
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:06,120
Why?

152
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:08,406
You didn't happen
to run across

153
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:12,210
a Japanese Imperial Navy
submarine, did you?

154
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:16,881
During World War II,

155
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:20,635
every country was trying to develop
the ultimate weapon.

156
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:23,271
The United States had the
Manhattan Project, of course;

157
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:25,523
the Nazis had das Uranverein.

158
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:28,092
And the Japanese, well,

159
00:08:28,094 --> 00:08:30,561
they had Mirakuru.

160
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:32,080
Stem cell
and genetic therapies,

161
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:34,765
decades ahead
of their time.

162
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,401
Every war

163
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:39,153
advances the cause
of science.

164
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:42,907
And the Japanese,
they had developed a serum

165
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,209
that caused
increased strength.

166
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:47,662
Rapid cell regeneration.

167
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:50,614
They called it Mirakuru.
"Miracle."

168
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:56,220
Thought they could
create an army of super soldiers.

169
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:58,589
They were transporting
their only supply

170
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,591
via submarine

171
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:05,229
when that sub came under
heavy fire by the allied forces.

172
00:09:05,231 --> 00:09:08,266
And it ran aground in
this chain of islands.

173
00:09:08,268 --> 00:09:11,302
Thanks to you...

174
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:15,306
We now know
it's this island.

175
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:21,913
You killed my friends.

176
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:24,899
Which means
it's up to you...

177
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:27,852
To help us
find that sub.

178
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:52,443
Are you forgetting
something?

179
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,319
Where do you think you're going?

180
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:03,037
Tahiti.

181
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,989
That's funny.

182
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:07,291
The flight manifest
says you're going to Moscow.

183
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:09,293
Well, we're going
to stop by there,

184
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:11,028
you know, after Tahiti.

185
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,247
What kind of partner
decides to interact

186
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,466
with our overseas holdings behind
the other one's back?

187
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,218
It was an oversight.

188
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,953
Oh.

189
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:20,704
Well, lucky
for our partnership,

190
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:22,974
I'm a fast packer.

191
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,645
Oliver, her tagging along
does not help matters any.

192
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,231
I will take care of her. John.

193
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:33,384
We're going to bring Lyla back.

194
00:10:33,386 --> 00:10:36,404
Wherever she is.

195
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:59,021
I've arranged a meeting
with the chief operating officer

196
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:01,941
of our Moscow subsidiary
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

197
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:04,026
Try your hardest
not to miss this one.

198
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,028
You know, I'm not this person
that you seem to think I am.

199
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,947
That depends.
On what?

200
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:09,648
On if I think you use
the corporate jet

201
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,450
for a weekend of fun
with your assistant.

202
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,169
Excuse me?

203
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,121
A blonde I.T. girl
all of a sudden  gets promoted

204
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:16,922
to be assistant
to the C.E.O.?

205
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,458
There are only two ways that happens.
One is nepotism,

206
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,876
and she doesn't look
like your cousin.

207
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:23,796
That...is...
absolutely not happening.

208
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:25,031
What were her
qualifications?

209
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:27,383
Aside from an abundance
of short skirts.

210
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:30,336
Her skirts aren't
that...short.

211
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,806
What was that about?
Nothing.

212
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,107
Everything
with Knyazev is set.

213
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:36,508
You have friends
in the Russian mafia?

214
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,110
Color me at not
at all surprised.

215
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:39,812
You're going straight
to the hotel in a cab.

216
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:41,013
No, you're leaving me
with her?!

217
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:43,816
Dig and I need
to get a drink.

218
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:47,153
Well...I...wouldn't
mind a drink.

219
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:52,825
Ms. Loring.
Didn't take you

220
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:54,410
for the club-hopping type.

221
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,379
Well, I'm here
on business.

222
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,747
Is everything ok with my mom?

223
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,999
We need to discuss
something about this case.

224
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:02,301
Your boyfriend Roy
was arrested last night.

225
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:04,136
I know, but it was actually
a misunderstanding.

226
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:05,504
He got released.

227
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:07,440
Well, a few reporters
got hold of the story

228
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:10,009
and they now know you're
dating a known felon.

229
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:12,428
Thea, your mother is on
trial for her life.

230
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,563
Her whole defense pivots
on being seen as a loving mother

231
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,849
who did what she had to do
to protect her children,

232
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:19,018
what kind of parent
she was.

233
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,156
We need the people
to know that she raised you

234
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,856
to make good decisions.

235
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:25,324
So if you care
about your mom,

236
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:28,911
you're going to have to end
this relationship immediately.

237
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:44,927
Oliver Queen? Ha!

238
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:48,097
My favorite American!

239
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,550
Dabro pazhalavat.

240
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:52,852
It has been too long.

241
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:55,587
John Diggle, this is
Anatoly Knyazev.

242
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:57,189
Thank you for meeting us.

243
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:59,892
If Oliver vouches for you,

244
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:03,112
you're my second favorite
American.

245
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:06,782
First, a toast.

246
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:10,736
None for me, thanks.

247
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:18,043
Prochnost.

248
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:19,445
To strength.

249
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:25,885
Now. Business.

250
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,471
This is woman
you look for, yes?

251
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:31,623
Picture is from two days ago,
from gulag--

252
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,059
prison.
Lyla was arrested?

253
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:37,913
Not quite. From what I hear,
she was trying to break in.

254
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:41,016
Why?
I do not know.

255
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,819
But clearly she had issues
breaking back out.

256
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:47,273
Gulag, worst in Russia.

257
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:49,942
It's called Koshmar.

258
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:51,410
The nightmare.

259
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:54,146
It's full
of violent psychopaths

260
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:55,998
and killers.

261
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,566
And that's just the guards.

262
00:13:57,568 --> 00:14:00,536
Anatoly, we need a way
into the gulag to extract her.

263
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:03,489
You get in, you get shot
before you get out.

264
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:05,491
Or end up like your friend.

265
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:07,393
Mmm, it's impossible.

266
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:08,844
The only thing
that's impossible

267
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,162
is us leaving this country
without this woman.

268
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I like this guy.

269
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:18,938
We have no word
for "optimist" in Russian.

270
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,608
The only way in to Koshmar

271
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,843
is as prisoner.

272
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:27,530
Now, I have guard there,
owes me favor.

273
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:31,350
It could work.
I'll give you one shot in twenty.

274
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,452
Set it up. I'll go.
No.

275
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:34,937
It has to be me.

276
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:37,156
No.

277
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:39,158
Oliver, what if something
happens to you in there?

278
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,261
What happens to me,
Felicity, or Isabel, for that matter?

279
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:45,531
You have to be on the outside
making the moves.

280
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,633
I'll go inside.

281
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,668
I've got this.

282
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:04,883
Now that is a lot of drugs.

283
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:07,719
Courtesy of Knyazev.

284
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:09,522
About enough weight to
land me in the Koshmar.

285
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:14,893
You need to be wearing this
when they process you.

286
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:19,031
Guards will take it,
but that's the point.

287
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:20,732
This...

288
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:23,419
Is Knyazev's man
inside the prison.

289
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,287
A guard.

290
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:28,040
He'll know where in the gulag
Lyla is being held.

291
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,092
When all hell
breaks loose,

292
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:32,962
you need to meet us at the
rendezvous point with Lyla, or...

293
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,347
Or I am
a permanent Russian.

294
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,435
Just thinking out loud...

295
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:42,972
But, are we sure this is the best plan
we can come up with?

296
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,640
I know Lyla's
your friend, but...

297
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:48,360
Felicity, Lyla
isn't my friend.

298
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:50,095
She was my wife.

299
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:51,897
Explain that sentence.

300
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,217
Lyla and I met in the army back
in Afghanistan.

301
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:59,104
But we didn't stay married long
once we got stateside.

302
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,044
Couldn't figure out a way to
stay married without a war to fight.

303
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:08,380
So she joined
A.R.G.U.S.,

304
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:12,201
and I circled back
for my third tour.

305
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:15,671
I can't leave here
without her, Felicity.

306
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:18,757
Just can't.

307
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:23,729
Two minute warning.

308
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,805
Good luck, John.

309
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:14,346
They have him.

310
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,854
Clock's running.

311
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,399
Zhivey, zhivey.

312
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,602
Hurry up.

313
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:56,617
Khoroshaya kurtka.

314
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:27,847
What, uh, crime
fits your punishment?

315
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,117
Drugs. And you?

316
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,687
I gave speech.
About government corruption.

317
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:36,123
Right.

318
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:40,494
It is rare to see one
of your people in Koshmar.

319
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,862
What, American?
Chernokozhiy.

320
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,481
Ehh...

321
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:47,651
Chernokozhiy
not popular here.

322
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:50,671
Shocker.

323
00:18:57,712 --> 00:19:00,430
You think Dig's ok?

324
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,716
I think he's doing
the same as he was

325
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:04,718
when you asked me
five minutes ago.

326
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,386
They're coming.

327
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:09,523
They sell us Russian
police truck for cheap.

328
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,857
Vot mashina,
kotoraya vam nuzhna.

329
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:30,711
Sto pyatisot tysyach rubley.

330
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,432
Na koleni.

331
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:47,394
Yesli vy sde syete eto,

332
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,596
moi lyudi vas,

333
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:54,534
I vashi deti
osanutsya sirotami.

334
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:07,247
What'd you say?

335
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,752
Please.

336
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:19,326
You know, in Russia,
there is gulag.

337
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:21,945
Almost as bad as this.

338
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:32,522
Sara--
Don't say my name.

339
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,742
If they find out we know each other,
they'll kill us both.

340
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,316
I thought you drowned.

341
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:46,486
When I came up,
the boat was gone.

342
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,221
And I thought you were, too.

343
00:20:48,223 --> 00:20:52,275
And I was floating out there
for days when this ship...

344
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:56,213
They found me.
And they saved me.

345
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,331
Is that why
you're helping them?

346
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,884
I don't have a choice.

347
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:03,704
I need to warn
my friends.

348
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:05,605
You said they were dead.

349
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:08,475
They're not
that easy to kill.

350
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:20,537
Try not to move.

351
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,492
It smells like puke!

352
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:28,128
It'll heal your wounds.

353
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,630
You have to go.

354
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:32,532
Get out of here.

355
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:34,835
Get to higher ground.

356
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,369
I'm not leaving you.

357
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:39,806
I will not
be the reason

358
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:41,975
something
happens to you.

359
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,977
Then we're in agreement.

360
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:46,246
Because I make
my own choices.

361
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:49,983
You are a strong woman.

362
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:53,353
When I care about someone,
there's nothing I won't do for them.

363
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:56,857
Another thing...

364
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:59,493
we have in common.

365
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:07,667
The burns, they're lowering
your body temperature.

366
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:10,921
Here.

367
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,210
Where you been all night?

368
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,212
Working.
Oh.

369
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:23,249
Well,
you deserve a break.

370
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:26,720
Um, actually,
I've been thinking.

371
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:29,088
Maybe we should
take some space.

372
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,091
I mean, we work together
and live together.

373
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:34,561
It's kind of getting hard
to breathe.

374
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,947
Since when?

375
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:39,432
Oh, wait, does this have to with
that lawyer lady dropping by?

376
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:41,067
No, this has
to do with the fact

377
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,869
that you've been
arrested twice in the last month.

378
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:45,138
Come on. I've been
trying to stay out of trouble.

379
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,324
My body hasn't
had a scratch on it in weeks.

380
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:49,943
Well, I mean, excluding the ones
that you put there.

381
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:51,945
And the other night?

382
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:54,064
Was a misunderstanding.

383
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:56,967
Roy...

384
00:22:56,969 --> 00:23:00,587
This just isn't working, ok?

385
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,956
Not for me.

386
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,258
Thea,
you can't mean that.

387
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,093
I do.

388
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,246
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,129
Those men...

390
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:47,133
They are Vory.
They are in charge.

391
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,803
It's best
to stay away.

392
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,188
Got it.

393
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,175
Listen, I'm looking for a
guard named Sergei Pavelski.

394
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:08,622
American...
You are suka now.

395
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,543
Are we seriously
going to do this?

396
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:15,128
Guess so.

397
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:29,809
Fighting strictly prohibited.

398
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,553
Vodki, pozhaluysta.

399
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:43,323
You missed the tour.

400
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:45,108
What happened
to you?

401
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,912
I saw a Russian vehicle
that I simply had to have.

402
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:51,331
Is that why you came to Russia?
Car shopping?

403
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:54,567
Oh, I just ordered one.

404
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,838
One's for me.

405
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:04,227
This cold room.

406
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:14,554
Six hours for you.

407
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,890
Six hours? You can't
keep me in here that long.

408
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,876
Now seven hours.

409
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:26,566
Well, that was
pretty stupid...

410
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,288
Then again,
you never really were

411
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,057
one of the brightest guys.

412
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,876
Deadshot.

413
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,221
Your spine
frozen through yet?

414
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:47,771
Trust me.

415
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,992
My problem here
isn't with the cold.

416
00:25:50,594 --> 00:25:54,012
What, you still haven't forgiven
me for shooting your brother?

417
00:25:54,014 --> 00:25:55,964
Man, you really
hold a grudge.

418
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:00,235
I know why you're here.

419
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:04,106
That girl.
From A.R.G.U.S.

420
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:06,908
Lyla didn't find a lead on you.

421
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,445
She found you.

422
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:13,348
Does everyone
really think

423
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,150
that Felicity and I are...
No.

424
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:17,152
Just everyone who works
at Queen Consolidated.

425
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:21,289
She's just a friend.

426
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,959
You don't seem like the kind of man
who has female friends.

427
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,627
Can I ask you
a personal question?

428
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,663
With some vodka in me,
I just might answer.

429
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:32,500
Why does saving
my family's company

430
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:34,369
mean so much to you?

431
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,974
Despite what Sheryl Sandberg
might say...

432
00:26:40,861 --> 00:26:44,096
It still isn't that easy to make it
as a woman in business.

433
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:47,299
I've...given up a lot.

434
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:48,984
Which means if I don't
succeed at everything,

435
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:51,286
then what was the point?

436
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:52,954
Hmm.

437
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:55,523
May I ask you
a personal question?

438
00:26:55,525 --> 00:26:57,709
Others have tried
and failed.

439
00:26:57,711 --> 00:27:00,395
Why do you try so hard to make me
think that you're a lazy idiot?

440
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:02,414
I know you're not.

441
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:06,134
Underneath that swagger,
I see you pretty clearly.

442
00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:08,253
Really?

443
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:10,338
And what do you see?

444
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,524
You're intelligent.

445
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:15,894
Driven.

446
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:18,480
And lonely.

447
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:21,483
How do you see that?

448
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:25,220
Because it's what I see
when I look in the mirror.

449
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:37,365
We don't have much time.

450
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,568
There you go.

451
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,403
Let's go, let's go.

452
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:46,091
Nice seeing you,
John.

453
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:53,215
You speak Russian.

454
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:57,519
I was raised in Moscow
until I was nine.

455
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:00,555
And then adopted by a family
that took me to America.

456
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:03,141
Took me years
to get rid of my accent.

457
00:28:03,143 --> 00:28:04,620
It isn't easy making friends

458
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:06,908
in grade school when
you sound like Natasha.

459
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:25,380
I...Don't have
a lot of time.

460
00:28:25,382 --> 00:28:27,782
I'll be quick.

461
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:29,801
Five minutes.
Must hurry.

462
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:31,920
Remind me to get you a pack
of cigarettes when this is all over.

463
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:34,923
I don't smoke.

464
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:45,400
You weren't going
to leave without me, were you?

465
00:28:45,402 --> 00:28:46,985
I should kill you
right now!

466
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:49,404
You won't.

467
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:51,606
Why?
Because.

468
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:54,809
I'm the only one who knows
where your little girlfriend is.

469
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:57,412
You're not stupid.

470
00:28:57,414 --> 00:29:00,982
You wouldn't put yourself
in here without an exit strategy.

471
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:02,667
I take you to the girl...

472
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:05,921
You take me out.

473
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:12,093
Isabel,
I have to go.

474
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:14,296
Sorry.

475
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:17,182
Do I strike you as someone
who needs to cuddle?

476
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,471
Hi.

477
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:24,505
Hi.

478
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:26,107
It's time. Ready?

479
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:27,526
Yeah, I--

480
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:31,179
I think she can take
the night off. Don't you?

481
00:29:31,181 --> 00:29:34,733
Ohh.
Felicity...

482
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:39,621
It--what happens in Russia
stays in Russia.

483
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:43,024
Even when it makes
no sense whatsoever.

484
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,709
Guessin', uh, you want
to hold on to that.

485
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,895
This way.

486
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:07,399
What
were you thinking?

487
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:08,817
What?

488
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:10,285
Over 64 million women
over the age of consent

489
00:30:10,287 --> 00:30:13,271
in Russia
and you sleep with her.

490
00:30:13,273 --> 00:30:16,892
So we're not doing
the "What happens in Russia

491
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:20,195
stays in Russia?"
We're still in Russia.

492
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:27,202
There is nothing money cannot buy
in this country.

493
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:30,005
Diggle should be heading out
Lyla in two minutes.

494
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:33,074
Well, breaking out
of prison is harder than it looks.

495
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:35,677
You of all people
should know that.

496
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,280
Stay quiet.

497
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:57,732
Follow me.

498
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,738
You'll remember
the rest of us...

499
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:06,774
Yes?

500
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:08,476
I promise.

501
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:11,379
I'll come back.

502
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:15,417
Come on.

503
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:22,641
Are we making a swim for it?

504
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:27,062
No. They'd shoot us
the second we hit the water.

505
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:30,065
You said your friends,
they have one

506
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:32,067
of the radios
from the ship, right?

507
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:34,269
Yeah.

508
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:37,155
You look like you know
what you're doing there.

509
00:31:37,157 --> 00:31:39,557
In the past year, I've learned a lot of
things I never expected to.

510
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,326
You and me both.

511
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:48,083
They won't respond
unless they hear your voice.

512
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:58,927
Shado.

513
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:01,596
Ni néng tingdào wo ma?

514
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:08,669
Slade.

515
00:32:08,671 --> 00:32:09,804
Can you hear me?

516
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:14,842
Thank God you're alive.

517
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:17,696
Yeah, I'm on the freighter--

518
00:32:17,698 --> 00:32:20,281
Sara, what are you doing?

519
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:22,117
There's only
two of them.

520
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:25,870
They haven't moved
from the location of the mortar attack.

521
00:32:25,872 --> 00:32:27,539
What the hell is going on here?

522
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:30,024
You just confirmed
that your friends are alive.

523
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:32,527
Which means
they're still a threat.

524
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:34,462
You know, until
we kill them.

525
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:37,999
You son of a bitch--oh!

526
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:52,863
If I say she's in there,

527
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:54,380
what's keeping you
from shooting me?

528
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,701
Honor.

529
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:01,771
You should
try it some time.

530
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,610
Lyla!

531
00:33:08,796 --> 00:33:11,297
Johnny?

532
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:12,749
Ready to go home?

533
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:15,251
You came for me.

534
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:18,304
I always have. Always will.

535
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:19,639
Deadshot's here.

536
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,808
In the prison.

537
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,227
I know.

538
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:26,679
What's your extraction plan?

539
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:29,315
Depends.
What time is it?

540
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:44,247
Let's go, go, go,
move, move, move!

541
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:00,346
This way.

542
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,933
Got it.

543
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:06,469
I shut down the phones.
The guards can't call for help.

544
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:09,105
Your friend and that woman
are not here by now,

545
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:10,773
they will not
be here at all.

546
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,315
Much better.

547
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:36,549
Oliver, get down!

548
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:43,205
Follow me! Move!

549
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,526
We're clear.

550
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:07,814
Stop the truck.

551
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,365
Get out.

552
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:12,168
Get out!

553
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:17,674
Move.

554
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,729
That's the thing
about honor, John.

555
00:35:39,731 --> 00:35:42,448
You can't
turn it on and off.

556
00:35:45,203 --> 00:35:48,538
I'm just curious.

557
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,741
How is it you think your brother
ended up dead?

558
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:55,277
You shot a client
that Andy was protecting,

559
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,896
and you missed.

560
00:35:56,898 --> 00:36:01,050
I don't miss.

561
00:36:01,052 --> 00:36:03,252
Your brother
was the contract.

562
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:05,922
Who would want to kill Andy?

563
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:09,475
I don't know the names,
just an alias.

564
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,729
Hive.

565
00:36:13,814 --> 00:36:17,633
Food for thought, John.

566
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,319
Food for thought.

567
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:56,338
Are we going to discuss what
happened last night?

568
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,673
Why would we?

569
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,175
No reason.

570
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,511
I'll see you
in the office tomorrow.

571
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,477
Thank you.

572
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:20,645
You had my back.

573
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:23,815
And now you know
what it feels like.

574
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,875
Wh--what are you--
what are you doing here?

575
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,760
Good question.

576
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:37,946
I've gotten a lot of calls
from prison,

577
00:37:37,948 --> 00:37:39,414
but never from my
girlfriend's mother.

578
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:41,466
It occurred to me
that I've never been given

579
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,202
the opportunity
to meet the man in your life.

580
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:46,254
I don't know
if she told you,

581
00:37:46,256 --> 00:37:48,006
but your daughter
kind of dumped me.

582
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:50,425
And what you should know
is that she did it for me.

583
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:53,512
Jean told me
she came to see you.

584
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:55,263
I told her
she shouldn't have.

585
00:37:55,265 --> 00:37:57,983
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

586
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,468
Us being together...

587
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,571
It can hurt her case.

588
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:04,656
Thea...

589
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:05,579
Your social life is not

590
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,128
going to be the determining
factor in my trial.

591
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,830
Sweetheart, what you've
had to endure this last year

592
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:15,400
is more than most people
go through in two lifetimes.

593
00:38:15,402 --> 00:38:18,570
But you've not only survived,
you've flourished.

594
00:38:18,572 --> 00:38:20,738
I think a lot of that
has to do with Roy.

595
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,510
So, as your mother,
I forbid you not to see him.

596
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,713
Thank you.

597
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:35,520
I have to admit,

598
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,557
this is not how I anticipated
my trip to Russia ending.

599
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,093
I just feel lucky
we made it out of there alive.

600
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,762
Thank you.

601
00:38:44,764 --> 00:38:46,815
Not just for coming for me.

602
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:49,517
For doing what
you had to once you did.

603
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,404
You mean working
with Deadshot.

604
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:57,909
You know, me and Carly
broke up because I couldn't love her

605
00:38:57,911 --> 00:39:00,445
and hate him
at the same time.

606
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:03,548
I'm honored
to be the exception.

607
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:07,035
Lyla, you're always
the exception.

608
00:39:07,037 --> 00:39:12,507

00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:19,130

611
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:21,466
No, no,

612
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:24,853
Stay for breakfast.

613

617
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,111
Why her?

618
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:09,847
I mean, besides the...

619
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,683
obvious leggy model reason.

620
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:13,985
It just
kind of happened.

621
00:40:13,987 --> 00:40:16,821
It didn't mean
anything.

622
00:40:16,823 --> 00:40:19,541
Hey.

623
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,246
Because of the life
that I lead...

624
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:30,251
I just think that
it's better to not...

625
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:33,871
Be with someone
that I could really care about.

626
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:48,486
Well, I think...

627
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:56,244
I think you deserve
better than her.

628
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,670
We have their location.

629
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,622
This one's no longer
of use to us.

630
00:41:07,624 --> 00:41:09,874
Let's see
how good you are...

631
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:12,711
At removing a bullet
from your head.

632
00:41:12,713 --> 00:41:15,079
Wait!

633
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:18,700
He could
still be useful.

634
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:21,836
She's right.

635
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,155
Once we get rid
of his friends,

636
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:26,891
we'll need him to lead
us to the graves.

637
00:41:28,894 --> 00:41:32,564
Sometimes I wonder
who gives the orders here.

638
00:41:32,566 --> 00:41:34,282
You...

639
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,534
or your little bouzin.

640
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:53,468
You're going back
to the island.

641
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:56,704
