1
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,414
Lights out!

2
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,448
Cletus. Are you there?

3
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,049
My angel.

4
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,254
This is for you.

5
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,366
What did the doctor say?

6
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,203
He said the mutations are advancing.

7
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,538
My powers are too strong.

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,635
Cletus, I'm scared.

9
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,542
It's gonna be okay.

10
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,638
They're coming to take me away.

11
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,411
They're sending me to a place
where there are others like me.

12
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,081
They can't do that.

13
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:09,161
They can't take you from me.
You're my one bright light.

14
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,887
I will always love you.

15
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,831
Frances!

16
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,325
Get off!

17
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,168
Frances!

18
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,075
No!

19
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,405
No!

20
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,297
Any last words?

21
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,632
Welcome to your new home, Frances.

22
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,713
Your old boyfriend's finally
getting what he deserves.

23
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,918
And the world will be
a safer place without him.

24
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,017
Detective Mulligan, with all due respect,

25
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,290
I don't want anything
to do with Cletus Kasady.

26
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,095
Well, that's too bad,
because he only wants to see you.

27
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,694
In my opinion, you had
your chance with Kasady and you blew it.

28
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,466
Right. So, what does he want?

29
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,776
Maybe he wants to spill the beans
about where the missing bodies are buried.

30
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,611
So you're gonna have to do
the right thing for a change.

31
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:59,056
No! Take your tiny hands off of me!

32
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:03,356
We should be out there,
protecting the city. Lethally!

33
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,165
What was that?

34
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,533
Unhand me!

35
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:17,235
Man should never consent to crawl
when he has the impulse to fly.

36
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,973
You are a bottom-feeder.

37
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,571
Be quiet.

38
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,248
How many times have I told you

39
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:30,220
that I want you to hide yourself
when I am working?

40
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,816
I am serious. It is important.
You have to show me respect.

41
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,759
-Respect? Respect?
-Yes! Yes.

42
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,057
-Okay.
-Okay.

43
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,564
-Kasady gonna give you the scoop, right?
-Right.

44
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,723
-Wrong.
-What do you mean?

45
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,200
Because you blow everything.

46
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,931
Okay, I see.
You're talking about Anne again.

47
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,164
I miss her!

48
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,110
-l will do it.
-l don't like you.

49
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,702
Let me eat him!

50
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:59,048
You do not deserve nice things.

51
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,626
Welcome back, Eddie Brock.

52
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,966
I've been thinking about you.

53
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,232
What do you want, Cletus?
I mean, why am I here?

54
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,039
Do a man who's buried alive

55
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,105
a kindness, won't you?

56
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,708
Get a message out to all my...

57
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,717
fans...

58
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,621
and in return,

59
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,951
-Il give you my life...
‘What?

60
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,289
story.

61
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:47,765
I heard the written word
hasn't been working out so well.

62
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:52,067
Piece like this, an exclusive...

63
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,971
would put you back on top.

64
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,471
Go on.

65
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,909
People love...

66
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,808
serial killers.

67
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,411
All my secrets

68
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,751
laid bare, Eddie.

69
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,917
So much camage.

70
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,185
But why me?

71
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,189
I like you.

72
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,497
All right, it's a deal.

73
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,592
What's your message?

74
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,703
"That distant cathedral...

75
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,274
is all I see...

76
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,107
fractured angel...

77
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,708
the other part of me."

78
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,050
Print that in your column.

79
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,127
Is that it? Who's gonna read that?

80
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,720
Some random haiku?

81
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,726
Print it...

82
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,299
and what's mine...

83
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,460
is yours.

84
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,727
Lucky me.

85
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,534
Goodbye, Eddie.

86
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,465
Thank you.

87
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,339
Thank you.

88
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,175
What a dick.

89
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,380
Eddie, look.

90
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,507
Look.

91
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,676
What are you doing?

92
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,846
Your job for you.

93
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,590
Eddie.

94
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,095
Don't forget me, Eddie.

95
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,538
What did you get?

96
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,741
I got a headache
and probably got tuberculosis.

97
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,247
What? A little louder.

98
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,250
He read me poetry, man.

99
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,545
Is this some kind of joke to you?
Because I'm not laughing.

100
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,182
Yeah, you could do with a laugh.

101
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,286
Come on, man. These things,
they just take a little time. All right?

102
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,420
-The second he gives you something--
-Of course.

103
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,967
Keep me ahead of the curve, Eddie.
Don't embarrass me!

104
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,058
Do you understand?

105
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,572
Trust me. The only scoop I'm getting
today is double chocolate chip.

106
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,200
No! I get brain freeze.

107
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,244
Come here.

108
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,412
Look.
-I'm looking.

109
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,474
Grab those.

110
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,382
All right.

111
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,090
Okay.

112
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,488
Now,

113
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,224
what do you think?

114
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,791
-I think I'm Pablo Picasso.
-No!

115
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,231
-Okay.
-Come here. Look.

116
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,577
Well, say what you see.

117
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,113
-It's a house.
-Never mind.

118
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,346
Oh, I know this one! It's a tree!

119
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,481
Idiot! Sit down.

120
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,150
Now...

121
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,255
pay attention.

122
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,816
Bingo.

123
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,788
Holy cow.

124
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,696
Would you say
your friendship with Cletus Kasady

125
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,359
is what allowed you
to solve this decades-old mystery?

126
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,529
You are the only person
from the outside world he's spoken with.

127
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,696
Seems he likes you.

128
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:50,367
Well, you know, he's a serial killer.
I don't see how he can like anyone.

129
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,810
Brock was able to uncover
what the FBI and police could not.

130
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,811
Bowing to public outrage,

131
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,012
the governor of California
has overturned his moratorium

132
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,852
and reinstated
the death penalty for Kasady.

133
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,330
Brock's career's been given
a much-needed revival,

134
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,196
putting him back on top once more.

135
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,046
A harrowing story finally comes to an end.

136
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,111
Vindication for the victims
and closure for the families,

137
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,782
thanks to the diligence of one man.

138
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,188
Thank you, Eddie Brock.

139
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,090
And Venom!

140
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,629
You know, this could be us, Eddie.

141
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,563
Going out there, solving cases.

142
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,864
Fighting bad guys. Maybe I eat them.

143
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,701
And then we save the day.

144
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,707
But we saved the day. It's done.

145
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,645
You said I could eat bad guys!

146
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,478
This again?

147
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,242
I need to be free!

148
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:08,878
Feeling the wind in my hair
and the sand between my toes.

149
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,115
You don't have any hair.

150
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,122
You are not listening to me.

151
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,658
Oh, I'm listening.

152
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,456
I cannot live like this anymore!

153
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,052
I'm starving!

154
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,256
So eat those guys.

155
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,821
I can't.

156
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,231
Sonny and Cher are best friends.

157
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,600
Are you serious?
That's ridiculous. That's what--

158
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,903
Man, that was abusive.

159
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,570
That was abuse.

160
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,446
And that's a $2000 TV.

161
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,575
You have got to get control
of your aggression.

162
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,017
That is why we have Snookie!

163
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,954
I cannot live on chicken
and chocolate alone. I need brains!

164
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,423
Chickens have brains.

165
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,620
1 most passionately disagree.

166
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:53,426
Look. Look at those poor idiots.

167
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,158
Small brains.

168
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,430
Come on, man, it's not their fault

169
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,939
that you live on the old phenylethyla--
Laphenylethylan--

170
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,031
-Phenylethylalanine.
-Yeah, I just said that.

171
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,042
I've told you a thousand times,

172
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,272
because it is only found in brains

173
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,780
-and in chocolate.
-And chocolate.

174
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,976
That's right. Well, how about this:

175
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,384
You live in my body, you live by my rules.

176
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,453
1 live in your body

177
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,617
because, unfortunately,
1 don't have many options.

178
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,786
Well, how about this, son?

179
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,727
The FBI is still investigating us

180
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,457
for all of that stuff
that "we were involved with."

181
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,001
So if one more head goes missing,

182
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,197
we will get hauled off into Area 51.

183
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,537
They will kill us both.
So somebody has to be responsible.

184
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,406
Responsibility.

185
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,873
it's for the mediocre.

186
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,315
-Food!
-Can you stop doing that?

187
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,353
-Food!
-Please just stop doing that.

188
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,048
Come on, stop doing that!
I have a deadline! Will you stop it?

189
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,022
Goddamn it! Fine!

190
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,363
-Good evening, Eddie.
-Hey, Mrs. Chen.

191
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,491
Good evening, Venom.

192
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,593
He says hi.

193
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,865
-Chocolate hasn't arrived yet.
-No!

194
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,033
Oh, no. We have a deal.

195
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,907
What's gonna happen?
You gonna stop protecting me?

196
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,206
I don't think so.

197
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,180
I've been keeping my mouth shut,
feeding your little secret.

198
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,015
Little old Mrs. Chen
is a little old blackmailer, huh?

199
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,611
Less of the old. 1 am 39.

200
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,088
-And I am Barry Manilow.
-Right.

201
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,954
1am happy to eat Mrs. Chen.

202
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,721
No, no, you cannot eat Mrs. Chen.

203
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,698
-What?
-l guess it's gonna have to be plan B.

204
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,627
What's plan B?

205
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,929
Not this again!

206
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,202
I need human brains to survive.

207
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,603
Now, pick up some chickens, man. Let's go.

208
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,319
I'm done with this grossness.

209
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,627
Look at all the amazing things
that we can do!

210
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,006
We are wasting our talent.

211
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,411
Bad guy!

212
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,816
Hello, kitty!

213
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,522
Leave him. Leave him be.

214
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,289
Leave him be! Leave him be!

215
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,090
-I shall remove your head.
-No, you won't.

216
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,534
-I will use it for bowling!
-No, you will not!

217
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,365
I will take it to--

218
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,372
What is the one that we like, Eddie?

219
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,464
it's Lucky Strike.

220
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,838
-Yes!
-Put him down.

221
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,674
Lucky Strike.
I will take you to Lucky Strike.

222
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,180
-And I will score a 300-point game.
-You won't

223
00:16:56,281 --> 00:17:00,514
The rest of your pudgy little boy body
will be left here,

224
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,951
rolling around in dumpster juice.

225
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,012
Oh, God.

226
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,352
No! Put him down!

227
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,861
No, no, no! No! No!

228
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,990
Fine!

229
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,293
She didn't want our help.

230
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,464
She did not know
she needed our help, Eddie.

231
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,870
There is a difference.

232
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,079
itis Anne!

233
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,478
Anne is on the phone, Eddie!

234
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,214
-Hey, Anne.
-Hey, Eddie. Hi.

235
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,347
-Hi.
-Be nice to her.

236
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,190
You sound out of breath.
I'm not catching you at a bad time, am 1?

237
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,730
No, no, not at all. I'm just--

238
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,889
I'm just hanging around.

239
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,394
I'm sorry I haven't returned your calls.
I guess...

240
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,934
I just needed a little space
after the whole...

241
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,702
alien-biting-a-guy's-head-off thing, so--

242
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,767
The good old days.

243
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:03,371
Anyway, so I have some news,
and I was wondering if we could meet?

244
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,280
Yes!

245
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,714
Yeah, sure, that would be--

246
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,616
That would be fine. Great.

247
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,118
-Okay, great. How's tomorrow night?
-Tomorrow night?

248
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,954
-Yeah. Great.
-8:007

249
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,857
-L'Araignée?
-Okay, great.

250
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,555
-Looking forward to it.
-Me too. Bye.

251
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,893
-Great.
-It's over with the doctor!

252
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,367
That is the voice of a woman
who just got brutally dumped.

253
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,301
Stop!

254
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,436
Don't you want to look your best?

255
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,379
Just leave me alone.
You are always nitpicking.

256
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,220
Hey!

257
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:46,881
Hey.

258
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,794
-Okay. Hi.
-Yeah.

259
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,731
Awkward.

260
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,602
So how's it going? How's Mr. Belvedere?

261
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,764
Good, good.

262
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,572
He's still wiping his ass on the carpet.
He learned that from you.

263
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,443
Yeah. How's the legal aid work going?

264
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,505
You know how much I love an underdog.

265
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,483
Yeah, that's why you
put up with me for so long.

266
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,585
You said it.

267
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,250
So.

268
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,189
-So.
-So?

269
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,423
I don't know, I thought it would be
better to tell you in person that--

270
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,593
No!

271
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,197
Anne. Wow, that is--

272
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,341
That is so much bigger
than the one that I got you.

273
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:39,810
It's gaudy.

274
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,676
That's Dan, right? Dr. Dan.

275
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,214
Yeah, it's Dan.

276
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,147
Holy shit, Anne. Way to go.

277
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,184
Are you okay?

278
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,516
-Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah.
-Well, I am not okay.

279
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,889
You could just say,
"Congratulations, I'm happy for you."

280
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,017
You know, like two people who still
care enough about each other to lie

281
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,358
so that the other one
doesn't feel like complete shit.

282
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,158
Maybe we could do that version of this?

283
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:04,169
-No, I am happy for you, Anne.
-No!

284
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,226
Congratulations.

285
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:06,702
Thank you.

286
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,467
That was going to be us, Eddie!

287
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,808
1, for one, would not be inconsolable
if Dan were to fall into traffic

288
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,905
and lose his head and his feet
and all of his teeth!

289
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,540
-What?
-What was that?

290
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,414
What? Nothing.

291
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,348
If I ask you a question, do you
have the ability to tell me the truth?

292
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,919
You mean, as in being super happy
for you because of your engagement?

293
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,192
Because you just told me to lie,
so that's really confusing.

294
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,859
Is Venom with you?

295
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,096
He's dead.

296
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,001
Iam. I'm playing dead right now.

297
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,335
Yeah, I mean, he--

298
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,205
Right.
-Okay.

299
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,710
-Okay.
-Good.

300
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,405
Well, that's--

301
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,549
You just don't change, do you?

302
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,917
What are you talking about?
This is just a huge shock.

303
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,512
Anne, I'm in love with you.
This is a lot to process.

304
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,557
The truth is you don't love anybody.
You can't.

305
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,286
Commitment's just not your thing.

306
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,753
All right, then, fine.

307
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,424
Do not marry Dan.

308
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,056
Dan makes me feel safe.

309
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,226
And you made me feel
like I was on a roller coaster.

310
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,602
Sometimes you have
to know when to get off.

311
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,196
-Yeah, and not yak.
-And not yak!

312
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,765
You know? Not yak.

313
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,367
Yak.

314
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,245
Hey, Venom. Take care of him, all right?

315
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,751
Don't let him
keep messing everything up.

316
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,756
I'm going to make you cry now, Eddie.

317
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,882
She will love it.

318
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,554
Cry.

319
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,063
It's a lot to process.

320
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,797
Congratulations, Anne.

321
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,766
That's great news.

322
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,010
Slow down, pal!

323
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,983
Why? You don't believe in consequences.

324
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,486
No injuries. You fix them.

325
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,454
No hangovers. You mend them.

326
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,856
I couldn't even hurt myself if I tried!

327
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:20,605
Eddie, I apologise
that I can't mend the heart.

328
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,698
Emotional pain, it hits much harder.

329
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,176
And it lasts longer.

330
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:31,648
You just need to pull up
your big-boy pants and fake it.

331
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,118
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.

332
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,176
Why?

333
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,188
Because I'm a real boy.

334
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,722
And you're just an amoeba.

335
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:46,020
1 will only take that
because we are hurting right now.

336
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,897
Don't worry, buddy.
1 will get you through this.

337
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,346
Do you know what always
cheers me up in the morning, Eddie?

338
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,150
Sausages. And brains!

339
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,415
1 say either
And I say either

340
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:18,019
I say neither
Neither, either, either, neither

341
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,928
Let's call the whole thing off

342
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:23,992
Potahtoes

343
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,004
1 like tomatoes
And I like tomahto

344
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,337
Potatoes, potahtoes
Tomatoes, tomahtoes

345
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,434
Let's call the whole thing off

346
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,237
Cheer up, old pal!

347
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,837
And, oh

348
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,782
If we call the whole thing off

349
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,580
Then we must part

350
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,886
That's for you.

351
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,462
Are you pen pals with an ant?

352
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,056
Listen to this.

353
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,265
"Dearest pally pal,

354
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,036
I hereby invite you to witness

355
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,408
my demise,

356
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,277
my final moments

357
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:13,943
on this spinning shit wheel

358
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:17,147
that we call Earth."

359
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,883
You are responsible

360
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,895
for bringing about
the end of Cletus Kasady.

361
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:29,059
It's only right that you hold the door
for me on my way out.

362
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:34,094
They'll stop my heart,
Just like it stopped at my birth.

363
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:38,734
What if Cletus Kasady
had never been revived?

364
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,304
He would never have pushed Grandma
down a flight of stairs.

365
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,819
Bye-bye, Grandma,
you puckered old sphincter.

366
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,821
He would never have thrown
a hair dryer into Mother's bathtub.

367
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,089
Yes, Mama, I'm a bad, bad boy.

368
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:03,033
He would never have been beaten
to the brink of death by Daddy-o

369
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,761
and sent fo...

370
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,673
St. Estes Home for Unwanted Children.

371
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,115
That circus of hell...

372
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,651
with one bright light.

373
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,554
Oh, Eddie.

374
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:36,225
We are all born into this world
through blood and pain.

375
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,998
Every hero has an origin story.

376
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,238
Your friend...

377
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,470
"Cletus Kasady.

378
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,573
Kiss, hug, kiss, hug.

379
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,477
Smiley face."

380
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,246
Nut job.

381
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,085
You know, I should be there.

382
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,659
No, it's a bad idea.

383
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,319
I mean, I put him there.

384
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:08,094
Actually, he put himself there
when he decided to be a complete lunatic.

385
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,030
Ta-da!

386
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,367
You know, it would be nice
just to have your support, just for once.

387
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,530
Ketchup?

388
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,101
This place is an all-you-can-eat buffet.

389
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,907
Who's going to care if I polish off
a couple of these idiots?

390
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,277
You can't be sure who is
and who is not guilty, buddy.

391
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,508
They're in prison!

392
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,712
Yeah, but some people
take false confessions.

393
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,551
You know, they take pleas.
We watched Making a Murderer.

394
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,182
-You all right?
-Yeah, man, I'm just practising.

395
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,556
Iam a predator, Eddie.

396
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,391
Lions do not eat salad!

397
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,123
But you're not a lion, are you?

398
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,757
I see you more of a vexatious
little pig-dog-house-bat thing.

399
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,462
That's fine.

400
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,934
-You suck.
-You suck!

401
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,062
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, wow.

402
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:52,201
I don't have an explanation for that.
I think I'm having a panic attack.

403
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,476
Yeah, I'l sign here.

404
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,813
Stand two feet away from the bars.
No touching the condemned.

405
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,079
Understood.

406
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,554
Visitor's here!

407
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,291
This is a "me" thing,
not a "we" thing.

408
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,128
Everything is a "you" thing.

409
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,727
Happy day for you, Eddie Brock.

410
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,729
What a scoop.

411
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:27,244
The end of the Magical Misery Tour.

412
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,179
I worry for your soul.

413
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,649
How will you live with the weight
of snuffing out a man's life?

414
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,854
I was hoping maybe you
could give me a couple pointers.

415
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,090
Funny little guy, aren't you?

416
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,099
Don't need that. My memory is outstanding.

417
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,427
Rude.

418
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,867
Consequences.

419
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,833
Every decision you ever make.

420
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:02,112
Who do we leave behind,
and how do we leave them?

421
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,849
A connubial bed, empty.

422
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,853
Waiting in the darkness

423
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:14,016
for the rescuer who never comes.

424
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,217
Because of you.

425
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,021
This guy makes zero sense.

426
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:21,065
You and I are the same.

427
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,294
No. No, we're not.

428
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,804
Twisted insides, mean daddies.

429
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,636
You feel like home to me, Eddie.
Like family.

430
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:34,742
And really, truly, that is all
I ever wanted in this world.

431
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,245
Family.

432
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:40,250
Killing your grandmother and your mother
sure is a funny way of showing it.

433
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:47,087
Anything you wanna
unburden yourself with before...

434
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,993
this happens?

435
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,421
Yes.

436
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,364
I have wishes to bestow upon you.

437
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,905
Oh, that is kind.

438
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:04,168
I want to wish you...

439
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,874
this heartbreak.

440
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,010
Too fate.

441
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,744
I wish for you
to see out your days alone,

442
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,615
as you always have been.

443
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,845
Watch it, pal!

444
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,684
Where are you going with this?

445
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:22,626
You are a cancer to everyone
who ever loved you, Eddie.

446
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,097
Deceived your trusting fiancée.

447
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:31,567
And no wonder Daddy
could never look at you again

448
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,628
after you killed his wife, your mother,

449
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,366
just by being born.

450
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,602
You son of a bitch!

451
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,208
No, no! No, no, don't! Don't!

452
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,043
Speak to my friend again like that!
I dare you!

453
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,781
Hey, hey!

454
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,387
No touching the inmate. Hey, back up!

455
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,322
Eddie?

456
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:57,959
You're done.

457
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:03,592
I have tasted blood before,
my friend, and that is not it.

458
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:07,298
Eddie Brock has a big secret!

459
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,964
Shut up, Kasady!

460
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,351
-That may have been a mistake.
-Shut up.

461
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,754
Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock?

462
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,587
I don't know anymore.

463
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,196
-Eddie!
-I don't wanna hear another word.

464
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,163
-Eddie.
-I don't wanna hear it.

465
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,755
Eddie, I am sorry.

466
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:39,028
That was his last time on record ever!

467
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,767
There's no more words for his victims.
You know, they're gone.

468
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:47,335
Any clues of outstanding bodies,
we've lost forever.

469
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:48,674
1 didn't mean to.

470
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,544
-You didn't mean to?
-And I said I'm sorry!

471
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,948
You didn't mean to, but you did it.
You just decided, I don't know:

472
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,110
That's it. You did it.

473
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,450
You didn't even think
we might get caught, get killed?

474
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,219
You don't think about things like that.
You think about chickens.

475
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,784
You think about you, you think about
what you want, and you think about you.

476
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,389
Let me remind you of something, Eddie.
You were a loser before I came along.

477
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,967
You were nothing. I made you special!

478
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,059
You made me special?
Let me tell you something.

479
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,504
Before you came along, I had a life.
I didn't have chickens, but I had dreams.

480
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,702
I had dreams and a fiancée
and a really successful TV show!

481
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,007
But you destroyed
all of those things by yourself.

482
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,640
Yeah. But you know what? I rebuilt my life
and now I just wanna live it. Good night.

483
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,584
And how did you build this new life?

484
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,710
Excuse me?

485
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:34,088
Well, who found the clue on the wall
$0 you could be this big, shiny hero?

486
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,593
Who found the clue? Who?

487
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,756
Yeah.

488
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:44,165
No, no, no. This is not
about being a hero for me, man.

489
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:49,230
This is about wanting to live in peace.
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

490
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,174
No, you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

491
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,236
Okay, this is about me
wanting to live without you

492
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,544
whining in my ear all the time
about eating bad guys

493
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,449
or nagging me about Anne,

494
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,919
or destroying my place
or destroying my life!

495
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:07,754
Do you know how lucky
you are that I chose you?

496
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:08,951
You chose me?

497
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,719
Buddy, I'm the only person
that took you in

498
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,026
when your friends kicked you off
the planet Ming Mong

499
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,190
because you are a reject!

500
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,759
You are a pariah! Lethal protection,
my ass. You couldn't protect anything.

501
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,862
You are useless. You couldn't
get a job down here cleaning toilets!

502
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,076
I'm sorry! I don't know what came over me.
Please, let me fix it.

503
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,579
So I can break it again!

504
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,945
You son of a bitch!

505
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,593
Out! Get out. Take your stuff. Get out!

506
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,964
This is my house!

507
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,492
No!

508
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,635
Keep it down up there!

509
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,272
Get out!

510
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,645
Sonny?

511
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,752
-You wouldn't dare!
-Yeah, absolutely.

512
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,786
No, no, no!

513
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,422
-Yeah!
-No!

514
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,932
I'm calling the police!

515
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,798
I am so sorry.

516
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,002
Show yourself.

517
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,152
You can't win!

518
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,985
Take a look at me.
Look at the size of you.

519
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,114
Puny.

520
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,156
How dare you?

521
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,460
1 guess this is goodbye.

522
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,870
Oh, yeah.
Finally something we agree on.

523
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,410
What in the world?

524
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,174
All this crazy shit.

525
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:11,838
Yeah!

526
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,698
No. No.

527
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,327
No, no, no.

528
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,206
No!

529
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,537
Yeah!

530
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,706
No!

531
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,402
-Yeah!
-No!

532
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,940
Oh, yeah!

533
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,345
No.

534
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,024
No, no, no.

535
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,856
I wish I never met you!

536
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,854
Sayonara!

537
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,609
Cletus Kasady,
you have been tried, convicted

538
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,977
and sentenced to death
by the state of California.

539
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:23,550
May your passing bring closure
to the victims' families.

540
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,421
And may you find peace
in the hereafter.

541
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,325
Soon come chaos.

542
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,920
Chaos soon come.

543
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,624
Are those your final words?

544
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,500
Enjoy the show.

545
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:19,799
Warden.

546
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:25,044
Something wicked this way comes.

547
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,624
Let me out!

548
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,060
Don't move!

549
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,071
Hey!

550
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,988
Please.

551
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,066
I got a family.

552
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,526
Any last words, warden?

553
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,654
Don't! Please!

554
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:13,145
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell

555
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,185
May your walls fall down
And may 1 live to tell

556
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:21,548
1 walk out a wiser, stronger man

557
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,890
And, warden, you tasted just like ham

558
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,152
You two are being evicted.

559
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,865
Come on, don't look at me like that.
It was never gonna work out.

560
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,030
All right?

561
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,940
Yes.

562
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:25,186
Just because of how quickly he moved in,
the offensive line cannot pick him up.

563
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,419
Breaking news. Serial killer
Cletus Kasady is on the run...

564
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,357
Shit.

565
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,521
...as a state-wide manhunt is underway...

566
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,562
Oh, shit.

567
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,962
...after fast night's audacious escape
from San Quentin.

568
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,738
It is absolute chaos here,
we have reports of bullets...

569
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,873
-Hey.
-What, you're not dead?

570
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,881
No.

571
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:52,882
May I come in?

572
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,248
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

573
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,721
I was just seeing for myself on the news.

574
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,789
Yeah, on a scale of one to ten,
it's 11 bad.

575
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:02,757
Yeah.

576
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,819
Reports coming from San Quentin are,
quite frankly, bananas.

577
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,761
Nice TV.

578
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,096
How did he do it?

579
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,602
Yeah, how did he, indeed?
That's the million-dollar question.

580
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,934
And yet again,
you were his special visitor.

581
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,495
So, what did he tell you?

582
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,803
Me? Nothing. Nothing at all.

583
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,468
Nothing about an escape plan?

584
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,104
Nothing about some kind
of elaborate breakout costume?

585
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,648
No.

586
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:28,116
Well, how come every time you seem
to be at the centre of these things,

587
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,813
and then miraculously
you know nothing about it?

588
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,150
Maybe I'm lucky.

589
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,155
Yeah, right.

590
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,486
You said...

591
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:44,458
the reports coming out
of San Quentin are bananas.

592
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,969
What do you mean by "bananas"?

593
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,631
Remember when I asked you a similar
question the day you interviewed him?

594
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,198
Information is currency.

595
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,937
You of all people should know that.

596
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,275
Come on.

597
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,213
I thought he'd come to try to find
the man that nearly got him executed,

598
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,448
but I guess not.

599
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,622
I'd lay low if I was you.

600
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,657
I'l see myself out.

601
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,832
Okay, think. Think, think, think.

602
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,136
What would Venom do?

603
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:28,407
He would find you before you find me,
and he would eat your face! Damn.

604
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,410
All right.

605
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,677
Who do we leave behind,
and how do we leave them?

606
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,746
-A connubial bed, empty, left to rot.
-Connubial. Is it marriage?

607
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,156
Waiting in the darkness
for the rescuer who never comes.

608
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,489
I don't understand.

609
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,555
"That circle of hell..."
-The cathedral on the hill is fell silent

610
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,429
because of you.

611
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,094
-You and! are the same.
-"...with one bright light."

612
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,070
Twisted insides...

613
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,265
Bright light.

614
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:01,905
You feel like home to me, like family.

615
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,537
St. Estes.

616
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,230
Crapola!

617
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,269
Another one bites the dust.

618
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:43,776
Look at all these weirdos.

619
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,283
My kind of people.

620
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:48,814
Nice costume.

621
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,325
Hey!

622
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,292
Awesome work!

623
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,888
Greatest costume ever! Oh, my God.

624
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,565
Is that Japanese?

625
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,399
No, I made it myself.

626
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,632
-Hey!
-Who, me?

627
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,639
Hello, gorgeous.

628
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,641
Sorry, no, not my type.

629
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,507
I am out of the Eddie closet!

630
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,967
Hello, darling.

631
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,277
Racer red, got to have it.

632
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,516
Let's get this party started.

633
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:54,718
Oh, hell, yes.

634
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,519
Stop! Stop, man! Stop! Stop!

635
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,791
Shit.

636
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,229
You are real.

637
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,328
lam.

638
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,802
And once I kill that thing that made me,

639
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,470
we will be indestructible.

640
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,571
I know where to find him,

641
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:23,848
but first I need you
to help me find something I lost.

642
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,515
Deal.

643
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,435
Oh, yeah!

644
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,008
Dude.

645
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,085
Oh, yeah, bro! What?

646
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:19,907
Thank you!

647
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:25,579
Oh, shit.

648
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:27,947
Your costume is amazing!

649
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,212
Thank you, one person!

650
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,786
Eddie was wrong.

651
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,620
He kept me hidden

652
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,126
because he was ashamed!

653
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,789
But look at me now!

654
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,060
You love me.

655
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:44,930
And I'm free!

656
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,732
Yeah!

657
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:53,767
Stop this cruel treatment of aliens.

658
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:54,675
It is wrong.

659
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,571
All of us should be able to live together

660
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,118
upon this ball of rock.

661
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,184
Free to be who we be!

662
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:09,822
I love you!

663
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,258
I love you too!

664
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:15,265
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

665
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,766
Lethal Protector out.

666
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,272
Well, that was a hard act to follow.

667
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,441
I wish you could have seen me tonight...

668
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:35,983
Eddie.

669
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:22,761
Holy shit.

670
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,602
-Mulligan.
-It's Eddie Brock here.

671
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,765
Look, this may be a long shot,
but I think I may have found something.

672
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,273
Go on, Eddie. What do you got?

673
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,402
Last time 1 spoke to Kasady,
he was talking to me about connubial beds

674
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,106
and marriage, and it didn't
make a whole lot of sense to me.

675
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:41,014
But I'm here at St. Estes,
and I found this...

676
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,454
Well, I'm standing in front of a tree.

677
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,955
And I'm looking at it.
I's got a carving on it.

678
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:51,688
It says, "CK loves FB."

679
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,858
I'm thinking that maybe whoever this FB is
might know where he's headed.

680
00:48:56,566 --> 00:49:00,594
And if you can, I don't know,
pull up some files from St. Estes,

681
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,935
maybe you can figure out who this FB is.

682
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,201
FB, that's Frances Barrison.

683
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,905
Wow, that's quick.

684
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,744
Yeah, it's impossible, Eddie.

685
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,151
She's dead. I shot her.

686
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:56,782
Can I help you, sir?

687
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,304
Got any of those Internets?

688
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:33,854
You're alive.

689
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:44,797
When I get out,

690
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,675
I'm gonna slice your face off
and wear it to a party!

691
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,339
You're never
getting out of here, Siegfried.

692
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,746
No one does.

693
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,677
Well, Frances.

694
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:03,924
It seems your sweetheart has done
a Houdini act over there at San Quentin.

695
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,664
It's all over the news.

696
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:12,762
Oh, don't get excited.
He's not gonna find you.

697
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:17,840
Screw you.

698
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,171
How flattering.

699
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,670
But you're not my type.

700
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,079
I wonder where he could be.

701
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,079
I'm right here.

702
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,014
Ta-da!

703
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,476
Hi, baby.

704
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:02,485
I don't want you to freak out, okay?

705
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,888
I'd like you to meet...

706
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:08,084
Carnage.

707
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,405
That is so hot!

708
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,648
Go.

709
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,162
A'66!

710
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,770
My dream car.

711
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,708
Yeah, I remember. Let's see what you got.

712
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:42,083
Yes, baby!

713
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,063
This is SFPD. Stand down!

714
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:29,895
Stop! You'll kill him!

715
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,560
She does that again, I'l eat her face.

716
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,304
He's sensitive to sound.

717
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,742
Stop the vehicle! Stand down!

718
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,785
Who said romance was dead?

719
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,589
Hey! No drunks in here!

720
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,092
Help me. Food.

721
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,898
Out! You get out!

722
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,735
Chocolate.

723
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:13,940
Venom?

724
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,345
I'm having trouble
keeping them standing, Mrs. C.

725
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,938
Where's Eddie?

726
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,078
Food...

727
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,323
Monsters!

728
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,523
Monsters everywhere!

729
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,598
They're everywhere!

730
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,762
Monsters!

731
00:55:58,555 --> 00:55:59,784
Put out an APB,

732
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,485
form a perimeter,

733
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,390
blockade state lines,

734
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,788
and bring in Brock.

735
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:12,063
I'm no use to anybody here.
I'm just wasting your time.

736
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:14,466
You know what I keep thinking?
I keep thinking:

737
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,006
"What else is Eddie Brock
not sharing about Cletus Kasady?

738
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:20,737
Why was it Eddie that Cletus wanted
to witness his execution?"

739
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,308
Bad things happen around you.

740
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,975
Multiple dead bodies
at your building last year,

741
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,678
that bizarre outburst
at the lobster restaurant,

742
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,747
and only you at the Life Foundation
when that rocket exploded.

743
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,549
And now Clyde's found Bonnie

744
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:40,152
and there's a dead psychiatrist at a
facility I knew nothing about until today.

745
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,221
And people are talking about
seeing monsters.

746
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,822
Monsters?

747
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,925
What do you mean "monsters"?

748
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:49,733
Monsters, Eddie! Everywhere Cletus goes,
so goes this supposed monster.

749
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,170
Oh, God.

750
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,572
Talk to me, Eddie.

751
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,505
Talk to me.

752
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,343
How's he doing it?

753
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:03,408
What's the secret?
How's he making people see things?

754
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,783
All right...

755
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,525
I can't answer any more of your questions
without making my phone call.

756
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,454
I'l get you your phone call.

757
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,263
But you know what secrets want, Eddie?

758
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:22,805
They want out.
That's why they're so hard to keep.

759
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,408
Eddie asked you to do this?

760
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:36,384
He has no one else that can help?
We'll be late for the party.

761
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,750
He's in trouble, Dan.

762
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,721
Yeah, trouble is his thing.

763
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:44,318
-Are there gonna be aliens again?
-No, of course not.

764
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,555
I'd like to speak to him alone.

765
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,795
Your duty of honesty supersedes your duty
to the client if somebody gets harmed.

766
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,564
They teach you that at posh school?

767
00:57:57,173 --> 00:58:01,406
Oh, hey. Anne. Hey, Anne,
thank you so much for coming.

768
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,173
Boy, that little guy's a charmer, huh?

769
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,139
How much do I need
to worry about you right now?

770
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,342
I messed up.

771
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:09,782
Okay. How badly?

772
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,447
It couldn't be worse, and it's all on me.

773
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,682
Whatever you did,
you just need to tell the cops the truth.

774
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:19,751
No. No. No, I can't tell them
that they are chasing a serial killer

775
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,764
who's also got an alien inside of him

776
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,633
and he's capable of killing everybody.

777
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,703
Venom. Talk to me, what's happening?

778
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:34,675
No, he's not here. He's not here.

779
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:40,710
Is this like an I'm lying "He's not here"
oris this a real "He's not here"?

780
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:41,875
He's not here.

781
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,953
Jesus Christ, Eddie.

782
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,681
St. Estes fire. All units.

783
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,017
What the actual f--?

784
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:47,988
Eddie, think.

785
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:51,391
I don't know. All I know is that he
can't go long without eating food, right?

786
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,122
So he's eating chicken
and he eats chocolate and that's it.

787
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,359
And that is only
if he's still observing the rules.

788
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:01,994
We need to find him.

789
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,232
You mean I need to find him.

790
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,742
Yeah, you need to find him, please.
And then I will fix it.

791
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,172
IM try.
-Thank you.

792
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,516
Mrs. Chen.

793
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,074
-Who's asking?
-It's me.

794
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:18,880
What do you want?

795
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,379
She's a charmer.

796
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,254
-Okay, listen--
-You broke Eddie's heart.

797
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,690
I don't have time to explain
why that's off the mark.

798
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:27,321
-Do you know where Venom is?
-You wanna break his heart too?

799
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,525
I'm not gonna get
into who did what to who.

800
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,693
Eddie said
he might be here for the chocolate.

801
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,099
I need to speak with the alien.

802
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,864
-You said there wouldn't be any aliens.
-I meant more aliens.

803
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,271
-Breaking news.
~The mayor has issued a curfew...

804
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:39,569
Turn the volume up, please.

805
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:45,041
Kasady and Barrison should be treated
as armed and extremely dangerous.

806
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,708
An all-out manhunt continues tonight.

807
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,447
-S0?
-Cletus has a symbiote.

808
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:53,716
Oh, my God! Any other information
you're pathologically lying about?

809
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,554
-Pussy.
-Excuse me?

810
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,855
-Eddie needs Venom.
-She just called me a pussy.

811
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,022
He said he didn't need him,
that life was better without him.

812
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,122
Okay, I don't understand.
What do you care--?

813
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,301
Oh, wait a second.

814
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,237
You get out here right now.

815
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,444
Do you see that?
Seriously, do you see that?

816
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:16,774
Yeah, hon, I've seen it.

817
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:21,578
Eddie's going to have to fight this battle
all by his little bitch self.

818
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,415
Don't be a big baby. Go help your friend!

819
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:26,046
He said I couldn't
get a job fixing toilets!

820
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:30,321
Cletus will come for him.
He won't survive without you.

821
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:34,659
Of course he won't.
Because I am the hero of the two of us.

822
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,167
Yeah, you're the big sexy hero.

823
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:46,071
You're the coolest, you're the hottest,
and you're the bravest.

824
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,109
lam.

825
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:48,666
I'm still standing right here.

826
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,405
No one likes you, Dan!

827
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,248
I love seeing you in action.

828
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,415
Let's go save that asshole.

829
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:10,088
I promised we'd be free from here.

830
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:14,194
And we'd walk
to the cathedral on the hill.

831
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:17,870
A wedding.

832
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:19,442
Three guests.

833
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,841
One for each of us.

834
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:24,641
The cop that took my eye.

835
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,307
Eddie Brock.

836
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,312
And Venom.

837
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,151
A red wedding.

838
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,695
You didn't find him?

839
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:54,711
Oh, my Lord. What happened?

840
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,416
Hey, Dan. All right, let's go.

841
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,552
I'm not talking to him!

842
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,923
He doesn't want to come out.

843
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:15,760
What do you mean? We have to leave now
‘cause Cletus is gonna wipe the city out.

844
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,527
We're not doing shit until he apologises.

845
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,330
So he's looking for an apology.

846
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,167
I know that amends aren't your thing--

847
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,865
Like, as in right now, an apology?

848
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,500
I need him to beg.

849
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,578
Fine, I will be the bigger of us.

850
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:32,944
1 will always be the bigger of us.
But go on.

851
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,110
-What is he saying?
-He said he's listening very sincerely.

852
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,709
All right, listen to this.

853
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:38,720
I am sorry.

854
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,187
Not the right tone.

855
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,221
I'm sorry.

856
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,417
Nope!

857
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,255
I am sorry!

858
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:46,851
So weird.

859
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:47,862
I'm
El
orry!

860
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,420
Why are you shouting at me?

861
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:53,196
Okay, well, fine.
I was a loser before I met you.

862
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,896
Yup. That's right.

863
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,735
And now I am someone.

864
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:01,243
You made me special.

865
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:02,641
Damn right!

866
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:05,578
-Why don't you put a cherry on it?
-A cherry on that? Right.

867
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:07,739
I'm...

868
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,645
I am truly very sorry
for everything that I said,

869
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,745
everything that I did not say,

870
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,291
everything that I did,

871
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:18,156
and probably everything that I did not do.

872
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,423
Yeah, he's thinking.

873
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,624
Come on, come on.

874
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:25,965
Okay!

875
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,967
-Oh, no.
-Kiss her!

876
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,939
Are you gonna kiss me now?

877
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,670
-No!
-No?

878
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:36,506
God, I'm never doing that again.

879
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:39,240
Well, maybe never.
I don't know. Honestly, it's really fun.

880
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,114
If we save the day, can we
call ourselves the Lethal Protector?

881
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,118
That is so '80s.

882
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:46,679
Dan. Pack quickly.
Don't stay. And if for any reason--

883
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,018
Fire and sound.

884
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,751
"Fire and sound"? Is that a band?

885
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,624
-No, it's what kills them.
-Yeah.

886
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,423
Okay, look, man, I've got her.

887
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:57,657
Not sorry!

888
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,193
God, I'm so sorry.

889
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,965
Those two need some
serious couples counselling.

890
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,009
I'm pulling up to Brock's now.

891
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,148
Shit. Oh, my God.

892
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,448
Kasady, place your hands on your head!

893
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,715
Which...

894
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,054
hands?

895
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:26,627
What the f-?

896
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,996
We found you.

897
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,971
Shriek will be so pleased.

898
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:46,882
Brockalicious!

899
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,595
Bling-a-ling.

900
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,533
Now, whose finger were you meant for?

901
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:20,906
A nice shiny lure for a little fishy.

902
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,750
Okay, here we go, buddy.

903
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:43,934
Hello, Anne.
I just incapacitated your boyfriend.

904
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,633
Now, he'll be okay,

905
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:48,438
with an answer about where Eddie Brock is.

906
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,077
Well, I'm sure as shit
not gonna tell you that.

907
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,809
It's a shame to hurt you.

908
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:04,389
Tell Brock Cletus will make a swap.

909
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,827
Her head for his.

910
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,330
He's gonna kill you both.

911
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,925
Peeps have tried that already.

912
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,333
Botched it!

913
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,576
They can't find him!

914
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,619
They are hunting us too, buddy.

915
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,020
Come on, where are you?

916
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,627
Hey, Dan. What's going on?

917
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:42,960
Eddie, they got her.

918
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:44,790
They've taken Anne!

919
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,097
-Calm down.
-They took her to their wedding.

920
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,796
-They took her where?
-Their wedding.

921
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,805
-Grace Cathedral. Hurry.
-We're on our way.

922
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:54,000
All right, it looks like
we are going to a wedding.

923
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,101
Oh, will there be canapés?

924
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,543
You bet your ass.

925
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,346
That distant cathedral...

926
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,851
is all I see.

927
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,318
Fractured angel...

928
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:47,260
the other part of me.

929
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,531
Dearly beloved...

930
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,068
Gifts first.

931
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:55,001
Actually, traditionally--

932
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,096
Shut your mouth...

933
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:00,098
Father.

934
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:04,703
Baby, I got for you what you want most.

935
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,407
The cop?

936
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:07,778
The cop.

937
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:08,748
Continue, Father.

938
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,716
Dearly beloved,

939
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:13,016
if anyone objects to this marriage,

940
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:16,583
speak now or forever hold their

941
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,092
Where is she?

942
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,625
There you are.

943
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:27,361
Death to you, Father.

944
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,597
No!

945
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,138
Not you, Father.

946
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:33,035
You, Father.

947
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,235
Oh, shit!

948
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,472
Where you going? What are you doing?

949
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,312
This is much worse than I thought.
That is a red one.

950
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,886
-Red one?
-We should leave. Immediately.

951
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,547
Annie will get over it.
We never liked her anyway.

952
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,249
-So let's go.
-Now?

953
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:51,453
Congratulations to the happy couple.
We are leaving.

954
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,459
Eddie!

955
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,157
I'l be right with you. All right?

956
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,960
You need to come out right now.

957
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:00,832
Because I am feeling
super, super vulnerable right here.

958
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:02,734
Brock's just like you?

959
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,102
Not for long.

960
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,068
Eddie, over here!

961
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:10,111
You need to come out right now.

962
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,342
I will let you eat everybody!
You can eat them all!

963
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,781
Apart from him in the robe.
You cannot eat him.

964
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,580
-Promise?
-l promise!

965
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:21,946
Thank you.

966
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,667
Baby!

967
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,707
Shut your mouth.

968
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,035
Marriage trouble already?

969
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,345
Time to die.

970
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,041
That's the spirit!

971
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:51,211
I mean us. We are going to die.

972
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,752
I killed you.

973
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,854
Well, you can't kill a ghost.

974
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,864
You. Kill him,

975
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:45,498
but keep your mouth shut.

976
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:48,271
Our wife knows what she's doing.

977
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,175
Just turn it down.

978
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,874
Who do you think you're talking to?

979
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,607
-Stop him!
-My cop!

980
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:03,915
Honeymoon over?

981
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,061
Oh, God. No.

982
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,061
Power up.

983
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:11,224
No!

984
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,982
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Cletus Kasady--

985
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:45,297
What do they say

986
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:47,995
about an eye for an eye?

987
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,508
Fire and sound!

988
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:00,776
Except without the sound.

989
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,476
Baby!

990
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,282
Cletus!

991
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,221
Mano a mano, Brock.

992
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,699
You know how I spent my endless days?

993
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:06,574
I spent them thinking about
how you only told one side of the story.

994
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:23,529
You didn't write about the part
where Cletus was abused

995
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:27,058
by Mommy, Daddy, and Granny!

996
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:04,695
You didn't tell the world
how he was a scared little boy

997
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,364
that no one cared about

998
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,879
and no one came to save!

999
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:17,252
You never asked yourself

1000
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,377
why!

1001
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:21,913
That's bad journalism.

1002
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:31,926
Oh, happy days.

1003
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:43,571
I'm not a crazy man,

1004
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,973
but I am a vengeful one.

1005
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,451
You're going to watch her die.

1006
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:01,527
Anne!

1007
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:03,162
Anne!

1008
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:19,879
Do something!

1009
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:25,610
Eddie, I'm afraid we cannot beat them.

1010
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:34,523
Baby, that's too much.

1011
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,322
You gotta stop him.

1012
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,197
What are you doing?

1013
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:41,201
I'l shut her up for good.

1014
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:44,704
No! Stop! You're hurting her!

1015
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,671
Get up!

1016
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:52,236
I can't.

1017
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,476
Look, look!

1018
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,747
They're not symbiotic.

1019
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:00,845
-Get away from her!
-Shut up.

1020
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,221
Take your hands off my wife!

1021
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,884
They're not a match.

1022
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,094
We are.

1023
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:11,564
That's right. We are.

1024
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,396
Together we are...

1025
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,407
-the Lethal Protector!
-The Lethal Protector!

1026
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:40,312
Let there be carnage!

1027
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,204
I got you. You okay?

1028
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:38,169
Father, one of us must die.

1029
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,470
We need fire.

1030
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,844
Or sound.

1031
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,560
No!

1032
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:22,222
Holy mackerel!

1033
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:01,455
He did not taste good.

1034
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:18,337
I'm a killer
with or without the monster, Eddie.

1035
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,641
You know what I really wanted?

1036
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:25,920
No. What was it, Cletus?

1037
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,786
I told you, but you weren't listening.

1038
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,448
Well, I'm listening now.

1039
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:35,085
I wanted your friendship.

1040
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,459
I'm sorry, Cletus.

1041
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,695
Fuck this guy!

1042
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,825
You in there, get him out of here.

1043
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,998
They're gonna come for you both.

1044
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:11,555
I know.

1045
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:14,726
Hey, Anne.

1046
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:16,564
Take care.

1047
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,340
Yeah. You too, champ.

1048
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,741
Dan!

1049
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,837
-You take care too.
-Thanks.

1050
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,383
I like you.

1051
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:30,646
We totally didn't need him, though.

1052
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,882
Honestly, I think he was
more of a hindrance than a help.

1053
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,393
Monsters.

1054
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:04,412
That there is Don Quixote,
and the guy next to him is Sancho Panza.

1055
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,681
They're two very different people who
have very different takes on the world.

1056
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,856
Different ways of doing things.

1057
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:15,556
Sometimes they didn't like each other
a whole lot, but ultimately...

1058
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:20,132
they worked together
to bring out the best in each other.

1059
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:24,399
Eddie, the time has come.

1060
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,063
I must go alone.

1061
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,107
It is me they want.

1062
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:30,869
Yeah.

1063
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,906
Well, my dear Sancho,

1064
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,587
facts are the enemy of truth.

1065
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,881
What does that even mean?

1066
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,219
It means...

1067
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,484
It means that we...

1068
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:48,296
are Ve...

1069
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:49,329
Fugitives!

1070
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,729
...nom. Yeah. Yeah.

1071
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,961
On the run.

1072
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:54,331
That too.

1073
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:10,946
Thank you for bringing me here.

1074
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:12,509
You're welcome, buddy.

1075
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:14,919
It's beautiful, huh?

1076
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,856
I'm sorry that we can't do anything
about the old

1077
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,452
wind-in-your-hair situation, but...

1078
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:25,466
Osho says,
when you love someone,

1079
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:28,332
-you accept the whole person,
-Osho?

1080
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,871
with all of their defects.

1081
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:32,098
Defects.

1082
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,937
Nobody is perfect.

1083
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,773
Just go back a minute. You telling me--?

1084
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,040
You just said that you love me.

1085
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,106
You did.

1086
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:43,810
Where will we go?

1087
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,683
I don't know. I don't know.

1088
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,318
Anywhere that needs
a Lethal Protector, I suppose.

1089
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:53,157
-You really meant it!
-Yeah.

1090
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:56,320
We will need a cape. And a mask.

1091
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,169
No. No, I think you got that covered.
We're good.

1092
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:07,744
Oh, I love this show.

1093
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:08,845
Yeah.

1094
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:13,057
Maximiliano's feelings
are not being validated.

1095
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:16,893
Yeah, well, he never should've kept
such an insane secret, man.

1096
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:19,057
We alf have a past, Eddie.

1097
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:23,493
What do you mean?
You hiding stuff from me?

1098
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:29,076
Eighty billion light years
of Hive knowledge across universes

1099
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:31,839
would explode your tiny little brain.

1100
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:35,178
What does that even mean, man?

1101
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,082
Well, let me give you a taste, then.

1102
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:42,521
Just the smallest fraction of the things
we symbiotes have experienced.

1103
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,557
Okay.

1104
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:44,922
Ready, Eddie?

1105
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:46,016
Yeah.

1106
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:55,593
Oh, what's happening?

1107
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:59,600
Oh! No, no, no! No!

1108
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:03,471
What the hell is that?

1109
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:05,945
Oh, that's just a towel.

1110
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:08,608
Where are we?

1111
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,116
-What did you do?
-It wasn't me.

1112
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:14,416
You better believe this shocking
revelation brought to light by yours truly

1113
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:15,957
has only raised more questions...

1114
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:16,956
What is this?

1115
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:18,822
...about the secret life
of Peter Parker...

1116
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:24,327
aka Spider-Man,
aka the Spider-Menace.

1117
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:28,335
But rest assured, dear viewers,
we here at the Daily Bugle won't rest...

1118
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:30,427
That guy.

1119
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:32,837
...until we've uncovered
the truth from his web of lies!

1120
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:34,465
I'm J. Jonah Jameson.

1121
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:36,009
Good night,

1122
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:39,310
and God help us all.

1123
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:43,516
Dude. What are you doing in my room?
