1
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,447
Do you know anything
about that car parked outside?

2
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,324
Could it be that bastard Ji Sooheon's car?

3
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,453
I can't really see their faces,

4
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,913
but it looks like there are two people
in the car.

5
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,790
-Two people?
-Yeah.

6
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,333
Ah, fuck, hold on.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,335
It's a man and a woman.

8
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,214
Wow, fuck.
They're about to have sex in the car.

9
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,758
Then chase them off.

10
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,802
That way, Ji Sooheon can approach
without suspecting anything.

11
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,720
Gotcha. I'm going to hang up for now.

12
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,764
What the fuck.

13
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,974
Why do they have to do that
in front of someone's house? Fuck.

14
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,278
Ugh, why do these fuckers
have to mess around over here?

15
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,279
Hey!

16
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,158
Leave.

17
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,125
Crazy bastards, shit.

18
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,190
Damn it.

19
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,443
Ji Sooheon, you bastard.

20
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,487
I caught your ass today.

21
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:33,004
REVENGE OF OTHERS

22
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:42,764
ONE DAY EARLIER

23
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,308
PILSUNG EXPRESS

24
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,986
Hello.

25
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,447
Do you remember me?

26
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,658
Oh, of course, of course.

27
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,952
Oh, but, what brings you here today?

28
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,123
I have something to tell you.

29
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,210
We'll do it.

30
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,011
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL

31
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:12,645
ICU VISITOR WAITING ROOM

32
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,443
Thanks.

33
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,044
What brings you here this early?

34
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,212
How's your mother doing?

35
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,634
She's the same.

36
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,802
Sooheon.

37
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,888
I just got back
from meeting Min Seonha's dad

38
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,182
at the shipping center,
where he works as a delivery man.

39
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,893
I know you need money fast.

40
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,103
Min Seonha's dad has made another request.

41
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,441
I guess that bastard Sa Junggyeong
is harassing Min Seonha again.

42
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,901
He's such a dirtbag.

43
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,167
I'll do it.

44
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,546
This is dangerous,

45
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,091
so stay out of this, Ajung.

46
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,051
I'll be fine.

47
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,844
But I haven't told Tae Soyeon about this.

48
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,518
I guess I better head to school.

49
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,562
I'll see you there, Sooheon.

50
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,164
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL

51
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,168
Ajung, Hong Ajung...

52
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,860
WHITE CIDER

53
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,531
I was pretty thirsty.

54
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,284
So I drank two.

55
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,244
Ah.

56
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,916
-Did you stay at the hospital all night?
-Yeah.

57
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,460
Isn't that my bag?

58
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,794
Yeah.

59
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,254
Your uniform's in here.

60
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,302
I know how you must be feeling,

61
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,429
but you should take care of yourself
so that you can look after your m...

62
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,559
Never mind.

63
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,187
Let's eat first.

64
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,608
Let's go eat.

65
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:18,915
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL

66
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,375
Let's eat.

67
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,261
You didn't have to come
all the way out here.

68
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,138
There's nothing for you to do here.

69
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,474
Look at you.

70
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,143
You're not eating anything,
so I'm here to make sure you eat.

71
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,687
And what about school?

72
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,231
You should be going to school.

73
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,404
I know I should be minding
my own business,

74
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,949
but I'm just so worried about you.

75
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,869
Sooheon.

76
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,081
You need to stay healthy
and live a normal life

77
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,291
in order to take care of your mom, right?

78
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,546
I'm healthy and I'm living a normal life.

79
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,215
Do you really think
this is normal right now?

80
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,469
If everything was normal,
why would I be here this morning?

81
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,638
Also...

82
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,396
Why did you hide the fact
that Ajung was here earlier?

83
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,192
Why would I hide something like that?

84
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,488
Am I supposed to be reporting to you
about every person that stopped by?

85
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,407
Eh...

86
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,452
I'm sorry that I said
you were hiding things.

87
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,331
But is it so wrong for me to ask?

88
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,000
You're pretty busy yourself.

89
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,836
Don't you have a lot
on your plate right now?

90
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,840
So are you saying
I should stop looking out for you?

91
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,233
These were inside Gi Osung's desk drawer.

92
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,985
The drawer was locked.

93
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,868
If they used to hang out together
like that,

94
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,954
it probably means they were pretty close.

95
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,458
Judging from everything so far,

96
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,668
it's pretty clear that Gi Osung
is the culprit.

97
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,755
But we'll have to delve deeper

98
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,214
to find out what really happened

99
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,634
between these four guys.

100
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,346
Jaebum definitely knew my brother.

101
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,141
He just can't remember is all.

102
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,226
Gwon Sejin hung out with them too.

103
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,319
Anyways, I'll look into this.

104
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,154
Just focus on looking after your mom.

105
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,678
-What were you doing in my room, bastard?
-Why would I go into your room?

106
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,054
Answer me! What did you do?

107
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,520
Ji Sooheon.

108
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,855
So you rifled through my drawers
and took my photos?

109
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,734
Ji Sooheon, you're really...

110
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,779
I guess I can't keep you alive.

111
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,912
Someone wants to have a word with you
before you head out for school.

112
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,122
With who?

113
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,457
Who else in this house
would want to speak with you?

114
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,925
Oh, come on in.

115
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,851
Why aren't you having breakfast?

116
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,269
I'm not hungry.

117
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,233
Don't worry too much about your arrest
and the police investigation.

118
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,985
Everything's okay as long
as you didn't do anything wrong.

119
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,279
I didn't do anything.

120
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,198
You're the one who made it worse
by hiding it.

121
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,284
You're right.

122
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,286
I should have thought it through
more carefully.

123
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,413
If this is about the murder,

124
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,498
I haven't done anything, so don't worry.

125
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,543
I'll be on my way to school.

126
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,711
Osung.

127
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,547
Sit down for a minute.

128
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,594
I...

129
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,804
Heard from Jihyun at breakfast

130
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,683
that when Detective Jin came
to the house yesterday

131
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,353
you were fighting with a boy
from Jihyun's class?

132
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,023
It was nothing.

133
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,067
I'm just not on very good terms
with him is all.

134
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,569
So do you always get into physical fights

135
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,488
when you're not on good terms
with someone, especially at home?

136
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,572
He came into my room
and rifled through my things.

137
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,656
Isn't that reason enough to get mad?

138
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,991
He rifled through your room?

139
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,202
What's his name?

140
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,496
I asked you what his name is.

141
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,623
It's Ji Sooheon.

142
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,249
Ji Sooheon.

143
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,253
Why would Ji Sooheon
rifle through your room?

144
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,423
He's just that kind of a person.

145
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,841
I don't understand
why Kook Jihyun likes him so much

146
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,885
as to invite him over to our house.

147
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,886
I don't get it.

148
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,013
By any chance, are you and Ji Sooheon

149
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,432
involved in this murder case?

150
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,433
What?

151
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,353
Why would we be involved
with the murder case?

152
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,771
We're not.

153
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,066
I mean, why was your study café receipt
left behind at the crime scene?

154
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,236
Since you wouldn't have been
at the crime scene,

155
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,697
I'm asking if Ji Sooheon would have had
anything to do with that receipt.

156
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,242
I don't know... anything about that.

157
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,373
Anyways, the killer intentionally left

158
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,084
your study café receipt
at the murder scene.

159
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,002
That's the fact.

160
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,631
They're trying to frame you
as the murderer.

161
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,258
So...

162
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,927
what should I do?

163
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,136
We need to catch the killer.

164
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,306
We need to find the guy
who's trying to frame you,

165
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,685
so that they can't hurt you anymore.
We need to find them quickly.

166
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,061
As for you, Osung...

167
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,230
...don't worry about this investigation
and just focus on your studies.

168
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,773
Do you understand me?

169
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,233
Yes, Dad.

170
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,068
Okay, you can go now.

171
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,596
How are you, Mr. Choi?

172
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,639
Oh, hey, I'm doing well, Chanmi.

173
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,224
You're working early today.

174
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,685
I had an appointment with a customer.

175
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,646
Where's Sooheon?

176
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,732
I don't know.

177
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,318
He must be at the hospital
because of his mom.

178
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,153
That's really a lot for him to deal with.

179
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,113
-Mr. Choi...
-Yeah?

180
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,407
Can I ask you for a favor?

181
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,534
Sure. What is it?

182
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,704
I was wondering if you could sell
this scooter for me.

183
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,372
I guess you're probably
not going to replace it.

184
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,791
-Are you not going to ride one anymore?
-Yeah, I'm not going to ride it anymore.

185
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,587
-Do you know how to prepare the documents?
-Yes, I put the documents under the seat.

186
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,590
Did you now?
You must be serious about selling it then?

187
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,218
Mr. Choi, please make sure
you sell it at a high price.

188
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,597
Are you in desperate need of money?

189
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,015
Thank you.

190
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,559
About Ji Sooheon.

191
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,395
I've come up
with a plan to get rid of him.

192
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,147
A plan? What good is a plan?

193
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,899
You just have to grab him
and beat the shit out of him.

194
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,987
My cousin and his friends
are going to beat him to a pulp.

195
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,988
Isn't that enough?

196
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,656
We can't be the ones
to lay our hands on him first.

197
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,741
That's why I asked to meet up.

198
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,743
Why can't we lay our hands on him?

199
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,912
I'm telling you. I'm going to kill the guy
who did this to my foot.

200
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,455
You don't have any evidence.

201
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,165
What are you going to do if he says
he's not the one who did this to you?

202
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,501
Once we beat the shit out of him,
he'll probably beg for mercy.

203
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,462
If you beat the shit out of him,
you'll end up in jail.

204
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,840
Aren't you on probation

205
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,675
for assaulting Min Seonha?

206
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,428
You'll definitely end up
in jail this time.

207
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,265
So what do you suggest we do?

208
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,643
Let's set a trap.

209
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,646
That bastard Ji Sooheon
will crawl right into it.

210
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,440
And once he's in,
it'll snap around his ankles like this.

211
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,068
He'll be stuck and won't be able
to make a move.

212
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,613
So how do you want to set up the trap?

213
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,198
I heard you've been putting pressure
on Min Seonha recently. Is that true?

214
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,450
Yeah.

215
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,993
Min Seonha must know.

216
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,246
She probably asked someone
to turn me into this shriveled mess.

217
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,124
That's why I've been
pressuring Min Seonha lately.

218
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,751
Just keep doing what you've been doing.

219
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,586
And don't do anything else.

220
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,589
Don't go anywhere near Ji Sooheon.

221
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,342
That way, he'll have zero idea
we're onto him.

222
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,385
On the flip side,

223
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,140
you do realize that we definitely need
to kill that bastard Ji Sooheon, right?

224
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,032
What's your deal?

225
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,909
Are you a pervert? Or a thief?

226
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,036
Maybe you're both?

227
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,705
A perverted thief who broke
into my drawer and stole my photos?

228
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,290
I don't know what you're talking about.

229
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,793
Just leave
if you're going to talk bullshit.

230
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,710
Hey.

231
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,003
You and I clearly both know
what's going on.

232
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,671
Don't you feel embarrassed
lying like this?

233
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,965
You took my pictures, polaroid's.

234
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,842
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-You took them.

235
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,430
Did you go crazy
after your visit to the police station?

236
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,307
I already told you it wasn't me.
Why do you keep talking shit?

237
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,601
Who do you think made me get arrested?

238
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,230
It was you. You, bastard.
Why are you playing dumb?

239
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,024
You framed me.

240
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,318
Wow, this bastard's really lost his mind.

241
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,987
Hey, look me in the eyes and tell me.

242
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,491
You were at the body shop.

243
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,410
For that bastard's murder. Weren't you?

244
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,912
You're crazy, aren't you?

245
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,498
How can you be so confident
with all this bullshit?

246
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,669
Okay.

247
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,131
Let's see how long you can keep up
with this lie.

248
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,675
I'm curious too.

249
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,219
How long can you keep up
with this bullshit?

250
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,096
Give me back my photos, you bastard.

251
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,265
How can I give back something
I don't have, you piece of shit?

252
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,475
If you're frustrated,
you can go find them yourself.

253
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,437
Once I find the evidence,

254
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,857
that'll be the end of you.

255
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,360
Like you said, as soon I find evidence,

256
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,404
your life's going to end.

257
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,116
This guy.

258
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,704
I don't have time for you right now.

259
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,249
So if you want to talk more shit,
just do it in front of a mirror, okay?

260
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,418
You'll see a pretty revolting bastard
standing before you,

261
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,086
even by your standards.

262
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,135
Let's see if you can keep talking that way
when you're in handcuffs.

263
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,761
Huh?

264
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,471
We'll definitely see about that.

265
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,688
What did you want to talk about?

266
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,899
Oh.

267
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,984
I wanted to ask you something.

268
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,235
Yeah.

269
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,243
Can you teach me how to drive a car?

270
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,494
Drive?

271
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,206
Of course I can teach you.

272
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,582
Do you want to get a license?

273
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,501
Yeah, I want to get my license.

274
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,003
In that case,

275
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,464
I'll guess I'll need to get a hold
of a practice car.

276
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,550
And a place
where we can comfortably practice...

277
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,430
What's this?

278
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,806
Can you take a look at this?

279
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,060
Is there anything you...

280
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,645
I mean...

281
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,521
Can you tell me anything about it?

282
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,773
About this photo.

283
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,691
Ah, I'm sorry.

284
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,444
You know I don't remember much.

285
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,949
Isn't this Park Wonseok?

286
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,283
A few days ago,

287
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,286
Osung showed me a polaroid like this.

288
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,164
One of me and Park Wonseok.

289
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,875
I have no idea who this guy is.

290
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,043
Gwon Sejin.

291
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,963
He was close to my brother.

292
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,297
He plays the violin.

293
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,318
Actually, what I wanted to ask you is...

294
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,697
Why is Gi Osung in the photo?

295
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,783
Based on the photo,
it seems you were all really close.

296
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,245
I just can't believe that my brother
and Gi Osung were close.

297
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,746
Something about it seems weird.

298
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,293
That was why I asked, just in case.

299
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,129
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,047
Ah, it's okay.

301
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,383
By the way,

302
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,677
where did you get this photo?

303
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,221
Uh...

304
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,223
Someone gave it to me.

305
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,977
I can't let you know who, but...

306
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,145
Oh.

307
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,315
Oh, right.

308
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,567
Your driving lesson starts tomorrow.

309
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,080
I'll see you for our next class.

310
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,772
NEW POST SHARE
SOUNDS STUPID :)

311
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,648
Osung, what's going on?

312
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,652
With what? Jaebum, can we talk later?

313
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,446
I just created an Insta account.

314
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,198
SHARE
YOUR POST IS SUCCESSFULLY UPLOADED

315
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,492
Why didn't you show me all the photos?

316
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,372
Why did you show me only
the one of me and Park Wonseok?

317
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,749
There was another one with you

318
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,834
and there was another guy in there too,
Gwon Sejin?

319
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,171
Why did you only show me
the photo of me and Park Wonseok?

320
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,006
Jaebum.

321
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,343
I don't know what you're talking about,
but let's talk later.

322
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,011
I'm kinda busy right now.

323
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,822
Hey, Jihyun.

324
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,074
I'm busy right now.

325
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,076
Check this out.

326
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,996
What's this?

327
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,248
Who took this?

328
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,041
Looks like Gi Osung
created an Insta account.

329
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,876
He uploaded a lot of fun photos.

330
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,338
Ah...

331
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,174
fivestars_GI
MY HOME LIKE 65

332
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,718
Wow, he's driving me insane.
He's finally lost his mind.

333
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,512
Oh, it's kinda funny though.

334
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,472
A lot of people are liking his posts.

335
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,184
-I'm following his account too.
-Ugh, this attention whore.

336
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,979
I was wondering why he didn't have
an Instagram account until now. Ugh.

337
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,523
He even posted practice
questions for the upcoming midterm.

338
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,733
He also posted a map
of favorite hang-out spots for bullies.

339
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,277
He's racking up a lot of followers
in a short amount of time.

340
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,488
-It's pretty popular.
-Popular, my ass.

341
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,871
Soyeon, Gi Osung opened up
an Instagram account.

342
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,540
A lot of his posts are about Kook Jihyun.

343
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,917
What a pathetic loser.

344
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm going to follow him anyways.

345
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,921
-I'm curious.
-Okay.

346
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,756
-Me too, me too, me too.
-Wow, this is pretty good.

347
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,091
Huh? Hey, this is...

348
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,593
I posted it on my Instagram,
so you can check it out.

349
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,012
Can you post more practice questions?

350
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,764
Wow, are you posting for free
what you get from your expensive tutors?

351
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,976
Don't worry. I'll pick
the most helpful ones and post them.

352
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:38,977
Wow, so lucky!

353
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,895
-Really?
-Hey, me too! Me too!

354
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,563
-Let's go.
-All right, I'll send it to you.

355
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,150
Hey, Gi Osung.

356
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,110
Your Insta's pretty fun, huh?

357
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,070
Hey, post more photos of Jihyun.

358
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,739
Okay, don't worry. I got you.

359
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,699
I'm going to post
at least five of her a day.

360
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,826
Five? Oh yeah!

361
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,872
What "Oh yeah"?

362
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,582
So what are you going to do
with my photos?

363
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,133
Instagram?

364
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,468
So after all that,
now you're going to sell my photos?

365
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,844
Just because we live together?

366
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,471
How could you say it like that?

367
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,639
Everyone likes them anyway.

368
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,557
Delete them while I'm asking nicely.

369
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,018
I can't really delete them right now.

370
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,728
Can you hold on
for like two or three days?

371
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,689
-Two or three days?
-Yeah, I think that'll be enough time.

372
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,775
Are you planning something right now?

373
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,276
What are you plotting?

374
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,862
Come on, plotting?
I’m not plotting anything.

375
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,531
I just wanted to try out Instagram is all.

376
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,658
Why after two or three days?

377
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,911
Is something going to end
after two or three days have passed?

378
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,621
It just means

379
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,331
I'll have them up for a bit,
then take them down.

380
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,999
Why did you take photos of me
without telling me?

381
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:43,959
Huh?

382
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,586
It was all just a joke, you know.

383
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,796
How many have you taken?

384
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,631
Tell me how many you took.

385
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,882
Not that many.

386
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,551
It was just for fun.
How many could I have possibly taken?

387
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,593
That's all of it.

388
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,845
Didn't you tell him
you're going to upload five a day?

389
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,305
I mean, I was just throwing bait.

390
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,515
You've got to throw some bait
to reel in the followers

391
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,225
-within a short period of time...
-Anyways.

392
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,060
Delete the posts while I'm here right now

393
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,270
and delete the ones
that are saved on your phone.

394
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,688
Give me your cell phone.

395
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,693
Hey...

396
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,702
I... I'm sorry.

397
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,704
It'll be over in two or three days,
and I'll delete them all after that.

398
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,913
Sorry.

399
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,672
Screw that asshole.

400
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,134
Ugh, what in the world is he plotting?

401
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,021
Enjoy.

402
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,570
What?

403
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,364
You think I'm going to kill you?

404
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,575
I... I deserve to die, detective.

405
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,452
Do you cut your noodles?

406
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,162
Yes, four times.

407
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,455
Ugh, seriously.

408
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,083
I would cut you like this
if I could have it my way.

409
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,963
I'm sorry. It won't ever happen again.

410
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,593
If we're to do our jobs,
let's do it right, yeah?

411
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,179
Kin, networks, alumni, neighbors.

412
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,890
You've got to cut all ties
that could hinder your investigation.

413
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,933
I'll keep that in mind.

414
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,728
If I ever catch you hiding evidence

415
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,688
and reporting to the higher-ups
without reporting to me,

416
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,732
this, this is how you'll end up.

417
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,650
Yes ma'am!

418
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,819
Detective Jin, I got a hold of a video.

419
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,779
What video?

420
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,781
For the body shop case.

421
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,617
We've already checked
all security footage,

422
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,577
and there's nothing else
we haven't collected. We've seen it all.

423
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,496
And you're still saying
there's another video?

424
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,955
This video is totally different.

425
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,415
Where was this taken from?

426
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,000
From the roof of the body shop.

427
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,795
-The roof?
-Yes, ma'am.

428
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,757
Let's go, follow me.

429
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,259
Excuse me? I haven't eaten yet...

430
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,723
So this is the back door of the body shop.

431
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,393
And a drone captured
the suspect coming out the back door.

432
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,103
So this means there was an accomplice.

433
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,733
It seems like it might be an accomplice,
but there's something strange about it.

434
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,819
They left through different routes,

435
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,028
and there's a time gap
between their exits.

436
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,614
One left through the front door,

437
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,659
and the other left through
the back door 10 to 15 minutes later.

438
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,578
It never occurred to me
that it could've been two people.

439
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,623
There was no car
or any security cameras by the back door,

440
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,292
so we couldn't have known this.

441
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,087
Oh, by the way,
how did you get a hold of this?

442
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,674
I was wondering
if there was anything else I could find,

443
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,218
so I went back to the crime scene
before coming into work today.

444
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,222
And I saw a strange guy there.

445
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,015
Look here!

446
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,437
What are you doing over there?

447
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,813
Come down!

448
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,941
Come down from there, quickly!

449
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,276
Who was he?

450
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,364
Cho Dohyun, Male, 27 years old.

451
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,450
He recently graduated from college,
currently unemployed.

452
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,160
And his hobby is playing with his drone.

453
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,662
Come on, move your butt
out of the way, man. I can't see!

454
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,621
I can see now! I can see!

455
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,956
If I were to be more specific...

456
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,374
...his hobby is to secretly
record apartment buildings

457
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,293
or motels at night.

458
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,587
And to record sexual intercourse
or nude scenes.

459
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,921
He's a pervert.

460
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,466
On the night of the murder,

461
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,010
He was enjoying his perverted hobby...

462
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,012
...when his drone broke
and fell somewhere.

463
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,263
I'm fucked.

464
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,523
When he followed the GPS on his drone,

465
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,109
He found out it had crash landed
onto the roof of the body shop.

466
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,241
So he thought he would come back
the next day when it was bright out.

467
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,660
The next morning,
when he came back to the body shop,

468
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,412
there was a police line set up.

469
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,749
He couldn't get past the police line
to retrieve his drone,

470
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,042
so he was hanging around the place.

471
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,835
That's when I found him today.

472
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,338
After retrieving the drone from the roof,

473
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,131
I checked the drone's recordings
just in case.

474
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,549
There was a lot of porn.

475
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,384
Then at the end, this came on.

476
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,220
Jongguk.

477
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,806
Good job.

478
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,891
That pervert was just so gross

479
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,434
that I charged him for violating

480
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,895
the Special Act on the Punishment
of Sexual Violence Crimes.

481
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,063
Got it.

482
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,256
Seonha, you're late.

483
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,802
You should've come right after school,
you fucking whore.

484
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,596
Fuck, how could you make me wait?

485
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,640
Why are you doing this to me?

486
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,809
I told you I don't know anything.

487
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:53,977
Aww, shit.

488
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,562
What do you mean you don't know anything?

489
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,314
If you don't even know who did this to me,
who else would know, you crazy bitch?

490
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,984
Tell me quickly
before I actually kill you.

491
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,111
Who did you ask to do this to me?

492
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,989
Hurry up and tell me, you fucking bitch!

493
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,407
Huh?

494
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,743
Hey, I said hurry up and tell me!

495
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,538
Who was the asshole
you asked to do this? Shit!

496
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,250
Fuck. I'll be back tomorrow, Seonha.

497
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,085
Got it?

498
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:29,512
YONGTAN HIGH

499
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,563
Hey! Hey, what the... What are you doing?

500
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,358
What the...

501
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,902
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

502
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,069
I'm fine.

503
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,408
Hey, what are you doing right now, huh?

504
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,331
Apologize to her.

505
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,874
Jaebum.

506
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,960
It's really not a good idea
for you to get close to Ok Chanmi.

507
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:14,974
Are you all right?

508
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:15,975
Yeah.

509
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,200
Dad, I'm sorry.

510
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,618
No, you shouldn't be, Seonha.

511
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,536
There's nothing for you to be sorry about.

512
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,122
I mean, you've done nothing wrong.

513
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,626
Dad, can I...

514
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,963
Can I transfer to a school far away,
where no one knows me?

515
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,840
I mean, why should you have to transfer
when you haven't done anything wrong?

516
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,801
Just wait it out, Seonha.

517
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,136
He said he'll come back tomorrow.

518
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,557
That devil Sa Junggyeong told me
he'll even come to our house tomorrow.

519
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,687
I really don't know what to do.

520
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,065
I wish I could kill him.

521
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,569
Seon... Seonha, listen to me.

522
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,365
I've made another re-request.

523
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,201
This time, he might actually kill him.

524
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,622
I mean, I didn't actually mean

525
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,125
that he'd kill Sa Junggyeong for real.

526
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,461
I meant that he'll punish him
till he's nearly dead.

527
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,965
Nearly dead, so that he won't ever dare
to approach us, ever again.

528
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,551
-Is that true, Dad?
-Of course.

529
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:35,722
I... I've made another request to him.

530
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,182
So don't worry, Seonha.

531
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,270
Soon, that wretched bastard Sa Junggyeong

532
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,857
will be gone forever.

533
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,775
Is that really going to happen?

534
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,152
Yes, Seonha.

535
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,987
He'll definitely be punished
this time around.

536
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,823
To the point where he won't even be able
to have his chin up.

537
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,293
I just can't stand it anymore, Dad.

538
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,677
It's okay. It's okay.

539
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,894
YOUNGSTRONG TIRE

540
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:00,932
You're here.

541
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,392
Hey, Sa Junggyeong.

542
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,603
At the soonest, it'll be tomorrow
or the day after that.

543
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,146
Ji Sooheon's going to attack you.

544
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,189
What?

545
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,734
Hey, are you sure about that?

546
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,569
I heard it at the convenience store
near Min Seonha's home.

547
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,239
I heard what Min Seonha
and her father were talking about.

548
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,784
Last time,
it was the photography dark room,

549
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,160
so where will it be this time?

550
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,829
Will it be at the school
I've transferred to?

551
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,080
Or maybe on the street?

552
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,998
What the fuck? How can I be prepared
if I don't know where he'll assault me?

553
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,834
The hunter decides where he'll hunt.

554
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,086
That's why it's called a trap.

555
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,254
So where will it be?

556
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,047
At the RV park you're currently living in.

557
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,348
That bastard Ji Sooheon will follow you

558
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,267
to try and find a place to attack you.

559
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,603
Where else would you be alone at night?

560
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,397
The RV park.

561
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,984
That's the perfect place to attack you.

562
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,071
Then my cousin
and his friends can hide near the RV

563
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,241
and once that bastard Ji Sooheon shows up,
they'll attack him and crush his toes.

564
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,659
They can pop all his teeth out.

565
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,369
-Am I right?
-No.

566
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,913
No matter what, you can't beat him up.

567
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,375
Your cousin and his friends
can't show up either.

568
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,627
Instead...

569
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,338
Sa Junggyeong, you're going to have
to take the beating.

570
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,175
What?

571
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,260
I have to get beaten up again?

572
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,138
Are you out of your mind? Seriously.
Hey, you bastard.

573
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,057
Do you think what you're saying
makes any sense right now?

574
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,112
Damn.

575
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,158
Don't go home
after your class ends tomorrow.

576
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,368
What I mean is...

577
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,163
don't go back to the RV.

578
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,249
Okay.

579
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,440
SEOUL

580
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,372
Excuse me.

581
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,082
Slightly to the left.

582
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,792
Like this?

583
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,377
No, that's too much.

584
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,218
Yes, I think that's good.

585
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,221
I think we have to turn it
slightly more to this side.

586
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,472
Here?

587
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,975
A bit more.

588
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,436
-How's this?
-A little more.

589
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,689
How's that?

590
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,274
Yes, that's good.

591
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,736
Damn, this kid thinks he's my boss now?

592
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,808
CAMERA_03

593
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,787
Ji Sooheon.

594
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,832
You're dead.

595
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,970
I need to apologize.

596
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,263
I really owe you an apology.

597
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,392
Are you telling me to drive
this car right now?

598
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,895
This car? Even I can recognize
how big and expensive it is.

599
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,065
Sorry, I couldn't find a practice car.

600
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,276
-All cars are the same.
-Uh, hold on. Hold on.

601
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,322
For today, let's just practice driving
slowly and braking.

602
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,118
I'm sorry, I don't think I can do it.
Can we just go, please?

603
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,202
If you can't do it now,
you'll be traumatized

604
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,745
and never be able to drive again
in the future.

605
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,913
Come on, let's switch seats.

606
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,254
Come on.

607
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,463
Let's just practice braking.

608
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,638
Now, step on the brake.

609
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,725
-It's fine.
-Okay.

610
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,726
Again.

611
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,146
Slowly, just do it slowly.

612
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,984
Now, brake.

613
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,280
Ah, sorry.

614
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,865
It's okay. You're doing great.

615
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,617
Don't step on the break so suddenly.
Do it gradually.

616
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,454
Try to remember how it feels on your feet.

617
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,913
-Okay.
-Try that again.

618
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,127
There you go.
Keep your foot on the accelerator, slowly.

619
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,087
There you go.

620
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,505
Keep going.

621
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,674
Now, the brake, slowly.

622
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,596
Oh, good job.

623
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,889
That's it.

624
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,225
Keep your foot on the brake
and move the gear to P to park.

625
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,562
-P to park.
-There you go

626
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,523
Wow, my hands are shaking.

627
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,401
Let's go again.
Move the gear to D to start again.

628
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,777
Huh? So soon?

629
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:32,990
What?

630
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,825
Sorry.

631
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,745
I just remembered when you first taught me
how to hold a firing pose.

632
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,705
Remember what you told me?

633
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,999
Hold your gun out. Relax your shoulders.

634
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,292
Keep your chin tucked.

635
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,836
Put it down. Hold your gun out.

636
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,464
Stop lying.
When did I ever tell you to do that?

637
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:49,423
You did!

638
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,717
Wow, see? Only the victim remembers.

639
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,763
So move your gear back
to D to drive and start.

640
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,765
Huh?

641
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,475
Start.

642
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,851
Move the gear to D.

643
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,520
D.

644
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,324
Tell me the truth.

645
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,660
Why are you trying to learn
how to drive all of a sudden?

646
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,662
Why?

647
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,122
Is there something wrong with that?

648
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,999
It just felt abrupt.

649
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,168
It's the middle of the semester,
and we're not even on a break.

650
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,838
Do you want the truth?

651
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,507
Yeah.

652
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,721
I'm going to drive my brother's murderer
to the mountains and bury them.

653
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,726
Soon, I'm going to catch the culprit

654
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,730
who killed my brother.

655
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,610
I'm going to ask the killer
why they did it.

656
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,363
And I'm going to get
an apology out of them.

657
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,702
If I can't forgive them even then,
I'm going to kill them.

658
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,706
I figured I'd probably need a car
for that.

659
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,749
So, am I...

660
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,377
your accomplice?

661
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,379
You're not an accomplice.

662
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,798
All you did was teach me how to drive.
That doesn't make you an accomplice.

663
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,801
But now I know all about your plan.

664
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,553
Then why don't you go
to the police station and report me?

665
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,934
I guess I don't have a choice then.

666
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,148
I guess I'll have to tell you
a secret too.

667
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,150
A secret?

668
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,157
What did it feel like for you

669
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,702
when your twin disappeared
from this world?

670
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,914
That came out of nowhere.

671
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,296
I was a twin too.

672
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,842
Are you serious?

673
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,093
Really.

674
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,388
When I was 14,

675
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,434
during the summer vacation
of my first year in middle school,

676
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,145
he suddenly died.

677
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,692
He was

678
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:15,861
the younger twin.

679
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,240
He was sick.

680
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,743
He had a bad heart.

681
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,872
He suddenly died of a heart attack.

682
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,045
We looked exactly the same.

683
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,050
Only my family could tell us apart.

684
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,719
That's how similar we looked.

685
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,602
After my younger brother died,

686
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,981
it was really weird for about a year.

687
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,985
Whenever I looked in the mirror,

688
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,321
I thought I could see him.

689
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,409
Honestly, it felt really surreal

690
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,372
to know that the person closest to me
had disappeared from the world.

691
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,167
I think I know how you felt.

692
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,673
But...

693
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,217
at some point, in the summer
of my second year of middle school,

694
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,427
it all became fine again.

695
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,973
A world that seemed so surreal to me
gradually started feeling more real.

696
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,766
Did you get over it?

697
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,102
I don't know.

698
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,147
Whatever it was...

699
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:37,234
I got used to feeling
like there was someone else there.

700
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,404
Feeling like someone else was there?

701
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,782
Do you feel like your twin brother
is there beside you,

702
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,033
just like he used to be?

703
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,994
It doesn't feel quite like a twin.

704
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,996
After a year,
I started to acknowledge and accept

705
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,874
that my younger brother had died.

706
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,501
It's hard to explain, but...

707
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,422
In any case, I feel like I'm not alone,
and that there's someone else next to me.

708
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,260
Maybe you feel that way after having coped

709
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,721
with that feeling of loss and separation.

710
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,102
Your secret's safe with me.

711
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:13,854
Same.

712
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,231
I'll keep your plan a secret.

713
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,483
I'm being serious.

714
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,817
I'm being serious too.

715
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,779
Even now,
I feel like there's one more of me.

716
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,280
This is really a secret.

717
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,200
All right.

718
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,747
Now that we've shared our secrets,

719
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,874
I guess we'll have to get back
to driving practice.

720
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,084
Get in. Let's go.

721
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,255
SHIN DONGHYUK ORTHOPEDICS

722
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,050
Ah, why?

723
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,760
That's not true.

724
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,814
Of course I'm alone.

725
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,733
You never know. Ji Sooheon might be
watching you right now.

726
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,485
Don't even try to check outside.

727
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,239
I get that,

728
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,949
but what should I do
if he tries to attack me now?

729
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,660
He's probably not prepared yet,
so he won't attack you right now.

730
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,454
He's probably checking to make sure
the RV park is a good place to attack you.

731
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,831
That's probably all he's doing right now.

732
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,249
He's trying to judge
whether it's the place

733
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,834
where you'll be alone as much as possible.

734
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,918
Without being noticed.

735
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,086
Wow, fuck.

736
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,338
I'd be fucked if he rushed in right now.

737
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,923
My brothers aren't here beside me.

738
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,133
Hey.

739
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,468
Don't overreact and just stay calm.

740
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,262
You need to make him believe

741
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,722
that no one else is going to come
visit you at the RV park.

742
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,348
All right.

743
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,107
23:58

NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL

A minute past midnight, Apr 17th, 2022

746
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,933
Ms. Shin has...

747
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,477
passed away.

748
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,032

00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,042
Ah, hello, this is Neungwha Hospital...

752
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:18,849
Hello.

753
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,059
Hey, Chanmi, this is the gym director.

754
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,063
Ah, yes, hello, sir.

755
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,273
Don't panic.

756
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,735
-Sooheon's mother just passed away.
-What?

757
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,070
Sooheon's cell phone seems to be off.

758
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,488
Could you go downstairs
and check to see if Sooheon's there?

759
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,574
Yes, I'm on my way.

760
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,621
Sooheon! Sooheon!

761
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,341
The person you dialed cannot be reached...

762
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,843
What do I do?

763
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,233
Hey, Chanmi, what's up?

764
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,118
She passed away?

765
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,622
Oh, no.

766
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,792
Sooheon?

767
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,668
You can't reach him?

768
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,337
He's not at the gym?

769
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,923
I have no idea.

770
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,216
Hold on a sec.

771
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,885
Ajung, Ajung.

772
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,595
Yeah, Soyeon.

773
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,889
-Do you know where Sooheon is right now?
-Huh?

774
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:44,351
His mother just passed away,
but they can't reach him.

775
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,727
What?

776
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,229
Chanmi.

777
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,772
Ah, there's no way Ajung would know.

778
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,441
What should I do?
Who should I be asking right now?

779
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,444
Jaebum.

780
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,863
Did you call Jaebum?

781
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,870
Chanmi, calm down.

782
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,622
Are you saying...

783
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,291
Sooheon's mother passed away,

784
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,502
but that you're not able
to reach him right now?

785
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:18,051
Chanmi, I'll come to you.
Just try to find out what's going on.

786
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,929
Yeah, I'm heading out right now.

787
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,814
-Soyeon, what should we do?
-What? What's going on?

788
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,650
I think Sooheon is here right now,
and that's why his cell phone is off.

789
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:34,860
Hey guys, can I have your attention?

790
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,653
-Here comes something interesting.
-What's this?

791
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,113
Sa Jung...

792
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,490
WHAT? IS THIS A REAL?
LMAO

793
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,825
What do you mean he's there?

794
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,494
Why would Sooheon go
to Sa Junggyeong's place?

795
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,499
Hey, Ajung.

796
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,001
Hey.

797
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,420
Did you go talk to Min Seonha's dad?

798
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,133
Did you relay the request to Sooheon?

799
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,719
-Because of the money?
-Yeah.

800
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,305
I'm sorry. I didn't know
it would end up like this...

801
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,365
Where's Sa Junggyeong right now?

802
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,867
That bastard Gi Osung
is waiting for Sooheon

803
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,410
to assault Sa Junggyeong
on his livestream.

804
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,412
Agh, it's a trap! Damn it.

805
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,873
So where's Sa Junggyeong right now?

806
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,791
-I don't know.
-Sa Junggyeong lives alone.

807
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,793
Min Seonha's dad told me this.

808
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,253
He told me Min Seonha
was once forcefully dragged

809
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,380
to Sa Jungyeong's place.

810
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,342
Since Sa Junggyeong's foot is injured,
he probably lives near his school.

811
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,386
Since he transferred to Hankyung High...

812
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:47,390
Jaebum and Chanmi,
you guys head to Hankyung High now.

813
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,392
We'll try to figure out
where Min Seonha was dragged to.

814
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,019
-Okay, keep us posted.
-Okay. Be careful.

815
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,657
Who is it?

816
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,078
Ah, how can I help you?

817
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,581
Can we please speak to Seonha?
We need to ask her something.

818
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,166
This is urgent.

819
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,257
There he is.
