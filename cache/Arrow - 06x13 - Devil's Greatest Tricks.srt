1
00:00:01,283 --> 00:00:02,616
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:04,596
You would be
remiss in forgetting

3
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:06,280
the thermobaric
explosive

4
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:08,148
that remains
in my possession.

5
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:10,149
What...Do you want?

6
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:11,984
Vengeance for my son.

7
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:13,218
What did you find?

8
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,054
Video of his
son's murder.

9
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,156
This is fabricated.
It didn't happen.

10
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:18,390
Whoever planned this

11
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,125
knew exactly how
Cayden would react.

12
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,161
Which means that person
has to be close to Cayden.

13
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:24,396
Do you trust me?

14
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:26,172
I need you here

15
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:28,108
for a rather
important assignment.

16
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,510
- What's that?
- Rooting out a traitor.

17
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:35,548
D--don't.

18
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,484
Baby,
please wake up.

19
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:39,052
He's gone, D.

20
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:44,691
We're clear.

21
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:47,694
All right. Keep moving.

22
00:00:53,168 --> 00:00:55,602
I guess Cayden James
and friends knew

23
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:56,870
we were coming.

24
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:58,471
Oh, yes.

25
00:00:58,473 --> 00:01:00,573
Once I learned of
Mr. Sobel's treachery,

26
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:04,043
I had to assume this
location was compromised.

27
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:06,579
Speaking of which,

28
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:10,583
I didn't appreciate
your alliance with him.

29
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:14,087
Made me think we no longer
have an understanding.

30
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:15,755
You need to know something.

31
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:17,590
Many things, I'm sure.

32
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:19,792
But I doubt very much
that you're the man

33
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:21,594
to teach them to me.

34
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:24,631
We almost have proof that
I didn't kill your son.

35
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:26,266
A desperate gambit.

36
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:29,102
Cayden, give me
more time.

37
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:32,272
Time, I'm afraid,
is a commodity

38
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:35,542
you and your city
have run out of.

39
00:01:35,544 --> 00:01:37,610
Mr. Sobel's betrayal
convinced me

40
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:41,114
that there's little good
in delaying matters further.

41
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:44,517
Accordingly,
I will be detonating

42
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,121
the thermobaric bomb
over Star City at midnight.

43
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:49,923
My son will find justice

44
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:53,826
in the ashes of your
beloved city.

45
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:58,048

47
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,674
Cayden is going to detonate
the bomb in 4 hours.

48
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:09,509
Where are we with the video?

49
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,644
Well, we're running
our photographic analysis algorithm

50
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,246
to reveal the original
footage.

51
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:15,215
How long will
that take?

52
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:16,649
As long as it takes.
The algorithm Felicity and Curtis wrote

53
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:18,618
works wonders
on a still image,

54
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,720
but this is 24 fps video we're talking
about here, so...

55
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,589
Right. Cayden just told us
that we are running out of time.

56
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,057
There's something
you should consider.

57
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,658
You're putting
all of your chips down

58
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,594
on a bet that he'll spare
the city if he thinks

59
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:29,629
you're not responsible
for his son's death.

60
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:31,531
That's because
it's the only play we have, Alena.

61
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,200
I'm just saying you
might be trying to reason with a man

62
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:37,103
who's beyond reason.

63
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:39,105
As you are well aware,

64
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:41,341
Arclight is now in its
final phase.

65
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:44,644
And now it's time for us
to take our leave.

66
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:46,579
Words much appreciated,

67
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:48,314
but how are we to get
out of city?

68
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:50,750
Stay close to your phones.

69
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,986
You will be airlifted
from the city

70
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:54,954
before the bomb goes off.

71
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:57,657
After it does, your individual shares
of the ransom

72
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,260
will be wired
into offshore accounts

73
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:02,362
that have been set up
for each of you.

74
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,697
Sounds fair...

75
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,965
Lucrative.

76
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:07,734
Indeed.

77
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:10,970
Thank you for helping to see
this project to fruition.

78
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:14,340
I don't think
I need to stress

79
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:21,247
how...personally important
this has been for me.

80
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:23,716
Thank you
for all you've done

81
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:26,486
to get justice for my boy.

82
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,164
Mr. James.

83
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:45,705
Just as Alexander
rained destruction

84
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:49,876
on Persepolis,
so do I now

85
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:53,713
on Averwood
Pharmaceuticals.

86
00:03:53,715 --> 00:04:00,853
$50 million for illegal
black market drug deals

87
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:04,557
and I just made
it all...

88
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,429
Disappear.

89
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,233
You must be our
new recruit.

90
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:16,769
Kojo Sledgehammer,
if I recall.

91
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,406
Yeah, I am--I am so stoked
to be here, Mr. James.

92
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:23,176
This is just--you're
an absolute legend.

93
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,750
It's been a pleasure
meeting you.

94
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:33,419
I'm sure we'll all do
great things together.

95
00:04:40,462 --> 00:04:42,295
Owen.

96
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:46,099
See you guys
tomorrow.

97
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,369
Hi, Dad.

98
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,803
Hey, that was quite
a game.

99
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:52,872
Please don't lie, ok?

100
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:54,907
I could see you weren't
in the stands.

101
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,809
Mom told me you didn't show.

102
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:59,379
Where's your mother now?

103
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,047
She and Jim went
to have dinner

104
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,782
at some fancy
French restaurant.

105
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:05,618
Jim got a promotion and said
he wanted to treat her.

106
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,121
That's considerate
of him.

107
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:13,292
So sorry I missed
the game, Owen.

108
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:15,628
I got delayed
at work.

109
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:18,164
Is that what we're
supposed to call

110
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,966
your weirdo hacker group?

111
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,701
The work we do is
important.

112
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:23,970
It benefits people
all over the world.

113
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:26,239
Yeah, work you won't
even tell me about.

114
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:29,108
As I've said, that's
for your protection.

115
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,910
Look, I know I'm not
the easiest person

116
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:33,346
in the world to
talk to...

117
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:35,815
But I do want to be

118
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:37,950
a bigger part
of your life.

119
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:39,619
I truly do.

120
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:42,121
Well, you can't have it
both ways, Dad.

121
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:43,823
You can't say you want
to be a part of my life

122
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:46,025
and keep me out of yours.

123
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:51,864
When are the finals?

124
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:56,035
Tomorrow night.

125
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:59,005
I will be there.

126
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:04,811
I can't share with
you all the details of my work,

127
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:08,147
but I vow to do
a better job of sharing your life,

128
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:11,284
and that begins
tomorrow.

129
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:19,725
Yes! Yes, exactly. Please.

130
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:22,895
Listen, we need SCPD radios linked
with emergency services

131
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:24,864
right now, ok? Now!

132
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,899
Where the hell
are you?

133
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:28,100
Did you get my message?

134
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:29,635
Yeah. Ok. We
rallied the troops,

135
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:31,204
and everyone's
panicking a little.

136
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,539
Gather a list of essential
personnel, clergymen,

137
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,309
doctors, as many people
as you can mobilize.

138
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:38,177
Wait. How--how are
we gonna explain

139
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,046
how you have access
to the Arrow's bunker?

140
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:41,781
We have bigger problems
right now, Speedy.

141
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,683
Besides, this is the
only place in the city

142
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:46,219
I can think of that could possibly
withstand that blast.

143
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:49,455
You have eyes on--

144
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:50,923
William. Of course.
I got it.

145
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:52,558
Thank you.

146
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:55,228
Do you have to keep
doing that?

147
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,898
It keeps me calm.

148
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,533
Do not worry.

149
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:03,336
Cayden James will not
let his friends die with the city.

150
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:05,137
You're damn right,

151
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,740
but I'm not gonna stick
around to find out.

152
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,575
Where are you going?

153
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:12,178
Someplace
I won't get blown up.

154
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,013
The two of you
haven't noticed?

155
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:17,416
The airlift
that Cayden promised,

156
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:19,352
it's more
than a little late.

157
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:22,655
I hate to say it,
but I think he's right.

158
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:25,024
I noticed that Dinah didn't show
up for work today.

159
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:26,692
Well, after what happened
to Sobel,

160
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:28,261
you really
expecting her to?

161
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:30,930
No. I just--from what
Oliver told me, I...

162
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:34,200
I don't really think that
she's exactly just grieving.

163
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:35,968
You think Oliver would
just what,

164
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,203
let Dinah kill her?

165
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,105
No. I--I just
don't think that

166
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,940
that's what's
on his mind right now.

167
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:44,043
Right. Well, you know,
if it comes down

168
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:46,846
to Laurel against Dinah,
then Laurel's

169
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:49,081
not the one
I'm worried about.

170
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,533
Tell me where I can
find Black Siren,

171
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:09,969
or the next bone I break
is your neck.

172
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:12,738
Lady, if any of these
people told me

173
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,007
where they were going,
I'd be with them.

174
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:19,278
I guess that's
one way

175
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,113
to not
get information.

176
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:22,882
What are you two doing here?

177
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:25,685
Looking for you. SCPD says
you weren't in today.

178
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,920
We were wondering
if you were gonna do something stupid.

179
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:29,021
Guess we were wrong.

180
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:31,090
I am looking for her

181
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:33,025
to get justice for
Vincent.

182
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:36,429
Why do you say, "justice," like
it's cold-blooded murder?

183
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:41,500
I know you're hurting, D.,
but Felicity called.

184
00:08:41,502 --> 00:08:44,036
We've got till midnight
before James

185
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:45,471
lets his bomb do its thing.

186
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,006
As much as we feel for you,

187
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:48,975
that seems
like the priority.

188
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:52,311
He's right. Now is not the time
to go off the deep end.

189
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:53,813
I can't
let this go.

190
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,481
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:56,949
D.

192
00:08:56,951 --> 00:09:02,388
I love you both, but stay
the hell out of my way.

193
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:10,196
We need to consider the
A.R.G.U.S. airlift option.

194
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:11,998
Oliver, we've already
talked about this.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,332
James will see it coming.

196
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,034
We need to consider
something.

197
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:17,803
- Got it!
- What?

198
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:22,041
I've seen
this. It's bogus.

199
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:23,609
You said you had
something?

200
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:25,711
Yeah, the whole thing
was a massive deception.

201
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,647
Owen was never
collateral damage,

202
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,148
like Cayden was made
to think.

203
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,416
He was the real target
the whole time.

204
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:34,520
Who is that?

205
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:35,855
Facial recognition just
picked him up

206
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:38,057
as Karl Iscove,
paid assassin.

207
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,325
With a bow and arrow?

208
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,160
A bow and arrow's not
his usual M.O.

209
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:42,895
I'm guessing it was
a special request

210
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:44,096
by whoever hired him
to kill Cayden's son.

211
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:45,731
All to set you up.

212
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:48,100
We need to have a conversation
with this Iscove,

213
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:49,335
find out who hired him.

214
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:51,070
He's dead.

215
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,205
What?

216
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:55,074
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:57,009
The assassin was assassinated
not long after Owen Post.

218
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:59,912
We need to know where
Cayden James is right now.

219
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:01,514
Got him.

220
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:03,683
Well, I'm
guessing Cayden doesn't care

221
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:05,184
about people knowing
his location

222
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:06,786
now that his bomb is
about to go off.

223
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:09,088
He's almost on the I-86.

224
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,656
He's psycho, but he's
smart, meaning he

225
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:12,091
doesn't want to be
anywhere near the boom

226
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:13,459
when the boom goes
boom.

227
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:15,127
We'll never catch him.

228
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,929
I have an idea.

229
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,104
We need to talk.

230
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:32,912
Questionable
judgment, Mr. Queen.

231
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:34,513
If you wanted
the bomb to go off

232
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:36,115
before midnight,
you'd be hard pressed

233
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:37,683
to come up
with a better way

234
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,952
than taking me
into custody.

235
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:41,754
Watch this.

236
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,422
Would that be
the proof that you

237
00:10:43,424 --> 00:10:45,157
alluded to earlier?

238
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,660
Just play the video.

239
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,499
No, I'm not
watching this again.

240
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:57,036
No, Cayden, you're not.

241
00:10:57,038 --> 00:11:00,106
Now we're watching
the real video

242
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:02,174
for the very first time.

243
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:07,146
Oliver didn't kill your son,

244
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:09,148
which means
someone else did.

245
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,317
The assassin's
name is Karl Iscove.

246
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:14,053
He was instructed to use
a bow and arrow

247
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:15,588
so the video could be
manipulated,

248
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,923
and they could make it
look like me.

249
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:19,725
It's the same tech used

250
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:24,330
to out Oliver as
the Green Arrow 4 months ago.

251
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:25,598
Someone's gone through
a lot of work to put

252
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,867
you two
on a collision course.

253
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:30,936
Oh, yes.

254
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:35,207
Someone within
my organization.

255
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:36,609
How do you know?

256
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:39,512
The metadata on
the forged video file

257
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:41,080
confirms it is the work

258
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,215
of the same person
who manipulated

259
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:44,717
that photo in October.

260
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:46,252
You lost a man a month ago.

261
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:47,753
Killed by the traitorous
Mr. Sobel,

262
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:50,189
but I highly doubt
it was Mr. Sheck.

263
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:52,324
That leaves
Laurel, Diaz.

264
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:54,059
And Anatoly.

265
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,294
I'd like to speak

266
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:56,962
to my former
colleagues.

267
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:59,865
And that's where the
two of you come in.

268
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:04,537
No! We're not rounding
them up to be executed.

269
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:07,540
No. I just want
a pointed conversation.

270
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,209
Bring them to me,
all 3 alive.

271
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:11,677
Otherwise I'll have
no choice

272
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,045
but to stay the course.

273
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:14,880
I still have a very
powerful bomb,

274
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:16,549
and I'd be
perfectly happy

275
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:18,217
to take out Star City
right along

276
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:22,655
with whoever orchestrated
the death of my son.

277
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,374
You got to be kidding me.
Please tell me you're kidding me.

278
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:35,201
The only way to stop James
from destroying the city is

279
00:12:35,203 --> 00:12:36,636
by delivering him
his people.

280
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:37,904
Lead them to the
slaughter, you mean.

281
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,405
I won't let that happen.

282
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,407
Right now,
that's our only option.

283
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,576
You don't even know for sure
that one of them did it.

284
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:45,545
I mean, none of them were working
for Cayden when he received the video.

285
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:46,846
But they were working
for him when he received

286
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,214
the doctored photo.

287
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:49,782
It has to be one of
those people, Alena.

288
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:52,485
It is either Diaz,
Anatoly, or Black Siren.

289
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:54,721
You hope.
What if Cayden is lying?

290
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:56,155
Well, we got bigger
problems than that.

291
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:57,790
I mean, what makes
you think that we

292
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:00,040
can find Cayden's
BFFs if he can't?

293
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,941
If they're smart, they're
out of the city by now.

294
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:03,608
They're smart,
but so is he.

295
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,009
He grouped them
together by promising

296
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:06,678
to fly them out
before the blast.

297
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,213
Thank goodness
for small favors

298
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:09,948
and gullible
bad guys.

299
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,516
But now they're worried
that James

300
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:13,218
might not make good
on that promise.

301
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,619
Raisa wanted to go to
one of the city shelters,

302
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,754
so she could be
with her family.

303
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,156
What's going on?

304
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:19,824
Why did we have to
leave the safe house?

305
00:13:19,826 --> 00:13:21,459
We'll talk about it
later, buddy.

306
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:24,195
You promised you
wouldn't lie to me anymore.

307
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:28,733
Cayden James is threatening
to detonate a large bomb

308
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:33,771
in Star City, and this is
the safest place for you.

309
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:35,339
That is the truth.

310
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:36,540
Alena.

311
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,175
Yeah, we're running
facial recog,

312
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:39,744
and Cayden gave us back
satellite control, but--

313
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:41,245
our usual tricks
aren't working.

314
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,682
Oliver, we need
the rest of the team.

315
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:46,517
Agreed.

316
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:49,754
Where are you going?

317
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:51,088
I need to go look
for a few people.

318
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,791
Let me come with you.

319
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,960
I need you to stay here.

320
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:57,395
I want to stay with you.

321
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:59,597
It is too dangerous
out there,

322
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:01,165
bottom line.

323
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,868
I'll be back as
soon as I can be.

324
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:10,908
You have any luck?

325
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,576
You think I would?

326
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:15,446
She was pretty clear
about where she stood, Hoss.

327
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:17,081
So basically the city's
gonna get destroyed

328
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,749
and our friend's gonna
commit murder,

329
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:20,818
and there's not a damn thing we can
do about either?

330
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:23,854
About time, D.

331
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:26,590
Different kind of D., Hoss.

332
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:28,793
Sorry, John.

333
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:30,895
We've gotten someplace
with Cayden James.

334
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:33,431
He won't detonate his bomb
if we bring back Anatoly,

335
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,566
Diaz, and Laurel alive.

336
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:37,568
So no honor amongst
thieves?

337
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,303
Well, let's just say he has
a good reason to think

338
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:40,838
at least one of
them's responsible

339
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,441
for his son's death.

340
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:45,209
We could use your help
finding them.

341
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:47,278
Well, if we do it, we should
go after Laurel first.

342
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,713
Dinah's after her.

343
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:49,914
And if she gets to her
before we do--

344
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,615
D.'s gonna kill her.

345
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:53,617
And if she does that,
she might be killing

346
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:55,519
the whole city.

347
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:15,139
Vince told me you had
a to-go bag stashed.

348
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:17,942
It took me a little while to
figure out where.

349
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:26,617
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...
- Hyah...

350
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:34,992
You can't stop me.

351
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:39,363
This ends tonight.
You end tonight.

352
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:40,898
No!

353
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,033
You stay out of this.

354
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:44,969
I can't let you
hurt her.

355
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:47,204
Hi, Daddy.

356
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:49,540
I missed you.

357
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:56,914
I told you,
this ends tonight.

358
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,726
Ah--

359
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:12,129
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

360
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:15,833
What are you doing?!
I had her.

361
00:16:15,835 --> 00:16:18,035
I'm saving the city.

362
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,844
I cannot believe you are
working with Cayden James.

363
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:27,257
Not like that, D.

364
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:30,277
He wants Anatoly,
Diaz, and Laurel alive.

365
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:31,844
Or boom goes the city.

366
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:33,411
Just saying that's
a pretty good reason

367
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,313
to not kill her besides,
you know,

368
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:39,350
all the other good reasons,
like killing is bad.

369
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:41,519
I can hold off for
a little while.

370
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:46,024
Dinah, we do not
just execute people.

371
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:49,527
No. You just let
them die.

372
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,462
Can we continue
this later?

373
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:53,331
Anatoly and Diaz are
still in the wind.

374
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,966
Correction. Ricardo Diaz
was in the wind.

375
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:56,901
Cayden's satellite just
picked him up headed south.

376
00:16:56,903 --> 00:16:58,436
Our team can take down Diaz.

377
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:02,307
Ok, sending you
the GPS coordinates now.

378
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,777
I'm staying here.

379
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:07,645
I'm not letting her
out of my sight.

380
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
So what, we're letting

381
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:11,349
the foxes guard
the henhouses now?

382
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:16,287
Quentin, Canary, you
keep eyes on Black Siren.

383
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:19,891
Wild Dog, Terrific,
you go after Diaz.

384
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:22,460
Overwatch, let us know when
you have eyes on Anatoly,

385
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:24,529
and Spartan and I will be
ready to move.

386
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:26,030
Put me through to Cayden.

387
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:34,405
Mr. Queen, have you
fulfilled my request?

388
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,307
We have Black Siren.
Where do we take her?

389
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,042
The last time I checked, it
took more than one songbird

390
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:39,577
to make up a trio.

391
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:41,679
Cayden, we don't
have time for games.

392
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:44,048
Then I suggest you find
my former compatriots

393
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,718
as soon as you can.

394
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:01,432
Owen, before this night
is over,

395
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:06,271
I promise you we will
render our judgment.

396
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,077
Ah.

397
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,746
You heading out, Cayden?

398
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:15,947
Yes, Alena.

399
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:17,448
Prior engagement.
Must attend.

400
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,083
Well, are you sure
that's a good idea?

401
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:20,985
What ever do you mean?

402
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:23,621
Oh, uh, I'm s--I'm sorry.

403
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:25,957
I just assumed somebody
would have told you.

404
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,558
I--I picked up
some chatter

405
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,260
on your hacked A.R.G.U.S.
responder a few minutes ago

406
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:32,997
about your takedown of
Averwood Pharmaceuticals.

407
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:34,999
My point being, it's just
if A.R.G.U.S. has your scent,

408
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:38,469
maybe going out right now
isn't the best idea.

409
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:41,673
Probably not, but I'll
take precautions.

410
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,609
I can't afford
to break this date.

411
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:56,287
Where do you think
you're going, buddy?

412
00:18:58,158 --> 00:18:59,991
You like that?

413
00:18:59,993 --> 00:19:03,661
We got this off another
pair of doppelgangers.

414
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:06,064
You know, I have to say,

415
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,066
I was surprised.

416
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:09,801
Your boyfriend

417
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:13,137
and his little magical
healing abilities,

418
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,772
you know, I thought
it would be harder

419
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:17,008
to take him down,
but it wasn't.

420
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,509
What's going on?

421
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:20,678
I'm counting down
the minutes.

422
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,780
What, before you try and
kill my daughter again?

423
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:25,183
That is not
your daughter.

424
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:28,353
That is a monster.

425
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:30,788
You gave your monster
a second chance.

426
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,357
After he worked his
ass off

427
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,691
to redeem himself

428
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,360
and after
he gave his life

429
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:36,961
to stop
Cayden James,

430
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:38,730
so if you seriously
want to compare

431
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,531
Vince to Laurel,
I sugg--

432
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:44,035
I know. I know
what she's done.

433
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:46,704
I'm not an idiot.

434
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:50,575
But no one deserves
to die, not even her.

435
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:53,177
You're wrong.

436
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,380
And once this is
all over

437
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:57,382
if Cayden James
doesn't kill her,

438
00:19:57,384 --> 00:20:00,918
I sure as hell am
gonna take my shot.

439
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:10,561
Where's my dad? He said
he'd be right back.

440
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:14,098
Um, yeah. I--I know.
And he will.

441
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,401
It's just
that things

442
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:17,902
didn't really go as
he planned tonight,

443
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:19,404
the way any of us
have planned.

444
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:22,373
So it's taking
a long time.

445
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,810
He's gonna be ok, ok?

446
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:26,811
Ok.

447
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:30,114
I've got eyes on Anatoly
and a few of his friends.

448
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:34,052
Looks like they got
themselves a helicopter.

449
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:38,656
Next I come back to city,
I hope it is ash.

450
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:52,670
Kapiushon! Show yourself.

451
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:58,943
Aah! Agh.

452
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:05,249
City is
about to become crater.

453
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:08,186
You want to put me
in prison? Fine.

454
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:10,721
Just out of town, please.

455
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:12,657
The bomb's not
going off, Anatoly,

456
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:15,126
because I'm going
to deliver Cayden James

457
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:16,828
the truth--you.

458
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,831
You have
finally snapped.

459
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,201
Took a few more years
longer than I expected.

460
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:25,570
You set me up.

461
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:28,206
The photo,
the doctored video.

462
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,141
I already told you,

463
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:32,009
that was not me.

464
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:33,411
Well, forgive me

465
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:36,514
if I don't want
to take you at your word.

466
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:38,182
Overwatch, we got him.

467
00:21:38,184 --> 00:21:40,151
Curtis and Rene got
Ricardo Diaz.

468
00:21:40,153 --> 00:21:41,486
That makes us 3 for 3.

469
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:45,022
William, give
that to me.

470
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:51,662
Call James.

471
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:53,798
I was beginning
to think you'd forgotten about me.

472
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,766
We have all 3.
Where do you want them?

473
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:57,602
Meet me at the abandoned
theater on Jefferson Avenue.

474
00:21:57,604 --> 00:22:00,204
I'm on it.
I'll call Curtis and Rene.

475
00:22:00,206 --> 00:22:01,606
Ok, I got
Quentin.

476
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:03,674
I'll keep an eye on Cayden.

477
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:25,629
Prodigious timing,
gentlemen.

478
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:26,623
It's almost midnight.

479
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,192
We're not here
to play games, Cayden.

480
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:29,860
And yet
here you are.

481
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:32,463
And what of Mr. Diaz
and Ms. Lance?

482
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:35,199
They'll be here.

483
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,367
And what of this
young man?

484
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:42,905
I don't believe your
son was invited, Oliver.

485
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:44,507
What are you doing here?

486
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:45,708
I want to be with you.
I'm scared.

487
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,110
William, just
listen to me--

488
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:48,444
It's just like
on the island,

489
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:49,846
just like when my mom died.

490
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:52,382
I don't want
to lose you, too.

491
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,217
Please. I want to stay
with you.

492
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:56,052
Come here. Come here.

493
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:57,987
It's all right.

494
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:01,290
You stay over here.

495
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:06,929
This started
with my son.

496
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,365
Yours should be
here for the end.

497
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,167
It's a beautiful
symmetry,

498
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:12,902
don't you think?

499
00:23:12,904 --> 00:23:15,571
He has nothing
to do with this.

500
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:17,240
I don't disagree,

501
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:19,275
but it appears your
son has other plans.

502
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:21,444
Hello, William.

503
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:23,229
My name is
Cayden James.

504
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:25,598
You're the guy who wants
to blow up the city.

505
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,601
I suppose.
It's a long story.

506
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:31,437
And it concerns
my own son.

507
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,771
Where is he?

508
00:23:32,773 --> 00:23:36,208
Passed away, I'm afraid.

509
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:49,288
Cayden James?

510
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:54,593
I was told to expect you.

511
00:23:54,595 --> 00:23:57,062
Warned, in fact.

512
00:23:57,064 --> 00:23:59,031
Mr. James, we're here to
remand you into custody

513
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:01,133
for multiple violations
of federal law.

514
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:03,802
I strongly advise you
not to resist.

515
00:24:05,873 --> 00:24:07,940
My only son is playing
in this game.

516
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:11,911
Could I perhaps watch it
before you take me in?

517
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:13,379
That's not
how it works.

518
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:15,681
I'm just asking
for a few moments,

519
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:17,383
a little compassion here.

520
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:20,986
I strongly suggest
surrendering peacefully

521
00:24:20,988 --> 00:24:22,688
to avoid a scene.

522
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,990
There's no need for that.

523
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:50,182
All right. I'm gonna get
the lay of the land.

524
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:53,519
She'd better be here
when I get back.

525
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,690
I don't think she likes me.

526
00:24:57,692 --> 00:24:59,124
Well, you haven't
given her

527
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:01,293
much reason to,
have you?

528
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:03,028
Fair.

529
00:25:08,736 --> 00:25:10,569
She's right, you know.

530
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:12,338
Ahem. About what?

531
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,872
I'm not like Sobel.

532
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:15,341
I'm not gonna change.

533
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:17,242
I'm not gonna
just wake up one day

534
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:19,211
and be your Laurel.

535
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,914
No, no.
You'll always be you.

536
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,750
But you can be better.

537
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:27,052
Why would I?

538
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:29,221
We live in an ugly world,

539
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:31,690
and the only way
to survive it is--

540
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:33,192
is to be ugly right back.

541
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:34,727
You're wrong, ok?

542
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:38,130
Hey, has it ever occurred
to you that I like who I am,

543
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:41,934
that when I killed Sobel,
I actually enjoyed it?

544
00:25:43,704 --> 00:25:46,739
And all those pictures
that you showed me of your daughter--

545
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:50,709
this--this--this woman
that I don't even recognize.

546
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:52,778
They made me sick.

547
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:56,248
She was soft and naive,

548
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,751
and that's why she's
the one who's dead.

549
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,519
Why are you telling
me this?

550
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:02,788
Because I don't ever
want to find myself

551
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,090
enjoying killing you.

552
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:10,529
Perimeter's secure.
Let's move.

553
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:12,131
Yeah.

554
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:19,104
Quite a brave young fellow
you have here, Mr. Queen.

555
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:23,275
Brave and foolish,
much like his father.

556
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:24,777
What--what's he
doing here?

557
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,779
None of your concern,
Mr. Lance.

558
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:29,448
Ah! And the rest of our
guests have arrived.

559
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,518
These two freaks say
that you think

560
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,787
one of us killed
your boy?

561
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:36,455
In point of fact, Mr. Diaz,

562
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:38,791
I know that one of you
killed my boy.

563
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:40,292
I intend to find out who.

564
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:43,295
You believe people
in masks

565
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,064
over people you do
business with?

566
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:46,432
I'm with the Russian.

567
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:49,101
I think these guys
would do anything

568
00:26:49,103 --> 00:26:50,803
to save their
precious city.

569
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,705
I don't trust anyone's
word, Mr. Diaz.

570
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:57,776
I put my faith
in data, information.

571
00:26:57,778 --> 00:26:59,812
Ones and zeroes never lie.

572
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:04,650
Here's digital proof that one
of you has betrayed me.

573
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:09,855
Oh, William, please
just get out of there.

574
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:11,957
None of you know...

575
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,927
What it feels like
to lose a son.

576
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:17,863
A piece of yourself
gone.

577
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:19,965
It's like a phantom limb.

578
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,733
No, it's worse than that.

579
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:24,536
It's like a piece
of your soul lost

580
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:26,138
as if it had never been there.

581
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,974
Lost. No, stop. I keep
reminding myself that

582
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:32,511
I have not lost my son.

583
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:34,346
He's been taken from me.

584
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:39,151
Hey...
You're losing it.

585
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:44,056
Your grief,
it's making you crazy.

586
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:49,895
What if it has?

587
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:51,196
Just look at him.

588
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:52,865
He wants to kill
everyone in this room.

589
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,867
Just be ready to move.

590
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:58,871
Ok, screw this.
It was me!

591
00:27:58,873 --> 00:28:00,105
I did it.

592
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:04,910
Surprise.
I'm the one who did it.

593
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:08,080
I killed your stupid kid.

594
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:11,116
- Oh, my God.
- What?

595
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:13,185
For the past 3 minutes,
Cayden's detonator

596
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:15,154
has been emitting
a 76-gigahertz field.

597
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,388
Now it's spiking.

598
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,490
What does this mean?

599
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:21,093
It means there's something
wrong with the bomb.

600
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:26,031
It's a shame, really.
He was very cute.

601
00:28:27,568 --> 00:28:28,901
The signal's fritzing again.

602
00:28:28,903 --> 00:28:30,502
The closer Cayden gets
to Laurel,

603
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:31,904
the bigger the frequency
spikes on the detonator.

604
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:33,939
No. It's not
the detonator.

605
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,510
Aren't you gonna ask me
why I did it?

606
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:43,415
No. I know
you're lying.

607
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,417
You're not
nearly as callous

608
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,953
as you portray
yourself to be.

609
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:49,821
I saw, Ms. Lance.

610
00:28:49,823 --> 00:28:52,457
When I ordered you
to execute Mr. Sobel,

611
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:55,060
I saw you hesitate.

612
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,430
You didn't want
to do it.

613
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,732
Oliver, you need
to get Laurel away from Cayden

614
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:02,401
right now.

615
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:04,803
His detonator is interfering
with her power-dampening collar.

616
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:11,696
Well, well, well.
Now, this is interesting.

617
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,375
Grr! Laurel!

618
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:27,884
Guys, are you ok?
Do you copy?

619
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,122
Overwatch, we're fine.

620
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:31,656
Ok, thermal imaging reads
everyone's still inside,

621
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:33,625
but they've gone in
different directions.

622
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm good.

623
00:29:34,962 --> 00:29:37,495
Find Anatoly!
I've got Diaz! Go!

624
00:29:37,497 --> 00:29:39,364
Sure thing, Hoss.

625
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:44,202
I knew this would
happen.

626
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:45,437
Why?

627
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,905
We work with Oliver,
we get in trouble.

628
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:49,741
The guy's a walking
death trap.

629
00:29:49,743 --> 00:29:52,510
Who do you think taught him
about traps?

630
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:10,362
Stop!

631
00:30:10,364 --> 00:30:12,797
God, you're persistent.
It's annoying.

632
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:40,225
The son of a bitch.

633
00:30:57,878 --> 00:30:59,678
Dinah, no!

634
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,279
No!

635
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:17,796
Laurel. Laurel.

636
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:35,313
William. William,
back away, son.

637
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:40,919
Come here, come here,
William.

638
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:43,621
Your son wouldn't want
you to do this.

639
00:31:43,623 --> 00:31:46,291
The person responsible for
his death is in the vicinity,

640
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:49,761
and I intend to drag them
to hell with me.

641
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:52,964
I owe it to my son.

642
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:55,900
Come here. Come here.

643
00:31:55,902 --> 00:31:57,802
You don't have to be
afraid, all right?

644
00:31:57,804 --> 00:32:01,306
I'm right here
with you.

645
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:03,842
And I love you
very much.

646
00:32:03,844 --> 00:32:05,577
William...

647
00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:11,149
I had an obligation
to protect my son.

648
00:32:11,151 --> 00:32:12,851
It's a father's job--

649
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,986
protect your child...

650
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,791
But I failed.

651
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:25,029
I failed him utterly.

652
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:29,167
All this time...

653
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:34,806
The man responsible
for his death...

654
00:32:37,444 --> 00:32:39,310
was me.

655
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,821
Don't you move.

656
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:59,421
I can't believe he was ready
to blow up the whole city.

657
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:01,927
Yeah.

658
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:04,750
He lost his boy.

659
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:07,856
I don't even want
to imag--well.

660
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:10,109
Yeah.

661
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:13,946
What you did was
very dangerous.

662
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:16,248
I know. And I'm sorry.

663
00:33:20,655 --> 00:33:23,756
I am never gonna let
anything happen to you, William,

664
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:26,052
ever.

665
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:27,651
And I am promising you
that I will do

666
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:29,952
everything that
I can to make sure

667
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:31,220
nothing happens to me.

668
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:32,755
You can't make that
promise.

669
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:34,456
I can make that promise.
I just did.

670
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,959
I am right now.

671
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:43,465
Kiddo, I've been doing
this a long time.

672
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,836
So trust me.

673
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:51,040
Ok?

674
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:53,142
Ok.

675
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:55,344
Thank you.

676
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:59,548
I got to go talk
to the others, all right?

677
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,051
Ok.

678
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:03,686
Where are we?

679
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:06,989
If by we you mean
Anatoly, Diaz, and Laurel...

680
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:08,190
Completely in the wind.

681
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:09,458
- Again?
- Again.

682
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,493
Again.

683
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:13,796
Ok, well, Quentin's walking
Cayden James through booking right now.

684
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:15,998
Look. I know what
you're gonna say,

685
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,334
but I think finding
Laurel needs to be our first priority.

686
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:19,935
Don't make this
personal, Dinah.

687
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:22,838
Or, you know,
more personal. Heh.

688
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,340
You heard her.

689
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:26,275
She is the one who had
Cayden James' son killed.

690
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:28,310
She is the one who set
all of this into motion.

691
00:34:28,312 --> 00:34:30,512
- You don't know that.
- She confessed.

692
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:32,715
She was pushing James'
buttons, D.

693
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:35,451
How did she manage to
blind all of you this much?

694
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:37,086
You're the one that's
not seeing clearly,

695
00:34:37,088 --> 00:34:38,087
if you ask me, Dinah.

696
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:40,189
I didn't.

697
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,091
Hey, hey.

698
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,593
You're better than this.

699
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,567
I guess we're leaving now.

700
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:53,402
Yeah, we're leaving now.

701
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:55,070
Just to be clear,

702
00:34:55,072 --> 00:34:57,473
whatever happened
doesn't change anything.

703
00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:00,242
Yeah, we're glad that we
took down Cayden James,

704
00:35:00,244 --> 00:35:03,078
but we're still doing
our own thing.

705
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:07,082
Please try and keep
Dinah in line.

706
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:09,551
No promises, Hoss.

707
00:35:09,553 --> 00:35:11,553
In case you haven't noticed,

708
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:14,423
we're not having a lot of
luck with that right now.

709
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:19,061
Well, we saved
the city again

710
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:22,998
and got Cayden James.

711
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,735
Yeah. Why doesn't it
feel like we won?

712
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:40,968
I must say this visit
is somewhat predictable.

713
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,872
Well, I needed to look
you in the eyes, Cayden.

714
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:53,381
I need to know that
this surrender of yours...

715
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:57,151
Isn't some sort of ploy.

716
00:35:57,153 --> 00:36:00,087
I've had bad luck
with that tactic.

717
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:02,323
You prevented me from
doing the unspeakable

718
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:05,359
last night.

719
00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:08,696
I'm sure Owen would
have been ashamed of me,

720
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:11,999
but then he always was.

721
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:15,102
These are my best
guesses

722
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:17,505
as to where you might
find my former allies

723
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:19,373
along with
the account number

724
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:20,675
to a bank
in Corto Maltese

725
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:22,043
where I placed
all the money

726
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:24,412
I embezzled
from the city.

727
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:26,781
Thank you.

728
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:30,885
I would ask one thing
in return.

729
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:35,556
Permission to visit
my son's grave.

730
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:39,160
I can arrange that.

731
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:48,169
Be a better father
than I was, Oliver.

732
00:36:59,415 --> 00:37:01,515
If this is another
feeble attempt

733
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:03,718
to extract
information from me,

734
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,421
I--I warn you I will
continue to invoke

735
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:10,992
my fifth amendment
protections.

736
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:13,561
I'm very sorry to have
to tell you this, Mr. James,

737
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:15,429
but...

738
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:18,432
Your son Owen was found
murdered last night.

739
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:25,406
No. He's...He's 18.

740
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:26,874
N--no.

741
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:29,477
Who would want
to hurt my boy?

742
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,779
I'm afraid we don't know.

743
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:39,487
I am truly
very sorry, Cayden.

744
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,508
Hey, what's the story,
morning glory?

745
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:04,879
I used to say
that to you

746
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,514
when you were a little
girl, you know?

747
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:08,749
The other you.

748
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:10,151
I already told you.

749
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:11,652
I know what you
told me.

750
00:38:11,654 --> 00:38:13,554
What you told me
was a lie.

751
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:17,124
But it's--James
said it:

752
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:19,627
You hesitated when
you killed Sobel.

753
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:21,495
So what if I did?

754
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:22,997
It means
there's a piece--

755
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:24,799
maybe just a small
piece, but it means

756
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,534
that there is
a piece of my daughter

757
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:28,636
in you somewhere.

758
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:32,373
And I'm gonna get it
out whatever it takes.

759
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,447
SCPD custody.

760
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:14,882
Didn't think we'd
end up here.

761
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:18,085
You know, I saw this
playing out a lot of ways.

762
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:20,721
I got to tell you...

763
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:25,826
I wasn't expecting this.

764
00:39:25,828 --> 00:39:27,661
I assume it would be
foolish to think

765
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:30,131
that this is
a rescue operation.

766
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:34,335
You were always the smartest
guy in the room.

767
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:39,240
You thought you always
had everybody pegged.

768
00:39:39,242 --> 00:39:42,476
You put everyone
in your little boxes.

769
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:45,546
You always understood
what they were thinking,

770
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,615
how they'd react,

771
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,583
but you're realizing now

772
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:54,989
you didn't really know
anything, did you?

773
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:57,424
I'm afraid I don't
take your meaning,

774
00:39:57,426 --> 00:39:58,792
Mr. Diaz.

775
00:39:58,794 --> 00:40:00,594
Is that so?

776
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:04,732
You're supposed to be
the smart one.

777
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:11,639
You made some moves.

778
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:13,707
Then I made some moves.

779
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:16,277
Queen is under
indictment now.

780
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:19,914
His team is fractured
in a million pieces.

781
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:24,952
And this city--
oh, this city--

782
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:29,657
it's primed for a takeover.

783
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,663
You see, guys like you never
understand these things.

784
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:39,166
Why destroy a city

785
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:43,938
when you could take it over?

786
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,775
I suppose this accounts
for your presence here.

787
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:50,144
Mm-hmm.

788
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,979
The new police captain--

789
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:54,081
she's on my payroll,

790
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:59,420
along with a few other
city officials.

791
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:04,158
Arclight was
a big help

792
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,560
in thinning
the herd for me.

793
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:10,464
I suspect you're not
done thinning the herd.

794
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:16,403
Well, you were
always talking about

795
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:18,672
how much you
miss your son.

796
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:20,407
In case you
didn't know,

797
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:23,110
I'm the one who
had him killed.

798
