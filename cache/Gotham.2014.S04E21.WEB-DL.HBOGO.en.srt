1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,520
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,840
What's your record for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,280
We all have our flaws.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,720
But you're still breaking the law.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,120
I want you to throw me a wake.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,240
Dig me up.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,760
I would liberate Lee Thompkins
with surgical precision.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,280
Dead or alive,
Jerome uses distractions.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
Got a plan for that?

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,120
Bruce?

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Jeremiah.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,840
Oh, God, no.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,000
He's still alive.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>Jerome is dead.</i>

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,960
<i>Long live me.</i>

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,240
I could not have done any of this
without your help.

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,080
Those generators that we built...

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,920
...work even better as bombs.

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,440
{\an5}<i>Sources tell us Captain James Gordon</i>

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,120
{\an5}<i>was at the scene
and is missing and feared dead.</i>

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,160
<i>Investigators are certainly
looking into</i>

23
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,440
<i>what could have caused
the sudden explosion.</i>

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,360
Harvey.

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,640
I just got off the phone
with Search and Rescue.

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,520
Whatever blew Jeremiah's bunker
was catastrophic.

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,760
There are no signs of life.

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Tell 'em to keep looking.

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,120
- Harvey, I think...
- Listen.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,800
Jim found his way out.

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,160
- Understand?
<i>- Gotham's Police Department</i>

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
<i>has dispatched an investigative unit,</i>

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,520
<i>which is currently canvassing
the area,</i>

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,960
{\an5}<i>looking for any traces
of Captain Gordon.</i>

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,600
Screw that, and screw her.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,000
Listen. In two minutes, Jim Gordon's
gonna come walking through that door

37
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,320
and chew all your asses out
for standing around

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
and not doing your job.

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,360
Now, first responders
are on the scene.

40
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,400
I want CSIs out there pronto,

41
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,680
and I want everyone looking for
Jeremiah Valeska and Bruce Wayne.

42
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,080
That's who Jim was looking for
when this whole thing went blooey.

43
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
You ain't the captain.

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,760
The captain ain't here.
I'm ranking detective.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,520
Last time we followed you,
the Pyg slaughtered us.

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,400
All right, look, enough.

47
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,400
Jim trusts him, okay?

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,720
So, everybody, get back to work.

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
Harvey.

50
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,600
Jeremiah Valeska wasn't
inside the bunker when it blew.

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,080
- How do you know?
- 'Cause he's outside,

52
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,200
and he's not alone.

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
What the hell?

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,800
You might not recognize
Jerome's followers,

55
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
as I've given them
something of a makeover.

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,520
But I assure you,
they're as loyal to me

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,760
as they ever were to him.

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,960
More so.

59
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,240
'Cause I accomplished something
my brother never could...

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,000
...killing James Gordon.

61
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,440
<i>Jeremiah! Jeremiah!</i>

62
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,720
You're a liar!

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Not so fast.

64
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,960
I have bombs planted around the city,

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,040
just like the one that killed
Jim Gordon.

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,760
<i>Jeremiah! Jeremiah!</i>

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,160
All you need to know is,
if I hit this detonator,

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Gotham is blown back
to the Stone Age.

69
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,080
If I pull this trigger,

70
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,000
your brains are blown
through the back of your skull.

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,480
Dead man's switch. You're familiar.

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,760
It's another little something
I took from my brother,

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,320
except mine's a bit more advanced.

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,520
You shoot me, my thumb loosens,

75
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,240
and then boom, boom,

76
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,920
boom, boom.

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,520
No, you will do what I say.

78
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,080
You're more sick than your brother.

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Don't compare me
to that short-sighted psychopath.

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,760
He just wanted to destroy things.

81
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,680
Me, I'm a builder.

82
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,520
I'm gonna create a new Gotham
in my image.

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,080
But every artist
needs a blank canvas, so...

84
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,120
...all of this has to go.

85
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,880
I detonate the explosives
in six hours.

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,480
I want the city empty when I do.

87
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,720
You need us to evacuate
Gotham in six hours?

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,440
That's impossible!

89
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
Then, everyone who dies screaming,

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,120
who watches their loved ones
crushed before them,

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,080
will have you to thank,
Detective Bullock.

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Look...

93
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,000
...nobody has to die.

94
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,320
Well...

95
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,280
...except for these people.

96
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,560
I know seeing is believing, and I do
want you to believe me, so...

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Oh, my God!

98
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,240
Get officers on the scene now! Go!

99
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,400
Six hours, Detective.

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,920
The clock is ticking.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,160
{\an5}Shame. I liked the clock tower.

102
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,800
{\an5}Jim took me there on a date once.

103
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,080
{\an5}Now they're both up in smoke.

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,080
{\an5}Good riddance.

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,680
{\an5}He always did want to die a hero.

106
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,600
{\an5}And that was Jim's problem.

107
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
{\an5}Me? I'd rather live.

108
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,760
{\an5}- And live well.
- Hmm.

109
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,080
{\an5}If it isn't little Penguin.

110
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,240
{\an5}Oh, and Butch's corpse.

111
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
{\an5}Hey, Tabby.

112
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
{\an5}Butch.

113
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,600
{\an5}The man responsible
for the recent fireworks

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,440
{\an5}is Jeremiah Valeska.

115
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,880
{\an5}Twin brother of our old associate.

116
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,640
{\an5}He has plans for Gotham.

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,880
{\an5}Plans we learned about
courtesy of this gentleman.

118
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,960
{\an5}They ripped out my fingernails.

119
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,520
{\an5}I believe that this is a golden
opportunity for cash and glory.

120
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,320
{\an5}Normally, I would keep
both of them for myself.

121
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,520
But I find myself a bit short

122
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,880
{\an5}of the necessary manpower.

123
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,080
{\an5}- Or womanpower, if you will.
- Mm.

124
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,040
{\an5}I'll go 50-50 on the take.

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,280
{\an5}An alliance with you?

126
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,480
{\an5}I'll pass.

127
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,720
{\an5}Pity. With the money
we were gonna make,

128
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,720
{\an5}I'd hoped to finally be able
to cure Butch of his condition.

129
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
{\an5}Wait, what do you mean?

130
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,080
Hugo Strange ran Indian Hill.

131
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,000
{\an5}Indian Hill's toxic sludge
turned Butch into this.

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
{\an5}Hugo Strange can fix Butch.

133
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
{\an5}But it won't be cheap.

134
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,880
{\an5}Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,120
{\an5}Don't look at me like that.

136
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,760
{\an5}I almost got killed fighting
your ex-boyfriend's rotting corpse.

137
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,240
{\an5}I think it's time to return
the favor.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,360
Fine. But Swamp Boy keeps his funk
ten feet from me at all times.

139
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,080
What did you have in mind?

140
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,640
Evacuate the city in six hours?

141
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
Five and a half hours.
And it will happen,

142
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,080
because this maniac
has bombs hidden all over Gotham.

143
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,560
Think of how many lives are at stake.

144
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,200
And every minute you hesitate
means fewer people get to safety.

145
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,800
- We'll need police.
- We are police! We're here to help.

146
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,320
Harper, please,
will you help the mayor?

147
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
You got it.

148
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,200
Holy mother of God.

149
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
Bruce Wayne.

150
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Hey.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Bruce.

152
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,360
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

153
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
I heard about Jim.

154
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,960
- Is it true?
- As far as I'm concerned,

155
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,280
Jim Gordon is alive, kicking,
and waiting for us to find him.

156
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Detective.

157
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Don't lie to me.

158
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
It's not looking good, kid.

159
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,480
I was hoping you could help me.
Did you see Jim?

160
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,640
How did you get out of the bunker?

161
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,240
Jeremiah and I had already
left the bunker.

162
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,040
Jerome, Jerome sprayed him
with a gas that drove him insane.

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm so sick of that freaking family.

164
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Did you hear about
Gotham Clock Tower? Huh?

165
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,720
This guy's got these massive
explosives...

166
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,480
- It's my fault.
- What?

167
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,920
Jeremiah had plans
to create next-generation generators.

168
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I funded him.

169
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
Wayne Enterprises built those bombs?

170
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,840
Listen, the schematics
for the batteries

171
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,600
should be in the Wayne Enterprises
R&D lab.

172
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,480
Lucius could take a look at them,
figure out how to disarm the bombs.

173
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,720
- I'm, I'm gonna go get them now.
- No, no, no, no, no.

174
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,960
- You're going home.
- No, I have to do...

175
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,680
Look, I know you feel guilty,

176
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,120
but Jim Gordon was,
is important to all of us.

177
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,880
And it's my job, so go home.

178
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,600
Be with Alfred. Be safe.

179
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,720
It's what Jim would want.

180
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Lucius!

181
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,240
Alfred, where have you been?

182
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,040
<i>No, not Alfred.</i>

183
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,280
I hope you didn't catch a cold
in my brother's grave.

184
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,560
I know those things aren't
exactly designed for the living.

185
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
What have you done?

186
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Where's Alfred?

187
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,440
Such anger.

188
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,120
Some people, not me, of course,

189
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,520
might consider that ingratitude
considering all I've done for you,

190
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,520
<i>all I'm still doing for you.</i>

191
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
You mean lying to me?

192
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,720
Using my company to build bombs?
Trying to kill me?

193
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,240
Bruce, let's get something straight.

194
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,800
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

195
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,040
I'd have put a bullet
through your brain

196
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,880
and left you to rot in that grave.

197
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,920
But I meant what I said.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're my best friend,

199
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,000
and today I'm gonna prove it to you.

200
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,360
You are insane.

201
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,080
You killed Jim Gordon.

202
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,520
<i>And if you don't want your manservant
to die, too,</i>

203
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,560
<i>you will follow my instructions
to the letter.</i>

204
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,600
71 Welling Avenue.
Be there in an hour.

205
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,920
Tell the police and I'll know.

206
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,160
Just like I know
that's where you are right now.

207
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Well, well.

208
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,240
Jim Gordon, back from the dead.

209
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Where am I?

210
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
The Narrows.

211
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
I was in Jeremiah's bunker.
There was a bomb.

212
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,480
Ed had you followed.

213
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,520
His people found you after the blast.

214
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,120
I'll have to thank him
when I arrest him.

215
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm surprised he didn't kill me.

216
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,560
I am, too, actually.

217
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,880
What do you plan to do with me?

218
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,080
I don't really know.

219
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,320
Lee, I have to get back to the GCPD.

220
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
Jerome's brother Jeremiah...

221
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Blew up the Gotham Clock Tower
about an hour ago.

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,320
The city's being evacuated.

223
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
I have to...

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,040
It's just a painkiller.

225
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,920
It does make you easier to handle.

226
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,840
You're not going anywhere.

227
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,600
My jacket. In my jacket...

228
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,800
I got those from Jeremiah's office.

229
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,960
They may give us some clue
as to what he's planning.

230
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,160
Please, let me take them to Harvey.

231
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,520
Oh, Jim, you still think that you're
the only one who can save the city.

232
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,440
- Wait.
- Get some rest.

233
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Doctor's orders.

234
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,960
Jeremiah's followers
must have taken Alfred

235
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,240
while I was at the cemetery.

236
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,960
I bet he put up a fight.

237
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,680
Thanks again for meeting me, Selina.

238
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,680
- Sure.
- I didn't have anyone else to call.

239
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,480
I know it's asking a lot,
so I just really appreciate...

240
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,880
Bruce, I'm gonna be here
whenever you need me.

241
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
Okay, that's the address.

242
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,520
I don't see anyone, though.

243
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,720
- That could be a trap, right?
- I don't know.

244
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,280
Jeremiah could've killed me
at the cemetery.

245
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,880
He wants something out of me.

246
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,640
Like what, to be your best friend?

247
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,680
Trap or not, if Alfred's in there,
I need to find out.

248
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Alfred?

249
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,960
Alfred!

250
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Alfred.

251
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Alfred!

252
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
You want to help Jim Gordon?

253
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,280
Have you lost your mind?

254
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,520
You brought him here
because you thought

255
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,480
it would give us leverage
with the GCPD.

256
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,840
Yes. By holding him hostage.

257
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,600
This drawing is the key
to Valeska's plan.

258
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,480
We solve it and we trade
the information for clemency.

259
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Perhaps.

260
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
Or, perhaps,

261
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,320
there's something more going on.

262
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,160
What happened between Jim and I
is over.

263
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm trying to protect
what we've built.

264
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,920
I still like my plan better.

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,880
Ed, if this maniac levels
half the city,

266
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,160
it's gonna disrupt food distribution,
water supply, power.

267
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,600
The people of the Narrows
will suffer the most.

268
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,960
We can prevent that,
while, at the same time,

269
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,240
helping us out of this mess we're in.

270
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Please.

271
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Fine.

272
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,960
If this is what you want,

273
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I will do it.

274
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
For you.

275
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Do it for us.

276
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,600
<i>After the mayor's evacuation orders,
the New Trigate Bridge is absolute...</i>

277
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,080
Where are we at with the evac?

278
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,520
Bridges and tunnels
are bumper-to-bumper.

279
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
National Guard is bringing
in the choppers.

280
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,120
But we're talking
about evacuating hospitals,

281
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,520
nursing homes, jails.

282
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,800
Some people just don't want to leave.

283
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,120
<i>We're seeing the same level of panic
on every bridge and tunnel...</i>

284
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,320
God, what a mess.
Just make it happen.

285
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,840
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

286
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,480
All right.
Let's go over this building...

287
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,040
I got the schematics
from Wayne Enterprises R&D.

288
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,960
The Wayne kid
said the bombs were batteries.

289
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,720
A series of networked
self-perpetuating generators.

290
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,240
But when supercharged,

291
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,360
they contain enough energy
to level a city block.

292
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,960
Got it. Battery bombs from hell.

293
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,840
Just tell me this will help us
find and disable them.

294
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,680
Disable, yes. Find, no. But...

295
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,560
...look, look here.

296
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,160
Because they were created
to be networked together,

297
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,160
Jeremiah would have to send the
signal a centrally located core relay

298
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
in order to blow all the bombs
from a single detonator.

299
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,080
Lucius, just English, please.

300
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,960
Sorry. The bombs are connected
by a nervous system.

301
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,440
The core relay is the brain.

302
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,920
We find that, we destroy that...

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,680
We can stop the bombs from going off.

304
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
- Yes.
- But how do we find it?

305
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,560
How do we find this brain?

306
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,160
Oh, Bruce.

307
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,160
You are about to have
a very transformative experience.

308
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
I envy you.

309
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Call our friend.

310
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,360
Tell him to kill the butler.

311
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,600
He's no longer necessary.

312
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,000
Oswald Cobblepot.

313
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Barbara Kean.

314
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,520
In my stronghold.

315
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,280
Not one step closer, Mr. Valeska.

316
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,600
And is that my dear Jongleur
with my core relay in his hand

317
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,280
and a grenade taped to his mouth?

318
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Indeed, it is.

319
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
Huh. Well...

320
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,080
...it seems you have the upper hand.

321
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,080
Undoubtedly.

322
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
And now...

323
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,080
...we have our own demands.

324
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,040
50 million dollars.

325
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
That's what you want.

326
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,200
It's a nice round number.

327
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't quite have that
on me right now.

328
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,280
You gave the mayor six hours
to evacuate Gotham.

329
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,040
An impossible task.

330
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,680
Let him buy another hour.

331
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,600
He will save thousands of lives.

332
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,080
50 million dollars
will seem cheap.

333
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,320
I see.

334
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,640
I play the villain,
you get away scot-free and rich.

335
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
I get you the money,

336
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,120
you give me back my core relay.

337
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,560
That is usually
how a handoff works. Yeah.

338
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,480
You drive a hard bargain,
but I'll see what I can do.

339
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,000
Just like that?

340
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,800
After knowing your brother,
I expected something more...

341
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Insane?

342
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,040
I'm nothing if not sane
and reasonable.

343
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,200
Two things my brother never valued.

344
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,680
Which is why I'll be successful
where he failed.

345
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,240
Well, that and being

346
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,280
vastly more intelligent.

347
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,320
Now, to see about your money.

348
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,040
This is Jeremiah Valeska.

349
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,120
I'd like to speak to the mayor.
I have additional demands.

350
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,280
Yes, really.

351
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,360
50 million, unmarked bills.
I'll tell you the location.

352
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,840
We're not just
gonna hand this thing over

353
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,520
and let him destroy Gotham, are we?

354
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,720
Of course not.

355
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,080
Once we get the money,
we kill Jeremiah and his people,

356
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,280
give the core relay to the police,
split the 50 million,

357
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,120
and are hailed
as the heroes of Gotham.

358
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,560
And we cure Butch.

359
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,600
And that. Certainly.

360
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Would you believe it?

361
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
They put me on hold.

362
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Well...

363
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,920
...there's always plan number two.

364
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,240
- Get down!
- Wait!

365
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,640
Are you out of your mind?

366
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,480
Why do you keep insisting I'm insane?

367
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,560
What's insane about
having a backup plan?

368
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,800
Something Jongleur never knew about.

369
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,760
And, so you know, this building
is within the blast radius.

370
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,240
And because of your interference,

371
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,440
I'm gonna detonate the bombs
as soon as I'm far enough away

372
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,720
to observe the destruction in peace.

373
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,440
No! You promised the city six hours!

374
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,320
And whose fault is it
that I changed my mind?

375
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,480
Tell our men to rewire the bombs
to work in direct sequence.

376
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,000
And, the rest of you...

377
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
...kill these idiots.

378
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Alfred!

379
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,280
<i>Hello, Bruce.</i>

380
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,840
Jeremiah!

381
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,640
<i>I imagine, you're wondering
why is Jeremiah doing this?</i>

382
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,000
<i>My brother once said,
"All it takes is one bad day</i>

383
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,800
<i>to reduce the sanest man alive
to lunacy."</i>

384
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,440
<i>Jerome gave me what I thought
was the worst day of my life.</i>

385
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,440
<i>But only by losing everything</i>

386
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,360
<i>was I able to face
what was inside me.</i>

387
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,360
<i>And I believe I've seen
something very special</i>

388
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
<i>- inside of you as well.</i>
- Alfred.

389
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,360
<i>But to free it, you'll have to lose</i>

390
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,720
<i>everything and everyone
you hold dear.</i>

391
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,200
<i>I instructed Scarecrow to mix up
something exceptional.</i>

392
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,360
No!

393
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,800
<i>Your butler is going to show you
the path ahead.</i>

394
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,120
<i>Now watch closely.</i>

395
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,960
No. No!

396
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Alfred!

397
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,800
Hello, sleepyhead.

398
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,040
You do realize the city
is about to be blown up?

399
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,600
It's an odd time for a nap.

400
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,480
You know that she drugged me.

401
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,840
Yeah. Don't really care.

402
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Thank you, gentlemen.

403
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,880
I want to make one thing very clear.

404
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,840
If Gotham becomes a rock pile,
I mind zero percent.

405
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,080
I'm only helping you

406
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,360
because I'm with Lee now.

407
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Fine. Whatever.

408
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,480
Feign nonchalance. It's very cute.

409
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,400
It's almost convincing.

410
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,920
Ed, Jeremiah Valeska is threatening
to destroy half the city.

411
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,880
You really think I care
if you've deluded yourself

412
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,280
into thinking you and Lee
are a couple?

413
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
You see...

414
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
...that is my point.

415
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,640
You don't believe that Lee
could actually love me, do you?

416
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,600
Honestly? No.

417
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,880
You're a psychopath and a murderer.

418
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,960
And the fact that you need me
to validate your crazy fantasy

419
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,560
means that you don't believe it
either.

420
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,520
That doesn't matter.
What matters is stopping Jeremiah

421
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,360
from killing thousands of people,
so can we...

422
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,120
- Yeah. We're gonna settle this.
- Ed.

423
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,280
No, Jim.

424
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,080
This isn't the GCPD.

425
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,400
Here, I make the rules.
So, we're not gonna do this

426
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,240
until we talk about
what I want to talk about.

427
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,760
Lee's changed. I accept that.

428
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,720
Maybe she will never be
the person that I knew.

429
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,720
Fine. But she is not
who you think she is.

430
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,720
The fact that she's with you
in whatever way she's with you...

431
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Oh, Jim.

432
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,760
She's with me in every way.

433
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,480
Means she wants something from you.

434
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,160
So when it's done,
she'll get rid of you.

435
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,640
So, you're saying
that she wouldn't be with a killer?

436
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,920
And yet, she was with you.

437
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,360
And you, Jim, are 10 times the killer
that I ever was.

438
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
You have a point.

439
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,080
Maybe that's why she's not
with me now.

440
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Can we do this?

441
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Why not?

442
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,560
Just try to keep up.
I'll speak slowly.

443
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
So, most labyrinths

444
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,040
are constructed as contiguous lines
along concentric circles.

445
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,720
- One way in, one way out.
- But this one's different.

446
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Undoubtedly.

447
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,520
Those red rectangles...

448
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,880
...they're unbound on one side.

449
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,600
And they overlap black lines

450
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,280
which would lead out
of the labyrinth.

451
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,320
So, maybe we're not looking
at plans...

452
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
...but the end result.

453
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Voilá.

454
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Look familiar?

455
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,960
So, this...

456
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,520
...is Wayne Enterprises.

457
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,040
This would be Gotham Central Bank.

458
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,120
These are the buildings Jeremiah's
planning to demolish with his bombs.

459
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,200
Once those buildings are blown,

460
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,240
they collapse and create the
labyrinth from the finished drawing.

461
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,440
Jeremiah lived his entire life
in a maze.

462
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,800
Now, he's trying to remake the city
into the place he feels most safe.

463
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,760
It's actually rather elegant.

464
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,880
I need to get to the GCPD.

465
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,400
Yeah, no, sorry.

466
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,160
You're not going anywhere until
we get this information to the mayor.

467
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,440
Lee and I have some legal knots
we need untangled.

468
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,760
Yeah. Before we spend
the rest of our lives together.

469
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,640
So, you're gonna use this
to hold the city hostage?

470
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,880
Time is running out.

471
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,040
Well, then the mayor would be wise

472
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,480
to forgive Lee and I
our indiscretions.

473
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,480
Ed, wait.

474
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,560
There's one thing I can't figure out.

475
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,880
One?

476
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,040
You're being a little kind
to yourself.

477
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,040
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I think you made a mistake.

478
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Where?

479
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,960
Get the core relay, he says.

480
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,000
Have the upper hand, he says.

481
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Finally.

482
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,400
Let's get the hell out of here before
Jeremiah blows us all to smithereens.

483
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,040
This is all your fault, Oswald.

484
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,320
- You'd better...
- Fix it. I know.

485
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,240
- What?
<i>- Harvey.</i>

486
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,160
Is this Oswald?

487
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm, kind of busy.

488
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,840
I have information regarding
Jeremiah Valeska's plan.

489
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
<i>What information?</i>

490
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,200
- Wait a second. Is that gunfire?
<i>- Just listen.</i>

491
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,200
Jeremiah is not honoring
the six hours.

492
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,160
He will blow the bombs as soon as
he can watch the catastrophe

493
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,440
<i>from a safe distance.</i>

494
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,160
Jeremiah said something
about rewiring the bombs

495
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
<i>to communicate with each other.</i>

496
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,360
<i>He called it a direct sequence.</i>

497
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,680
Communicate with each other.

498
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
<i>Harvey.</i>

499
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Harvey!

500
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,200
It's a backup system from
when they operated as batteries.

501
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,640
That means we can disrupt them

502
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,600
by disarming the first bomb
in the sequence.

503
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,360
It's like removing one light
from a string of Christmas lights.

504
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,800
If only we knew where the bombs were.

505
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,920
He's back.

506
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,040
- Hey.
- Hey.

507
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,800
Gordon is alive.

508
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,560
Jim! Oh!

509
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,320
Oh, buddy.

510
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,280
All right, easy there, big fella.

511
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,760
Remember, I just got blown up.

512
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,440
- How'd you get out of the bunker?
- It's a long story.

513
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
But what matters is,

514
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,240
I have the locations of every bomb
Jeremiah planted.

515
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Alfred.

516
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Alfred.

517
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Alfred.

518
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Alfred.

519
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,480
Jeremiah said Bruce Wayne
might try to bring his friends.

520
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,320
I suppose you're one of them.

521
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,800
What? No. I just wandered in here.

522
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,840
I think our little experiment

523
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,320
is about to get
much more interesting.

524
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,360
Jeremiah wasn't bluffing.

525
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,400
There's at least a dozen bombs
on this map.

526
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,920
But you're saying if we disarm
one of them in the sequence,

527
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,560
we'll stop all of them
from going off.

528
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,920
And according to this,
the closest one is just a mile away.

529
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,240
I need to look at the schematics

530
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,080
to determine the best way
to neutralize them.

531
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,000
Alert the bomb squad.
Tell 'em to meet me there.

532
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,760
Wait. Harvey.

533
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,320
Let the bomb squad handle this.
You don't have to go.

534
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,000
Yes, I do. I need this, Jim.

535
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Yeah.

536
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,000
It doesn't matter.

537
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,080
The experiment is nearing
its conclusion.

538
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Your friend will soon be driven mad.

539
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Stop!

540
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
No!

541
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Alfred.

542
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Alfred, please.

543
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
Please stop.

544
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Alfred.

545
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
Alfred. Alfred, stop!

546
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Alfred!

547
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,800
Just stop. Alfred. Please.

548
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
No!

549
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,400
- No!
- Brucy.

550
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,440
Give me a smile.

551
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,840
Smile.

552
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,320
Alfred, listen to me.

553
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,680
You can beat this.
You can fight this.

554
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,680
Alfred, you're stronger than him.

555
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,760
Do not let him win!

556
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,120
No! No! Alfred!

557
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,920
- Bruce. Bruce. Bruce. Bruce.
- Alfred! Alfred!

558
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,440
Breathe. Look at me.

559
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,760
Scarecrow was just pumping
his fear gas in here.

560
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,440
You were only seeing
what he wanted you to.

561
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,960
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

562
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,160
No, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce.

563
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,000
Bruce, Bruce!

564
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,920
Listen. Listen to me. Listen.

565
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,240
Look at me, look.

566
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
Just look at me.

567
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Look, I'm fine.

568
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
It's me.

569
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
It's Alfred.

570
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Alfred.

571
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Alfred.

572
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
Hey.

573
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,640
I'm at the site.
Where the hell's the bomb squad?

574
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,120
The evacuation's jamming the streets.
They're still en route.

575
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,120
I can't wait. I got to go in.

576
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Do you see the bomb?

577
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,240
I don't know what it's supposed
to look like,

578
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,200
but I think it is exactly
what I'm staring at.

579
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,000
Lucius, we got to do this thing.

580
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,920
- Harvey...
<i>- Listen. We can't wait.</i>

581
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,240
We don't know when Jeremiah's
gonna set this thing off.

582
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,280
Then you're gonna have to unscrew
the antenna

583
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,560
- to activate the kill switch.
<i>- Okay.</i>

584
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,560
Lucius.

585
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,600
<i>It's making some kind of weird noise.</i>

586
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
What kind of a noise?

587
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,280
A bad one, and... and it's,
it's, getting all glowy.

588
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,800
Then, you are going to have
to work quickly.

589
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Okay.

590
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,320
<i>Jeremiah! Jeremiah!</i>

591
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,000
All my life, I spent by myself.

592
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Hidden away.

593
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,560
I am so glad to be sharing
this happy moment with all of you.

594
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,240
Today marks the dawning
of a new Gotham City.

595
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,720
One where we will all be free.

596
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Now...

597
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,440
...shall I do the honors?

598
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,160
<i>Once you unscrew the antenna,
a kill switch breaker should pop out.</i>

599
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,640
<i>Destroying it should stop the signal
from the detonator to all the bombs.</i>

600
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,400
Which breaker is it?

601
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,880
What?

602
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,480
- What do you mean, which breaker?
<i>- There are two of 'em.</i>

603
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,040
Jeremiah must've changed them
since making these schematics.

604
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,200
- Okay. I'll break both of 'em.
<i>- No, wait, Harvey,</i>

605
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,400
one of the breakers could be
the supercharge fail-safe.

606
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,760
Whatever you do,
do not touch that one.

607
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,560
- Or?
- Or all the bombs will blow.

608
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,880
Lucius, they're identical.

609
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,360
Then, Harvey, I don't know.

610
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,160
<i>- We interrupt this program...</i>
- That's Jim Gordon!

611
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
He's not dead.

612
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,360
<i>This is a message
to the followers of Jeremiah Valeska.</i>

613
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,880
{\an5}<i>Jeremiah claims to have killed me.</i>

614
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,360
{\an5}<i>Well, bad news, I'm alive.</i>

615
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,800
No. No, no, it's a trick.

616
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
I killed him.

617
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,480
{\an5}<i>So, just know you're worshipping
a fraud.</i>

618
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,080
<i>A pale imitation of Jerome.</i>

619
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,160
{\an5}<i>You did your worst, Jeremiah,
and I'm still here.</i>

620
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,680
- You lied to us.
- Gordon's alive.

621
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,040
What does it matter
whether he's alive?

622
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,760
When I hit this switch,

623
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,600
we will hear the sounds
of a new world being born.

624
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,600
Oh, for the love of God.

625
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,080
Our world.

626
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,920
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

627
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,840
Which of you will make it blow?

628
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,560
Now, listen.

629
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,800
- He's a liar!
- He's a fake!

630
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,000
Liar!

631
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,320
Stop!

632
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,480
I want you all to know...

633
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,240
...I find your fickleness

634
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,760
quite hurtful.

635
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,800
And more so...

636
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
...very predictable.

637
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,160
Well, that is disappointing.

638
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,160
If you'd ask me this morning how many
people I was gonna kill today,

639
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,480
I would've been way off.

640
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,400
Perhaps the outcome
was not what we had hoped,

641
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,880
but it was worth the risk.

642
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,520
Ozzie, if I were you, I would
limp out of here while you still can.

643
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,240
Fine.

644
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,160
- Let's go, Butch.
- Nope.

645
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,800
I'm done.

646
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,640
Ever since we teamed up,
everything's gone to crap.

647
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,400
Hell, we don't even know
where Strange is.

648
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,040
Except I do know where Strange is.

649
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,000
You mean to tell me you've known
where he is the whole time

650
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,800
- and haven't told me?
- I just got word.

651
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,520
No more excuses!

652
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,680
He fixes me now!

653
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,280
And how exactly do we pay him?

654
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,920
I can be very persuasive.

655
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,880
Think. Think.

656
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,120
Think, think, think,
think, think, think.

657
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,680
How did they beat you, huh?

658
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,960
How did they figure you out?

659
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,200
Gordon must've stolen
the blueprints to the maze,

660
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,400
found one of the bombs,
and sabotaged the sequence.

661
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,760
I'll have to start again.

662
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You're tenacious.

663
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
I like that.

664
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,640
Who are you?

665
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,320
What do you want?

666
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
I had a vision

667
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,920
of Gotham in flames.

668
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,920
Together, we can make that happen.

669
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,240
Well, I appreciate the offer,

670
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,480
but recent events have convinced me
of the benefits of working alone.

671
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,360
Don't be so rash.

672
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,160
Your dream of a new Gotham
will come to be.

673
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,280
With my help.

674
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,000
You're behind me, aren't you?

675
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,880
I can conquer Gotham on my own.

676
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,520
What makes you think
I need your help, whoever you are?

677
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,720
Because, my boy,

678
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,080
all this is not just about Gotham.

679
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,160
This is about Bruce Wayne.

680
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
You here to arrest me?

681
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
To thank you

682
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,800
and to present you with an offer.

683
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Leave Gotham.

684
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,360
Start a new life somewhere else.

685
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Alone.

686
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
And if I don't?

687
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
I know we can't change the past.

688
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
What we've done

689
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
or done to each other.

690
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,400
I can't pretend to recognize
the person I see before me.

691
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,840
But whatever happens,
after I walk out that door,

692
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
I care about you.

693
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
And I always will.

694
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,560
Lucius!

695
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,320
Call the mayor. Tell him
not to lift the evacuation order

696
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,640
until all the bombs
are under lock and key.

697
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,960
And I want every cop out there
to keep looking for Jeremiah Valeska!

698
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
What?

699
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,240
Give it up for Harvey Bullock!

700
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,200
Oh, dude! Come on!

701
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,040
Thank you.

702
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Come on.

703
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,960
Right. Well, I'm gonna take
a very long and a very hot shower.

704
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,120
And then I'm gonna make us
a legendary fry-up.

705
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Will you be joining us, Ms. Kyle?

706
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,560
I got no plans.

707
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Excellent.

708
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
You all right, mate?

709
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,160
Good, lad.

710
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Thank you again.

711
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,120
I don't know what would have
happened if you weren't there.

712
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
You're welcome.

713
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,600
Why do you think
he's so obsessed with you?

714
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,200
Jeremiah said all it takes
is one bad day

715
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,600
to drive a person insane.

716
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,120
I wonder if my parents dying
made me a little insane.

717
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,120
Maybe he sensed that.

718
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,480
Maybe he wanted to bring it out.

719
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,120
Well, you proved him wrong.

720
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,200
To be fair...

721
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,480
...the day's not over yet.
