00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,222
The feds have got to show everyone
their agents are off limits

168
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,100
and they're going to send their best guys.
We got to get out of here.

169
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:28,437
One thing we know for sure

170
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,523
is that they wanted this car.

171
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,443
Because something is in it.

172
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,196
If we find out what it is, we'll
know what we're up against.

173
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,342
HOBBS: All right, listen up!
The men we're after are professional runners.

174
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,261
They like speed and are guaranteed
to go down the hardest possible way

175
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,721
so make sure you got
your underwear on.

176
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,682
We find them, we take them as a
team, and we bring them back.

177
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:10,270
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.

178
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,940
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting, men.
Let's go hunting.

179
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,196
Agente Hobbs!
Chief of Police, Joéo Alemeida.

180
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,447
Luke.

181
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,742
Sorry to hear about
the loss of your men.

182
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,869
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

183
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,496
Let me tell you something
about these two men.

184
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,082
One is a former federal officer,
been in deep cover for five years.

185
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,000
He knows every way you're
going to come for him.

186
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:35,170
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,

187
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,798
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.

188
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,717
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...

189
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,844
Two things.
One, I need a translator.

190
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,429
We have plenty in the public
relations department.

191
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,306
Elena Neves.

192
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,267
A patrol officer?
You heard me.

193
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,229
But why? We have many
more experienced people.

194
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,314
I like her smile.

195
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,316
What's the second thing?

196
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,278
Stay the fuck out of my way.

197
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,699
(DRILLING)

198
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,165
Brian.
Hm?

199
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,043
I have something
I have to tell you.

200
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,795
(DOOR OPENING)
VINCE: God damn.

201
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,672
What a mess!

202
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,134
Where you been, man?

203
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,760
(CHUCKUNG)

204
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,763
You better check that tone.

205
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,682
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.

206
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,267
Stop it!
Both of you.

207
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:34,730
Where were you, Vince?

208
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:38,942
Guys all over the favelas
asking about you.

209
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,653
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

210
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:42,821
Had to wait them out.

211
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,614
That is such horseshit.

212
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,783
(SHOUTING) That was your job,
and those were your guys! Hey!

213
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,452
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

214
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,328
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it.

215
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:51,496
Go walk it off.

216
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:10,182
REYES: Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

217
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:14,269
but, quite frankly, your business
methods are too violent.

218
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,606
Let me tell you a true story.

219
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:22,110
Five hundred years ago, the
Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

220
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:25,655
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

221
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:32,370
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

222
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:38,001
The natives killed
every single Spaniard.

223
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:43,840
Personally, I prefer
the methods of the Portuguese.

224
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,094
They came bearing gifts.

225
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:49,471
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

226
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:54,017
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

227
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:57,354
but to continue receiving them, they
had to work for the Portuguese.

228
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:01,900
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

229
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:06,446
Now, if you dominate
the people with violence,

230
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:10,784
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.

231
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,495
And that's the key.

232
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:17,374
I go into the favelas and
give them something to lose.

233
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,210
Electricity, running water,

234
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,420
school rooms for their kids.

235
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:26,883
And for that taste
of a better life,

236
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,387
I own them.

237
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,597
Gentlemen.

238
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,559
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

239
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,185
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

240
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,436
I apologize for
the interruption.

241
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,523
Sefior Reyes,
may I speak with you?

242
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,109
We've found them.

243
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,779
Pardon me, gentlemen.

244
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,921
DOM: Almost wish
I didn't see that.

245
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,177
Almost.

246
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,304
Wait, Dom.

247
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,556
Mia was on that train.

248
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,266
(SHOUTING)
My sister!

249
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,519
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

250
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,938
You set up the deal!

251
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,649
I thought the job
was for the cars.

252
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,860
I didn't know.

253
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,403
All they want is the chip.

254
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,115
Damn!

255
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,409
You should've come clean.

256
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,077
What's going on out here?

257
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,163
Nothing.

258
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:41,708
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip.
I can take this to them.

259
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,960
They'll give it to Reyes
and set things right.

260
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,046
Get out.

261
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,926
What?

262
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,052
Get out!

263
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:02,229
You never listen to me.

264
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,982
Not when I told you
he was a cop, and not now.

265
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:10,779
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.

266
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,156
Look at our family now.

267
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:18,286
I can't go home!
Your sister is stuck in this life!

268
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,330
Where's Letty, Dom?

269
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:23,833
Where's Letty?

270
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,776
Plasma cutter.

271
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,113
Wilkes, I want a list
of every place within 50 miles

272
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,948
that distributes
compressed gas tanks.

273
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,158
Pass me that manifest.

274
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,834
Officer Neves.
Been waiting for you.

275
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,295
You asked for me?
I did.

276
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:10,046
May I ask why?

277
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,549
My smile
is not that great.

278
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,680
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.

279
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,640
Six months later, you upped
and joined the force.

280
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:21,975
You're motivated.

281
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,812
Plus, I figure you're the only
one in Rio who can't be bought.

282
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,314
Am I right?

283
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,734
Yes.
Of course I am.

284
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:31,985
Good news, bad news.

285
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,737
You know I like
my dessert first.

286
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,780
Back-checked
the rail line like you asked.

287
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,866
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

288
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,659
One set of tracks
headed west

289
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,412
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

290
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:43,788
But another set
of tracks headed east.

291
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:46,249
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

292
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,918
The GT40 that was missing
from the manifest.

293
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,587
Followed the trail
a couple of miles.

294
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,880
Pretty easy in this scrub.

295
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,715
Can't move without
leaving a sign.

296
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,258
Give me the damn veggies.

297
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:58,636
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

298
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,473
Not necessarily.

299
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:04,976
That road heads up through
the hills into the favelas.

300
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,395
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

301
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,856
It's all dirt a mile
from where you were.

302
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:13,109
If they headed that way, we'll
pick up their tracks there.

303
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,445
You come prepared.

304
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,988
I'm motivated.

305
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,740
HOBBS: All right, then.

306
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,534
Let's find ourselves a car.

307
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:51,773
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

308
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,191
What do you think?

309
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,693
Well, it's definitely
a custom chip.

310
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:59,406
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

311
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,324
Let's check this one.

312
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,455
Look at that.

313
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,958
Same building,
same order every week.

314
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,876
It's a delivery schedule.

315
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,023
What's this?

316
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:36,443
Drugs?

317
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,446
No. That's a dealer pack.

318
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:41,448
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

319
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,408
so they don't have
to constantly count it.

320
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:44,826
Right there,
that's 49 kilos.

321
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,870
49 kilos is a million
in twenties.

322
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:50,039
You're saying each one of these
shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

323
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,166
Yeah.

324
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,127
(GUN COCKING)

My father.

He used to...

406
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:28,182
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,

410
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:45,241
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,
helping her with her homework.

411
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:49,286
Even after she went to sleep,

412
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,415
he'd stay up
for a few more hours

413
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:56,460
so he could learn the next chapter
and help her the next day.

about my father.

him smiling.

remember what the hell he looked like.
