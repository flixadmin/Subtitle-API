[Oliver] <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:05,672
Last night, a group of vigilantes
saved hundreds of lives.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:09,259
So if we are going to decide
on diverting police resources

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,427
towards stopping them,

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,680
we are not going to do that until
the people of Star City have spoken.

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,223
<i>How the public will decide</i>

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>on the issue of vigilantism
is anyone's guess.</i>

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,353
Mayor Queen didn't mention
he was under investigation.

9
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,439
-Of course he did.
-Which makes us overdue for a chat.

10
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,984
-I'm not the man you think I am.
-No, Mr. Queen, I think you are.

11
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,487
I was able to upload
a critical piece of code

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,157
-to Arclight.
-What happens now?

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,616
We take the next step.

14
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,376
-[Oliver] Thanks very much, guys.
-[William] Thank you.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,795
[Oliver] That's very generous of you.
Thank you, buddy.

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,797
-All right.
-[William] Oh, cranberry sauce.

17
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,551
-[Oliver] Okay. Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
-Awesome. Happy Thanksgiving.

18
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,261
Nice turnout. You're having fun?

19
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,096
Yeah. I'm really glad we're doing this.

20
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,765
Me too, buddy, me too.

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,102
Hey, how do you think Felicity's doing?

22
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,354
Uh, you should go save her.

23
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,567
Can you comment on speculation
Mayor Queen converted

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,653
Councilwoman Pollard's bill
into a city-wide referendum

25
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,865
as a distraction from speculation
that he's the Green Arrow?

26
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,326
If I was dating the Green Arrow,
I think I would know.

27
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,411
Besides, the Flash is much more my type.

28
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,371
Sam, she's a civilian,

29
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,874
-just give her a little space, okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

30
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,462
How is it that you don't put an arrow
into one of those people?

31
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,507
-[Oliver] Hey.
-Oh, did Oliver save you?

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,802
-He is heroic that way.
-She was doing just fine on her own.

33
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,804
All right, listen, we're all set inside.

34
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,472
Rene, he's a complete pain in the ass,

35
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,973
but he's a very good advanceman.

36
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,227
-Detective, what's the tally?
-Um, I got it all here.

37
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,230
Good. Good. All right, listen,
everybody, please gather around.

38
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,982
Gather around. Mayor Queen will be
making an announcement

39
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,903
and then we will be touring the site
of the new SCPD headquarters.

40
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,906
Thank you so much

41
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,700
for being here today, guys. Uh...

42
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,829
It means a ton to Felicity,

43
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,206
to William, to myself, that...

44
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,834
we can all gather together as a city,

45
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,711
and help our neediest neighbors
on Thanksgiving.

46
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,631
Across these various food drives,
with your help,

47
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,467
the SCPD has collected enough food

48
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,011
to feed over 1,200 families.

49
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,348
And it is why I am incredibly proud

50
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,226
to be here today at
the unveiling of our new precinct.

51
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,520
A top-of-the-line facility

52
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,730
for a top-of-the-line police force.

53
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,445
One that might actually make
federal agencies jealous.

54
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,658
Are you here to tour our new headquarters?

55
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,076
Turn around.

56
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,746
-You're doing this here?
-Oliver Queen, you're under arrest.

57
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,248
On what charges?

58
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,001
Murder, assault, burglary, and kidnapping.

59
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,920
All stemming from your activity
as the Green Arrow.

60
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,132
Dad?

61
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,342
It's gonna be fine, buddy. I promise.

62
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,927
[Watson]
You have the right to remain silent.

63
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,556
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

64
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,186
Okay. The Mayor's about to
come in, press in tow.

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,856
You'll give the formal salute,
he'll say a few words and...

66
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,567
I want this man processed

67
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,360
and I'm gonna need an interrogation room.

68
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,529
-This is the Mayor. You can't...
-I'm a Federal Agent,

69
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,989
with a valid arrest warrant.

70
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,908
I want this man bound over
until arraignment.

71
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,535
-Yes, but you are federal. This is...
-Temporary holding request.

72
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,579
I'm gonna need
the ranking lieutenant to sign off.

73
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,874
-Then get him here.
-I'm the ranking lieutenant.

74
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,002
Can I expect my prisoner
to be here when I come back for him?

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,630
Could you process the Mayor
through booking, Joe?

76
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,049
Joe?

77
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,034
{\an8}You did this in front of my son.

78
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,579
{\an8}In front of my son!

79
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,085
{\an8}Agent Watson,
when I get out of here, and I will,

80
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,964
{\an8}I'm going to sue you
for malicious prosecution.

81
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,341
{\an8}Express yourself. In the meantime,

82
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,802
{\an8}you're being prosecuted
for multiple felonies.

83
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,346
{\an8}You show up after five years

84
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,181
{\an8}and The Hood just "happens to"
show up with you?

85
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,975
{\an8}That was Roy Harper.

86
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,518
{\an8}Wearing the hood at your instruction.

87
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,605
{\an8}Same way John Diggle's been doing
since I started my investigation.

88
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,691
{\an8}I've got more than you think I have.

89
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,235
{\an8}A confession
will make this easier on all of us.

90
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,988
{\an8}I'd like to see William.

91
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,991
{\an8}You're not in a position to make demands.

92
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,951
{\an8}I demand to see William.

93
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,538
{\an8}Until then, you get nothing.

94
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,965
{\an8}You said you weren't
the Green Arrow anymore.

95
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,093
{\an8}I am not the Green Arrow anymore.

96
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,512
{\an8}Even the FBI would agree with me there.

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,181
{\an8}I've kept my promise to you.

98
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,266
{\an8}You're in jail.

99
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,435
{\an8}I'll get out of here
as soon as I possibly can.

100
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,814
{\an8}For now, go home with Felicity
and Raisa will be there

101
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,526
{\an8}and I will be there just as soon as
I can. Okay? I just...

102
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,572
{\an8}I need you to be as strong
as I know you can be.

103
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,283
Okay, buddy?

104
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,660
Come here.

105
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,002
{\an8}Okay. This is gonna sting.
And by sting, I mean hurt really bad.

106
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,628
{\an8}Okay, well, as long as it will stop this.

107
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,547
{\an8}Well, I can't say 100% that it will.

108
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,632
{\an8}This is a prototype that
Felicity and I have been developing

109
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,384
to mass-produce her spinal implant.

110
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,845
Spinal as in not sure
if it will work for your issue,

111
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,598
prototype as in, well, prototype.

112
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,475

00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,239
{\an8}Hey, you guys need to see this.

116
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,786
{\an8}Watson just arrested Oliver in front

morning, the FBI arrested Mayor Queen...</i>

119
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,211
-That son of a bitch.
-Pretty much. Yeah.

120
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,629
Did she just do all this now

121
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,255
because she just got through
talking to all of us?

122
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,635
Sorry, she didn't talk to all of us,
she actually never talked to me.

123
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,304
{\an8}If you've got FOMO about being
interrogated, don't worry.

124
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,598
{\an8}Think you won't miss out
when we all get arrested.

125
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,266
{\an8}I actually think we're all
in the clear for now.

126
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,601
{\an8}No, because cops arrest

127
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,769
{\an8}up the food chain in criminal enterprises,

128

criminal enterprises.

{\an8}They don't arrest
the kingpin and his underlings,

130
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,608
{\an8}they arrest the underlings first.

131
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,360
{\an8}That's how it works.

132
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,278
{\an8}I've seen every episode
of<i>The Closer.</i>Twice.

133
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,281
{\an8}Well, I'm a real life cop
and I observed Oliver's interrogation

134
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,699
{\an8}and it didn't sound like we were targets.

135
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,118
{\an8}That's enough.

136
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,495
{\an8}We have to focus.

137
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,790
{\an8}This might be the most difficult
thing we've ever had to face.

138
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,459
{\an8}If the people think
that the Green Arrow's in prison,

139

{\an8}then the floodgates will open.

140
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,422
{\an8}Now, more than ever,
we have to protect this city.

If the criminals here think
that it's open season,

142
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,427
then this city will become a war zone.

Miss Lance, not a directive.

153
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,798
Potato, po-tah-toe.

154
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,633
Now, what am I looking for?

155
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,387
The nano-thermite device is inside
the containment unit at the far end.

156
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,268
They do not have the keys.

157
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,607
-[Cayden] Wait.
-[Laurel] Why?

158
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,276
And don't say, "Savor the anticipation."

159
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,404
Nano-thermite is highly explosive.
Your scream will detonate...

160
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,614
[sonic scream]

161
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,499
You do see how that
could've gone wrong. Yes?

162
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,250
Yes. But it didn't.

163
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,560
[door opens]

164
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,978
[footsteps]

165
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,987
-Tell me what you need.
-I need some sleep.

166
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,198
I think I can do one better.

167
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,909
FBI transfers can get lost.

168
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,162
-Locks can be left open.
-I appreciate that.

169
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,084
But if I make myself a fugitive, then,

170
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,504
obviously I'm making William an orphan.

171
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,675
-You got to do it the right way.
-Yeah.

172
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,095
-I got to do it the right way.
-Okay.

173
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,306
Good night.

174
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,523
[sighs]

175
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,115
Hand's feeling a bit better.

176
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,741
What you got?

177
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,994
There was a break-in last night
at Sunderland Corp.

178
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,663
Why didn't we get an alert?
Felicity has us wired...

179
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,374
Up the wazoo. I know.
Trying to figure it out.

180
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,460
We're basically
the Big Brother of Star City.

181
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,421
Not in a creepy way.

182
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,051
[Curtis] Okay. This makes more sense now.

183
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,428
Laurel.

184
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,221
Yeah, who works with Cayden James,

185
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,600
who can hack any security system
to bypass any alerts, such as ours.

186
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,684
What did they steal?

187
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:08,107
{\an8}Nano-thermite. It's a metastable
intermolecular composite.

188
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:13,154
A reactive particle, you know,
like mint inside a soda?

189
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,449
Alone, harmless. But together,
kaboom, as in kill lots of people,

190
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,159
not spill grape juice
all over your clothes...

191
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,368
What are they targeting, Curtis?

192
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,828
I don't know.

193
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,997
Nano-thermite needs to be combined
in order to be combustible,

194
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,499
but once it is, there are
many, many, many possibilities.

195
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,836
-Can you narrow it down?
-No. But Felicity might be able to.

196
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,674
Hey, talk fast. Oliver's arraignment
is in two minutes.

197
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,719
Laurel and Cayden James got their hands on
a mess of nano-thermite last night.

198
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,554
That means they'll be in the market
for an accelerant.

199
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,598
What kind of accelerant?
That's a really long list.

200
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,017
The nano-thermite heist,
did it involve a computer hack?

201
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,186
It involved Cayden James,
so what do you think?

202
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,938
I think that you can back-trace his hack,
maybe you can get into his system.

203
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,023
Can you come back and do this?

204
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,775
Because you're like,
way better at this than I am.

205
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,193
I got to go.

206
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,197
-Hey.
-[man] Mr. Mayor?

207
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,036
Sam? I didn't realize
you were joining my defense.

208
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,206
-Can a city district attorney...
-He can't. And I'm not.

209
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,875
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor. But considering
that the charges against you

210
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,086
stem from actions taken
within this city...

211
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,338
Is the FBI handing you the case?

212
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,548
Sorry, Oliver.

213
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,763
All rise!

214

Judge McGarvey presiding.

215
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,775
I understand the defense have waived

216
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,069
the reading of charges
in favor of a motion?

217
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,153
Yes, Your Honor.

218
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,323
Defense moves to dismiss
for lack of probable cause.

219
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,368
The photograph with the defendant
wearing the Green Arrow outfit

220
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,161
was debunked a month ago.

221
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,413
We're not relying on that photo.

222
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:50,000
The FBI has provided definitive proof
that Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

223
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,377
Then let's see it.

224
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,171
Show my whole card during
an arraignment? I don't think so.

225
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,091
Sorry, Miss Loring,
but we're not skipping over steps here.

226
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,927
But good for you, I'm gonna release
the defendant on bail.

227
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,430
Your Honor, the defendant faces
seven counts of murder.

228
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,473
And he's the Mayor
and sole parent of a minor.

229
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,308
Something tells me
he's not going anywhere.

230
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,729
Particularly not with a $5 million bail
and a $500,000 bond.

231
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,814
[gavel pounds]

232

We're gonna ask for an accelerated
docket and an early trial date.

233
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,741
Please tell William not to worry.

234
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,535
You tell him yourself when you get home.

235
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,704
I'm sorry, do you have
half a million dollars lying around?

-Actually I do.
-What?

-No. I can't let you do that.
-I can't let you not let me.

of ammunition they work with.

Whatever information they have,
they're keeping it offline.

262
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,773
I can check around the SCPD,
see if anybody's heard anything.

Good. Quentin, let's see if
whatever it is came from City Hall.

[sonic scream]

311
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,230
Digg's been keeping this
a secret for months?

312
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,066
With some kind of drugs?

313
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,570
And he told you guys.
And he didn't loop me in?

314
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,155
It was right
when Oliver got home from Kasnia.

315
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,698
And he figured he'd be okay

316
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,992
after Curtis hooked him up
with that prototype thingy.

317
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,994
What prototype thingy?

318
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,621
You might have to ask him.

319
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,083
Hey, speaking of, any word
from Curtis on Digg's condition?

320
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,293
Stable.

321
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,170
They're running tests.

322
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,048
Feels wrong us not being
at the hospital with him.

323
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,051
All of us showing up in his room
right now is the last thing we need.

324
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,261
Well, Digg needs to get back
on his feet pronto.

325
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,638
'Cause we did not exactly
shine out there without him.

326
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,932
What did Laurel steal this time?

327
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,771
Only 100 pounds
of polymer-bonded explosives.

328
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,564
When combined with the nano-thermite...

329
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,109
Well, actually, I don't know
what happens when they combine.

330
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,531
It'll take a little time
for this blood work to come back.

331
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,117
But if I had to guess,
you're suffering withdrawal

332
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,827
from the drug you've been taking,

333
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,539
in combination with
Mr. Holt's experimental treatment.

334
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,625
Is he gonna be okay?

335
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,587
I'll know more once
Mr. Diggle's panels come back.

336
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,880
Thank you, Doctor.

[sighs]

338
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,429
I should have ran
a mountain of tests on you

339
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,972
before injecting you with that prototype.

340
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,184
It was my choice.
Don't beat yourself up, Curtis.

We have a problem.
We have a massively huge problem

344
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,027
and considering it's in the same week
Oliver's been arrested.

345
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,529
-What is it?
-[Felicity] <i>The nano-thermite,</i>

346
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,697
when combined with the explosive,
creates a thermobaric weapon.

347
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,157
What's a thermobaric weapon?

348
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,452
It disperses what is essentially
a cloud of fire

349
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,329
and then pressure cooks everything
within 200 yards.

350
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,124
I'm guessing we're giving up hope

351
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,835
that Cayden James has to cook
a lot of turkeys for Thanksgiving.

352
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,336
[Felicity] <i>The only good news is that</i>

a thermobaric bomb
is extremely difficult to make.

354
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,591
Yeah. Well, Cayden James could do it,
given his history.

355
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,927
He'll probably detonate it
in a populated area.

356
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,262
Maximize casualties.

357
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,056
Go help Felicity. See if you can
find out where's he's targeting.

[Felicity] <i>Hey, John.</i>

359
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,772
I just heard about
what's been going on with you. And...

360
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,526
I'm really sorry
you've been dealing with this.

361
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,819
Thank you, Felicity.

362
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,029
-Have you told Oliver?
-No.

363
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,115
Really think that you should tell him.

364
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,785
Look, he just got arrested. I don't
want to add anything to his plate.

365
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,288
John, I think he'd really want to know.

366
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,707
Not this week.

367
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:32,087
Thanksgiving Day.
There's a million events going on.

368
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,464
I mean, if you're Cayden James,
what do you target?

369
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,384
-Soup kitchens, parade?
-Door-buster sales.

370
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,387
That's where my mom took me.

371
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,142
Cayden wouldn't guess.
He would be logical, be calculating.

372
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,894
Calculating.

373
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,355
I saw one of his algorithms at Helix
that's based on traffic patterns

374
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,691
and can extrapolate to predict
population movements.

375
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,818
-Maybe if I can recreate it...
-I'm here. Uh...

376
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,486
What can I do to help?

377
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,740
You can start by telling me what prototype
you used to treat John's condition.

378
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,116
Our prototype.

379
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,744
The one we've been developing
to cure paralysis.

380
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,788
You injected our friend with
our company's proprietary technology

381
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,540
and you didn't think to, I don't know,

382
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,167
involve me in that at all?

383
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,086
I thought Lone Ranger was just the way
we did things here at Helix Dynamics.

384
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,173
You know, the name of the company
you picked without consulting me?

385
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,428
I'm gonna work on an algorithm over there

386
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,639
when I figure out what an algorithm is.

387
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,477
I can't believe you just equated
a company name

388
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,937
to exposing a friend of ours

389
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,898
to an untested procedure,
one you still haven't told me about.

390
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,858
It's the prototype of your spinal implant.

391
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,194
Well, mine, seeing as how
I'm the one who invented it.

392
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,739
Which is why I probably don't understand
how you get to be so offended here.

393
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,617
Okay. We don't have time
for this right now.

[keyboard clacking]

395

You should cross-reference
the crowds' patterns

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,165
with the bomb's path of destruction.

I'll work on a particle cloud sim.

398
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,298
Could've just told me
you didn't like the name.

399
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,634
It's more than just the name, Felicity.

400
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,887
You picked the product we're making,
we're working out of your loft.

401
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,430
That's called being decisive,
taking initiative.

402
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,682
I didn't do anything in secret.

403
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,975
Can we, maybe, fight about this

404
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,018
when we don't have
a thermobaric bomb to stop?

405
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,312
You don't have to ask me to do anything,

406
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,648
because that's how
you and I work together.

407
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,194
It's done. Let's hope it works.

[John sighs]

409

not to bother you with this.

00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,210

-I'll be fine.

I didn't want you to worry, Oliver,
which is why I didn't tell you.

417
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,732
No, no. John, you didn't tell me

418
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,776
because you knew I'd never let you
go out there compromised.

419
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,488
And that I'd certainly never let you
compromise the team.

The first time
I've ever been disappointed.

422

Oliver, you gave up the right to judge me
when you gave up that hood.

423
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,088
You don't get to claim the moral
high ground here, my friend.

424
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,590
I'm not, Oliver.

425
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,552
But I apologize to the people
who I endanger.

426

The team, Oliver.

427
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,474
The team.

My obligation begins and ends with them.

I don't owe you a damn thing.

430

For the sake of our friendship,
I hope that's withdrawal talking.

I put on this hood
because you asked me to.

-Don't blame me for this.
-I'm not blaming you, Oliver.

I blame myself.

434

For putting your needs, your goals,
even your family above my own.

435

I've done that from the very beginning.

-That was my biggest mistake.
-That was your biggest mistake?

I happen to like a wide variety of music

and <i>The Stranger</i> is a treasured
piece of rock and roll history. Yeah.

461

Starling Stadium seats 35,000 people.

00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,855
Guess that sold-out crowd's gonna
get pressure-cooked today.

463
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,690
So how do we go in without Diggle?

464
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,817
We have to step it up. Fight without him.

465
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,611
'Cause that went really well at AmerTek.

466
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,196
We got four hours until showtime.

467
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,572
That's definitely the place,
because Cayden

468
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,407
already has control over the system.

469
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,826
What can we do about shutting it down
or cutting the power or something?

470
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,077
Tried that, didn't work.

471
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,621
That's how I know Cayden
has me locked out of the grid.

472
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,207
I know the saying goes, "The show
must go on," but this can't.

473
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,833
I might be able to help with that.

474
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,046
I'll declare a state of emergency
and they will cancel the concert.

475
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,298
-Did you talk to John?
-John and I spoke.

476
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,300
Wanted to apologize to everyone.

477
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,262
I didn't know about John's injury and...

478
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,932
I should have.

479
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,267
I will have them shut down the concert.

480
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,519
I wanted to see Billy Joel.

481
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,025
[man] Like I said on the phone, Mr. Mayor,
I'm not canceling.

482
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,654
The cost would be catastrophic.

483
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,697
So would a terrorist attack.

484
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,324
You have no actionable intelligence

485
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,409
or confirmation from law enforcement.

486
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,704
You're asking me to set a match
to millions of dollars on a hunch?

487
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,666
Have you even brought this to Mr. Joel?

488
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,000
Brought what?

489
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,253
You haven't given me anything substantive.

490
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,088
I'm trying to save lives.

491
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,048
You're trying to save your ass.

492
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,343
You give me some proof, something
more than your gut to go on,

493
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:57,597
and I'll cancel. But without it,
we open the gates at 7:00 p.m.

494
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,935
Oh, come on.

495
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,563
-You all right?
-Yeah. Why're you asking?

496
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,816
-'Cause you don't look it.
-Well...

497
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,942
Well, I get it.

498
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,986
No one wants to believe
someone that they care about

499
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,321
is capable of unspeakable things.
I've been there.

500
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,198
[scoffs] Oh, yeah?

501
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,660
Has your daughter's
otherworldly doppelganger

502
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,287
been on a murder spree lately, Dinah?

503
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,747
Not exactly. No.

504
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,834
But I did find out my ex-boyfriend
is a vigilante.

505
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,128
What, the guy in the ski goggles?

506
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,589
I never thought in a million years
that he had it in him.

507
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,467
And ever since I found out,

508
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,469
I've been trying to reconcile

509
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,805
the man that I loved
with the monster he is now.

510
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,765
[sighs] Um...

511
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,476
I'm sorry.

512
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,606
Um...

513
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,608
Last month when...

514
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,654
Laurel attacked the bunker,
I had a chance to stop her.

515
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,824
-What?
-Yeah.

516
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,868
I had a gun on her,

517
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,330
but I couldn't pull the trigger.

518
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,374
Not like I did on Lian Yu.

519
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,128
The point being all those people that
she's been killing you told me about,

520
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,133
they're on me.

521
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,428
That's not anywhere close to true.

522
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,513
Why're you saying that?

523
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,642
I'm hoping it.

524
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,356
Because I had a chance to stop Vince

525
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,108
and I let him go too.

526
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,236
We're good people, Quentin.

527
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,323
And we see the best
in the people we care about.

528
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,660
And I, for one, am not ready
to believe that that's a bad thing.

529
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,670
Come back for Round Two?

530
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,381
No. No.

531
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,469
Back to apologize.

532
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,223
You said you put
my family in front of yours.

533
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,308
You did.

534
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,269
Then I asked you to put on the hood
to make things better with my son.

535
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,521
And I...

536
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,109
I didn't give
proper consideration to yours.

537
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,487
I'm truly sorry.

538
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,580
I was thinking about William today, a lot,

539
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,457
you getting arrested in front of him.

540
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,793
-How's he doing?
-Oh, he's fine.

541
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,254
He's a tough kid.

542
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,090
But he is very grateful

543
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,343
and thankful that you are the Green Arrow,

544
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,221
so I don't have to be.

545
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,266
Don't know how much longer
I can keep doing that.

546
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,268
Especially in the short term.

547
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,019
You get your test results back?

548
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,021
Yeah.

549
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,316
[sighs]

550
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,363
The nerve damage
in my arm spread to my back,

551
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,867
and because of the steroid use,
I caused permanent damage.

552
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,078
If I continue out in the field,
I could end up paralyzed.

553
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,455
Oh, John,

554
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,292
I really wish you hadn't
have gone to these lengths for me.

555
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,837
[exhales] Well, now it's my turn
to apologize to you.

556
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,549
I should have never said
that I was doing it for you.

557
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,887
Remember last year, when the Dominators

558
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,307
put us into this "alternate" Star City?

559
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,601
Yeah. Kind of difficult to forget.

560
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,811
We got to see what our

561
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,897
perfect life would be.

562
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,027
Mine was being the Green Arrow.

563
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,572
So you asking me to take the mantle

564
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,200
was not selfish,

565
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,412
it was giving me the one thing in
the world that I never knew I wanted.

566
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,624
Well...

567
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,712
Felicity thinks that Cayden James
is going after Starling Stadium.

568
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,840
It's gonna be 35,000 people there tonight.

569
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,052
-You're the Mayor. Shut it down.
-I tried.

570
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,306
Getting arrested is not doing
a lot for my credibility.

571
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,100
What're you gonna do?

572
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,772
I've been working on a probable location

573
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:19,317
for Cayden's thermobaric bomb,
but Starling Stadium, it's massive.

574
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,777
We'll have to split up.

575
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,445
Still, who's gonna be calling
the plays out there?

576
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,780
I vote Dinah.

577
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,825
She has the least field experience
of the three of us. No offense.

578
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,118
She has superpowers, tactical training,
and police experience.

579
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,620
It's all right, Felicity. It's all right.

580
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,039
We just cannot have a repeat
of what happened at AmerTek.

581
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,625
Anybody have any suggestions
on how we do that?

582
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,715
I have a suggestion or two.

583
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,399
Overwatch, we're on site.

584
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,950
Any luck locating the bomb?

585
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,243
I'm running a code to find

and evacuate stadium that way?

592
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,845
[Wild Dog] I'll do it. Can't risk the SCPD
spotting you as the Green Arrow.

Easy, I'm just a fan in a mask.

619
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,714
Overwatch, what's happening?

620
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,717
All you need to know is that there's
no SCPD or FBI folks near you.

621
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,887
Just focus on the bomb. You're, like,
super close, like, 50 yards.

622
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,514
Guys, a little help here.

623
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,975
Terrific, Canary, go.

624
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,519
[officer] Make this easy on yourself.

625
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,854
[Wild Dog] It's cool, hoss.

626
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,857
[grunts]

627
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,444
[device beeping]

628
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,073
Overwatch, I'm at the device.

629
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,744
The wiring's all wrong on the thermobar.

630
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,496
That's not a bomb at all. That's a...

631
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,123
Decoy.

632
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,834
[officer] Get down!

633
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,918
[woman exclaims]

634
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,254
[sonic scream]

635
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,342
-[Mr. Terrific] You're welcome.
-[Wild Dog] She did all the work.

636
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,261
[Cayden] I know what you're thinking.

637
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,346
Where's the horrifically huge bomb?

638
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,767
This is going to be
an incredibly insightful evening.

639
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,935
Where is it?

640
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,397
No need to play nice.
Those jerkwads aren't cops.

641
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,649
[grunting]

642
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,573
Get those fans out of there.

643
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,117
Where is it?

644
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,244
Your generation is so impatient.

645
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,622
Why can't you just savor the anticipation?

646
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,714
There is no bomb. So, relax.

647
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,300
-And all of this?
-To get your attention.

648
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,552
To talk. That's all.

649
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,764
It's not like I have your number.

650
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,849
You're insane.

651
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,268
Thomas Szasz,

652
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,188
the renowned psychiatrist
and psychoanalyst,

653
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,066
says that there is no
such thing as insanity.

654
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,986
Revenge, on the other hand,

655
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,448
is very real.

656
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,033
Revenge?

657
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,160
I've never even met you.

658
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:45,041
And yet you cost me something dear to me.

659
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,252
Someone very dear.

660
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,464
My son.

661
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,802
That's why I've arranged
this little tête-à-tête.

662
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,139
So that when your city burns,
you'll know why.

663
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,021
[sonic scream]

664
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,576
We ran facial recognition

665
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,496
and none of those "cops"
are on the force. No surprise.

666
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,332
[scoffs] Fake cops,
fake uniforms, fake bomb.

667
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,209
That's a lot of trouble to go through
just to have a conversation

668
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,377
with the Green Arrow.

669
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,254
Now, did he really lose his son?

670
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,588
Alena helped connect the dots.

671
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,925
There is a boy named Owen Post who
has Cayden James listed as his father

672
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,094
on his birth certificate, but he's
never been known to live with Cayden.

673
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,847
Two months after A.R.G.U.S.
put Cayden into custody last year,

674
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,473
Owen went missing and was never found.

675
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,268
How does this have anything
to do with the Green Arrow?

676
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,519
Or any of us?

677
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,313
We need to keep digging, because
even if we bear zero responsibility,

678
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,023
we need to know why
Cayden James thinks we do.

679
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,318
Guys, a dude I used to code for
just blasted out this link.

680
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,783
It's super-trending.

681
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,078
Yep. Local news stations
are picking it up.

682
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,914
And of course, no one knows
that these cops aren't legit.

683
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,292
Does anyone else find this timing
just a little bit too convenient, right?

684
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,461
The whole city is voting on
the Anti-Vigilante Referendum today.

685
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,714
Guess we know which way
Cayden James wants 'em to vote.

686
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,341
He pulled us in to get those videos.
To sway the referendum.

687
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,676
That's not all he did.

688
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,970
The man has a real thermobaric bomb now.

689
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,471
Which he doesn't intend to use.

690
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,849
At least not yet anyway.

691
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,601
-Still sounds pretty dangerous.
-Yes, it does.

692
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,728
But it's a problem for another day.
How's the polling going?

693
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,147
It's gonna pass, boss.

694
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,192
Let's prepare a statement.

695
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,820
I'm right behind you.
Just need to finish up with Lance.

696
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,823
You know, if the bomb had been real,

697
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,366
we still would've stopped it
from going off.

698
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,492
Yeah. I know.

699
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,244
It's just good to have
Oliver back in the saddle.

700
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,079
Yeah, that and...

701
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,582
You and I knew where Cayden was targeting

702
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,876
because we worked
on the trace algorithm. Together.

703
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,211
'Cause we're a good team.

704
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,340
I'm sorry that I named the company
without consulting you.

705
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,550
And I'm sorry
that I picked our first project.

706
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,385
I'm sorry that I took the prototype
without asking you.

707
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,348
So, there's just one more thing
that I'm also sorry about.

708
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,641
What?

709
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,476
You know the angel investment we got?

710
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,229
What?

711
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,857
Evening, everybody.

712
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,195
I think we all would like
to applaud city officials

713
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,573
for conducting today's vote
in such a professional manner.

714
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:27,161
I believe, in my heart, that vigilantes

715
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,748
have worked to make this city
a safer and better place.

716
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,086
I also recognize, as Mayor,

717
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,381
that it is my duty to honor
the will of the people.

718
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,550
You have spoken today

719
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,304
and demanded the harshest possible
penalties for anyone

720
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,057
caught engaging in acts of vigilantism.

721
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,477
Some people still believe
that includes me.

722
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,896
But I remain confident that

723
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,483
my innocence will be proven
and I will be exonerated at my trial.

724
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,945
Thank you very much, everyone.

725
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,780
[reporters clamoring]

726
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,907
We would've won
had it not been for the video.

727
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,158
You did great out there.

728
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,702
I feel like
I just kicked myself in the teeth.

729
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,829
Maybe it's because you didn't believe
a single word that you said.

730
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,790
Give us a minute.

731
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,336
I'm headed back to Washington.

732
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,964
Something tells me you'll be back
in time to testify at my trial.

733
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,925
The time of vigilantes
is coming to an end.

734
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,219
Because how can you idolize someone

735
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,263
hiding in the shadows
who won't show his face,

736
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:30,182
who refuses to own up to
his shortcomings and culpability?

737
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,184
That's not a hero.

738
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,769
That's a coward.

739
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,731
What does your boy think of you?

740
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,607
Leave my son out of this.

741
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,860
Doesn't matter what I do, Mr. Queen.

742
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,154
It matters what you do.

743
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,329
Are you okay, Mr. Diggle?

744
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,081
Well, I'm happy as hell
to be getting out of here.

745
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,044
-And it's John.
-[Oliver] William.

746
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,628
It's Mr. Diggle.

747
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,466
And you were the Green Arrow
for my dad. Right?

748
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,676
That's right, William.

749
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,138
But if you were here last night,

750
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,473
who was at the stadium?

751
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,642
The Green Arrow wasn't at the stadium
last night, buddy.

752
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,020
Just... Just his team.

753
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,730
Okay.

754
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,774
Hey, man, let's go pull
the car around here for...

755
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,984
-"Mr. Diggle."
-All right.

756
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,701
I'm sorry you had to step in.

757
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,371
And I'm sorry you had to lie to your son.

758
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,164
I don't want to lie to him.

759
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,501
But I can do it if it's temporary.

760
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,212
If I'm just, uh...

761
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,423
subbing in for the real Green Arrow.

762
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,387
-What do you mean?
-I mean as soon as you're healed up,

763
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,264
I want you to put that hood back on.

764
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,604
Oliver, I like the way that sounds.

765
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,065
-Makes two of us.
-[door opens]

766
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,360
-[John] I'm almost ready, Doc.
-Um, actually, I'm here for Mr. Queen.

767
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,070
It's your sister. Something's happened.

768
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,245
Hi, Ollie.

769
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,126
[sighs]

770
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:28,634
Well, that stuffing smells a whole
lot better than this cranberry jello.

771
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,136
William made the stuffing.

772
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,097
-The young man can cook.
-Yeah, just like his father.

773
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,515
Raisa helped me a bit.

774
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,059
Raisa? As in our Raisa?

775
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,269
[Oliver] As in our Raisa.

776
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,480
Yeah. I have a lot to catch you up on.

777
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,023
Yeah.

778
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,777
I will save you some stuffing for
later if you want, Auntie Thea.

779
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,863
I would love that.

780
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,532
How'd you make such a miraculous recovery?

781
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,242
Lazarus Pit water.

782
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,493
[Felicity] She's kidding.

783
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,537
For blast victims like Thea
in a minimally conscious state,

784
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,247
the trick is just to find
the right drug to literally

785
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,415
wake her brain up.

786
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,501
In this case, a new form of Zolpidem.
It's not even on the market yet.

787
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,170
So more like

788
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,465
cutting-edge neuroscience
than, I don't know, a miracle.

789
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,217
It seems pretty miraculous to me.

790
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,429
I missed you very much.

791
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,182
Hell of a Thanksgiving.

792
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,643
I've never had more to be thankful for.

793
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,440
Come here. You too.
