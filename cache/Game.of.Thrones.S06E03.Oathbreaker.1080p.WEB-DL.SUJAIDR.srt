2
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:04,374
Easy, easy.

3
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,009
Easy.

4
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,017
What do you remember?

5
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,192
They stabbed me.

6
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,482
Olly...

7
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:33,736
he put a knife in my heart.

8
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:41,961
I shouldn't be here.

9
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:46,249
The lady brought you back.

10
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:50,086
Afterwards, after they stabbed you,

11
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,338
after you died, where did you go?

12
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,390
What did you see?

13
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,647
Nothing.

14
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:05,401
There was nothing at all.

15
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:12,492
The Lord let you
come back for a reason.

16
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:17,080
Stannis was not the prince
who was promised,

17
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:18,781
but someone has to be.

18
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:25,505
Could you give us a moment?

19
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,611
You were dead.

20
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,396
And now you're not.

21
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,735
That's completely
fucking mad, seems to me.

22
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,287
I can only imagine
how it seems to you.

23
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,959
I did what I thought was right.

24
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,080
And I got murdered for it.

25
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:10,416
And now I'm back.

26
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:11,918
Why?

27
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:13,636
I don't know.

28
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:16,139
Maybe we'll never know.

29
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:18,224
What does it matter?

30
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:21,978
You go on.

31
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:26,265
You fight for as long as you can.

32
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:29,268
You clean up as much
of the shit as you can.

33
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:32,321
I don't know how to do that.

34
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,075
I thought I did, but...

35
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,864
I failed.

36
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,919
Good.

37
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:48,504
Now go fail again.

38
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,263
They think you're some kind of god.

39
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:50,183
The man who returned from the dead.

40
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:51,851
I'm not a god.

41
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:54,654
I know that.

42
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:58,157
I saw your pecker.

43
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:01,160
What kind of god would
have a pecker that small?

44
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:29,472
Your eyes are still brown.

45
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:31,357
Is that still you in there?

46
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:33,359
I think so.

47
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,564
Hold off on burning my body for now.

48
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:43,069
That's funny.

49
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:46,956
You sure that's still you in there?

50
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,406
You all right?

51
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,109
Yes.
Yes, I'm fine.

52
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:29,916
Did I ever tell you I used to
think the sea was called the see

53
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,952
because it was nothing but water
as far as the eye could see?

54
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:34,337
I don't think so.

55
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:36,839
Sea, see.

56
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,759
They're spelled different,
but they sound the same.

57
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,845
Yeah, they do.

58
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:45,932
It was before I learned
how to read, obviously.

59
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:52,188
Sam, are you going to be sick?

60
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:09,655
Won't be long.
We'll be in the south soon.

61
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,824
I'm excited to see Oldtown.

62
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:17,413
Captain says it's the most
beautiful city in Westeros.

63
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:20,916
Are you going to vomit again?

64
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:23,219
No.
No, no, no.

65
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:27,506
The Citadel doesn't admit women.

66
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:30,676
There won't be a place for
you there or for Little Sam.

67
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:34,230
I stayed at Castle Black.
There's no women allowed there.

68
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:36,399
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.

69
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:39,902
I don't have a Jon Snow
or Maester Aemon

70
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,822
to help me bend the rules.

71
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:44,740
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.

72
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,525
By yourself?

73
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:48,327
With a baby and no money?

74
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,697
So if we're not going to Oldtown,

75
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:52,948
where are you taking me?

76
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,702
To my home.

77
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:58,037
Horn Hill.

78
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,625
My father's--
well, my father,

79
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,295
but my mother's a kind woman
and my sister's lovely.

80
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:09,098
They'll take care of you both.

81
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:12,468
"Wherever you go,
I go, too."

82
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:14,303
<i>That's what you said.</i>

83
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:33,956
I said that because I want
you and Little Sam to be safe.

84
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:36,325
That's all I want--

85
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:39,962
to become a maester so I can
help Jon when the time comes

86
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,714
so you'll be safe.

87
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,416
Us and everyone else in the world.

88
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:45,634
I don't care about them.

89
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:49,638
Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

90
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:53,142
I care about you and him.

91
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,596
I know that, Sam.

92
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:59,932
And he does, too.

93
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:05,237
You're the only one who ever has.

94
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:16,449
If you think it's for the best,

95
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:19,168
we trust you.

96
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:22,171
I'd feel better if you threw
something at me and stormed off.

97
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,758
I'd never do that
to the father of my son.

98
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,851
That's my father.

99
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:28,354
The man beside him is Howland Reed,

100
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:29,989
Meera's father.

101
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,536
Ser Arthur Dayne.

102
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:45,754
The Sword of the Morning.

103
00:12:45,873 --> 00:12:48,624
Father said he was the best
swordsman he ever saw.

104
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:04,773
Lord Stark.

105
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:08,060
I looked for you on the Trident.

106
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:10,145
We weren't there.

107
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:11,814
Your friend the usurper

108
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,900
would lie beneath the
ground if we had been.

109
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:17,036
The Mad King is dead.

110
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:19,205
Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.

111
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,707
Why weren't you there
to protect your prince?

112
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,709
Our prince wanted us here.

113
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,085
Where's my sister?

114
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,390
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come.

115
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:47,850
And now it begins.

116
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:54,440
No.

117
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:56,492
Now it ends.

118
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:35,708
He's better than my father.

119
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:37,343
Far better.

120
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,383
But Father beat him.

121
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:46,552
Did he?

122
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,637
I know he did.

123
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:50,389
Heard the story a thousand times.

124
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,325
He stabbed him in the back.

125
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:31,096
What's in the tower?

126
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,898
That's enough for one day.

127
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:34,683
We'll visit again another time.

128
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,352
- I want to see where he's going.
- Time to go.

129
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:40,105
Father!

130
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,217
Why did you do that?

131
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:10,385
Take me back there.
I want to go back.

132
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:11,770
No.

133
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:16,358
- He heard me.
- Maybe.

134
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:19,778
- Maybe he heard the wind.
- He heard me.

135
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:22,865
The past is already written.
The ink is dry.

136
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:25,284
What's in that tower?

137
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,702
<i>I want to go back there.</i>

138
00:17:26,821 --> 00:17:29,571
I've told you many times,
stay too long

139
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,124
where you don't belong
and you will never return.

140
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,992
Why do I want to return?

141
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,878
So I can be a cripple again?

142
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:38,413
<i>So I can talk
to an old man in a tree?</i>

143
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,549
You think I wanted to sit
here for 1,000 years

144
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,501
watching the world from a distance

145
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,002
as the roots grew through me?

146
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:45,804
So why did you?

147
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:48,674
I was waiting for you.

148
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,559
I don't want to be you.

149
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:53,312
I don't blame you.

150
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:56,849
You won't be here forever.

151
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,568
You won't be an old man in a tree.

152
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,104
<i>But before you leave,</i>

153
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:05,190
you must learn.

154
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:07,109
Learn what?

155
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:09,828
Everything.

156

_

189
00:22:03,513 --> 00:22:06,514
I don't know how you stand
it in all that leather.

190
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,607
If we could have the room.

191
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:28,737
You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

192
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:33,030
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

193
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:34,327
If you're going to torture me,

194
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:36,461
just call them back
and get on with it.

195
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:38,630
I am not a torturer.

196
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,518
Though it so often is
what people deserve.

197
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:47,472
And it does provide answers.

198
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,442
But they're usually
the wrong answers.

199
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:54,029
My job is to find the right answers.

200
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:56,231
Do you know how I do that?

201
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:59,618
I do it by making people happy.

202
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:02,320
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

203
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:05,657
That's your name, isn't it, Vala?

204
00:23:05,742 --> 00:23:08,043
That's all right.

205
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:11,296
I know who you are
and what you've done.

206
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:14,366
You've done a lot.

207
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:17,012
You've sacrificed
your body for a cause,

208
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:20,372
which is more than most people do.

209
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:23,635
And you've helped
the Sons of the Harpy

210
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,522
murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.

211
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:29,881
The Unsullied and the Second
Sons are foreign soldiers

212
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:32,000
brought here by a foreign queen

213
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:34,803
to destroy our city and our history.

214
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:37,756
I understand.

215
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:40,509
Well, that makes perfect sense

216
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:43,345
from your perspective.

217
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,232
I have a different
perspective, of course.

218
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:50,769
I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective

219
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:53,271
just as I will try
to see them from yours.

220
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:55,574
Because that is the only way

221
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:58,577
that I can make you and Dom happy.

222
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:05,450
That is how
you pronounce it-- Dom?

223
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:08,587
I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

224
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:12,007
Such a handsome boy.

225
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:15,627
Those big, brown eyes. Good
luck keeping the ladies away.

226
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:19,881
Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?

227
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:22,851
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

228
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,387
Children are blameless.

229
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,640
I have never hurt them.

230
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:31,059
Your boy is in no immediate danger,

231
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,727
this I swear to you.

232
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:36,615
But between us, dear,

233
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,818
you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.

234
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:42,487
We both know the penalty
for that crime.

235
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:51,296
How will poor Dom
get on without his mother?

236
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:53,415
And with his breathing problem.

237
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,834
If I tell you anything,
they'll kill me.

238
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:58,136
So either you kill me or they do.

239
00:24:58,222 --> 00:25:01,756
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

240
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,343
There is a third option, though.

241
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,647
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

242
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:13,351
I've already booked passage for
a woman and her young son.

243
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:16,905
I'll even throw in a bag of
silver to help you start again.

244
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:18,773
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask

245
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:22,577
one of our leather-clad
friends back in to carry it.

246
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,362
Far too heavy for me.

247
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:27,616
The boat sails at dawn.

248
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,502
You need to decide now.

249
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:33,371
A new life for you and Dom

250
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:35,090
or...

251
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:52,941
What should we do while we wait?

252
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,860
To pass the time, what should we do?

253
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,279
<i>What should we talk about?</i>

254
00:25:59,616 --> 00:26:01,399
You speak 19 languages.

255
00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:04,819
You must occasionally use some
of them to talk about things.

256
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:08,156
You two, you spend a great
deal of time together.

257
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:11,409
What would you be talking
about if I weren't here?

258
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:14,462
Patrol.

259
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:17,215
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

260
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,885
What we see on patrol.

261
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,920
Who we captured on patrol.

262
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:24,472
That's good.
That's very good.

263
00:26:26,593 --> 00:26:28,977
But that's a report.

264
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:31,263
I was thinking more
of a conversation.

265
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:34,432
A wise man once said the
true history of the world

266
00:26:34,518 --> 00:26:37,936
is the history of great
conversations in elegant rooms.

267
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:39,938
Who said this?

268
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:42,407
Me.

269
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:44,442
Just now.

270
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:53,034
All right, no conversations.

271
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,003
Let's play a game.

272
00:26:57,874 --> 00:26:59,735
You don't play games,
either one of you, ever?

273
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,069
Games are for children.

274
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:02,711
<i>My master Kraznys</i>

275
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:04,750
would sometimes make us play games.

276
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:06,798
There, that's a start.

277
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:10,602
- Only the girls.
- No, no, no.

278
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:12,637
Not that.
Of course not that.

279
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:16,274
Innocent games.
Fun games.

280
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,859
Drinking games.

281
00:27:17,978 --> 00:27:20,145
<i>We do not drink.</i>

282
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Until you do.

283
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:25,921
All right.
No drinking.

284
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:27,786
We can play without drinking.

285
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:30,132
It's a wonderful game.
I invented it.

286
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:31,656
Here's how it works.

287
00:27:31,742 --> 00:27:33,802
I make a statement about your past.

288
00:27:33,827 --> 00:27:35,460
If I'm wrong, I drink.

289
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:38,663
And if I'm right--

290
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:42,167
maybe we can't play without drinking.

291
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,388
Oh, you took your time.

292
00:27:46,506 --> 00:27:48,473
Sorry.

293
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,287
I was busy learning who funds
the Sons of the Harpy.

294
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:54,346
- Some things you can't rush.
- You found out?

295
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:56,564
The Good Masters of Astapor

296
00:27:56,683 --> 00:27:58,850
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

297
00:27:58,935 --> 00:28:01,936
With help from their
friends in Volantis.

298
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:03,488
<i>You see?</i>

299
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:06,074
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

300
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:07,803
We only have to worry about

301
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:10,028
the three rich foreign
cities paying for it.

302
00:28:10,113 --> 00:28:11,746
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.

303
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:13,698
We will do it again
and execute the Masters.

304
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:17,202
If the Unsullied march off to
reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,

305
00:28:17,287 --> 00:28:18,787
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

306
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:21,423
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

307
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,208
We cannot.

308
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:26,094
The Masters speak only one language.

309
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:27,879
They spoke it to me for many years.

310
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:29,714
<i>I know it better
than my mother tongue.</i>

311
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,518
If we want them to hear us, we
must speak it back to them.

312
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:35,770
May it be the last
thing they ever hear.

313
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:37,939
You may be right.

314
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:40,025
<i>So we will fight them?</i>

315
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,060
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

316
00:28:42,145 --> 00:28:45,063
It's a conversation.

317
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:47,449
Tell me, can your little
birds get a message

318
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:50,785
to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

319
00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:53,455
and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

320
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:56,207
Of course.
Men can be fickle,

321
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:59,411
but birds I always trust.

322
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:08,636
Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

323
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:10,088
How's your mother's jaw?

324
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:11,723
Better.

325
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,235
And your father?

326
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,727
No one's seen him.

327
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:17,095
And no one will.

328
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,813
That worked out rather nicely.

329
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:20,932
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

330
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:23,101
I don't think so.

331
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:25,019
Do you miss him?

332
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:27,689
He was nice.

333
00:29:27,774 --> 00:29:30,108
He called us his little birds.

334
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:31,776
He gave us sweets.

335
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,748
It's funny you should mention that.

336
00:29:38,502 --> 00:29:42,454
Guess what I happened to find today.

337
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,124
Candied plums from Dorne.

338
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,796
Now remember, if any of your friends

339
00:29:51,932 --> 00:29:55,133
like sweets or need help,
they can always come to me.

340
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:59,637
All I need in return are whispers.

341
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,897
<i>No need to be afraid.</i>

342
00:30:08,982 --> 00:30:10,899
This is Ser Gregor.

343
00:30:10,984 --> 00:30:13,234
He's friends with all my friends.

344
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:20,792
Run along now.

345
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:27,465
Varys's little birds?

346
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:29,050
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

347
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,085
What did you do to him exactly?

348
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:32,837
I haven't been able
to get a clear answer.

349
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:35,006
Oh, a number of things.

350
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:36,591
Does he understand what we're saying?

351
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:38,927
I mean, to the extent
that he ever understood

352
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:41,262
complete sentences
in the first place.

353
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:45,150
He understands well enough.

354
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:47,268
So tell him to march into the sept

355
00:30:47,354 --> 00:30:49,988
and crush the High Sparrow's
head like a melon.

356
00:30:50,073 --> 00:30:53,491
The High Sparrow has hundreds of
Faith Militant surrounding him.

357
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:55,860
Ser Gregor can't face them all.

358
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:57,862
And he won't have to.

359
00:30:57,998 --> 00:30:59,998
He'll only have to face one.

360
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:04,536
Has the Faith leveled
official charges yet?

361
00:31:04,621 --> 00:31:06,287
Not yet.

362
00:31:06,373 --> 00:31:09,541
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

363
00:31:09,676 --> 00:31:11,543
Don't stop at the city.

364
00:31:11,678 --> 00:31:13,962
I want little birds in Dorne,

365
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:16,714
in Highgarden, in the North.

366
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,884
If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

367
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,853
I want to hear it.

368
00:31:21,938 --> 00:31:24,556
If someone is laughing at the queen

369
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:27,275
who walked naked through
the streets covered in shit,

370
00:31:27,394 --> 00:31:29,143
I want to hear.

371
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:32,030
I want to know who they are.

372
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:34,232
I want to know where they are.

373
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:43,552
<i>As bad as Lord
Varys was, Qyburn is worse.</i>

374
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:45,960
I told them all.
I told them.

375
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,962
He's arrogant, dangerous.

376
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:51,082
You don't get thrown out of the
Citadel without good reason.

377
00:31:51,218 --> 00:31:52,917
And no one listened to my advice.

378
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:55,136
<i>So here we are.</i>

379
00:31:55,255 --> 00:31:57,555
And what he's done to Gregor Clegane

380
00:31:57,641 --> 00:31:59,591
<i>is an abomination.</i>

381
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:02,760
We never sanctioned this experiment.

382
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:05,430
I for one think it will
be in our best interest

383
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:07,232
to have the beast dest--

384
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:14,606
- Can I help you?
- Why are you here?

385
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:17,108
- My mother--
- I was invited, my dear,

386
00:32:17,193 --> 00:32:19,861
to help deal with several
troublesome issues,

387
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:22,280
such as the queen's imprisonment.

388
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:24,782
Thank you for bringing it up.

389
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:28,620
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

390
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:30,922
Margaery is the queen.

391
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:32,790
You are not the queen

392
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:34,926
<i>because you're not
married to the king.</i>

393
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:36,711
I do appreciate these things

394
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:40,431
can get a bit confusing
in your family.

395
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:42,684
This is a small council meeting.

396
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:44,936
You have no position
on the small council.

397
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:46,804
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

398
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,330
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

399
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:50,141
does have a position
on the small council.

400
00:32:50,277 --> 00:32:52,810
Grand Maester Pycelle, would
you sanction that statement?

401
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:54,979
Well, um...

402
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:58,066
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower

403
00:32:58,151 --> 00:33:00,234
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

404
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,904
<i>Of course, that was the Mad King.</i>

405
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:04,622
King Robert saw things differently.

406
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,407
And King--

407
00:33:09,713 --> 00:33:12,547
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

408
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,832
Do you consider the
murder of your own blood

409
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:16,918
a troublesome issue?

410
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:18,947
The same women who murdered Myrcella

411
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:21,422
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

412
00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:23,224
We've got a lot to discuss.

413
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:25,727
All of us together.

414
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:29,514
And seeing as you cannot make us
leave, we best get on with it.

415
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:34,185
No, we cannot make you leave.

416
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:37,405
And you cannot make us stay.

417
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:41,109
Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

418
00:34:22,485 --> 00:34:24,318
Your Grace.

419
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:27,572
My mother would like to see her
daughter's final resting place.

420
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:30,241
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

421
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:32,243
That's not possible.
Not yet.

422
00:34:32,328 --> 00:34:33,995
When will it be possible?

423
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,414
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

424
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:39,083
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked

425
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:41,586
through the streets
in front of the whole city.

426
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,388
That wasn't the full atonement?

427
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:45,256
No.

428
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:48,476
She must stand trial
before seven septons

429
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,728
so we can learn the true
extent of her sins.

430
00:34:50,814 --> 00:34:54,982
I want you to let her see
Myrcella's resting place.

431
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:56,651
I am the king.

432
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,236
You are.

433
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:02,106
And what does that mean to you?

434
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:03,608
<i>It means a great deal to me.</i>

435
00:35:03,693 --> 00:35:05,610
The Crown and the Faith

436
00:35:05,695 --> 00:35:07,829
are the twin pillars of the world.

437
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:09,947
<i>Do you know who told me that?</i>

438
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:12,761
Your mother.

439
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:15,286
My mother who is unclean?

440
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:19,340
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

441
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:41,362
How do you think the Mother
Above first came to us?

442
00:35:42,365 --> 00:35:44,148
How did men and women

443
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:47,735
first come to feel
the Mother's presence, hmm?

444
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:50,955
It was through their own mothers.

445
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,044
There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

446
00:35:57,163 --> 00:36:01,332
But when she speaks of you, the
Mother's love outshines it all.

447
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:06,337
Her love for you is more real

448
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:08,339
than anything else in this world

449
00:36:08,424 --> 00:36:11,425
because it doesn't
come from this world.

450
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:13,478
But you know that.

451
00:36:13,563 --> 00:36:16,180
You've felt it.

452
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:18,483
You've seen her
when she talks to you.

453
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,353
Yes.

454
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:24,655
<i>It's a great gift.</i>

455
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:26,741
One I never had.

456
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:30,361
Envy.

457
00:36:30,497 --> 00:36:32,914
One more thing for me to atone for.

458
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:36,250
Your Grace,
do you-- may I?

459
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:37,919
Do you mind?

460
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:39,370
It's my knees.

461
00:36:39,455 --> 00:36:41,339
Of course.

462
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,548
When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

463
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:52,884
she did it to get back to you.

464
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:55,720
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

465
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:57,605
through any more than
she's already endured.

466
00:36:57,724 --> 00:37:01,058
It's not what I want.
It's what the gods want.

467
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:03,778
<i>They make their will known
to us and it's up to us</i>

468
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:06,314
to either accept or reject it.

469
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:10,067
Please.

470
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:18,626
If we're to be just and good,

471
00:37:18,745 --> 00:37:21,462
then we accept it,
all of us, even kings.

472
00:37:21,581 --> 00:37:25,833
A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

473
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:28,386
And no one is wiser than the gods.

474
00:37:30,924 --> 00:37:34,091
My grandfather once said
something similar.

475
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:36,060
Except for the part about the gods.

476
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:40,064
The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

477
00:37:41,317 --> 00:37:43,351
As they work through your mother.

478
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:47,655
There's so much good in all of us.

479
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:51,442
The best we can do is to help
each other bring it out.

480
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:21,472
Who are you?

481
00:38:21,557 --> 00:38:22,974
No one.

482
00:38:24,861 --> 00:38:27,361
<i>Who were you
before you came here?</i>

483
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,113
<i>Arya Stark.</i>

484
00:38:31,117 --> 00:38:33,651
<i>Tell me about
Arya Stark's family.</i>

485
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:36,654
Her father was Eddard Stark.

486
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:39,290
Her mother was Catelyn Stark.

487
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,710
She had one sister, Sansa,

488
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:44,712
and four brothers.

489
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:56,173
Three brothers.

490
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:59,093
<i>Robb, Bran, Rickon.</i>

491
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:03,981
And a half-brother Jon.

492
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:07,485
And where are they now?

493
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,521
<i>They may be dead
for all a girl knows.</i>

494
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:22,249
Tell me about the Hound.

495
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,870
<i>Also dead.</i>

496
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:39,266
<i>Arya Stark left him to die.
He was on her list.</i>

497
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:44,855
He was not on her list anymore.

498
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:46,691
She had taken him off it.

499
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:50,861
Why? Didn't she want
him dead any longer?

500
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:56,951
<i>She did and she did not.</i>

501
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:03,574
She sounds confused.

502
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:12,083
Yes, she was.

503
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:19,056
Who else was on Arya
Stark's funny little list?

504
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:22,143
<i> Cersei Lannister.</i>

505
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,895
<i>Gregor Clegane.</i>

506
00:40:26,816 --> 00:40:28,232
<i>Walder Frey.</i>

507
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:34,739
<i>That's a short list.</i>

508
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:41,245
<i>That can't be everyone
you want to kill.</i>

509
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,534
Are you sure you're not
forgetting someone?

510
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:52,623
Which name would you
like a girl to speak?

511
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:30,711
<i>If a girl tells me her name,</i>

512
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,214
I will give her eyes back.

513
00:41:36,169 --> 00:41:38,135
A girl has no name.

514
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:42,841
Come.

515
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:18,542
If a girl is truly no one,

516
00:42:18,628 --> 00:42:21,045
<i>she has nothing to fear.</i>

517
00:42:46,405 --> 00:42:48,539
Who are you?

518
00:42:51,911 --> 00:42:53,794
No one.

519
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:06,507
The Umbers are
a famously loyal house.

520
00:43:06,592 --> 00:43:09,093
Famously loyal to the Starks.

521
00:43:09,178 --> 00:43:12,229
And you, Lord Karstark.

522
00:43:12,315 --> 00:43:15,099
Your people share blood with
the Starks, don't they?

523
00:43:15,234 --> 00:43:17,851
But here we are.
Times change.

524
00:43:17,937 --> 00:43:20,271
When my father became
Warden of the North,

525
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:22,356
<i>your house refused
to pledge their banners.</i>

526
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:24,241
Your father was a cunt.

527
00:43:27,446 --> 00:43:29,663
My beloved father,
the Warden--

528
00:43:29,782 --> 00:43:32,917
Your father was a cunt
and that's why you killed him.

529
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:35,930
<i>I might have done
the same to my father</i>

530
00:43:35,955 --> 00:43:38,505
if he hadn't have done me
the favor of dying on his own.

531
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:41,425
My father was poisoned
by our enemies.

532
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,260
Mmm.

533
00:43:43,346 --> 00:43:46,630
Why have you come to
Winterfell, Lord Umber?

534
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:50,601
The bastard Jon Snow led an army
of wildlings past the Wall.

535
00:43:50,686 --> 00:43:53,103
We're farther north
than any of you fuckers.

536
00:43:53,189 --> 00:43:56,473
<i>Wildlings come down, we always
have to fight them first.</i>

537
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,810
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.

538
00:43:59,895 --> 00:44:02,646
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

539
00:44:02,732 --> 00:44:05,616
So now you've come seeking help?

540
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:08,035
We need to help each other.

541
00:44:08,154 --> 00:44:11,705
The colder it gets, the farther
south those goat fuckers will roam.

542
00:44:11,824 --> 00:44:13,791
Won't take them long to get here.

543
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:16,710
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

544
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:18,429
If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.

545
00:44:18,497 --> 00:44:20,965
<i>He knows this place
better than we ever will.</i>

546
00:44:24,086 --> 00:44:26,220
Pledge your banners to House Bolton.

547
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,839
Swear loyalty to me
as Warden of the North

548
00:44:28,975 --> 00:44:31,475
and we will fight together
to destroy the bastard

549
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,060
and all his wildling friends.

550
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,346
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

551
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:38,065
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

552
00:44:38,184 --> 00:44:40,184
I'm not doing that either.

553
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,237
Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

554
00:44:43,356 --> 00:44:46,190
Your father honored tradition.

555
00:44:46,275 --> 00:44:48,492
<i>Knelt for Robb Stark.</i>

556
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:50,995
Called him King of the North.

557
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,247
<i>Was Robb Stark right
to trust your father?</i>

558
00:44:53,366 --> 00:44:55,165
Then it appears we're
at a bit of an impasse.

559
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:58,369
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.

560
00:44:58,504 --> 00:45:00,087
I've got a gift for you.

561
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:05,793
A girl, I hope.
I prefer redheads.

562
00:45:05,878 --> 00:45:08,879
A girl, aye.

563
00:45:10,216 --> 00:45:12,266
<i>A wild one.</i>

564
00:45:19,942 --> 00:45:21,775
I like them wild.

565
00:45:22,862 --> 00:45:26,363
And the boy, nice and young.

566
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:28,615
The way Karstark likes them.

567
00:45:34,407 --> 00:45:35,906
Who's this?

568
00:45:35,991 --> 00:45:38,375
Rickon Stark.

569
00:45:45,468 --> 00:45:47,751
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

570
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:21,285
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

571
00:46:32,765 --> 00:46:34,515
It's time.

572
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:15,005
If you have any last
words, now is the time.

573
00:47:15,141 --> 00:47:17,391
You shouldn't be alive.

574
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,426
It's not right.

575
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:22,396
Neither was killing me.

576
00:47:26,735 --> 00:47:29,353
My mother's still
living at White Harbor.

577
00:47:29,488 --> 00:47:31,355
Could you write her?

578
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,774
Tell her I died
fighting the wildlings.

579
00:47:42,201 --> 00:47:45,919
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

580
00:47:46,038 --> 00:47:50,007
Betray you or betray
the Night's Watch.

581
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:53,177
You brought an army of
wildlings into our lands.

582
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:57,881
An army of murderers and raiders.

583
00:47:58,017 --> 00:48:01,718
If I had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,

584
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:05,222
I pray I'd make
the right choice again.

585
00:48:05,357 --> 00:48:07,391
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

586
00:48:07,476 --> 00:48:10,477
I fought, I lost.

587
00:48:12,314 --> 00:48:14,231
Now I rest.

588
00:48:15,234 --> 00:48:19,152
But you, Lord Snow,

589
00:48:19,238 --> 00:48:21,655
you'll be fighting
their battles forever.

590
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:10,764
We should burn the bodies.

591
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:13,767
You should.

592
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:24,828
What do you want me to do with this?

593
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:26,613
Wear it.

594
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:29,032
Burn it.

595
00:50:29,118 --> 00:50:31,335
Whatever you want.

596
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,919
You have Castle Black.

597
00:50:39,712 --> 00:50:41,928
My watch is ended.

598
00:50:51,229 --> 00:51:01,842
