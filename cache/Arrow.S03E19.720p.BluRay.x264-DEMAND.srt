1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,161
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,890
You have but two choices.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,961
Ascend to the calling of Ra's al Ghul, or you
will spend the rest of your days in a cage.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,889
- I love you.
- Wow.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,401
- Lance knows.
- The whole city knows, Oliver.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,763
Mr. Queen should be considered armed
and highly dangerous.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,801
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,485
Captain Lance.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,170
I'm here to turn myself in.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,368
- The hell are your people doing?
- I told them to stand down.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,642
- Get down.
- You've got the wrong guy.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,211
Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,010
I am.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,760
To repeat, we're getting word
from the authorities...

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,807
...that Roy Harper, a Glades resident with a
long history of run-ins with the police...

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,891
...has been identified as the vigilante
known as the Arrow.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,129
What the hell was that?

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,291
Probably just a power surge.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,923
That wasn't a power surge. Check it out.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,124
Harper is currently being transported
to S. C. P.D. by police caravan...

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,527
...and should be arriving eminently.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,883
We're now going live to the S. C.P.D.

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,290
All right, let's get him. Come on.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,287
- Bring him.
- Captain.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,767
- You calling off the hunt for Queen?
- No comment.

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,450
Come on, bring him through.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,367
Proud of yourself?
Letting the kid take the fall?

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,007
Not gonna let him do that. Give me a pen
and paper, I'll sign a confession.

29
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,641
Oliver? Not another word.

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,047
- Uncuff him.
- Ha. Sure, in 25 to life.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,446
More like right now.

32
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,801
Habeas writ.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,884
The district attorney's office
won't charge Oliver Queen...

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,447
- ...while charging Harper with the crime.
- Nice try.

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,246
Five hours ago,
Queen turned himself in. He confessed.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,331
To you, alone and uncorroborated.
And then the Arrow turned himself in.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,930
Your so-called confession
is looking rather fabricated now.

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,761
- That's just crap.
- The DA is ordering Oliver to be released.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,850
You the only one who's allowed
to put themselves above the law?

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,281
This isn't over.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,809
What the hell are you doing?

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,406
Making sure you both
don't end up in prison.

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,601
Hey. What are you doing here?

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,643
Proofing the quarterly earnings report.

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,241
Finalizing the subsonic
ionizer patent application.

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,802
- And I'm trying to debug a sequential...
- I mean what are you doing here? Heh.

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,968
Oliver and Roy Harper
are both in handcuffs.

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,242
I have a lot of work to do.

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,569
And Oliver was released.
How do you know about Roy Harper?

50
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,967
Apart from it being
all over the television...

51
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,090
...I'm able to put one and one
together and I get that...

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,124
...Oliver's sister's boyfriend
is obviously part of your team.

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,367
Obviously.

54
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,642
- You okay?
- Yes.

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,247
How are you?

56
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,211
Yeah, let's not get into that. Uh...

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,400
I said I love you, but it was like...

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,405
It was, like, with a lower case L.
You know? Not...

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,124
Um... So let's not make it a thing.
Um...

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,361
You had just saved my life,
I had 6.2 billion nano-robots...

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,167
...coursing through my hypothalamus,
and my emotions were all over the place.

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,130
Well, I'll let you get back
to your work-slash-worry, and, uh...

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,764
...keep a good thought for Roy.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,286
Okay.

65
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,845
What were you thinking?

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,644
Roy?

67
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,610
Tell me why.

68
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,404
Remember what I told you
when I found out you were the Arrow?

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,921
Yeah, you told me I saved your life.

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,650
Now I get to save yours.

71
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,844
- I can't let you do that.
- Oliver, ever since I found out...

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,210
...that I killed that cop, I have been
trying to make it right as Arsenal.

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,891
Maybe what I need to do
is make it right as the Arrow.

74
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,162
- No, Roy...
- I killed a police officer.

75
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,251
Mirakuru or not, I should be punished
for that. I should be in prison.

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,568
That won't bring the officer back.

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,962
This city still needs you.

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,886
It needs you more.

79
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,327
For the first time
since I remembered what I did...

80
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,444
...I'm okay.

81
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,405
You sure this place is safe?

82
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,084
- As safe as I could manage.
- Who's that?

83
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,651
- Someone eager to repay a debt.
- For how long?

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,962
Waller has men all over Hong Kong
looking for us.

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,602
Even if we make it out, there's nowhere
we could run where Waller won't find us.

86
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,767
So, what are we gonna do?

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,606
- I'm gonna find Waller first.
- You'll break into A.R.G.U.S. by yourself?

88
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,325
No.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,047
He's gonna walk in.

90
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,281
My pass card to the field office.

91
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,007
What do you want?

92
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,931
Setting Harper up as your patsy.
I applaud the gambit.

93
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,721
I had nothing to do with Roy
turning himself in.

94
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,406
- But I will get him out.
- And then what?

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,002
Ra's won't stop until you're wearing
the Demon's Head ring on your hand.

96
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,646
- That's not gonna happen.
- People are being murdered.

97
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,121
Your days as the Arrow are finished.

98
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,800
But of course,
no one close to you has died.

99
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,200
Have you considered leading
the League of Assassins...

100
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,166
...might be a preferable outcome
as to what alternatives Ra's might devise?

101
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,283
I have a lot of work to do.

102
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,841
I'm gonna break Roy out of prison.

103
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,091
Ironically, before turning
to vigilantism...

104
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,291
...Harper was a career criminal with an
arrest record for breaking and entering...

105
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,767
...petty theft, and grand larceny.

106
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,407
- Recently, Harper worked in collaboration...
- Thea.

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,126
- Tell me you didn't put him up to this.
- Of course not.

108
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,290
But I'm gonna do everything
in my power to make it right.

109
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,450
- You okay?
- I'm fine, but we need Roy out of prison.

110
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,849
Looks like we have another problem
to add to our ever growing list.

111
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,088
Homicide at Starling National Bank.

112
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,443
Channel 52 has acquired
surveillance footage of the incident.

113
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,604
If you're a bank-robbing metahuman,
why stay in Central City...

114
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,690
...when you have banks and no Arrow?
Okay.

115
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,406
Okay, we need a plan to extract Roy.

116
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,967
In the meantime, Felicity,
call S.T.A.R. Labs.

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,925
See if they're tracking any metahumans
out of Central City.

118
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,887
S.C.P.D. According to city records,
you got a basement down here.

119
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,202
You already have Roy Harper in custody.

120
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,846
I got a warrant that says
I can search that basement.

121
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,727
Sorry for the rush.

122
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,367
I didn't wanna give you time to turn
that place into a storage room again.

123
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,289
Gentlemen.

124
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,770
Here you go. Break it down.

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,331
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

126
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,648
Oh, uh, my Chinese is a little rusty, but this
looks like a crate from the North China Sea.

127
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,724
You spent some time there, right?
And this is my favorite.

128
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,491
You actually put those things on display?

129
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,929
Captain, we have fingerprint matches for the
latents we lifted off all this equipment.

130
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,610
Hold that thought.

131
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,971
What do you got?

132
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,929
We only got one match.

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,810
- Who is it?
- Roy Harper.

134
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,964
What, just one...?

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,286
Uh...

136
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,602
Did you check the other computers?

137
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,370
- Captain, it's clearly...
- Shut up.

138
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,451
Whatever crap
you're thinking about giving me, save it.

139
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,970
Smart as you all are,
you are bound to make a mistake.

140
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,004
I'm gonna be there when it happens.

141
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,086
You wiped the entire place.

142
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,448
And moved some of your
sensitive trunk items.

143
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,847
- You're welcome.
- You didn't wipe Roy's prints.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,685
Roy confessed.
We didn't see any point losing both of you.

145
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,285
I'm not losing Roy.

146
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,165
What about that metahuman
that's out there killing people?

147
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,522
We need my backup cache
from the secondary lair.

148
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,925
See those plainclothes?
Lance will have them follow you.

149
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,203
You try to nab even so much as
a purse-snatcher and they'll pounce.

150
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,209
Somebody needs to protect this city.

151
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,444
We are dealing with a metahuman.
Call Barry.

152
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,210
Oh, he can't help right now. Uh-uh.

153
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,006
He's got a lot on his plate
with Dr. Wells, I think.

154
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,646
It's really hard to keep up with him.

155
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,969
But what if there's someone else
that could help?

156
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,689
Oh, hey, Felicity. Check this out.

157
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,723
I finally got the neural network online.

158
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,367
So when my brain
tells the gauntlet to wave, and...

159
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,405
- Hi.
- Hi.

160
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,928
Sorry about what's happening.
If there's anything I can do to help...

161
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,525
That's why we're here.

162
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,365
- Oh.
- You know how I try to keep my work life...

163
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,643
...and my other work life separate?
I meant to tell you that.

164
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,006
Did I tell you that?

165
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,565
- There's a...
- There's a meta...

166
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,563
...in Starling City killing people.

167
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,322
- A meta, as in human?
- Yeah.

168
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,811
So obviously we need to catch
this plasma death thing guy.

169
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,611
Ugh. Now I see why Cisco
gives them all names.

170
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,083
The police are all over Oliver,
so we need you.

171
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,924
And you're okay with this?

172
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,491
We need your help.

173
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,491
So it's a team-up.

174
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,727
High-five.

175
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
- Don't shoot.
- What the hell is going on?

176
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,083
They've been holding me here for weeks.

177
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,642
What? You don't trust me?

178
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,960
Look at him.

179
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,442
- He's Army, not A.R.G.U.S.
- You're saying this is General Shrieve?

180
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,007
He held me hostage.

181
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,124
Targeted you and the Yamashiros
for death.

182
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,607
- Why would he do that?
- The Alpha/Omega.

183
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,408
Shrieve plans to unleash it
on Hong Kong.

184
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,491
Claim that the Triad mishandled a
bioweapon they never should've had.

185
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,564
- That's insane.
- Well, Shrieve seems to think that...

186
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,321
...China is a military and economic threat.

187
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,849
So he'd killed himself and his men
just to hurt China?

188
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,045
His team has developed a vaccine
they can inoculate themselves with.

189
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,962
Run. Get as far away
from Hong Kong as you can.

190
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,844
If you make it...

191
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,489
...I hope we meet again someday.

192
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,484
Now go.

193
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,848
- Who's the Arrow now, boy, huh?
- There he is.

194
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,841
Can't hide now, can you?

195
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,684
- I see you. I see you.
- Hey, baby.

196
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,169
How are you?

197
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,889
I told the guards I didn't wanna see you.

198
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,529
Why?

199
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,811
Roy, please.

200
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,202
Will you tell me what is going on?

201
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,685
When we got back together...

202
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,366
Hell, even before that. l...

203
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,684
I made a promise to myself
that I would never lie to you again.

204
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,085
Okay.

205
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,766
That's why I didn't wanna see you.

206
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,049
I didn't wanna break that promise.

207
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,771
Why would you?

208
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,600
- Roy.
- Thea.

209
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,688
Thea, please just...

210
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,286
...know that I'm gonna be fine.

211
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,648
Is that a lie?

212
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,926
Thea, don't worry.

213
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,771
Roy's not gonna be in there much longer.

214
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,202
I'm working on it. Bye.

215
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,965
- Roy holding up?
- For now.

216
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,565
Hot off the presses.

217
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,489
What are those?

218
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,251
I visited the bank today.
Ah, manager's a friend of mine.

219
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,887
I beat him at squash every Tuesday.
I took a few photos of the crime scene.

220
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,169
Photos is a bit reductive,
these are enhanced resonance scans.

221
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,642
It occurred to me that if we can't
see his face because of radiation...

222
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,087
...we need to remove the radiation.

223
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,725
Oh, I could kiss you right now.

224
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,486
Awkward, sorry. Boundaries.
Working on it.

225
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,244
So if we interlace the resonance scans'
frequency with our news footage,

226
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,447
we get this.

227
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,284
- There he is.
- Facial recognition?

228
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,169
Way ahead of you.

229
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,805
Jake Simmons, he's in the system. Serial
bank robber. Explains Starling National.

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,810
Last known address, Central City.

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,161
Where's he now?

232
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,445
He was last seen on a traffic camera
at the corner of Gantner and Yount.

233
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,689
There's a processing plant there.
He went in, never came out.

234
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,047
- On it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

235
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,040
I thought the point of this team-up was
you not being spotted out as a vigilante.

236
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,685
Stop calling it a team-up, Ray.

237
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,249
This Jake Simmons is not just a metahuman, he
is a killer and you're not ready for that.

238
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,841
I'm not gonna try to
equate our experiences...

239
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,523
...but superpowers are based in science,
and I am a man of science.

240
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,689
If there's any way to defeat this guy...

241
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,884
...I'm the one best able to figure it out.
Fine.

242
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,967
- The second you get in over your head...
- I'll run.

243
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,891
Fly. Probably.

244
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,167
How many abandoned warehouses
are in this city?

245
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,250
- No, no, I'm genuinely curious.
- Stay focused, Ray.

246
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,086
- Maybe Simmons isn't in there.
- You get this anxious when I'm in the field?

247
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,724
I can't think of an answer
that doesn't get me in trouble.

248
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,447
Still nothing.

249
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,525
Not a visual sighting or any reading
at all from the Atom.

250
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,610
When I say Atom, I mean the suit,
not myself in third person.

251
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,246
There's a decent chance
you and Palmer are related.

252
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,927
Well, that's equally fascinating
and terrifying.

253
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,450
Be my eyes, Ray. What's going on?

254
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,603
Oh, Tin Man. You shouldn't be here.

255
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,966
Actually, I should.

256
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,408
See, you're the bad guy, and I...

257
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,131
Ray?

258
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,402
Thanks for the top-off.

259
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,211
Ray?

260
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,811
Ray? Ray?

261
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,841
Oh, my God, Ray. Are you hurt?

262
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,283
Hurt would be a step or two up
from how I feel right now.

263
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,721
Wait, just a second.

264
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,641
You're lucky to have
gotten out of there alive.

265
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,446
It wasn't that bad, was it?

266
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,529
- It was way worse, Ray.
- Ray.

267
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,128
- I need shields.
- That's not the answer.

268
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,840
You need to anticipate your opponent.

269
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,844
You need to trust your instincts,
and not just your tech.

270
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,681
- My instinct is to trust my tech.
- When I'm on the field, my bow, my arrows...

271
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,241
...those are just tools.

272
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,209
- I'm the weapon.
- That's poetic.

273
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,083
My point is that if you rely on that suit
more than you rely on yourself...

274
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,885
...it's gonna get you killed.

275
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,530
- When will Shrieve distribute the virus?
- Don't know.

276
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,007
If he's gonna pin it on the Triad, he'll have
to do it soon. We need to get out of Hong Kong.

277
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,528
My contacts say
Shrieve has men everywhere.

278
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,724
Even more resources
at his disposal than Waller ever had.

279
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,361
Shrieve has ensured
we won't get off this island.

280
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,403
Alive.

281
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,250
Well, if we can't run...

282
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,847
- Waller said Shrieve had a vaccine.
- You wanna steal some?

283
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,003
He has to have it
somewhere in Hong Kong.

284
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,807
Get down!

285
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,920
Let's see how good you are
without your arrows.

286
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,446
Good enough.

287
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,646
Just remember...

288
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,047
...that was without arrows.

289
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,811
Get down on the floor!

290
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,169
Turn this place inside out.

291
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,449
We know how this guy
loves his secret hiding places.

292
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,167
Hey, Frank. What brings you out
of your downtown office?

293
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,641
Chief of D has asked me
to have a word with you.

294
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,002
Yeah? What about?

295
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,927
He wants to know why
you're going Ahab on Queen...

296
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,003
...when we got a different suspect
in custody.

297
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,004
We got a patsy in custody, trust me.
Queen is our guy.

298
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,685
There's no evidence against him.

299
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,850
- Why do you think I'm searching his condo?
- Friend to friend...

300
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,367
...you've come so far. You're a captain.

301
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,607
Don't throw all your hard work away
on something personal.

302
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,690
I don't know what it is you think
you're gonna find, but it's not here.

303
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,841
There's nothing here.

304
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,008
Like there was nothing
in the basement of your club?

305
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,845
You're either complicit
or the most naive girl I ever met.

306
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,204
You know that your brother is letting your
boyfriend rot in prison for his crimes, right?

307
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,002
Get out of my home.

308
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,128
I know you went to visit Harper
yesterday.

309
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,162
Does he even know why
he's throwing his life away?

310
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,401
Lance.

311
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,006
Is he all right?

312
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,682
All right, I'll be right there.

313
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,564
Your boyfriend was just attacked.

314
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,926
He's all right.

315
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,851
But I can't imagine it'll be the last time.

316
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,403
Your brother dropped a lot of bodies.

317
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,202
And when... Not if. When... Roy gets a shiv
in the back, that body will be on him too.

318
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,361
The suit recorded over 10 terabytes of
data, which were uploaded in real time...

319
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,410
...to a geosynchronous satellite.
That is a huge energy suck.

320
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,604
- Fascinating. How do we find Simmons?
- Light bulb. Literally.

321
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,451
No, actually, figuratively, ha.

322
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,808
Just before Simmons beat me...

323
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,088
...I blasted him with my
compressed light beams...

324
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,442
...and he thanked me for topping him off.

325
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,603
He absorbs energy,
turns it into weaponized plasma.

326
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,968
If we can link into the
city's power grid...

327
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,766
...we might track
where he's getting his extra juice.

328
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,929
Ollie!

329
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,603
- What's going on?
- It's Roy.

330
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,962
He was attacked by a bunch of inmates.

331
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,443
He's fine,
but there's hundreds of them in there.

332
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,126
- I'm gonna break him out.
- You could end up in a cell next to him.

333
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,130
If you know what's good for you,
you'll get out of my way.

334
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,120
Oliver, if you know what's good for you
and for Roy, you're gonna stay put.

335
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,521
- I can't do that.
- Listen.

336
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,809
- Get your hands off me.
- Listen, I know what you're going through.

337
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,487
You have to rely on Palmer to take care
of this meta while Roy sits in prison.

338
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,610
But listen to me, man.
You have to throttle this back, Oliver.

339
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,484
You have to.

340
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,006
If we lose everything...

341
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,322
I've already lost everything.

342
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,806
I am not gonna lose Roy.

343
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,362
- Oliver.
- I can't believe...

344
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,844
...you and Diggle are sitting on your hands
while Roy fights off all of Iron Heights.

345
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,209
- It's not that simple.
- No, Felicity, if anything was ever simple...

346
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,647
...it's this.
This what? You going to jail too?

347
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,329
I can't just do nothing.

348
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,208
I think John's right. I think you're struggling
with doing nothing. With Roy, with Ray.

349
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,161
But right now, you need people to help you.
You need to let them.

350
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,210
Maybe there is something more going on
with you than just what's happening...

351
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,885
...with Roy and this metahuman.

352
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,046
You have sacrificed everything
to be the Arrow.

353
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,202
Even you and me.

354
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,885
But...

355
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,330
...whether or not you break Roy out
of Iron Heights, there is no more Arrow.

356
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,881
Ra's took that from you.

357
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,766
I was told once that a man
cannot live by two names.

358
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,200
Well, right now I can't live by either.

359
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,562
So I don't know who I am.

360
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,921
I know who you are.

361
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,610
Whether you're in a suit or under a hood,
you're the man that I...

362
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,843
You're the man that I believe in.

363
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,762
Ray finished the transponder.
I have to upload it to a power source.

364
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,082
Hopefully it'll bring us right to Simmons.

365
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,287
I'll go with you.

366
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,128
It is adorable how you keep forgetting that
Lance is after you, but it's a quick errand.

367
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,126
And you need practice
in letting people help you.

368
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,286
You sure this is it?

369
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,807
It doesn't look like a typical Army base.

370
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,043
Matthew Shrieve isn't a typical
Army general, apparently.

371
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,846
Quiet.

372
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,407
Where's the vaccine?

373
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,725
You can end up unconscious
or you can end up dead.

374
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,163
Two lefts, second door on your right.

375
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,407
Good choice.

376
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,128
Company coming, 10 seconds.

377
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,685
Up there.

378
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,967
Thank you.

379
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,804
Can you give us a minute?

380
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,166
- I already signed my confession.
- Yeah, it's a hell of a story.

381
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,204
That stuff about setting up shop
under your girlfriend's club.

382
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,641
I like how you manage
not to implicate her.

383
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,129
- What are you doing here?
- Remember that, uh, corpse I showed you?

384
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,722
The one the Arrow killed? I knew you had
an obsession with the Arrow...

385
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,850
...and I was trying to wave you off,
because I knew somehow...

386
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,886
...that if you stayed obsessed with him,
that you would come to a bad end.

387
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,561
And here I am, two years later.
I'm still trying to save you, son.

388
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,210
I don't need saving.

389
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,602
You're doing this
because you think you owe Queen.

390
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,481
- But you don't. You don't deserve to be here.
- Patrol Officer Gabe Vincent.

391
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,684
He left behind a wife and 9-year-old boy.

392
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,087
I know.

393
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,484
I killed him.

394
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,528
I stabbed him in the chest with an arrow.

395
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,724
So don't think for a second
that I don't deserve to be here.

396
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,164
No. You don't think for a second
that what you're doing here...

397
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,362
...makes up for anything you did
out there.

398
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,090
Guard.

399
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,929
Perfect.

400
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,447
We have takeoff.

401
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,888
I'm sorry, miss, but I don't think
you're supposed to be here.

402
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,526
I'm supposed to access your grid
for the city.

403
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,285
Think you can help?

404
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,129
- Sure. It's this way.
- Thank you.

405
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,282
So, uh, what's with the sunglasses, man?

406
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,210
We're indoors and it's, well, night.

407
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,205
- Do you have a sensitivity to...
- To light?

408
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,805
No.

409
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,723
I love the light.

410
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,169
Think the plan to find Simmons
will work?

411
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,362
Well, it was Felicity's, so yes.

412
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,971
Except the tracking firmware
seems to be malfunctioning.

413
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,685
- What?
- It's not a malfunction.

414
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,685
It's Simmons.
He's drawing energy from a power station.

415
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,763
- Which one?
- The one Felicity just went to.

416
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,681
Come on, Felicity, pick up.

417
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,844
I'm sorry, but the blond
can't come to the phone at the moment.

418
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,686
- I swear to God, if you hurt her...
- You'll what?

419
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,167
Fly away again?

420
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,603
I am talking to the man in the suit, right?

421
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,409
The one who thinks a piece of scrap metal
makes him some kind of hero?

422
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,210
It doesn't.

423
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,210
I am sorry for the interruption.

424
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,811
Where were we?

425
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,042
Waiting for you to come closer.

426
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,170
- You can't go.
- It's Felicity.

427
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,729
You won't make it in time. The power station
is 8 minutes away going 60 on your Ducati.

428
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,043
- But the Atom can fly.
- You need more than your tech this time.

429
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,890
You're right.

430
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,567
My tech needs your instinct,
and maybe there's a way we can get it.

431
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,882
Okay, I'm entering the
power station now. Activate the link.

432
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,563
Ha, ha. It's working.

433
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,246
I'm just a passenger now. Oh!

434
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,447
Let's get this guy.

435
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,245
Sorry...

436
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,240
...but I have to kill you now.
- No, you're gonna leave her the hell alone.

437
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,127
Kick his ass.

438
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,127
You Okay?

439
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,889
- You gotta get out of here.
- No. I'm not gonna leave you here alone.

440
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,407
- Get her out.
- I'm not alone, but I can't fight him...

441
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,050
...and worry about you. Go.
No.

442
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,601
Felicity, go! Get out of here!

443
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,604
- Hope you played video games as a kid.
- I'm trying to concentrate.

444
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,569
Sorry. Just, I'm trusting you with my...

445
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,726
Ray, can you take this beating?
I can pull you back.

446
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,809
I'm fine, just get this bastard.

447
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,646
Ray, I've lost control.

448
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,851
My transmitter's been severed.

449
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,971
Get up.

450
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,287
Get up, Ray!

451
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,649
Fight back, Ray. Fight back!

452
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,241
- Ray!
- He's too strong.

453
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,169
This is not about strength.

454
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,481
This is about heart.

455
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,163
When the mayor was killed,
you put yourself at risk to save Felicity.

456
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,642
Normal people, they don't do that.
Heroes do that.

457
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,007
Come on, Ray.

458
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,161
Take him out, Ray.

459
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,365
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

460
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,010
No, it's totally worth it.

461
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,170
Are you okay? I was so worried.

462
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,807
I'm fine. Even/thing's okay now.

463
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,882
Eyes front, Harper.

464
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,891
I told you, eyes front.

465
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,811
My instincts are to swivel my head.
Won't happen again.

466
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,571
No, it won't.

467
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,250
Thea?

468
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,210
It's Roy.

469
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,891
Harper was killed an hour ago.

470
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,081
I'd say I'm sorry, but I think
we both know whose fault this is.

471
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,731
I shouldn't have listened to either of you.

472
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,923
I might not have been able to save Roy...

473
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,410
- ...but I'd feel better right now if I'd tried.
- We know that, Oliver.

474
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,604
We also know you may never forgive us.

475
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,127
I make my own choices, John.

476
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,161
I made this one.

477
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,328
He doesn't mean forgive us for that.

478
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,008
He means forgive us for this.

479
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,207
How?

480
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,607
Don't be mad at them, this was my idea.

481
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,129
If any one of us were in there,
Oliver would think of something.

482
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,481
You're right.

483
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,968
If one of us deserves to go to prison...

484
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,527
...it's me.
Roy, we can't allow you to do that.

485
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,043
- No way Oliver's going along with it.
- That's why you won't tell him.

486
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,329
You could have gotten yourself
killed for real.

487
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,167
I figured that I could hold off
until Dig's guys got into position.

488
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,207
One of Lyla's contacts,
an A.R.G.U.S. freelancer.

489
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,249
He has a special talent
for knifing people in just the right way.

490
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,046
Leaves a convincing amount of blood
without the kill.

491
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,842
He laces the blade with a beta blocker
to crawl the heartbeat.

492
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,366
Gives the illusion of death.

493
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,889
Everyone thinks the Arrow is dead.

494
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,560
Which means Oliver Queen is innocent.

495
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,247
You did all this without asking?

496
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,529
How many times
have you saved one of us without asking?

497
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,844
This time, we had to save you.

498
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,360
If everyone thinks you're dead...

499
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,250
...then what happens to Roy Harper?

500
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,246
Tell Thea... Well, tell her
I'm alive first, heh.

501
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,641
Then tell her I'm sorry
I had to leave without saying goodbye.

502
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,484
- I feel like you're throwing your life away.
- I'm not.

503
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,565
I'm starting a new one.

504
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,851
Anywhere, anytime...

505
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,365
...you need something, call me.

506
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,445
Take care of yourself, Roy.

507
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,529
I'll miss you most of all, Scarecrow.

508
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,723
Just be ready to get a million calls...

509
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,730
...on that untraceable satellite phone
I stashed in your bag.

510
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,087
Thank you.

511
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,606
Thank you.

512
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,766
So on a scale of one to 10,
how mad at us are you?

513
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,849
I need to learn to let people help me.

514
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,525
Yeah.

515
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,047
You could use some practice in that.

516
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,288
I just think sometimes
you're so focused on people you love...

517
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,326
...you forget to see
that there are people who love you.

518
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,005
Just enough inoculant for us.

519
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,847
And Akio.

520
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,884
- What about her?
- We need to inject Akio and ourselves.

521
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,566
Then the three of you
need to get somewhere safe.

522
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,371
- And what about you?
- I lifted this when I took the vaccine.

523
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,602
It belongs to one of Shrieve's men...

524
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,650
...because it has plans for how
they'll distribute the virus.

525
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,769
I'm gonna use it to stop them.

526
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,923
No, you won't.

527
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,160
- We are.
- Tatsu.

528
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,368
What example are we setting
for our son...

529
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,321
...if we have a hope to save millions
of innocent people but only save ourselves?

530
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,451
Listen, the two of you need to take care of
Akio. I am not gonna be responsible...

531
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,001
You need to learn to let people help you.

532
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,763
And Maseo and I are going to.

533
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,929
What about...

534
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,563
- ...Death bolt?
- Nice.

535
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,247
You know, you're the only other person
who's good at the names.

536
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,883
So, uh, how do they get fed,
and you know...

537
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,969
...complete the transaction, so to speak?

538
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,770
Cisco?

539
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,566
You said Simmons
was from Central City, right?

540
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,731
Yeah, last known address,
4160 Dixie Canyon. Why?

541
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,407
According to this,
Jake Simmons was a guest...

542
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,763
...of the Opal City Police Department
on December 11, 2013.

543
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,726
- Where do I know that date from?
- The date of the particle accelerator test.

544
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,083
But if Simmons wasn't in Central City...

545
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,329
...the night of the dark
matter explosion...

546
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,407
...then how can he be a metahuman?

547
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,050
Do you know who I am, child?

548
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,685
You're the Demon.

549
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,968
I am the Demon's Head.

550
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,280
As those were before me.

551
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,131
And very soon, your brother.

552
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,049
He will never take your place.

553
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,850
He Will.

554
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,361
Once I've given him sufficient motivation.

555
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,847
No, my brother's going to kill you.

556
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,166
No.

557
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,362
He's going to beg me.
