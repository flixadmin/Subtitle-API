3
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,208
This is an emergency meeting
of top-level leadership.

4
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,875
{\an8}Highest priority.

5
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,500
The Central Home Minister and
the Chief of RAW will also be joining us.

6
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,125
Subject, sir?

7
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,083
I believe it’s about Yethi.

8
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,916
As you know, we’re hosting
the Cricket World Cup this year.

9
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,750
The opening ceremony is next month.

10
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,791
Twelve teams
and leaders from three countries

11
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,041
will be our prestigious guests.

12
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,125
But…

13
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,208
there’s also trouble on the horizon.

14
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,166
{\an8}The gangster brothers, Daya and Yethi.

15
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,750
{\an8}Last month, Daya's account in Dubai

16
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,833
received funds
from various Arab countries.

17
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,916
Large amounts.

18
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:15,166
Daya and Yethi are plotting something
major at our event next month.

19
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:16,958
Intelligence indicates a severe threat.

20
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,791
Daya isn’t on our radar.

21
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,125
All his operations here
are controlled by his brother, Yethi.

22
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,333
We need to apprehend Yethi immediately.

23
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,375
Sir, Shivam is the task force head.

24
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,625
{\an8}- Sir!
- He's been monitoring

25
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,708
{\an8}Yethi's operations
for the past three years.

26
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,458
So, Shivam, what information
do you have on Yethi?

27
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,500
To be honest… nothing, sir.

28
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,916
I almost arrested Yethi three times
in the past three years,

29
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,625
but each time I received orders
from above that he shouldn’t be touched.

30
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,333
No, no.
This isn’t the time for blame games.

31
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:48,958
{\an8}Sorry, sir.

32
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,625
I’m granting you complete authority,
effective immediately. Go and get him.

33
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,750
For the past two months, none of his
gang members have surfaced, sir.

34
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,333
They may have gone underground
due to this operation.

35
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,458
{\an8}- Something has to be done immediately.
- Sir!

36
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,958
{\an8}The event is next month.

37
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,791
{\an8}We must catch Yethi before then,
or we’ll have to call off the event!

38
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,916
When we had Yethi in our hands,
we let him slip away.

39
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,875
Now we don’t even know his whereabouts.

40
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,583
Can’t we track down
at least one of his gang members?

41
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:24,916
We have a chance.

42
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,750
Yethi gang's number two. Rane!

43
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:28,875
He has a girlfriend.

44
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,166
{\an8}They were meeting regularly in Mahim
before he went underground.

45
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,291
{\an8}If we can get to her,
we might be able to locate him.

46
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,416
{\an8}Would he show up?

47
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,500
{\an8}There's a girl involved.
He might take a chance.

48
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,666
Can we trust the girl?

49
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,500
We assured her safety if she cooperates.

50
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,291
He will definitely come.

51
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:58,791
There he is.

52
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:09,958
Hi, baby!

53
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,416
- Now you remember me!
- Oh, my wild one!

54
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,500
- Do you miss me?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,000
Rane!

56
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,458
Shoot on the legs.

57
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,083
Come on, shoot on the legs, boys.

58
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,208
Tell us where Yethi is.

59
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,458
{\an8}Tell us.

60
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,416
{\an8}Tell us, I say.

61
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,458
{\an8}Tell us.

62
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,000
{\an8}Hey!

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,875
Where is Yethi?

64
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:25,791
I don't know.

65
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,666
{\an8}Since he won't open
his mouth about Yethi…

66
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,166
his tongue is of no use.

67
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,916
Speak up!

68
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,791
If we cut it off…

69
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,458
I will at least have some satisfaction.

70
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,833
- Tell me.
- He's gone to the South.

71
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,083
Near the Andhra, Tamil Nadu border…

72
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,875
There is a place called Ratnagiri.

73
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,833
There is a guy… Muruga,
a small-time smuggler.

74
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,791
He can transport goods not only
from the port but directly from the sea.

75
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,250
Three months ago,

76
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,875
Yethi went there.

77
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:06,750
Tell us!

78
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,541
He has not returned since then.

79
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,666
We have no information
on his whereabouts.

80
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,458
DSP Tulasi?

81
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:50,958
{\an8}Please sit.

82
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,583
{\an8}My name is Danny.

83
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,958
I am a Mumbai-based smuggler.

84
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,250
We are expecting a consignment by the sea.

85
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,000
We cannot receive it at the port.

86
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,000
We heard a smuggler called Muruga,

87
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,208
can bring in goods from the sea,
so, we came for him.

88
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,416
But when we reached here,
they said he was no more.

89
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,750
When we inquired about his inner circle,

90
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,708
we were told this area's DSP, Tulasi,
supported Muruga a lot.

91
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,875
You have earned quite a lot.

92
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,750
I want the same help
you extended to Muruga.

93
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,458
Quote your price.

94
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,791
Goods from the sea are neither brought

95
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,666
by Muruga…

96
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,708
nor me.

97
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,916
On the mountain that you see in the East,
there are four villages.

98
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,625
Those four villages together
are called the Red Sea.

99
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,166
They are the ones who actually bring
in goods from these waters.

100
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,083
Who do I meet there?

101
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,166
Bhaira.

102
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,666
I am also a cop.

103
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,958
You think I cannot recognize a fellow cop?

104
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:23,833
One more thing…

105
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,166
Be careful with the Red Sea people.

106
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,333
{\an8}Who are you? What do you need?

107
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:02,791
I need to meet Bhaira.

108
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,041
We are here from Mumbai on a job.

109
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,000
A job only you are capable of doing.

110
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,708
We have a delivery coming
from another country on a ship.

111
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,000
Mumbai is too challenging
to unload the cargo.

112
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,083
The ship will pass through
this area tomorrow night.

113
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:33,500
I know you can go into the sea
and unload the cargo discreetly.

114
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,416
We quit doing such jobs a long time ago.

115
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,708
That means you did it in the past.

116
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,833
So, start again.

117
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,750
I will pay you beyond your imagination.

118
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,833
I will cover your mountain in gold.

119
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,875
Listen to me
and go back to where you came from.

120
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,208
What's the matter?

121
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,833
Are you misinterpreting
my requests for pleading?

122
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,458
You are far away from civilization.

123
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,916
If I kill you right here, it will be ages
before the world learns about your death.

124
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:13,041
Before I see your blood,
just follow my orders.

125
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,666
Take what I give you.

126
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,458
You come to the Red Sea,

127
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,833
and threaten me of bloodshed?

128
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,458
Are you teaching us
about the dangers of death?

129
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,916
They definitely know about Yethi.

130
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,500
I have to find someone
who can give us the information.

131
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,416
You came to the mountain
and tried to scare them?

132
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,333
Who are you?

133
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:08,958
Singappa.

134
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,333
I live on the East side of the mountain
you just climbed down.

135
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,875
I have come here on a job.

136
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,041
You look like an elder.

137
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,458
Can you talk them into doing it?

138
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,666
Come.

139
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,583
Take the boat out, Naga.

140
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,583
What's the big deal
in knocking off some cargo?

141
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,250
This sea route is like a path
to a diamond mine.

142
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,458
Am I a fool to believe
you gave up everything?

143
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,166
Quote what you want
and how much you want.

144
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,000
I will give it to you.

145
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,500
You should convince them to do it.

146
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:50,833
What do you say?

147
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,250
You want it?

148
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,916
This is a very expensive diamond.

149
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,375
If you do as I say,

150
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,833
many such diamonds will be yours.

151
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:08,958
Check it out.

152
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:22,958
Sir…

153
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,458
Down there! Down there!

154
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,250
- Down there.
- What's down there, sir?

155
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,458
What's there, sir?

156
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,250
Could you find the diamond ring?

157
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,750
You saw something
terrifying in the sea,

158
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,250
that made you forget the ring.

159
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,416
It is out of this fright,

160
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:07,041
that no matter how many of you show up
and how much you tempt us,

161
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,500
the locals from here
won't meddle with the sea.

162
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,416
With my eyes closed or open,

163
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,125
I cannot unsee
what I saw in the sea.

164
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,166
Who were they?

165
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,583
Who is responsible for all this?

166
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,416
It's quite a long story, sir.

167
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,458
It's the story of a sea
turning red with blood.

168
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,541
Whose story is it?

169
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,125
The story of the rough waters
of the mighty sea…

170
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,750
on which he stood unshaken.

171
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,375
It's the story of our beloved "Devara."

172
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,375
To overcome fear,
you should listen to the story of God.

173
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,583
To understand fear, you should listen
to the story of Devara.

174
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,500
Many years ago,

175
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,416
behind that mountain,
existed a kingdom.

176
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,291
To conquer that kingdom,
the sea had to be crossed.

177
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,458
But a huge army was stationed
on the mountain.

178
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,041
A dynamic force specially chosen
by the king from across the country.

179
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,708
They had no caste. No religion.

180
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,708
They never knew fear.

181
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,291
Their God was their weapon.

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,541
And their weapon was courage.

183
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,250
Day and night, they were
watching the sea from the mountain.

184
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,333
As a testimony to the sea
reddened hundreds of times

185
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,375
<i>with the blood of the enemies…</i>

186
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,958
<i>this place came to be known</i>
<i>as the Red Sea.</i>

187
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,250
Ages passed.
Kingdoms disappeared.

188
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,208
When the white folks from
far-off lands were looting

189
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,375
and carrying our wealth away
across the ocean,

190
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,875
the army couldn't simply watch
and do nothing.

191
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,500
It's the story of that army ready
to do anything for our country, sir.

192
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,708
They ventured into the sea,
looted the ships,

193
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,208
and distributed the loot
back on this land.

194
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,208
After the British left,

195
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,375
the country didn't need the brave warriors
from the mountain anymore.

196
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,458
There was nobody
to care for them.

197
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,916
These keen warriors…

198
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,958
became an opportunity
for someone.

199
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:03,208
{\an8}<i>To use their strength</i>
<i>in fearlessly taming the sea,</i>

200
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,708
<i>a few had flocked to our mountain.</i>

201
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,208
Very unlikely of you

202
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,583
to be worried sick like this.
What's up, Muruga?

203
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:16,916
It's a full moon night, Tulasi.

204
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,000
The sea is raging.

205
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,333
I am worried if they can make it…

206
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,583
Whether the sea
is calm or raging,

207
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,416
when we have a brave warrior
ready to confront it,

208
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,875
why should you worry, Muruga?

209
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,416
<i>Devara! Devara!</i>

210
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,000
<i>Devara! Devara!</i>

211
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,708
<i>Devara! Devara!</i>

212
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,666
Hello, sir!

213
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,500
Indian Coast Guard,
Eastern Regional Officer, Irfan.

214
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,333
Ethan's Captain, John.

215
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,916
Warrant to search the ship.

216
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,291
We have information
that some illegal weapons

217
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,833
and ammunition
are coming from Russia.

218
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,541
Help us to search your vessel.

219
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,416
I see our cargo. Let's go.

220
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:32,958
Sugar, sir.

221
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,083
Why are the locks open?

222
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,208
All in all,
there must be ten officers, Devara.

223
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,041
There is no other way.

224
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,750
<i>The smuggler gangs</i>
<i>from foreign countries,</i>

225
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:50,083
<i>who found it difficult to get</i>
<i>their cargo through the port,</i>

226
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:54,708
<i>knew the strength of these men and</i>
<i>used them to get it directly from the sea.</i>

227
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,166
<i>Every village had</i>
<i>its unique strength.</i>

228
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:06,375
<i>All the four villages got together</i>
<i>and challenging the Red Sea itself,</i>

229
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,500
<i>took up this dangerous mission.</i>

230
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,958
Kids shouldn't be
involved in this job.

231
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,458
Devara has addressed this
with you on several occasions, Bhaira.

232
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:28,291
My land, my people, and my rules.

233
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:31,083
I have made this clear just
as many times, Rayappa.

234
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:37,666
- Count it.
- It must be right.

235
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,000
If you eat at this hour of the day,

236
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:01,958
how will the food nourish you?

237
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,125
Forget that.

238
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,166
If you stay up so late,

239
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:09,000
don't you see how unhealthy that is?

240
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,750
I have seen it all.

241
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,416
That's why I can't sleep unless I see you.

242
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:19,250
With these eyes,
I witnessed my father's death.

243
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,208
I saw your father's passing too.

244
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,291
I watched my siblings die…

245
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,541
and the death of
all my close ones.

246
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,625
How unlucky I am!

247
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,541
I spent all my life
closely watching death.

248
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,583
I can't do this anymore, son.

249
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,833
Either you should
see my death next…

250
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,083
or I should get to see you every day.

251
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:44,875
Now that I've seen you,

252
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,375
I can sleep peacefully.

253
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Is Vara asleep?

254
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:59,666
Your mom doesn't fall asleep
until she catches a glimpse of you.

255
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:03,500
Vara won't sleep until he
hears a story from you, will he?

256
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,750
It was raining very
heavily that day.

257
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:15,500
The British ransacked
all our treasures

258
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,041
and were getting away in a ship.

259
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:21,916
My father…

260
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,291
Your grandfather…

261
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,666
- gathered all our people in a ship…
- Oh, my!

262
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,000
Stop it, Father.

263
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,125
You always narrate your
father's or his father's story.

264
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,000
I want to know
my father's story.

265
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,583
Tell me Devara's story.

266
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:53,458
Your father's story is not worth sharing
with the next generation.

267
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:00,416
My father's is a story of valor
and honor, of a fight for our country.

268
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,041
Ours…

269
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,083
are dark stories that
cannot be shared.

270
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,000
Yes, we are barely living.

271
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,958
Whether our lives
will change enough

272
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,083
to become great stories
for future generations,

273
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,458
is something even I don't know.

274
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,250
How are you, son?

275
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,375
Yes, I am good. How are you?

276
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:32,375
I am fine.

277
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,875
Greetings, Devara.

278
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,125
Hey, how are studies going?

279
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,416
I am studying well, Devara.

280
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,958
I will be done in two years.

281
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,458
Then I will return
and start teaching here, Devara.

282
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,166
Please take this.

283
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:52,375
We have a lot of help from
you already. I can't accept this.

284
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,208
Don't call this help, Ademma.

285
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,208
This is our responsibility.

286
00:30:57,708 --> 00:31:00,458
Your husband was
one of us on the sea.

287
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,291
We lost him to the same sea.

288
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,166
His family is now our family.

289
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,875
Please accept this.

290
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,125
After his father passed,

291
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,708
though he was keen on venturing
into the sea with you,

292
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:23,750
I disapproved
and sent him out to study instead.

293
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,000
For understanding me, helping me out,

294
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,166
and being a great support,
I'm much obliged, Devara.

295
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,791
He is your son, Ademma.

296
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,250
He should become
what you want him to.

297
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:37,916
He will be exactly that.

298
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,750
It's Ayudha puja tomorrow.

299
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,791
I wonder who will win
the competition this time,

300
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,166
and take home the weapons.

301
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,750
Devara will win again if he wishes to

302
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,916
or he will voluntarily lose
if he wants someone else to win.

303
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,875
You can root for
whoever you want,

304
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,541
but it's my father,
Bhaira who will triumph.

305
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,916
This time the weapons
shall come to our village.

306
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,958
If Devara wants the weapons
to go to your village,

307
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,208
only then will Bhaira win.

308
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,125
Is that so?

309
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,458
Let's find out the winner right away.
Come on, Vara.

310
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,666
Go on, Vara.

311
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,541
You show him who
Devara really is. Go.

312
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:19,791
Come on, you.

313
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,333
Pasura, knock him down.

314
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:22,708
- Hit him, Vara.
- Hit him!

315
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,208
Strike at him. Pound him.

316
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,750
- Hit him well, Pasura.
- Go for it, Vara.

317
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,250
Yes, Pasura, that's right.
Hit him hard.

318
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,166
Knock him down, Pasura.
Strike at him.

319
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,875
- Pasura, pin him down.
- Hit him, Vara.

320
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,583
- Hit him, Vara. Go for it.
- Knock him down.

321
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,500
Pasura, that's right. Hit him hard.

322
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,958
Just like that, strike at him, Pasura.

323
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:46,625
Hit him hard. Knock him down, Pasura.

324
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,791
Beat him. Yes, take him down.

325
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:01,458
Didn't I tell you?

326
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,958
No matter who is in the arena,
the winner will be Bhaira.

327
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:49,500
What happened?

328
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,166
Devara is here.

329
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:04,541
<i>The Red Sea swells up</i>
<i>And gets boisterous with a roar</i>

330
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,875
<i>The warriors of the land</i>
<i>Celebrate their valor today</i>

331
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
<i>The waves of blood from clanging swords</i>
<i>Pounce like a tempest off our legion</i>

332
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:17,458
<i>Hey, the salty air</i>
<i>Has turned burning hot</i>

333
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:21,000
<i>Hey, the sound of drums rent the skies</i>

334
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,458
<i>The tiger's heirs</i>
<i>Sway like possessed</i>

335
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:28,125
<i>As the rebellious land</i>
<i>Rises in a dance of ecstasy</i>

336
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:32,291
<i>Today is the day</i>
<i>To worship the weapons we wield</i>

337
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:36,333
<i>Let us tap our shoulders</i>
<i>And celebrate the fair</i>

338
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,333
<i>It's a fete of warring brave hearts</i>
<i>Let's give them a welcome…</i>

339
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:44,083
<i>With warm blood coursing through</i>
<i>March ahead, our warrior</i>

340
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:18,000
<i>- This is a tradition</i>
<i>- Breaching it is desecration</i>

341
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:24,500
<i>- It's a family for whom war is life</i>
<i>- The sea and the time stand witness</i>

342
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:28,083
<i>The sacrifices by our mothers</i>
<i>Are the breast milk that blesses us</i>

343
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:31,625
<i>Making this body shape into a weapon</i>

344
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:35,125
<i>Self-esteem that refuses to surrender</i>
<i>Dictates the boundaries</i>

345
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:38,666
<i>The chronicles of our ancestors</i>
<i>Are radiant like a glorious history</i>

346
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:42,166
<i>This day that comes</i>
<i>Every year is meant for us</i>

347
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:45,750
<i>The stroking of our mustache</i>
<i>Is our message to the world</i>

348
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:49,875
<i>Today is the day</i>
<i>To worship the weapons we wield</i>

349
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,958
<i>Let us tap our shoulders</i>
<i>And celebrate the fair</i>

350
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:57,000
<i>It's a fete of warring brave hearts</i>
<i>Let's give them a welcome</i>

351
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:01,833
<i>With warm blood coursing through</i>
<i>March ahead, our warrior</i>

352
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:18,666
<i>The Red Sea swells up</i>
<i>And gets boisterous with a roar</i>

353
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,250
<i>The warriors of the land</i>
<i>Celebrate their valor today</i>

354
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:28,000
<i>The waves of blood from clanging swords</i>
<i>Pounce like a tempest off our legion</i>

355
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:34,666
It's time for the battle.
Women and kids should leave.

356
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:48,625
All of us know the village that wins
the battle gets the ancestral weapons.

357
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,791
They have been in Devara's
possession for a long time.

358
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,333
Let us see who gets them this year.

359
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,583
Let me remind you of
the battle rules once again.

360
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,416
Only two warriors from each
village can get into the arena.

361
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,958
The last man standing
shall be the winner.

362
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,791
Are you ready?

363
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,166
We are just four villages.

364
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,333
Instead of this contest,

365
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:13,250
why don't we allow each village to
possess the weapons each year?

366
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:17,208
Rayappa's village hasn't
seen weapons for years now.

367
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,375
I would like them to get
the weapons this time.

368
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:27,083
Do you think our ancestors were fools

369
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:30,250
to introduce this custom, Devara?

370
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:33,666
For our ancestors,
war was a livelihood.

371
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:39,208
They introduced such customs to
intensify the spirit of fighting, Bhaira.

372
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:41,916
It has been a long-standing tradition.

373
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,666
We must go for the battle.

374
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:49,041
What about Rayappa's village that
can only row boats and not fight battles?

375
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,041
If the weapons go
to their village at least once,

376
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,875
they too will be benefited, Bhaira.

377
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,916
Winning has become a habit for you,
so if it bothers you so much,

378
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,041
win them again
and give them to Rayappa, Devara.

379
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,500
Let's begin.

380
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:30,125
Sura! Sura!

381
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,791
- Sura! Sura!
- Dega!

382
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:34,666
- Sura! Sura!
- Dega! Dega!

383
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,375
- Sura! Sura!
- Dega! Dega!

384
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,041
- Sura! Sura!
- Dega! Dega!

385
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:43,833
- Sura! Sura!
- Dega! Dega!

386
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,750
- Hit him hard.
- Dega! Dega!

387
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,916
Dega! Dega!

388
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,625
One man down from the West side.

389
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,791
Kunjara! Kunjara!

390
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:59,166
Kunjara! Kunjara!

391
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,875
Kunjara! Kunjara!

392
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:10,666
Kunjara!

393
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,125
Kunjara! Kunjara!

394
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,541
One man down
from the North side.

395
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,291
Bhaira! Bhaira!

396
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:40,791
Bhaira! Bhaira!

397
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:47,208
Bhaira! Bhaira!

398
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,708
Hit him!
Knock him down!

399
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:08,458
Bhaira! Bhaira!

400
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,541
Come on!

401
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,375
Kunjara!

402
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:35,375
Both the contenders
from the West side have now lost.

403
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:41,416
- Bhaira! Bhaira!
- Bhaira! Bhaira!

404
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,500
- Devara! Devara!
- Devara! Devara!

405
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:50,375
- Devara! Devara!
- Devara! Devara!

406
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:56,625
- Devara! Devara!
- Devara! Devara!

407
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:43,916
- Devara! Devara!
- Devara! Devara!

408
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:50,125
- Devara! Devara!
- Devara! Devara!

409
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:57,583
Bhaira!

410
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,458
- Devara! Devara!
- Devara! Devara!

411
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:06,500
- Devara! Devara!
- Devara! Devara!

412
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:11,791
- Devara! Devara!
- Devara! Devara!

413
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:40,041
- Devara! Devara!
- Devara! Devara!

414
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,583
- Bhaira! Bhaira!
- Bhaira! Bhaira!

415
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:36,500
- Bhaira! Bhaira!
- Bhaira! Bhaira!

416
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:40,750
- Bhaira! Bhaira!
- Bhaira! Bhaira!

417
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:58,666
<i>Along with the four villages,</i>
<i>maybe even the sun was curious to see</i>

418
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,541
<i>which of these two warriors</i>
<i>would emerge as the winner.</i>

419
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:08,916
<i>By the time the crimson sun rose,</i>
<i>the two had turned red from blood.</i>

420
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,875
- Bhaira!
- Devara! Devara!

421
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:18,041
Devara! Devara!

422
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:46,041
If Devara requests you,
it means he has ordered you.

423
00:45:48,166 --> 00:45:49,125
Rayappa…

424
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,875
I had a nightmare last night, Jogula.

425
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:47,416
The sea had gone red again
turning into an actual Red Sea.

426
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:53,791
And it was I who made it so.

427
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:57,416
The days to come are
not auspicious, Devara.

428
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:02,125
Not everybody you think
is yours is trustworthy.

429
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:07,333
You must be all eyes
and be very cautious, Devara.

430
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,625
I went home for Ayudha puja.

431
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,333
- I'm returning to college now.
- Oh, is it?

432
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,291
How did the ritual go?

433
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:21,333
It was good.

434
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,375
My Sivudu is no more, Devara.

435
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,916
He was on his way to the town

436
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,333
when they blew up
the bus he was on.

437
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:22,500
I thought he would come back
after finishing his studies.

438
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:25,166
This is how he came back.

439
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,708
Instead of going away to study,

440
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:38,666
had he followed his heart
and took to the sea with you,

441
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,250
he'd still be alive.

442
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,125
I am the reason
for my son's death.

443
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:59,166
We must have some
past-life connection.

444
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:02,666
Because of your association with me,
my business is booming.

445
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:07,166
That's why it's about
time you increase the pay.

446
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,000
Two bags for each village.

447
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,458
Have I ever denied your request?

448
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:15,916
In two days' time,

449
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:19,125
the ship with our cargo
is crossing the Red Sea.

450
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,291
Those goods are highly valuable.

451
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:26,166
The coast guard has tightened
the security on the sea.

452
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,916
We somehow managed to escape
the last time.

453
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,791
It's best we take a break for a while.

454
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,833
Is this really Devara talking?

455
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,208
How come you are scared, Devara?

456
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,125
I am not scared.

457
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,291
I am saying we
need to be cautious.

458
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:45,333
The ship has already set sail, Devara.

459
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:46,625
How can you refuse to go now?

460
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:51,708
It would be dangerous if all of us got
caught with the consignment, Muruga.

461
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:56,708
We already know it is dangerous
but we do it anyway.

462
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,750
What is this strange talk, Devara?

463
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:02,125
If something happens to one person,

464
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,833
the rest of us will stand by his family.

465
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:06,958
But if it turns out bad for all of us…

466
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,666
who will stand with our families, Bhaira?

467
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:14,666
In that case,
we will go this time, Devara.

468
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:18,208
If something happens to us,
you will protect this mountain, won't you?

469
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:22,958
Let's go, guys.

470
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:27,333
Send us a note with details of the ship
and the arrangement of its cargo, Muruga.

471
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:48,250
Though you have objected,
they seem ready to get into the sea.

472
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:50,750
But if you come along,

473
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,333
we know we all will return safely.

474
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:55,833
Give it a thought, Devara.

475
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,625
Come on!

476
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:45,541
Where are you coming
from at this hour?

477
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:47,000
{\an8}We went hunting, sir.

478
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:48,291
{\an8}To hunt fish, sir.

479
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:52,958
{\an8}All the heroes went together
yet not much of a catch today.

480
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:56,666
I mean, the fish.

481
00:51:58,958 --> 00:51:59,958
{\an8}We went in a
different direction.

482
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:01,541
We couldn't catch much.

483
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,416
It's already quite late, sir.

484
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,291
It's the usual time for sharks to come.

485
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,875
We better leave.

486
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:12,416
You should too.

487
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:38,083
{\an8}Sir, there are bigger fish in here.

488
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:58,916
Illegal weapons, grenades,
and material to make bombs.

489
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,500
This is what you are
transporting over the Red Sea.

490
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:04,458
Do you have any idea where it
goes and how many lives are lost?

491
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,000
This sea is a border
to our country.

492
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:13,041
Whenever there was danger
across this sea, for our land,

493
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:16,625
{\an8}your ancestors struck
it down making this sea

494
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,833
{\an8}red and I grew up listening
to their stories.

495
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:21,708
But today the country faces danger

496
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,875
from you, who are their descendants
and from this Red Sea.

497
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:27,708
It's not like
I am unaware of your heists.

498
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's the tale of your forefathers
guarding the sea that has inspired me

499
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,666
to take up this job
of watching over the sea.

500
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:39,708
Considering you're their clan resorting
to petty thefts for your survival

501
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,750
I remained silent,
which was my biggest mistake.

502
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:45,416
Do you know how many hands
your smuggled

503
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,208
goods change,
and how many lives they take?

504
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,708
<i>Had I managed to stop you</i>
<i>two months ago,</i>

505
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,083
<i>I would've saved hundreds of lives</i>
<i>lost because of that consignment.</i>

506
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,833
Even a kid from your own village
lost his life there.

507
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:36,333
{\an8}This is what I feel when I look at you.

508
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:39,208
{\an8}The stories we heard
of those great warriors

509
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:41,125
{\an8}were either made up

510
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,750
{\an8}or you are not
from their bloodline.

511
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:46,333
Guard your tongue, sir.

512
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,458
Not tongue.

513
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,875
I am saying our country should be guarded.

514
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:02,250
{\an8}Okay, sir. Okay, copy that.

515
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:07,375
Sir, we've just received a message.

516
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,708
You have been blessed with a daughter.

517
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:15,250
A fresh life might have arrived
in this place full of monsters.

518
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,833
But I am not sure
how long it will survive.

519
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,375
Unless these beasts are
locked up permanently,

520
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:26,541
human beings cannot survive.

521
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,625
Devara…

522
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:40,458
Hey…

523
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:44,250
Stop it.

524
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:20,750
Let's go, guys.

525
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:22,875
{\an8}Take the cargo along with you.

526
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:36,875
Keep breathing, sir.

527
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,291
You have to go see your child.

528
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:44,458
You said your baby will not survive
in this land of beasts.

529
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:47,125
I swear on the weapons
that we worship…

530
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:52,250
I will let no harm from
the Red Sea reach any child.

531
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:55,416
This is Devara's promise. Trust me.

532
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:57,666
Believe me.

533
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:20,291
What happened?

534
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:22,750
It is not my blood.

535
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,666
But someone else's.

536
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,208
Hey, Devara.

537
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:33,833
Did Devara also
go with you guys?

538
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,750
I knew you were all on one team.

539
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:44,166
Do your counting
and pick up your cargo, Muruga.

540
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:46,625
What's inside, Muruga?

541
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:47,958
Hand it to me.

542
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,041
What's inside?

543
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:58,333
That's one question I told
you not to ask me, Devara.

544
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,125
Weapons.

545
01:00:02,791 --> 01:00:04,625
Just like the weapons you have.

546
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:06,666
But the latest ones.

547
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:09,916
Load the goods.

548
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,416
You will not move the goods.

549
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:16,750
Hey, what's wrong, Devara?

550
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:18,833
What is it?

551
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:20,500
Do you want more money?

552
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,458
I will pay you double
if that's what you want.

553
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
What do you mean we
can't move the goods?

554
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,875
We brought the goods
that killed our boy.

555
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:32,000
How many more kids
might we have killed?

556
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:36,333
You said there are weapons
in this like the ones we have.

557
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:42,750
Our weapons were made
to protect good from evil.

558
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:47,166
These weapons have been made
to kill the innocent.

559
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,375
You are talking too much.

560
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:54,791
Load the goods in the vehicle
and go to your wife and kids.

561
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,750
Forget about the goods
and you go do the same!

562
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,916
All these years,
I gave them whatever they asked for.

563
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,458
Now he is taking me for granted. Yes?

564
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:14,625
From now on, we are going
to get huge shipments, Devara.

565
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:18,125
Be frank and ask me what you want.

566
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:23,583
If your men or you approach
us for this work again,

567
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,916
even your dead bodies
will not leave this mountain.

568
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,208
This is Devara's word.

569
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,083
If it's all about your words,

570
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:43,625
then what about ours, Devara?

571
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:49,708
Just because the coast guard
blabbered something,

572
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:52,125
are we going to give up our work?

573
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,708
We must go into the sea.

574
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:57,833
We must conquer the sea.

575
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:00,791
I have told you already, Muruga.

576
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:03,625
Whether anyone likes it or not…

577
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:07,166
Whether they participate or not…
This line of work will not stop.

578
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,291
You said you will bring
much bigger consignments.

579
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:14,000
Even if it means people
dying because of them,

580
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:17,375
or killing a number
of people to get them…

581
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:19,375
This mountain is always ready.

582
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,916
Despite knowing what we do is wrong,

583
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,666
I believed that we did it only
to make our ends meet.

584
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:35,041
But I just realized
that these wrongdoings

585
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:38,375
have strongly seeped into our blood.

586
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,375
We should get rid
of this filthy blood!

587
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,500
We must know
how dishonorable this work is!

588
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,375
All that a man needs is
enough courage to live.

589
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:32,625
Not the courage to kill.

590
01:04:34,166 --> 01:04:37,833
If you disregard my word
and still choose to gather that courage,

591
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,416
I will become a terror
that kills that courage.

592
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:46,333
If Devara requests you,
it means he has ordered you.

593
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:50,083
And if he actually orders you…

594
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,208
<i>All hail!</i>

595
01:04:58,416 --> 01:04:59,875
<i>All hail!</i>

596
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,500
<i>All hail!</i>

597
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:07,000
From today, we will go into the sea
only for fishing.

598
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,416
<i>It's the great ocean</i>
<i>The other side…</i>

599
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:13,125
<i>Burst into flames</i>
<i>The expansive sky</i>

600
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,916
<i>Atrocities come</i>
<i>To a halt…</i>

601
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,375
<i>Fizzled out, the evil adamance</i>

602
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:20,583
<i>On the path of war</i>

603
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,875
<i>The chief marches forward</i>

604
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:26,125
<i>Teaching fear…</i>

605
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:29,083
<i>He draws a line for his army</i>

606
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:31,791
<i>O' courage, ready to leap! Careful!</i>

607
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:34,458
<i>Don't you dare…</i>
<i>Don't you dare come face to face</i>

608
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:37,083
<i>What are you before Devara?</i>

609
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,750
<i>Hide yourself…</i>

610
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:41,958
<i>Time has faltered</i>

611
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:45,083
<i>The swelling tides have paused</i>

612
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:50,458
<i>Lives have run helter-skelter</i>
<i>And vanished into burrows</i>

613
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:53,083
<i>O' courage, ready to leap! Careful!</i>

614
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:55,750
<i>All hail! All hail the tiger!</i>

615
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:58,416
<i>What are you before Devara?</i>

616
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,041
<i>Oh, hail him! Devara!</i>

617
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,500
If your son had stayed with Devara,

618
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,791
you said he would still be alive.

619
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:11,916
You sent him far from here
and blamed yourself for his death.

620
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:19,666
The explosives that killed your son
were brought by us from the Red Sea.

621
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:24,083
You were not responsible for his death.

622
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:28,000
It was me.

623
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:32,708
I don't have the courage
to look into your eyes and say this.

624
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:34,750
Hence, I am looking down at your feet.

625
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:40,500
I cannot fix my mistake
and bring your son back to life but…

626
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:46,958
I will make sure nobody
faces such loss again.

627
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,583
<i>All hail!</i>

628
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,291
<i>All hail!</i>

629
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:55,958
<i>All hail!</i>

630
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:00,500
<i>Why harm the world?</i>

631
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,708
<i>Why face Devara's wrath?</i>

632
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:06,875
<i>When he comes down as war</i>
<i>It's all destruction</i>

633
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:11,083
<i>A miracle invisible to the eye</i>

634
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:14,416
<i>Acts as the guardian of the sea</i>

635
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:17,500
<i>When you defy destiny, it's a tragedy</i>

636
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:25,291
<i>Hey, the waters in red wash his feet</i>

637
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:30,541
<i>His very arrival like a deluge</i>
<i>Is a proclamation in itself</i>

638
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:35,833
<i>Devara's silence is a</i>
<i>Warning unamendable</i>

639
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:41,166
<i>His burning anger</i>
<i>Makes even death sweat in fear</i>

640
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,750
<i>O, courage, ready to leap! Careful!</i>

641
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:46,500
<i>Don't you dare…</i>
<i>Don't you dare come face to face</i>

642
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:49,125
<i>What are you before Devara?</i>

643
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:51,791
<i>Hide yourself…</i>

644
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:54,125
<i>Time has faltered</i>

645
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:57,166
<i>The swelling tides have paused</i>

646
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:02,541
<i>Lives have run helter-skelter</i>
<i>And vanished into burrows</i>

647
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:05,166
<i>O, courage, ready to leap! Careful!</i>

648
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,833
<i>All hail! All hail the tiger!</i>

649
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:10,500
<i>What are you before Devara?</i>

650
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:13,250
<i>All hail the king…</i>

651
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:23,750
<i>To face Devara, who was preventing</i>
<i>wrongful activities on the sea,</i>

652
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,083
<i>Bhaira found a solution in the sea itself.</i>

653
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,500
Why did you do such a thing?

654
01:08:57,958 --> 01:08:59,791
Did I not come across
your mind even once?

655
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:06,791
When I hear about how much you
struggle to get this blind sister married,

656
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:09,041
I am not able to live with it, brother.

657
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:11,958
If I am dead,

658
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,583
you may grieve me for a few days.

659
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:19,750
But I won't be a burden
to you anymore, brother.

660
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:21,083
How can you be a burden to me?

661
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,416
I will take care
of you all my life…

662
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,166
We will take care of her, Rayappa.

663
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:31,666
I want to get your sister married
to my younger brother.

664
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:36,458
Bhaira…

665
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,208
Are you serious?

666
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:42,333
Your family is my family too, Rayappa.

667
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:48,166
Without further delay,
make the arrangements, Rayappa.

668
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:54,125
What Devara did on the mountain
is still driving us mad!

669
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:57,000
And here you are negotiating a
wedding and celebrating it, Bhaira!

670
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,833
We will not be able
to stand Devara at the wedding.

671
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:04,875
We have tolerated him all this while.

672
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:06,958
Won't you at least
have a last look at him?

673
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:17,125
In fact, true celebrations will begin
with his death at this wedding.

674
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:27,625
You want to confront Devara and kill him?

675
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:32,000
Even before he could
get a proper mustache,

676
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:34,208
Devara ripped apart
a shark in the sea

677
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:35,958
and dragged it to the shore.

678
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,791
As long as he is conscious,
no one would dare

679
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:44,958
go near and touch him, Bhaira.

680
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:52,916
Oh! Rayappa!

681
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,458
Come in.

682
01:10:58,041 --> 01:10:59,916
My younger sister's wedding
has been fixed, Devara.

683
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,916
You mean Padma's?

684
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,125
Who is the groom?

685
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:07,041
Bhaira's brother.

686
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:10,875
He was generous enough
to come home with the proposal.

687
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,750
You have come bearing
such great news, Rayappa!

688
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
When is the wedding?

689
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:18,583
We are planning it
for the day after tomorrow.

690
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,833
She holds you
in higher regard than me.

691
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:25,708
Don't worry about Bhaira.
All of you should come.

692
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:27,416
She is like a sister to me, Rayappa.

693
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:28,958
Don't be so formal
with your invitation.

694
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,666
I will be there
to send her off heartily.

695
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:11,666
Devara?

696
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,916
- They look good as a couple.
- Yes.

697
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,583
They complement each other, right?

698
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,708
What's up, Thanga?
What are you looking at?

699
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:40,083
Do you want to get married too?

700
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,000
There are many suitable matches
for you around here.

701
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:46,041
Let us know if you like somebody.
I will marry you off on the same stage.

702
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,833
With so many suitors around,
why are you eyeing my husband?

703
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,875
What is this? What's with the distance?

704
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:12,833
Devara came as soon as I invited him.

705
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:17,250
He came in the end
like a distant relative.

706
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:20,375
Kept himself distant too.

707
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,708
We considered you family
and came early.

708
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,333
We have downed three pots already.

709
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:29,041
Whatever I did is
for our own good.

710
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,541
This is not our only way to live.

711
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:38,416
If we put our heads together,
we will find ample other ways.

712
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:43,333
Please listen to me
this one time, Bhaira.

713
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:47,000
As long as you live,

714
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:49,875
this mountain shall obey
only your orders, Devara.

715
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:54,375
It's a promise from me.

716
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:15,458
Devara is dancing at
your wedding, Padma.

717
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:54,166
Devara…

718
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:39,708
How many outsiders are expected?

719
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:42,416
Apparently up to fifty.
Since it's Devara…

720
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,333
Do you think they can do it?

721
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:46,416
Hey, Devara is completely drunk.

722
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,333
You don't need
to fight him to kill.

723
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:50,833
Once he gets intoxicated
and collapses, just kill him.

724
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:00,750
Bhaira, what's going on?

725
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:03,000
I heard them say wicked things.

726
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,166
He is the one
with wicked words and wicked actions.

727
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,458
This is not right, Kunjara.

728
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:10,708
It's our Devara.

729
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:15,750
As long as I am alive,
I won't let this happen.

730
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,041
If this wedding is called off,
your sister won't stay alive.

731
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,458
Devara's life…

732
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:25,000
or your sister's life?

733
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:34,250
If you remain silent
just for tonight,

734
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:39,208
tomorrow… you can cry
over his corpse for a while.

735
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:46,458
Or your sister will die and you will
end up crying every day, Rayappa.

736
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:53,750
Tell him that a gang at Mandapala shore
is secretly setting out to loot.

737
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,291
Make sure he leaves from here.

738
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:20,208
Hey, Rayappa. Come and join me.

739
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:25,083
Why the tears, Rayappa?

740
01:19:27,541 --> 01:19:30,666
You must bid goodbye
to your sister with happiness.

741
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:34,000
Isn't this what we have
all been waiting for?

742
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:39,958
With the wedding happening here,

743
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:44,500
some of our men are ready to venture
into the sea without being noticed.

744
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:49,750
They are setting out
from the Mandapala shore.

745
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:08,833
<i>The sea is full of blood</i>
<i>It's his Red Sea</i>

746
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:25,666
<i>All hail! All hail the tiger!</i>

747
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:33,750
<i>The sea is full of blood</i>
<i>It's his Red Sea</i>

748
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:38,250
<i>All hail! All hail the tiger!</i>

749
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:39,250
<i>You never touch the sea</i>

750
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:43,666
<i>You never play with me</i>

751
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:48,000
<i>I'll never show you mercy</i>

752
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:50,125
<i>I'll never…</i>

753
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,750
<i>I had a nightmare last night, Jogula.</i>

754
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:58,583
<i>The sea had gone red again</i>
<i>turning into an actual Red Sea.</i>

755
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:02,708
<i>And it was I who made it so.</i>

756
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:11,708
<i>The sea is full of blood</i>
<i>It's his Red Sea</i>

757
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:15,875
<i>All hail! All hail the tiger!</i>

758
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:20,041
<i>The sea is full of blood</i>
<i>It's his Red Sea</i>

759
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:24,250
<i>All hail! All hail the tiger!</i>

760
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:26,833
Eyes that knew
nothing but courage,

761
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,333
for the first time ever,

762
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:32,541
were filled with fear.

763
01:26:35,666 --> 01:26:37,666
Were those the dead bodies
that I saw in the sea?

764
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:36,833
Dear…

765
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:41,583
Get up.

766
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:42,708
Oh, my…

767
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:45,166
Dear…

768
01:27:45,791 --> 01:27:46,666
Kora…

769
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,208
Kora…

770
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:56,541
Has Devara killed them?

771
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:58,333
Has he killed them all?

772
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:29,833
{\an8}<i>I thought I could reform</i>
<i>you with my words.</i>

773
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:35,291
<i>But now I see that you have turned into</i>
<i>fearless and uncontrollable beasts.</i>

774
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:40,208
<i>You won't even fear God or the devil</i>
<i>if he's visible every day.</i>

775
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:48,291
<i>So, just like them, I choose to be</i>
<i>an invisible fear from today.</i>

776
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:52,500
<i>If you forget fear and go into</i>
<i>the sea on your crooked jobs again,</i>

777
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:55,791
<i>I will lay you down on</i>
<i>the shore just like this.</i>

778
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:21,458
It had been two years since
Devara set off into the sea.

779
01:29:22,125 --> 01:29:26,250
The stillness and silence
had somehow reduced the fear.

780
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:29,458
They had lived like sharks.

781
01:29:30,166 --> 01:29:33,375
Their pride stood in the way
of turning into fishermen.

782
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:36,333
But on Bhaira's assurance,

783
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:39,416
a few did venture
into the sea again.

784
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:46,375
<i>Like a tempest born out of the sea,</i>
<i>Devara had probably pounced upon them.</i>

785
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:56,333
<i>Watching the half-dead</i>
<i>come afloat to the shores,</i>

786
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:58,500
<i>the mountain had</i>
<i>its heart in its mouth.</i>

787
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,416
<i>They took to the sea again.</i>

788
01:30:01,958 --> 01:30:03,666
<i>However, this time</i>
<i>it wasn't for a heist.</i>

789
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:05,000
<i>It was for sustenance.</i>

790
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:08,000
<i>Fishing became their livelihood.</i>

791
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:15,791
<i>Meanwhile, the women in his family</i>
<i>kept waiting for Devara, counting minutes.</i>

792
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:22,791
<i>Adamantly trying to make Devara appear,</i>

793
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:25,416
<i>in the Ayudha puja</i>
<i>conducted every year,</i>

794
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,041
<i>Bhaira killed two people</i>
<i>from Devara's village…</i>

795
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:31,666
- Bhaira… Bhaira…
- Bhaira… Bhaira…

796
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:34,291
<i>and made a couple</i>
<i>more bedridden.</i>

797
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:53,875
<i>Since that year, the celebrated fight at</i>
<i>the Ayudha puja has also been stopped.</i>

798
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:57,000
<i>But Devara didn't return</i>
<i>to the mountain.</i>

799
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:02,916
<i>To put an end to Devara</i>
<i>and the fear he infused,</i>

800
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,125
<i>taking a few kids</i>
<i>of the mountain under his wing,</i>

801
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:12,583
<i>Bhaira wanted to mold a generation</i>
<i>into a fearless army.</i>

802
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,250
<i>Twelve long years had passed.</i>

803
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:23,041
<i>Bhaira ingrained the minds</i>

804
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:27,041
<i>of his young army with the belief</i>
<i>that Devara was their only target.</i>

805
01:31:50,916 --> 01:31:52,666
As per your instructions,

806
01:31:52,916 --> 01:31:57,583
I saw Devara in him every minute
and spilled his blood, Bhaira.

807
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,583
When you are in the arena,

808
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,916
you must see Devara
in your opponent

809
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:25,458
and make him shed blood.

810
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:27,291
How many times
have I told you that?

811
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:29,041
He dropped to the ground so…

812
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,125
Also he grew up with me, Bhaira.

813
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:32,958
He only grew up with you.

814
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:36,666
But he was raised by me.

815
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:58,833
<i>Samara born to Kunjara,</i>
<i>the dead leader of the West,</i>

816
01:32:59,333 --> 01:33:04,125
<i>grew up only waiting for Devara,</i>
<i>who caused his father's death.</i>

817
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:09,583
<i>Every day he would go to Devara's</i>
<i>home to check on his old mother</i>

818
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:14,583
<i>because some day</i>
<i>the lady would die of old age and</i>

819
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:17,333
<i>Devara would come</i>
<i>to see her one last time.</i>

820
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:20,041
<i>And finally, Devara would</i>
<i>come under his knife.</i>

821
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:25,500
Why didn't you come
to collect the money this month?

822
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:31,958
When will you stop going
to Devara's house?

823
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:36,208
When you send us
to the sea to kill Devara.

824
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:39,583
In order to kill Devara,

825
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:41,791
not only do we
need perfect timing,

826
01:33:42,125 --> 01:33:44,375
but also a perfect weapon.

827
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:44,833
While coming from Hawk Mountain,
we had this shark attacking our boat.

828
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:47,083
No matter how much we tried
we couldn't subdue it.

829
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:50,041
Vara jumped into the sea, held it down,

830
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:51,833
and fought it till it died.

831
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:56,083
Just like Devara, Vara killed
that shark and pulled it ashore.

832
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:02,333
What are you all looking at?

833
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:05,916
Are you in shock
at how Vara killed the shark?

834
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:08,833
Once I jumped into the sea,

835
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:12,041
I could see nothing except
this aggressive shark.

836
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,000
I tore apart its fins,

837
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:17,125
punched through its ribs,

838
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:19,791
and pulled away its jaws.

839
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:27,333
Slowly it breathed
its last in my hands.

840
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:34,750
What are you staring at?

841
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,125
You think I found a
dead shark on some shore

842
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:40,166
tied it to my boat and brought it here?

843
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:44,250
Believe it or not. I don't care.

844
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:46,875
What a guy!

845
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,583
He couldn't hold up
and blurted out the truth.

846
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,958
Devara's son
should be a warrior.

847
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:52,541
How can Vara be so useless?

848
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:56,500
Did they ask you about it?

849
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,291
Why were they staring at me as
if I was incapable of killing a shark?

850
01:36:00,375 --> 01:36:02,083
Of course.
Knowing you too well, they would.

851
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:04,708
You were so eager to tell them you
brought a dead shark from another shore

852
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:06,375
even before they asked you.

853
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:08,333
- Move it now.
- Hey, Vara!

854
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:11,166
I saw the ladies of your house
on the Pearl shore.

855
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:14,333
They were talking to someone who
claimed he saw Devara's belongings.

856
01:36:18,583 --> 01:36:22,916
Hey, we heard you say that you saw
Devara in the Shell Mountain last night.

857
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,250
Did you see him for sure?

858
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:26,458
I went to that mountain
this morning to collect wood.

859
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,958
There were traces
of cooking in one spot.

860
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,541
Devara was probably
there in the night…

861
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
What else did you see?

862
01:36:33,583 --> 01:36:34,458
Tell us the truth.

863
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:35,958
Did you see Devara?

864
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:38,500
No, my lady.
There were human footprints though.

865
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,041
No one would dare
to go there at that hour.

866
01:36:41,208 --> 01:36:42,416
- I am quite certain it was Devara
- You mean…

867
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:43,625
- who spent the night there.
- Yesterday night…

868
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:45,125
Let's go home.

869
01:36:45,208 --> 01:36:46,583
- Last night…
- Let's just go home.

870
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,125
Come in.

871
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:55,125
Everybody in the village thinks
you guys are mad.

872
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,625
Do you think your son has gone missing?

873
01:36:59,416 --> 01:37:01,500
You are searching for him
as if you lost him in a fair!

874
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:05,416
If he had left for a job,
he would have returned once it was done.

875
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,416
Your son left because
he was hell-bent upon his vow.

876
01:37:09,666 --> 01:37:10,625
He will not…

877
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:14,375
Don't say that he will not return.

878
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,791
This body will drop dead right now.

879
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:22,125
Every single day,

880
01:37:22,583 --> 01:37:25,083
I survive in the hope
that he would return.

881
01:37:28,416 --> 01:37:31,708
Even the sea that your son ventured into
hits the shore every day.

882
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:33,916
Years have passed.

883
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:35,958
Has he come even once to visit?

884
01:37:36,666 --> 01:37:39,250
He visits me in my dreams every night.

885
01:37:43,541 --> 01:37:45,208
Crossing over them someday,

886
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:48,458
won't he stand right before my eyes?

887
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:50,625
He will return.

888
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:53,083
He will return for sure.

889
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:02,375
I can understand where Grandma's
coming from. What's wrong with you?

890
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:05,708
Are you not yet done with somebody
who has abandoned his family?

891
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:08,333
Devara didn't abandon his family
when he left.

892
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:11,708
He left because he felt that these
four villages were his family.

893
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:22,166
<i>Just like the sons of Kunjara and Devara,</i>

894
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:26,666
<i>even Bhaira's son, Pasura,</i>
<i>grew up to be a man.</i>

895
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,416
I will come back next month.

896
01:38:53,541 --> 01:38:54,833
You are not letting go of Chandrakala.

897
01:38:55,166 --> 01:38:56,791
Are you going to be
with her forever, Pasura?

898
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:57,750
No way!

899
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:02,916
This is only until I get
Rayappa's daughter, Thangam.

900
01:39:04,791 --> 01:39:06,916
I can't wait till she is mine.

901
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:29,333
Hey, Seenappa.
Heard your girl got a marriage alliance?

902
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:32,458
I wanted to talk to Thanga
regarding this matter.

903
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:34,250
Why should you talk to Thanga about it?

904
01:39:34,833 --> 01:39:36,375
Did she find you the match?

905
01:39:36,458 --> 01:39:38,666
Find the match?
Well, she ruined it.

906
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:43,041
My would-be son-in-law was at the tailor's
yesterday and saw your daughter, Thanga.

907
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:45,916
She looked at him coyly,
blushed, and smiled.

908
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:49,375
Assuming Thanga likes him,

909
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:52,625
he wants us to postpone tomorrow's event
of fixing the wedding day.

910
01:39:52,708 --> 01:39:54,833
I need to find out what all this is about.
Call her out.

911
01:39:54,916 --> 01:39:57,208
This is something the ladies
should discuss and resolve.

912
01:39:57,541 --> 01:39:58,666
Let's get out of here.

913
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:01,291
I can sort this out myself.
Thanga… Thanga!

914
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:06,708
You have wrecked my daughter's life,
and you are happily washing your hair?

915
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:10,708
I didn't wreck her life.
In fact, I saved her from misery.

916
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:15,875
My smile made him drool and he asked you
to stop the wedding with your daughter.

917
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:17,083
Just imagine…

918
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:20,041
Had he seen me like this,

919
01:40:20,125 --> 01:40:22,083
he would have left her
even after marriage.

920
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:23,333
How is he a good match?

921
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:26,916
Please go and explain this
to your daughter clearly.

922
01:40:27,166 --> 01:40:30,875
I don't think she will let any girl
of her age get married.

923
01:40:30,958 --> 01:40:33,791
Keep her under control
or this will cause a lot of problems.

924
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:40,333
Thanga, how many will you try this on?

925
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:42,416
What will you get out of ruining
everybody's alliance?

926
01:40:42,791 --> 01:40:46,041
Mom! What do our girls
from the village actually want?

927
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:48,583
Everybody wants a simple
and uncomplicated husband.

928
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:51,166
But I want a macho man for myself.

929
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:56,000
Thanga wants a warrior
who will make her erupt.

930
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:59,416
If I miss someone like that
and he becomes someone else's

931
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,375
what would happen to me?

932
01:41:01,125 --> 01:41:03,750
If the other girls wait
till I find my man,

933
01:41:03,916 --> 01:41:07,458
what do they have to lose?

934
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,208
Why are the fruits so spoilt?

935
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:17,750
You hit me because my hand touched you?

936
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:19,166
It's because you laid your hand on me.

937
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:21,083
It will be my hands on you
someday anyway.

938
01:41:21,166 --> 01:41:22,541
How many times do I tell you, Seenu?

939
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:25,166
I will consider you
only if I don't get Vara.

940
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:27,083
Can you not wait a bit for me?

941
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:29,166
His family is pressuring him
to marry his cousin.

942
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,291
Once he is clear about you,
he can give her some clarity too.

943
01:41:31,583 --> 01:41:32,500
Yes!

944
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:39,166
Hey, Metta!

945
01:41:39,583 --> 01:41:43,916
With the sun kissing my hair every day
on the sea, my hair has turned red.

946
01:41:44,125 --> 01:41:45,000
Does it look fine?

947
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:47,416
You should be turning red
with smooches from girls,

948
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,416
but here you are talking about the sun
or the moon kissing!

949
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,375
What nonsense is this?

950
01:41:50,958 --> 01:41:52,041
What are you mad about?

951
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:54,291
What happened?
Why are you angry?

952
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:55,416
- Nothing new.
- Uncle, one tea.

953
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,625
He saw Valli
and went to fool around with her.

954
01:41:57,708 --> 01:42:00,041
She said she won't decide
until things get clear from your end.

955
01:42:00,375 --> 01:42:02,125
Come to a conclusion
about that girl, Thanga

956
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:03,583
so that our lives will get some clarity.

957
01:42:03,708 --> 01:42:05,333
Till then Valli will have her eyes on you.

958
01:42:05,541 --> 01:42:08,250
Knowing she likes me,
how can you marry her, man?

959
01:42:08,375 --> 01:42:10,166
She only has her eyes on you.
She is not on you, right?

960
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:12,208
Yuck! Disgusting fellow!

961
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:14,416
What is disgusting about being romantic?

962
01:42:16,916 --> 01:42:19,458
Hey, Chennamma!
Hasn't your grandson recovered yet?

963
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:21,083
Are you still using medication?

964
01:42:21,916 --> 01:42:25,208
If the bad omen on this village is lifted,
there will be no more illness.

965
01:42:25,666 --> 01:42:26,750
Medicine is not going to help.

966
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:30,666
Without using medicines,
why carry such stupid superstitions?

967
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:41,291
What did I say?
Why did the old lady glare at me?

968
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:44,333
If Devara were here,
he would win the Ayudha puja fight,

969
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,666
carry the weapons
on his head,

970
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:50,333
and cleanse the hamlet
of its bad omen and bewitchment.

971
01:42:50,541 --> 01:42:51,458
That's her belief.

972
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:58,750
Someone born of such noble blood
is ignorant of the value of our weapons.

973
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:01,416
It's our misfortune…
That's what her look says.

974
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,875
If the West side dwellers come,
give them the boat and collect the money.

975
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:18,083
I heard Chitranga made a big ruckus.

976
01:43:20,333 --> 01:43:23,791
Strangely, instead of marrying Vara,
you are looking everywhere else.

977
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:28,166
He only got his dad's looks.
Not his courage.

978
01:43:28,583 --> 01:43:29,458
Oh, really?

979
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:31,833
He is always so naive and timid.

980
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:33,041
How can I get along with him?

981
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:37,250
When I see my man even from a distance,

982
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:41,500
- Thanga's heart, from deep inside, must…
- Erupt and overflow.

983
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:45,458
Thanga, if you don't decide about Vara,
things will get complicated.

984
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:49,583
That guy Metta Seenu is fiddling with me
wherever he finds me.

985
01:43:49,833 --> 01:43:52,333
Why didn't you slap him?

986
01:43:52,583 --> 01:43:53,708
How could I slap him?

987
01:43:53,791 --> 01:43:56,000
If she suddenly takes a fancy to Vara
and takes off with him,

988
01:43:56,083 --> 01:43:57,625
Seenu will be my only option.

989
01:43:57,708 --> 01:43:59,458
Then you should give him your consent.

990
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:00,875
How could I?

991
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,416
If she ends up disliking Vara,
won't he fall between the cracks?

992
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:09,333
Damn! How disgusting!
If she turns down Vara,

993
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:10,583
you want to go ahead with him.

994
01:44:10,958 --> 01:44:12,166
If she accepts Vara,

995
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:13,916
Seenu is waiting to warm up to you.

996
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,500
- Oh, God!
- How would you understand this, sister?

997
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:19,833
Just a year after you came of age,
you were married off.

998
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:21,416
You can afford to say anything.

999
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,875
We are in our youth
but sadly with no companion.

1000
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,625
Two days ago, when they were returning
from fishing on the sea,

1001
01:44:31,708 --> 01:44:33,541
a shark had leaped onto their boat,

1002
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:36,708
and Vara apparently jumped into the sea
and killed it with his bare hands.

1003
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:38,541
Who? Was it our Vara?

1004
01:44:38,625 --> 01:44:42,375
Yes! Seemingly, he also dragged
the dead shark to the shore himself.

1005
01:44:45,541 --> 01:44:46,750
He has it in him.

1006
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:50,125
He definitely has it in him.
I know!

1007
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:53,250
He does have something.
I have known him since we were kids.

1008
01:44:55,125 --> 01:44:56,166
He has it in him.

1009
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Oh, my goodness!

1010
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:08,791
Watch him walk like a champion.

1011
01:45:12,291 --> 01:45:15,208
I am thrilled and enthralled from within.

1012
01:45:16,916 --> 01:45:18,458
Hi, Thanga, how are you?

1013
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:20,041
I heard you jumped into the sea,

1014
01:45:20,125 --> 01:45:22,916
killed a shark with your bare hands,
and dragged it to the shore.

1015
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:27,500
Your vigor, your valor…
I know about it.

1016
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:29,166
What you saw is nothing.

1017
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:31,375
There is a lot more to see.

1018
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:35,666
Looks like they both are a thing.

1019
01:45:35,833 --> 01:45:36,791
It's just the two of us now.

1020
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:40,708
I wanted to gift that boat
to my future husband.

1021
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:46,333
I finished building it today.

1022
01:45:46,625 --> 01:45:47,625
Do you like it?

1023
01:45:48,083 --> 01:45:49,375
Sure, it looks nice.

1024
01:45:54,541 --> 01:45:56,833
How come… you've shown up here?

1025
01:45:57,333 --> 01:45:59,791
I could have come, had you called me.

1026
01:45:59,916 --> 01:46:01,833
I have come for Rayappa.

1027
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:03,708
My goodness!

1028
01:46:03,791 --> 01:46:06,291
Have you gone to the extent
of talking to my father about us?

1029
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:16,750
- Take this.
- Okay, Rayappa.

1030
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:19,041
What brings you here, Vara?

1031
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,291
Ayudha puja is upon us.

1032
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,458
I wanted to speak to you about it.

1033
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,291
What are you implying by that?

1034
01:46:27,375 --> 01:46:28,291
Oh, my goodness!

1035
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,750
I might run out of breath today.

1036
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:36,000
My knight is getting ready
for Ayudha puja.

1037
01:46:36,083 --> 01:46:38,458
- Are you planning to fight in the arena?
- What are you saying?

1038
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:40,166
Have you got drunk in the morning?

1039
01:46:40,416 --> 01:46:41,583
Why will I get into the arena?

1040
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,916
They will kill me.

1041
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,333
That's what I thought.

1042
01:46:44,875 --> 01:46:45,958
Hey, Thangam…

1043
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:50,666
Oh, no!
What happened, Thanga?

1044
01:46:51,708 --> 01:46:52,583
Remove your hand.

1045
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:53,833
Go away.

1046
01:46:59,666 --> 01:47:00,541
Damn, you!

1047
01:47:04,291 --> 01:47:07,333
Everybody is sad that our village hasn't
received the weapons for a long time.

1048
01:47:08,083 --> 01:47:11,375
Maybe we should go to Bhaira
and plead with him…

1049
01:47:11,875 --> 01:47:14,500
to give us the weapons
without a contest this time.

1050
01:47:16,541 --> 01:47:19,208
I am too scared to go to him alone.

1051
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,291
I was hoping you would accompany me.

1052
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,875
We can go.

1053
01:47:29,166 --> 01:47:30,875
- Remove your hand.
- Why is that?

1054
01:47:31,416 --> 01:47:32,666
The link is broken there.

1055
01:47:32,916 --> 01:47:34,416
Let me not break my slipper.

1056
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:40,416
I knew it.

1057
01:47:41,291 --> 01:47:43,166
I knew he didn't have it in him.

1058
01:47:45,666 --> 01:47:48,375
I knew he wasn't right for me
ever since we were kids.

1059
01:47:49,791 --> 01:47:52,125
I knew there was nothing in him.

1060
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:55,833
What is he staring at, Rayappa?

1061
01:47:56,375 --> 01:47:58,375
Is he thinking about how these trees
grew from the water?

1062
01:47:59,833 --> 01:48:01,291
What made you come here, Rayappa?

1063
01:48:02,083 --> 01:48:03,583
That too with a cub for company.

1064
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:08,458
It's been years since the weapons
have reached their village.

1065
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:11,708
They are sad that nothing good
is happening there.

1066
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:15,250
You know that Ayudha puja is upon us.

1067
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:19,500
If you can hand us the weapons this year,

1068
01:48:19,916 --> 01:48:21,291
we will keep them in our village,
and give them back.

1069
01:48:22,916 --> 01:48:25,541
Whichever village wanted the weapons,
Devara would represent that village,

1070
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:27,875
fight, and win the weapons for them.

1071
01:48:27,958 --> 01:48:31,500
You are his son
and you are begging for the weapons?

1072
01:48:31,625 --> 01:48:32,958
How many times have I told you?

1073
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:34,750
I am not like him.

1074
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:36,875
Please accept me as I am.

1075
01:48:38,375 --> 01:48:39,916
Am I not one of you?

1076
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:42,958
I request you to give us the weapons
just this one time.

1077
01:48:53,625 --> 01:48:55,416
We were inside for nine minutes.

1078
01:49:06,625 --> 01:49:10,666
Instead of coming to me,
go to the sea…

1079
01:49:10,916 --> 01:49:15,375
and say, "Our village has no hero
or a valiant man. So, please, come."

1080
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,833
Bellow and call him.

1081
01:49:18,041 --> 01:49:22,916
Maybe that will make your father
enter the arena for your sake.

1082
01:50:08,791 --> 01:50:12,208
Are we ending this with a celebration
like every year…

1083
01:50:12,583 --> 01:50:14,166
or is there going to be a fight?

1084
01:50:21,125 --> 01:50:22,791
If the ladies and children leave,

1085
01:50:23,041 --> 01:50:23,916
we are ready to fight.

1086
01:50:43,416 --> 01:50:45,333
Get the arena ready, guys.

1087
01:50:55,333 --> 01:50:56,208
Hey, wait up.

1088
01:51:03,208 --> 01:51:05,958
Ranga! Ranga!

1089
01:51:06,041 --> 01:51:08,833
Ranga! Ranga!

1090
01:51:08,916 --> 01:51:11,791
Ranga! Ranga!

1091
01:51:11,875 --> 01:51:13,583
Ranga! Ranga!

1092
01:51:13,666 --> 01:51:16,541
Vara! Vara!

1093
01:51:37,958 --> 01:51:39,416
Ranga! Ranga!

1094
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:13,208
Vara! Vara!

1095
01:52:13,291 --> 01:52:17,583
- Vara! Vara!
- Vara! Vara!

1096
01:52:17,666 --> 01:52:19,708
Vara! Vara!

1097
01:52:19,791 --> 01:52:23,166
- Vara!
- Garuda!

1098
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,625
Vara! Vara!

1099
01:52:46,583 --> 01:52:47,500
Hit him hard.
Come on.

1100
01:53:26,791 --> 01:53:28,041
- We are done with both the contenders
- Hit him!

1101
01:53:28,125 --> 01:53:29,250
from the West side.

1102
01:54:06,625 --> 01:54:07,666
Hey…

1103
01:54:30,166 --> 01:54:31,291
I will see to it that he is no more.

1104
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:35,250
Is it enough to knock him down…

1105
01:54:36,625 --> 01:54:38,416
or should I bury him?

1106
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,958
Defeat is worse than death.

1107
01:54:41,208 --> 01:54:44,208
His cry of pain due to defeat

1108
01:54:44,833 --> 01:54:47,750
should reach Devara all the way.

1109
01:54:47,833 --> 01:54:51,416
- Sena! Sena!
- Sena! Sena!

1110
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:55,125
- Sena! Sena!
- Sena! Sena!

1111
01:54:55,208 --> 01:54:59,583
- Sena! Sena!
- Sena! Sena!

1112
01:54:59,666 --> 01:55:02,208
- Sena! Sena!
- Sena! Sena!

1113
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:28,500
Strike him down!

1114
01:55:35,416 --> 01:55:36,291
Come!

1115
01:55:41,875 --> 01:55:44,500
Sena! Sena!

1116
01:55:44,583 --> 01:55:46,208
Sena! Sena!

1117
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:49,000
Sena! Sena!

1118
01:55:49,083 --> 01:55:52,791
Sena! Sena!

1119
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:55,166
Sena! Sena!

1120
01:56:07,125 --> 01:56:08,250
Vara!

1121
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:41,291
We have finished two per village, Bhaira.

1122
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,291
We are done with the fight.

1123
01:57:48,791 --> 01:57:50,416
The weapons will remain
in front of your house.

1124
01:57:52,083 --> 01:57:54,125
Watching them might help you
to get up and walk soon, Varada.

1125
01:58:08,333 --> 01:58:10,916
Have you heard what happened, Rayappa?

1126
01:58:12,208 --> 01:58:13,958
Vara drugged everyone
at the Ayudha puja

1127
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:15,833
and won the competition.

1128
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:17,916
When we know it all, why are we
still having this discussion?

1129
01:58:19,041 --> 01:58:19,916
Permit me.

1130
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:23,708
I will go to his village, knock him down,
and bring back the weapons.

1131
01:58:24,083 --> 01:58:26,708
Tell me what we should do to him, Rayappa.

1132
01:58:35,875 --> 01:58:38,958
It's better to forget it
as if nothing happened, Bhaira.

1133
01:58:41,625 --> 01:58:44,458
If they fell because they were drugged,

1134
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:46,791
they should have been sober
by morning.

1135
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,416
But they aren't able to get up
from their beds.

1136
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:57,666
During the Ayudha puja,
you only saw timidness in his eyes.

1137
01:58:59,083 --> 01:59:01,166
But I saw the technique in his fists.

1138
01:59:05,833 --> 01:59:07,666
I saw Devara-like strength in him.

1139
01:59:14,791 --> 01:59:16,666
Unaware of his own strength,

1140
01:59:17,166 --> 01:59:20,291
he tried to win by drugging everyone
because of his innocence.

1141
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:23,666
In a way, that's the best-case scenario
for all of you.

1142
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:27,416
There is already one Devara in the sea.

1143
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:30,541
Creating another Devara on the mountain…

1144
01:59:31,666 --> 01:59:33,583
will not be good for you, Bhaira.

1145
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,958
Husband and liquor have
a special connection.

1146
01:59:46,208 --> 01:59:47,333
I just don't understand.

1147
01:59:48,083 --> 01:59:50,500
How can he win by sedating everyone?

1148
01:59:51,375 --> 01:59:55,666
Sister, I imagined my husband
to be as mighty as the sea.

1149
01:59:55,916 --> 01:59:56,791
This guy…

1150
01:59:56,916 --> 01:59:58,916
seems like a small wave
that touches the shore.

1151
02:00:00,333 --> 02:00:03,250
I am your senior with a lot of experience.
Take my advice.

1152
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:06,333
Every woman has a heartthrob,

1153
02:00:06,416 --> 02:00:07,833
different from the one she marries.

1154
02:00:08,333 --> 02:00:11,500
If you can see your heartthrob
in the man you marry

1155
02:00:11,583 --> 02:00:14,916
and save your marriage,
life can get surprisingly pleasant.

1156
02:00:15,125 --> 02:00:16,583
How is that possible?

1157
02:00:16,875 --> 02:00:19,541
When Thanga looks at her man,
she should erupt

1158
02:00:19,625 --> 02:00:22,375
- and overflow from inside.
- What nonsense!

1159
02:00:22,625 --> 02:00:23,541
Stop it right there.

1160
02:00:23,708 --> 02:00:24,875
Leave him alone, if you don't like him.

1161
02:00:25,083 --> 02:00:26,833
- I will take care of him.
- Hey!

1162
02:00:27,125 --> 02:00:30,625
Somehow, I still feel
hopeful about him.

1163
02:00:30,833 --> 02:00:32,208
What are you hoping for?

1164
02:00:32,541 --> 02:00:35,333
You want someone like Devara
and he doesn't exist on this mountain.

1165
02:00:36,750 --> 02:00:40,875
Should I just wait till Devara returns
and marry him?

1166
02:00:43,208 --> 02:00:45,333
Hey, have you lost your mind?

1167
02:00:46,208 --> 02:00:47,500
What do I do then?

1168
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:48,833
My dear Thanga,

1169
02:00:49,625 --> 02:00:51,791
we don't get whatever we want.

1170
02:00:52,208 --> 02:00:56,333
We must mold whatever we get
and hone it to perfection.

1171
02:00:56,708 --> 02:01:00,250
Unless you ignite a desire in him
to marry you,

1172
02:01:00,333 --> 02:01:02,250
why would he try to be
your knight or warrior?

1173
02:01:03,208 --> 02:01:04,208
What is Thangam?

1174
02:01:04,291 --> 02:01:05,833
How great is her beauty?

1175
02:01:06,083 --> 02:01:07,750
He should see it…

1176
02:01:08,125 --> 02:01:09,250
and get tantalized.

1177
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,875
Look at her yap!

1178
02:01:21,916 --> 02:01:26,083
<i>Encompasses me like a fond guest</i>
<i>Your mischievous gaze</i>

1179
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:31,083
<i>It doesn't stay still even for a moment</i>

1180
02:01:31,875 --> 02:01:36,291
<i>All the time, I am lost in your world</i>

1181
02:01:37,208 --> 02:01:41,583
<i>If you can, please, do stop me</i>

1182
02:01:41,666 --> 02:01:47,250
<i>Come, the comfort of my sleep</i>
<i>I have given it away to your dreams</i>

1183
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:51,458
<i>I wait for you on the threshold</i>
<i>Of my youth</i>

1184
02:01:51,541 --> 02:01:57,125
<i>Come! I have gathered all my hopes</i>
<i>And stamped them on your heart</i>

1185
02:01:57,416 --> 02:02:00,791
<i>I have set the stage for your arrival</i>

1186
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:08,208
<i>For some reason it is born</i>
<i>This fascination for you is born</i>

1187
02:02:08,875 --> 02:02:13,291
<i>And with it is born my madness for you</i>
<i>Naming itself after you</i>

1188
02:02:13,375 --> 02:02:18,208
<i>Allure has dressed itself in a half-sari</i>
<i>With hands colored in henna</i>

1189
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:23,875
<i>Making vows to my lord</i>
<i>Encompasses me like a fond guest</i>

1190
02:02:24,958 --> 02:02:26,208
<i>It does encompass me</i>

1191
02:02:26,291 --> 02:02:28,750
<i>Encompasses me like a fond guest</i>

1192
02:02:31,250 --> 02:02:35,625
<i>Encompasses me like a fond guest</i>
<i>This mischievous gaze</i>

1193
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:41,041
<i>It doesn't stay still even for a moment</i>

1194
02:03:01,291 --> 02:03:05,791
<i>Casts me a net of intoxication</i>
<i>Your chivalrous charisma</i>

1195
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:10,916
<i>Why don't you come closer</i>
<i>And cuddle me?</i>

1196
02:03:11,125 --> 02:03:15,750
<i>I have nurtured this priceless charm</i>
<i>In all symmetry</i>

1197
02:03:16,125 --> 02:03:20,750
<i>Take possession of it little by little</i>

1198
02:03:20,958 --> 02:03:25,791
<i>Invade me with your kisses</i>
<i>For your mischief is most welcome</i>

1199
02:03:25,875 --> 02:03:30,500
<i>Why don't you touch me at least once</i>
<i>Even if by mistake?</i>

1200
02:03:30,583 --> 02:03:31,458
<i>Hey, come!</i>

1201
02:03:31,541 --> 02:03:36,250
<i>This necklace of gold</i>
<i>Doesn't please me at all</i>

1202
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:40,166
<i>Deck me up with your hugs</i>

1203
02:03:40,250 --> 02:03:41,375
<i>Oh, come!</i>

1204
02:03:41,458 --> 02:03:46,125
<i>No lullaby by the full moon</i>
<i>Is able to put me to sleep</i>

1205
02:03:46,208 --> 02:03:49,750
<i>Consider my pain a little</i>

1206
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:57,083
<i>For some reason it is born</i>
<i>This fascination for you is born</i>

1207
02:03:57,791 --> 02:04:02,083
<i>And with it is born my madness for you</i>
<i>Naming itself after you</i>

1208
02:04:02,166 --> 02:04:07,041
<i>Allure has dressed itself in a half-sari</i>
<i>With hands colored in henna</i>

1209
02:04:07,625 --> 02:04:10,166
<i>Making vows to my lord</i>

1210
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:15,041
<i>Encompasses me like a fond guest</i>
<i>It does encompass me</i>

1211
02:04:15,125 --> 02:04:17,708
<i>Encompasses me like a fond guest</i>

1212
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,416
<i>Encompasses me like a fond guest</i>
<i>This mischievous gaze</i>

1213
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:29,791
<i>It doesn't stay still even for a moment</i>

1214
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,291
If everyone is sharpening their weapons,

1215
02:05:06,458 --> 02:05:08,583
I guess it's time
to put them to use.

1216
02:05:09,625 --> 02:05:13,791
We've been anxiously waiting
for your approval, Bhaira.

1217
02:05:14,083 --> 02:05:17,458
Are we going to the sea to fight him
anytime soon?

1218
02:05:19,291 --> 02:05:20,166
Bhaira…

1219
02:05:27,208 --> 02:05:29,541
The coast guard authorities
have opened up jobs

1220
02:05:29,625 --> 02:05:32,000
for expert swimmers
to help them in the sea.

1221
02:05:33,375 --> 02:05:34,833
I heard the pay is excellent too.

1222
02:05:36,375 --> 02:05:39,333
We could make good use of the training
you gave us all these years.

1223
02:05:40,875 --> 02:05:44,250
If you say yes, all of us
will find jobs on the sea, Bhaira.

1224
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:51,291
Were all these years of my teaching
and practice meant for this…

1225
02:05:53,208 --> 02:05:54,708
or for Devara?

1226
02:05:55,375 --> 02:05:59,166
When we get busy with our jobs,
Devara will have no job to do, Bhaira.

1227
02:06:00,791 --> 02:06:02,041
Think it over until tomorrow.

1228
02:06:15,875 --> 02:06:18,208
How can you give in to his words, Bhaira?

1229
02:06:19,666 --> 02:06:22,875
I have kept him with me
since he was a kid.

1230
02:06:23,375 --> 02:06:25,750
I wanted him to reach my level,

1231
02:06:26,333 --> 02:06:28,500
but time and again,

1232
02:06:29,041 --> 02:06:32,416
I see more and more traits
of Devara in him.

1233
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,125
Where did I fall short?

1234
02:06:36,625 --> 02:06:38,000
You gave us everything.

1235
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:39,916
You are everything to us.

1236
02:06:40,333 --> 02:06:41,666
We are just like you, Bhaira.

1237
02:07:32,125 --> 02:07:34,000
He did grow up with us,

1238
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:37,375
but for a while, we could only see
Devara in him, Bhaira.

1239
02:07:58,791 --> 02:07:59,916
How are you, Bhaira?

1240
02:08:04,083 --> 02:08:06,708
How come you called for me
after a long time?

1241
02:08:07,625 --> 02:08:10,541
It's time to get into the sea again.

1242
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:18,000
The army I have raised over the years
is ready to enter the sea,

1243
02:08:18,083 --> 02:08:24,333
quell any level of danger,
and carry the cargo to the shore.

1244
02:08:24,625 --> 02:08:27,208
- What about Devara?
- Along with your consignment,

1245
02:08:27,875 --> 02:08:30,166
his head will be brought too.

1246
02:08:31,583 --> 02:08:32,791
Bhaira, Bhaira…

1247
02:08:33,833 --> 02:08:36,416
I cannot dare to do that
as long as Devara is alive.

1248
02:08:39,208 --> 02:08:41,458
If something goes wrong,
I will lose my consignment.

1249
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:44,458
There is a good chance
he will end my life too.

1250
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Unless we get into the sea for the cargo,
why would Devara show up?

1251
02:08:50,541 --> 02:08:52,000
How will they kill him?

1252
02:08:52,208 --> 02:08:53,125
Could be true…

1253
02:08:54,541 --> 02:08:56,375
But I am not taking that chance.

1254
02:08:57,833 --> 02:08:59,833
Draw Devara out somehow

1255
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:02,625
and send me word
that you got rid of him, Bhaira.

1256
02:09:04,333 --> 02:09:08,041
I will get a new consignment every week
and bring glory back to this mountain.

1257
02:09:11,708 --> 02:09:13,333
But only if you kill Devara.

1258
02:09:19,083 --> 02:09:22,666
Muruga said he will not procure shipments
unless Devara is dead.

1259
02:09:24,458 --> 02:09:25,791
For that to happen,

1260
02:09:26,416 --> 02:09:28,125
Devara must be brought out.

1261
02:09:29,333 --> 02:09:33,291
<i>Hence Bhaira spread a rumor about it.</i>

1262
02:09:35,625 --> 02:09:38,958
Everybody in our village thinks
Devara is not alive anymore.

1263
02:09:39,208 --> 02:09:42,000
I heard about it too.
Nobody has seen him till now.

1264
02:09:42,125 --> 02:09:44,083
Even his family hasn't seen his face.

1265
02:09:44,333 --> 02:09:46,041
It seems quite true.

1266
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,500
The West and the East dwellers say
Devara is no more.

1267
02:09:50,708 --> 02:09:51,583
Is that true?

1268
02:09:51,916 --> 02:09:55,041
The North side and some of our own
are saying the same.

1269
02:09:55,625 --> 02:09:58,750
Even I doubt if Devara is alive.

1270
02:09:59,458 --> 02:10:03,208
<i>Having heard what she feared most</i>
<i>all her life,</i>

1271
02:10:04,083 --> 02:10:05,375
<i>his mother's health deteriorated</i>

1272
02:10:05,458 --> 02:10:07,958
<i>and they took her</i>
<i>to Jogulamma's for treatment.</i>

1273
02:10:11,291 --> 02:10:14,041
It is not medicine
that will cure her, Vara.

1274
02:10:15,208 --> 02:10:16,375
This is the angst of a mother.

1275
02:10:18,416 --> 02:10:24,333
She cannot fully recover
unless she sees her son Devara.

1276
02:10:28,041 --> 02:10:30,375
<i>Knowing too well</i>
<i>that Devara would turn up</i>

1277
02:10:30,458 --> 02:10:32,500
<i>before his sick mom's health got worse,</i>

1278
02:10:33,208 --> 02:10:37,000
<i>Bhaira surrounded Jogulamma's house</i>
<i>day and night along with his men.</i>

1279
02:10:45,625 --> 02:10:48,125
We have been waiting for him
for the past three nights.

1280
02:10:48,833 --> 02:10:50,083
Do you think he will show up, Bhaira?

1281
02:10:51,041 --> 02:10:53,291
He has to come at least for his mother.

1282
02:11:43,875 --> 02:11:44,791
Devara…

1283
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:02,500
Did you have food?

1284
02:12:45,625 --> 02:12:46,708
- Hey!
- Bhaira!

1285
02:12:46,916 --> 02:12:47,875
Devara was here.

1286
02:12:47,958 --> 02:12:49,708
We must finish him before
he leaves the mountain.

1287
02:12:53,583 --> 02:12:54,500
There he is!

1288
02:13:12,583 --> 02:13:13,458
Hey!

1289
02:13:13,916 --> 02:13:14,791
Hey!

1290
02:15:18,666 --> 02:15:22,000
<i>Everybody on the mountain got to know</i>
<i>that Devara had paid a visit.</i>

1291
02:15:26,083 --> 02:15:27,500
How is he doing?

1292
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:30,250
Good as always.

1293
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:34,583
His hair has slightly gone gray.
That's all.

1294
02:15:36,666 --> 02:15:37,791
Why do we care?

1295
02:15:38,791 --> 02:15:40,291
Why should we care how he is?

1296
02:15:42,125 --> 02:15:45,125
Are you still not through with him
after all these years?

1297
02:15:46,375 --> 02:15:50,541
He came to see the old lady as a formality
not out of his love for us.

1298
02:15:53,708 --> 02:15:57,291
When will you understand that
he will not return for you and me?

1299
02:16:02,250 --> 02:16:03,125
Damn it!

1300
02:16:05,708 --> 02:16:09,833
<i>Bhaira, who was fuming because Devara</i>
<i>was almost under his sword</i>

1301
02:16:09,916 --> 02:16:11,125
<i>but got away again,</i>

1302
02:16:12,416 --> 02:16:14,833
<i>had another opportunity</i>
<i>knocking at his door.</i>

1303
02:16:20,083 --> 02:16:23,416
When Devara, who should have charged
at you the moment he saw you, instead

1304
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:28,500
sneaked away from you, it became
obvious that he had lost his vigor.

1305
02:16:30,041 --> 02:16:33,166
A ship containing our consignment
will pass by the Red Sea this coming week.

1306
02:16:36,166 --> 02:16:38,166
Are you and your troops
ready for this, Bhaira?

1307
02:16:41,375 --> 02:16:42,625
As you promised,

1308
02:16:42,875 --> 02:16:46,833
along with the shipment, make sure
you bring Devara's head too, Bhaira.

1309
02:16:47,833 --> 02:16:49,000
Coming Saturday, Bhaira.

1310
02:17:01,958 --> 02:17:06,750
<i>Bhaira was elated to enter</i>
<i>the sea after many years…</i>

1311
02:17:07,333 --> 02:17:10,125
<i>but no one could have imagined</i>
<i>the event that followed.</i>

1312
02:17:15,333 --> 02:17:16,500
What happened?

1313
02:17:16,708 --> 02:17:17,750
What's wrong, Bhaira?

1314
02:17:17,833 --> 02:17:18,916
What happened to your hand?

1315
02:17:19,958 --> 02:17:23,208
Out of fear of fighting
with Bhaira in the sea,

1316
02:17:23,291 --> 02:17:25,250
Devara must have done this.

1317
02:17:28,708 --> 02:17:31,375
His plan better not work, Bhaira.

1318
02:17:37,041 --> 02:17:38,458
Last night,

1319
02:17:39,458 --> 02:17:44,583
I know it was you who did this.

1320
02:17:45,375 --> 02:17:46,375
Bhaira…

1321
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:48,333
Though you lost your father,

1322
02:17:48,916 --> 02:17:51,375
I treated you like my own son.

1323
02:17:51,791 --> 02:17:52,666
How dare you!

1324
02:17:55,958 --> 02:18:00,666
As a kid, since the moment
I saw my dad's body lying on the shore,

1325
02:18:01,375 --> 02:18:03,708
I haven't had a good sleep.

1326
02:18:04,958 --> 02:18:11,250
I have been hankering to kill him,
wash my hair with his blood,

1327
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:12,833
and get my revenge!

1328
02:18:14,291 --> 02:18:17,875
But if you get into the sea
and face Devara,

1329
02:18:18,375 --> 02:18:20,750
his death will be on your plate.

1330
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,541
The one who killed Kunjara
should be killed by this son of Kunjara's.

1331
02:18:27,750 --> 02:18:31,750
If that should happen,
you must refrain from coming.

1332
02:18:44,291 --> 02:18:47,958
In order to kill Devara,
it is not strength that you need Bhaira.

1333
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:51,708
This is good enough.

1334
02:18:52,958 --> 02:18:56,250
Every one of us going there
has more than we need.

1335
02:18:56,458 --> 02:18:58,916
The coming week,
when we venture into the sea,

1336
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,708
even if we see Devara from a
mile away, we shall kill him and return.

1337
02:19:19,333 --> 02:19:20,333
What happened, Uma?

1338
02:19:22,083 --> 02:19:23,750
I am scared, Mom.

1339
02:19:25,958 --> 02:19:26,833
Uma?

1340
02:19:29,208 --> 02:19:31,750
I went into the forest for henna,

1341
02:19:32,041 --> 02:19:34,000
and Bhaira's men stopped me
on my way back.

1342
02:19:35,625 --> 02:19:36,500
Hey!

1343
02:19:37,291 --> 02:19:38,166
Move aside.

1344
02:19:39,083 --> 02:19:43,208
How brave!
Not a trace of fear in your voice.

1345
02:19:43,708 --> 02:19:45,166
Is it because you are Devara's daughter?

1346
02:19:45,250 --> 02:19:48,000
They said, "Your dad,
Devara, will be dead soon.

1347
02:19:48,083 --> 02:19:52,625
Once he is dead, one of us
will take you each day."

1348
02:19:52,708 --> 02:19:58,916
We shall take out all our pent-up anger
on your mother and you each night.

1349
02:20:01,416 --> 02:20:03,333
There is surely a man in your house.

1350
02:20:04,166 --> 02:20:06,125
But no way he can save you.

1351
02:20:06,208 --> 02:20:08,958
"It is beyond your brother's ability
to protect you.

1352
02:20:09,625 --> 02:20:12,875
Neither can the locals do anything."

1353
02:20:12,958 --> 02:20:15,208
They were talking all this rubbish.

1354
02:20:16,208 --> 02:20:19,000
I feel like dying, Mom.

1355
02:20:21,458 --> 02:20:27,208
Nobody from this mountain
will ever dare touch Devara's daughter.

1356
02:20:28,583 --> 02:20:30,166
But if it does happen,

1357
02:20:30,666 --> 02:20:35,333
like you suggested,
we will all drink poison and die.

1358
02:21:01,125 --> 02:21:03,333
What's up, Vara?
Why are you here?

1359
02:21:05,833 --> 02:21:08,041
Did your sister come
and complain to you?

1360
02:21:10,125 --> 02:21:12,125
I wish she told me.

1361
02:21:13,333 --> 02:21:15,375
But she went crying to my mother
and told her.

1362
02:21:18,583 --> 02:21:22,458
She didn't consider me man enough
to tell her problems to.

1363
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,291
You are a coward who can't win a contest
without sedating others!

1364
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,166
Why will they consider you a man
or a hero?

1365
02:21:44,458 --> 02:21:45,916
Even I am drunk right now.

1366
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:48,208
For the spite in me to thrash you,

1367
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:51,875
why don't you see whether my intoxication
helps it or hinders it?

1368
02:23:14,875 --> 02:23:15,750
Rayappa…

1369
02:23:16,916 --> 02:23:17,791
Rayappa…

1370
02:23:18,291 --> 02:23:20,750
Vara knocked up Bhaira's men
at the toddy shop.

1371
02:23:22,916 --> 02:23:23,833
What happened?

1372
02:23:24,166 --> 02:23:27,583
Bhaira's men troubled Vara's sister
when she was returning from the forest.

1373
02:23:27,916 --> 02:23:29,875
Vara smacked them down
when he got to know about this.

1374
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:31,958
- Vara? Really?
- Yes.

1375
02:23:32,625 --> 02:23:33,750
How did he do it?

1376
02:23:34,125 --> 02:23:35,416
Has anybody seen him do it?

1377
02:23:35,750 --> 02:23:39,583
People at the toddy shop said
he beat them till they bled.

1378
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:43,541
Oh, my goodness!

1379
02:23:51,291 --> 02:23:52,250
I knew it.

1380
02:23:53,041 --> 02:23:55,250
I knew that he had it in him
since we were kids.

1381
02:23:55,791 --> 02:23:59,583
He will not tolerate any advances
made towards me or his sister.

1382
02:24:00,041 --> 02:24:02,791
I knew it, Dad! I knew it!

1383
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:06,833
I knew it. I did!

1384
02:24:31,416 --> 02:24:34,583
<i>O' luscious murrel</i>
<i>I shall make a curry of you</i>

1385
02:24:34,791 --> 02:24:37,458
<i>The spices on the stove</i>
<i>Are boiling to stew</i>

1386
02:24:38,083 --> 02:24:41,291
<i>Your cute crony</i>
<i>Shall offer you her youth</i>

1387
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:44,291
<i>And give you a passionate maiden feast</i>

1388
02:25:50,625 --> 02:25:53,666
<i>Your sidelong glances act</i>
<i>Like incense of moonlight</i>

1389
02:25:53,916 --> 02:25:57,125
<i>Girl, you have put me</i>
<i>On a winged horse</i>

1390
02:25:57,250 --> 02:26:00,583
<i>The prime of youth lures the hungry lion</i>

1391
02:26:00,666 --> 02:26:03,875
<i>Let me put the dark night to sleep</i>

1392
02:26:03,958 --> 02:26:08,416
<i>Look at your waist</i>
<i>Thin as a wasp's</i>

1393
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:10,750
<i>How you chiseled it to a smooth finish</i>

1394
02:26:10,833 --> 02:26:13,541
<i>Cut the distance</i>
<i>With spirits soaring high</i>

1395
02:26:13,625 --> 02:26:17,375
<i>Surrender to the cupid for you</i>
<i>Are caught for good</i>

1396
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,250
Vara is here, Singappa!

1397
02:27:23,416 --> 02:27:24,583
What were you up to last night?

1398
02:27:25,791 --> 02:27:28,083
Bhaira's men were troubling my sister.

1399
02:27:28,541 --> 02:27:30,875
I drank some to build courage
and bashed them up.

1400
02:27:31,208 --> 02:27:32,083
Hey!

1401
02:27:32,208 --> 02:27:34,000
Yes, I got drunk and beat them.
What about it?

1402
02:27:34,166 --> 02:27:36,000
They are dead from your beating.

1403
02:27:39,833 --> 02:27:40,750
How can they be dead?

1404
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:42,500
It wasn't me, Singappa.

1405
02:27:42,791 --> 02:27:44,958
We have been oblivious
to your strength just like you.

1406
02:27:45,208 --> 02:27:47,208
You lived as a coward around us.

1407
02:27:47,291 --> 02:27:50,541
But we should have known
that you are Devara's blood.

1408
02:27:52,166 --> 02:27:53,500
Since you thrashed
the people from that village,

1409
02:27:53,583 --> 02:27:55,291
Bhaira's men are about to charge on us!

1410
02:27:55,375 --> 02:27:58,458
If you take the lead we are ready
to kill them all, Vara.

1411
02:27:58,541 --> 02:27:59,750
Have you gone mad?

1412
02:28:00,291 --> 02:28:02,000
Keep calm and get to work.

1413
02:28:02,666 --> 02:28:04,708
I will go and explain myself to Bhaira.

1414
02:28:05,708 --> 02:28:06,625
Go!

1415
02:28:26,458 --> 02:28:28,708
I really don't know
how they died, Bhaira.

1416
02:28:29,458 --> 02:28:31,375
If I said that I am capable of killing,
would you believe it?

1417
02:28:33,208 --> 02:28:34,916
I dragged a dead shark to the shore…

1418
02:28:35,375 --> 02:28:37,250
Such is my courage.

1419
02:28:39,750 --> 02:28:41,208
I spiked everybody's drink
and won the weapons.

1420
02:28:41,833 --> 02:28:43,208
Such is my strength.

1421
02:28:43,625 --> 02:28:47,000
At least you should wonder
how I could do this, Bhaira.

1422
02:28:48,583 --> 02:28:51,666
He misbehaved with my sister
so I got angry and slapped him.

1423
02:28:51,916 --> 02:28:53,875
But how can you hold me responsible
for his death?

1424
02:28:55,625 --> 02:28:58,291
You must convince everyone
that I am one of you, Bhaira.

1425
02:28:59,208 --> 02:29:03,166
Though you are Devara's son,
you are not his man.

1426
02:29:03,416 --> 02:29:07,250
For everyone to believe
that you are one of us,

1427
02:29:07,750 --> 02:29:12,750
you must join hands with our people
and do what they do.

1428
02:29:19,875 --> 02:29:22,958
After many years,

1429
02:29:23,708 --> 02:29:26,166
your peers are venturing
into the sea tonight.

1430
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:35,083
They are going to fight your dad
and bring the consignment.

1431
02:29:36,875 --> 02:29:37,833
Vara…

1432
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:44,208
If you join them, then from tomorrow
you will become one of us and stay safe.

1433
02:30:08,125 --> 02:30:11,958
You want to go to the waters
guarded by Devara.

1434
02:30:12,708 --> 02:30:15,250
If something goes wrong,
I will not be able to handle it, son.

1435
02:30:20,125 --> 02:30:21,750
I thought you were feeding me out of love.

1436
02:30:21,958 --> 02:30:24,708
Is it out of fear of my death
that you are overfilling my plate?

1437
02:30:25,250 --> 02:30:28,000
You are all praise about the man
who killed your husband!

1438
02:30:28,625 --> 02:30:30,791
Was I born to Kunjara or Devara?

1439
02:30:42,125 --> 02:30:45,208
You seem to be in quite a good mood today.

1440
02:30:45,833 --> 02:30:49,250
Oh, I heard you are setting out
to the sea tomorrow.

1441
02:30:49,625 --> 02:30:54,000
If Devara does something to you,
we cannot meet again. Is that the reason?

1442
02:31:17,708 --> 02:31:21,791
Nobody's happy that Vara, who killed
our men, is accompanying us, Bhaira.

1443
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,583
It wasn't Vara who killed him.

1444
02:31:27,375 --> 02:31:28,250
It was me.

1445
02:31:29,416 --> 02:31:30,916
Without me,

1446
02:31:31,416 --> 02:31:36,250
it is not as easy as Kunjara's son
thinks it is to kill Devara.

1447
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:41,208
With Vara being a part of this team,

1448
02:31:41,833 --> 02:31:45,541
Devara will be caught in a moment
of doubt and confusion.

1449
02:31:46,958 --> 02:31:51,833
It is for this reason
that I killed our guy last night

1450
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:56,625
and brought Vara to his knees before me.

1451
02:32:34,166 --> 02:32:35,208
What are you worried about?

1452
02:32:35,833 --> 02:32:38,916
Are you stressed about
what to do if your dad shows up?

1453
02:32:40,416 --> 02:32:41,291
Hold this.

1454
02:32:41,541 --> 02:32:42,958
In case you happen to face Devara,
this will come in handy.

1455
02:32:43,916 --> 02:32:45,791
Why would I need this?
I don't want it.

1456
02:32:46,541 --> 02:32:49,166
Are you confident that you will kill him
without using this?

1457
02:33:12,666 --> 02:33:14,416
Come on, Devara.

1458
02:33:50,541 --> 02:33:51,416
Hey!

1459
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:52,375
Hang on, guys.

1460
02:34:34,250 --> 02:34:35,666
It's not Devara,

1461
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:36,833
it's a shark.

1462
02:35:20,916 --> 02:35:21,791
Devara is here.

1463
02:35:25,041 --> 02:35:27,875
Tonight, we will head back only
with Devara's head in our hands.

1464
02:35:28,333 --> 02:35:29,208
Come on!

1465
02:36:29,333 --> 02:36:30,208
Singappa!

1466
02:36:31,333 --> 02:36:32,250
Singappa!

1467
02:36:32,875 --> 02:36:35,458
Along with the sons of Kunjara and Bhaira,

1468
02:36:35,541 --> 02:36:39,166
Vara has secretly gone
to the sea on a heist.

1469
02:36:39,916 --> 02:36:42,125
They are defying Devara, Singappa.

1470
02:36:44,125 --> 02:36:46,833
They must have influenced my son.

1471
02:36:47,333 --> 02:36:51,125
And believing them like a lamb,
he must have joined their herd.

1472
02:36:53,125 --> 02:36:55,416
Please do something
and stop him, Singappa.

1473
02:36:56,916 --> 02:37:00,875
You know my husband, Devara,
better than I do.

1474
02:37:02,208 --> 02:37:04,750
Will he spare a wrongdoer
even if it is his own son?

1475
02:37:16,750 --> 02:37:20,375
In spite of my incessant pleading,
why doesn't anyone say a word?

1476
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,916
Have you also joined hands with them?

1477
02:37:24,541 --> 02:37:26,208
While acting like our own,

1478
02:37:26,375 --> 02:37:29,833
are you also trying to kill Devara?

1479
02:37:44,125 --> 02:37:47,083
All of you who are resorting
to forbidden activities,

1480
02:37:48,125 --> 02:37:49,833
including Vara, his own son,

1481
02:37:49,916 --> 02:37:53,458
will not be spared by my husband, Devara.

1482
02:37:53,625 --> 02:37:57,375
Your husband left all of us
a long time ago, dear.

1483
02:38:05,333 --> 02:38:09,208
Our Devara left us
and went to God long ago.

1484
02:38:13,875 --> 02:38:16,458
Guarding the sea all these years

1485
02:38:16,541 --> 02:38:19,083
and forbidding everyone
from committing a crime…

1486
02:38:20,666 --> 02:38:23,041
isn't your husband, Devara.

1487
02:38:38,791 --> 02:38:40,208
It is your son, Vara.

1488
02:38:45,916 --> 02:38:48,666
<i>The sea is blue</i>
<i>But it's his Red Sea</i>

1489
02:38:48,750 --> 02:38:50,166
<i>All hail!</i>

1490
02:38:50,250 --> 02:38:54,333
He grew up listening
to the stories from Devara.

1491
02:38:58,083 --> 02:39:00,083
To uphold fear in this mountain,

1492
02:39:00,208 --> 02:39:04,208
he scripted a very big story
that Devara is alive.

1493
02:39:11,375 --> 02:39:12,791
<i>All hail!</i>

1494
02:39:16,708 --> 02:39:18,166
<i>All hail!</i>

1495
02:39:21,750 --> 02:39:25,083
Did you think that
under the influence of those beasts,

1496
02:39:25,166 --> 02:39:27,291
he followed them like a lamb?

1497
02:39:27,875 --> 02:39:29,250
That's not true.

1498
02:39:29,958 --> 02:39:34,750
Those who took him
as their pawn are the lambs.

1499
02:39:36,583 --> 02:39:39,041
By now, your son must be

1500
02:39:39,208 --> 02:39:43,583
hunting them down
like a monster in the sea!

1501
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:00,416
Since you don't know him,

1502
02:40:01,833 --> 02:40:04,791
it might seem like
he has gone into the sea.

1503
02:40:06,625 --> 02:40:09,791
But to us who have been
watching him for years,

1504
02:40:12,041 --> 02:40:15,291
he himself appears to be a mighty sea.

1505
02:40:34,458 --> 02:40:35,625
Not them.

1506
02:40:36,208 --> 02:40:39,041
Go kill your dad, Devara,
and bring him here!

1507
02:40:39,125 --> 02:40:40,000
Who? Me?

1508
02:40:40,208 --> 02:40:41,125
Yes!

1509
02:41:05,666 --> 02:41:11,000
Now that you have heard of Devara's death,
I can imagine your anguish tonight.

1510
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:16,500
But your son's dance of fury
on the Red Sea

1511
02:41:16,583 --> 02:41:18,750
to keep Devara's promise…

1512
02:41:20,625 --> 02:41:23,166
will make you forget your pain.

1513
02:41:24,833 --> 02:41:26,333
<i>All hail!</i>

1514
02:41:27,583 --> 02:41:29,125
<i>All hail!</i>

1515
02:41:30,250 --> 02:41:31,666
<i>All hail!</i>

1516
02:41:32,833 --> 02:41:34,333
<i>All hail!</i>

1517
02:42:06,250 --> 02:42:08,875
<i>O' courage, ready to leap! Careful!</i>

1518
02:42:08,958 --> 02:42:11,666
<i>Don't you dare…</i>
<i>Don't you dare come face to face</i>

1519
02:42:11,750 --> 02:42:14,083
<i>What are you before Devara?</i>

1520
02:42:14,166 --> 02:42:16,833
<i>Hide yourself…</i>

1521
02:42:18,250 --> 02:42:19,541
<i>All hail!</i>

1522
02:42:19,625 --> 02:42:22,333
<i>All hail! All hail the tiger!</i>

1523
02:42:23,583 --> 02:42:24,833
<i>All hail!</i>

1524
02:42:24,916 --> 02:42:27,125
<i>All hail…</i>

1525
02:42:59,833 --> 02:43:02,208
<i>O' courage, ready to leap! Careful!</i>

1526
02:43:02,291 --> 02:43:04,958
<i>Don't you dare…</i>
<i>Don't you dare come face to face</i>

1527
02:43:05,041 --> 02:43:07,500
<i>What are you before Devara?</i>

1528
02:43:07,583 --> 02:43:10,208
<i>Hide yourself…</i>

1529
02:43:37,666 --> 02:43:39,416
Twelve long years ago,

1530
02:43:40,583 --> 02:43:41,666
on the same shore,

1531
02:43:43,625 --> 02:43:45,000
watching people hanging from a boat,

1532
02:43:45,083 --> 02:43:47,583
a generation had discovered fear
and stopped their activities.

1533
02:43:54,166 --> 02:43:56,291
Now finding these men on this boat,

1534
02:43:56,375 --> 02:43:58,416
another generation
will come to a standstill.

1535
02:44:00,375 --> 02:44:05,875
Do you think the next generation will
grow up without fear, Singappa?

1536
02:44:08,666 --> 02:44:11,791
Even if somebody thinks
of entering the sea again,

1537
02:44:12,750 --> 02:44:13,833
it would remain a dream.

1538
02:44:15,791 --> 02:44:18,250
The waves that saw your play,
will testify to it, Vara.

1539
02:44:46,291 --> 02:44:49,291
I went with them to confront Devara.

1540
02:44:50,708 --> 02:44:52,666
To keep the story I wrote "alive."

1541
02:45:03,708 --> 02:45:05,041
What are you saying, Vara?

1542
02:45:06,875 --> 02:45:10,458
You want me to drive this weapon into you
and watch your blood flow?

1543
02:45:12,166 --> 02:45:14,125
To do that and to watch it…

1544
02:45:14,916 --> 02:45:16,958
This old heart is too weak
to bear the pain.

1545
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:22,583
This weapon is
the God we worship, Singappa.

1546
02:45:24,208 --> 02:45:28,041
Do it for the sake of the mountain.

1547
02:45:30,291 --> 02:45:31,250
Do it.

1548
02:45:35,916 --> 02:45:37,541
I cannot do this, Vara.

1549
02:45:39,500 --> 02:45:40,416
Singappa…

1550
02:45:43,208 --> 02:45:44,291
Singappa!

1551
02:46:41,583 --> 02:46:44,708
Don't worry about
the pain in my eyes, Singappa.

1552
02:46:47,583 --> 02:46:51,750
Just focus on the fear
in everyone else’s eyes tomorrow.

1553
02:47:07,375 --> 02:47:10,875
The sea, which had only witnessed
weapons and blood,

1554
02:47:11,583 --> 02:47:15,666
<i>probably broke into tears</i>
<i>over what Vara did.</i>

1555
02:47:16,333 --> 02:47:19,625
<i>It reached out to touch his feet that day.</i>

1556
02:47:26,083 --> 02:47:27,583
Who was capable of killing Devara?

1557
02:47:29,166 --> 02:47:31,375
Who could have driven a knife
through Devara?
