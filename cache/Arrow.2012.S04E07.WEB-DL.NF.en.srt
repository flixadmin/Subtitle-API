FELICITY: <i>Green Arrow
and Speedy need assistance.</i>

157
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,320
-Thanks.
-You should go. Get out of here.

158
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,323
-What about you?
-I've got this. Go.

159
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,744
Felicity, I'm going for an ID
on the Ghost that shot at us.

160
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,870
<i>Stand by.</i>

161
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,169
(GASPS)

162
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,923
Andy?

163
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007
(GROANS)

164
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,969
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

165
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,314
Well, even death's not permanent anymore.
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,858
No, no, it's okay.
Nothing seems to make sense anymore.

167
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,904
Andy... I can't believe this.

168
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,989
It's obvious that HIVE faked his death.

169
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,908
-Maybe it was part of his recruitment.
-You saw the file.

170
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,452
You saw what kind of man my brother was,
what kind of man he is.

171
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,706
We don't know anything.
Not until we hear it directly from Andy.

172
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,248
And how are we supposed to do that?

173
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,792
We get him out of HIVE.

174
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,919
Oliver, how can you still be giving him
the benefit of the doubt?

175
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,629
Because he's your family.

176
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,923
You said he was a good man,
maybe a part of him still is.

177
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,299
-I don't know.
-FELICITY: I do.

178
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:13,385
Last month, at the lumber yard, a Ghost
had a chance to kill you, but didn't.

179
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,013
I remember thinking how weird that was.
Unless that Ghost was Andy.

180
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,599
So, what, he had a chance to kill me
and he didn't,

181
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,933
so I'm just supposed to
forget he's a killer?

182
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,644
No, but you should still remember
he's your brother.

183
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,938
I can't square that circle, Thea.

184
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,398
That HIVE member was
nothing like my brother.

185
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,443
The man who was my brother's dead.
He's dead.

186
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,743
-What brother?
-OLIVER: The brother of the prisoner

187
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,994
that stole the drugs.

188
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,287
But only because he put him up to it.

189
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:43,082
You're crazy. That prisoner attacked you
'cause what you did to his sister.

190
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,250
That's a lie.

191
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,044
It's a hell of a lot more believable
than me putting him up to attacking you.

192
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,337
You know what? You have had it in for me

193
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,381
-ever since you found that knapsack.
-Enough.

194
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,760
I have a means of divining the truth.

195
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,598
Why did you kill that prisoner?

196
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,642
Because he attacked me.

197
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,560
Oh, come on, man.

198
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,813
This isn't the place for
your hocus-pocus crap.

199
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:08,524
Did you have that prisoner
attack Mr. Queen?

200
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,776
Hell no.

201
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,781
You're lying.

202
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,365
According to what? A bunch of twigs?

203
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,035
No, Reiter, don't do this.
You got to hear me out.

204
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,622
It's him. He's the problem.
He's the problem! Hey!

205
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,081
What are you gonna do to him?

206
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,499
Nothing.

207
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:28,169
I believe the wronged
should make things right.

208
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,220
So, you wanted to see me?

209
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
So polite. That's a bit atypical.

210
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,017
Well, a guy gets slapped down
enough times, he learns who's boss.

211
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,936
Apparently not.

212
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:46,813
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

213
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,318
After our meeting last week,
I had an unpleasant encounter

214
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,486
with the Green Arrow and his compatriots.

215
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,364
My security personnel
are under the opinion

216
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:01,577
that you called that meeting so as to
create an opportunity to have me followed.

217
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,621
So your security guys don't trust me,
but what about you?

218
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,041
Trust is an orchid.

219
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,501
Beautiful but delicate.

220
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,380
Requiring ideal conditions
in order to thrive.

221
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,343
Without those conditions, it dies.

222
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:22,932
Tread carefully, Quentin.

223
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,351
Believe it or not,
the death of your daughter

224
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,229
is not the most terrible thing
that I can threaten you with.

225
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,947
(CELLPHONE RINGING)

226
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,083
I don't want to talk to you.

227
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,793
MALCOLM: <i>Then why are
you answering the phone?</i>

228
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,462
Because I...

229
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,802
I would have told you I was stopping by,
but you weren't taking my calls.

230
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,970
What do you want?

231
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,054
To help you.

232
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,057
Those men you killed in Nanda Parbat,

233
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,435
the effects of those deaths
must be wearing off by now.

234
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,478
I'm fine.

235
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,230
The bloodlust has returned, hasn't it?

236
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,899
I have it under control.

237
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,608
You can't control it, Thea.

238
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,157
Who's Lawrence Tanner?

239
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,825
A pedophile.

240
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,452
Multiple accusations, no convictions.

241
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,996
Lives three blocks down.

242
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,455
The world needs one less pedophile,

243
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,792
and you need at least a month of peace.

244
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,795
Look, I'm gonna go out. Okay?

245
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,212
And when I come home,

246
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,841
you better not still be here,
or I am calling the police.

247
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,725
Hey.

248
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,729
Alex hired a security detail,
if you want to sit this one out.

249
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,106
Yeah, I'm gonna be at the bar.

250
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,861
Well, this has to be a better way
than how you usually spend your evenings.

251
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,988
Dressing in leather and tying people up.

252
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,782
There he is.

253
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,492
They're waiting for you on the dais.

254
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,119
Ready for this?

255
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,205
About to find out.

256
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,625
<i>Evening.</i>

257
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,795
<i>It is our great privilege</i>

258
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,757
<i>to be here tonight
to honor the Star City Police Department.</i>

259
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,759
<i>These are a group of men and women</i>

260
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,471
<i>who risk their lives for us
on a daily basis.</i>

261
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,473
<i>Never been an easy job.</i>

262
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,516
<i>And it has certainly
never been more difficult</i>

263
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,393
<i>than it is right now in our city.</i>

264
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,063
<i>These are the people
that keep our streets safe,</i>

265
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:35,940
<i>who watch over us.</i>

266
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,608
<i>They protect us.</i>

267
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,445
<i>For that, I'm grateful,
and so is the rest of Star City.</i>

268
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:50,537
(OLIVER CLEARS THROAT)

269
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:51,956
Not bad.

270
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,416
Not quite as powerful
as the Green Arrow's, but not bad.

271
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,003
Yeah? Maybe I should get him
to endorse me.

272
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,214
I need a favor from you.

273
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,508
Relocation of
one of Darhk's foot soldiers.

274
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,800
Could be a little difficult.

275
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,969
Darhk called me
into his office this morning

276
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,720
for a little chat about
how he doesn't trust me anymore.

277
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,805
Wait, wait, wait. Are you in danger?

278
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,432
I hope not.

279
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,602
But listen, when I was there,
I saw something on his desk.

280
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,438
Something about Slip 52 down at the docks.

281
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,274
Now, if the Ghosts are there,

282
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,984
maybe the one you're looking for
will be there too.

283
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,735
-Okay. Thank you.
-All right.

284
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,322
Hey, honey. How are you?

285
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,867
-Here you go, miss.
-Thank you.

286
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,411
Club soda?

287
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,496
Yeah, it has to be.

288
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,082
Can't have the candidate's bodyguard
getting hammered.

289
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,209
Do you want to talk about it?

290
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,172
Resurrected siblings are
kind of in my wheelhouse.

291
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,715
This ain't quite the same thing, Laurel.

292
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,384
(EXHALES)

293
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,136
Sara wasn't really a...

294
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,264
A member of an organization of killers?

295
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,809
I'm sure there are a million things
going through your head right now.

296
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,145
All I'm saying is, make one of them

297
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,856
an appreciation for the fact
that your brother is actually alive.

298
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,192
Well, why?

299
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:06,447
Why, so I can hold out some kind of
false hope that he might be decent?

300
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,823
He doesn't deserve that.

301
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,783
No, he probably doesn't, but you do.

302
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,661
After Andy died, a part of you died, too.

303
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:15,789
And now, now is your chance to heal.

304
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:17,416
How am I supposed to do that?

305
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,089
I had to look my nephew in the eye

306
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,507
and tell him that

307
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:30,012
he was never gonna see his daddy again.

308
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:31,931
(CRYING)

309
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,104
And the months after Andy died
were the darkest times in my life.

310
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:42,233
I would've given anything,
anything to get Andy back.

311
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,736
I would've sacrificed my life

312
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,990
to have him back
with his wife and his son.

313
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,285
I would've traded my life for a stranger.

314
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,707
-Mr. Queen, it's so nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

315
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,335
Do you think you can get
more funding for the SCPD?

316
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,962
Well, that's certainly a top priority.

317
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,630
-That's great news. Thank you.
-Sure.

318
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,840
Mr. Queen. Huge fan.

319
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,301
Thank you, Mr...

320
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,886
Darhk.

321
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,472
I have some ideas on
how I might contribute to your campaign.

322
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,099
-Do you have a minute?
-Of course.

323
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,519
Well, it's not just about
financial support.

324
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,147
I have strong relations
in the business circles.

325
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,231
Media outlets as well.

326
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,650
This is all well and good,
but I am running unopposed.

327
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,278
So I don't totally understand
how you could help me win.

328
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,904
Oh, it's not about winning.

329
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,823
It's about how much we could accomplish
if we worked together.

330
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,908
Right.

331
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,826
And not to be indelicate, but

332
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,746
a lot has changed in Star City
since your parents held sway here.

333
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,331
The levers of power have changed.

334
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,543
And not understanding that is
what doomed Jessica Danforth's bid.

335
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,128
Hmm.

336
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,547
What do you want, Mr. Darhk?

337
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,757
I read the press release
about your new project.

338
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,759
"The restoration of Starling Bay."

339
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:53,512
Reconsider your plans.
Leave the Bay as it is.

340
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,681
What if I refuse?

341
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,684
Well, then you'll no longer be unopposed.

342
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,270
Mr. Queen.

343
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:03,897
Mr. Darhk.

344
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,113

347
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,784
-What are you doing?
-Oh.

348
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,954
I'm just listing all of the terrible ideas
you've had over the past three years,

349
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,957
of which throwing in with Damien Darhk
has got to be the worst.

350
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,376
I'm not throwing in with Damien Darhk.

351
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,462
I am using him to get at HIVE.

352
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,130
Isn't Lance already our man on the inside?

353
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,467
Lance has lost Darhk's trust,
making this the only way...

354
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,801
To get yourself killed.

355
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,720
You remember the last time

356
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,139
you tried to take down
an evil organization from the inside?

357
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,474
-This is different.
-Why?

358
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,059
Because you'd be doing it as Oliver Queen?

359
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,227
Yep.

360
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,853
What about your mayoral campaign?

361
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:47,733
You cannot be an effective candidate
for mayor and Darhk's undercover stooge.

362
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,985
(CLEARS THROAT) Taking
down Darhk is more important.

363
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,280
Especially now that we know
that he has Andy under his thumb.

364
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,825
First, there's a whole long list of things
that we don't know about Andy.

365
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,870
Second, you didn't decide
to run for mayor to take down Darhk.

366
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,249
You did it to give this city something
that the Green Arrow can't give them.

367
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,917
Hope. Inspiration.

368
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,087
Don't lose sight of that.

369
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,922
Not even for John.

(GROANS)

371
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,854
This man betrayed us.

372
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:29,316
He sent an innocent man,
a useful man, to his grave.

373
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,904
He conspired against me, you,
all of his brothers.

374

I'm begging you.

380

Come on, Queen.

Please! Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

Your friend was reunited

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,338
Yeah, crazy.

391
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,341
So have you given him your crown yet?

392
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,761
I mean, you held the record with
five years thinking Oliver was dead, so...

Ah. (CHUCKLES)

it must have been for you, Thea.

-Okay.

This is Alex. (WHISPERING) Sorry.

Hi, there. What're you drinking?

400
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,116
Maybe I can buy you another.

401
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,452
I don't think my date
would like that very much.

402
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,995
Well, I don't see him here.

How am I supposed to tell Carly?

411
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,164
She has a right to know, Johnnie.

412
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,666
She's better off thinking he's dead.

I'm not sure that's your call to make.

I'm not sure about anything.

415
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,466
You know, when I first found out
about the Flash,

416
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,553
and Lazarus Pit, and what it did for Thea,

417
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,807
I began to daydream about Andy being back.

418
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,437
I would just play with that idea,

419

"My brother's back."

420

as can be expected, right?

00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,237
No, I think I should stay.

473
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:55,827
But I just remembered I got that thing
in the whatever with the what's it.

474
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,329
Oliver, let this go, man.

475
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,916
I have.

476
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,001
And you almost got yourself killed.

477
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:05,962
I've been a lot closer to "almost killed."

478
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,213
Andy made his choice.

479
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,715
You don't know that.

480
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,051
John, you saw what was going on tonight.

481
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,595
Those men were under
the influence of something.

482
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,806
Whatever pill is scrambling their DNA

483
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,474
is also making them susceptible
to Darhk's suggestion.

484
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,435
All right. Just because you have
a blind spot for your family,

485
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,770
don't expect me to as well.

486
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,730
-That's not what this is about.
-The hell it's not.

487
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,733
Family is exactly what this is about.

488
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:30,862
Criminal or not,
under the influence or not,

489
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,865
Andy let his son and his wife
believe he was dead,

490
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,033
for eight years, Oliver.

491
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,618
(LOUDLY) Eight years!

492
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,996
And there's no excuse for that!

493
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,374
-None.
-John, I'm... You don't know.

494
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,626
Oliver, you don't know.

495
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,877
You have this inexplicable way of

496
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,503
excusing everything
just because it's family.

497
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,797
Oh, it's not "inexplicable."

498
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,132
I'm asking you... (GRUNTS)

499
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,303
I'm asking you to hold out hope for Andy
because I need that hope.

500
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:59,474
I need to believe that
no matter what happens in our lives,

501
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,268
no matter how much darkness infects us,

502
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,313
I need to believe
that we can come back from that!

503
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:08,399
DIGGLE: And it was exactly that thinking
that led you to the League last year.

504
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,070
Doesn't seem like
you learned much from that.

505
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:13,614
Felicity told you.

506
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,156
Getting in bed with Darhk, Oliver,

507
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,075
I don't see how you can even consider it.

508
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,624
We are gonna take this guy down.

509
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,667
And no idea is off the table.

510
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,878
Look, you're doing things
differently, Oliver.

511
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:32,507
Fighting Darhk from the inside
is just fighting Darhk in the shadows.

512
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,259
You want to do things differently?

513
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,261
You want ideas? Fine.

514
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,181
Let's take this son of a bitch down
in the light of day.

515
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,275
Hey.

516
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,943
Just in time.

517
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:53,987
For what?

518
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:58,533
Roasted lizard with a little bit of
coriander and sea salt.

519
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,786
I've gotten better at removing the skin
with a sharp rock.

520
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,620
I ate already.

521
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,041
Thank you.

522
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:11,963
Are you all right?

523
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:13,674
Had a hard day.

524
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,095
Taiana, I have to...

525
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,016
I have to tell you something
about your brother.

526
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,143
Vlad?

527
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,021
Is he all right?

528
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,315
No.

529
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,358
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,777
What do you mean?

531
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:37,405
-Is he...
-Taiana, I'm very sorry.

532
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,157
(TAIANA CRYING)

533
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,540
-Hey.
-Hey.

534
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:52,462
Sorry, I had Curtis grab some more toys
so I could keep working on your tooth.

535
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,798
That's okay. I don't think
we're gonna be using that

536
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,467
table for eating tonight, anyway.

537
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:02,430
Oliver and John are busy fighting over
John's not-so-dead-after-all brother.

538
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,057
Do I even want to ask?

539
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,226
Let's just say you no longer
corner the market

540
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,685
on not being as dead as people think.

541
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,605
Though in John's brother's case,
he does have a pretty good excuse.

542
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:14,442
Unlike some people. Have you seen anyone?

543
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:16,361
Of course not, I've been busy here
working on your tooth.

544
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,528
You're stalling.

545
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,281
Ray, when you come back from the dead,
you're supposed to start living again.

546
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,532
What's going on?

547
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,536
I've been catching up
on the past six months.

548
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,831
My company, my city, my life.

549
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,793
And I feel like Tom Sawyer
watching his own funeral.

550
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,669
Except in my case, nobody really cares.

551
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,296
That is not true, Ray.

552
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,758
Renaming Starling "Star City" is nice.

553
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,510
But then, take a look
at what's happened to the place.

554
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,597
And my company, this thing I built
that was supposed to outlast me,

555
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,141
is now on life support.

556
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,309
Because it needs you.

557
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,020
To do what?

558
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,313
The same thing I was doing
before I "died"?

559
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,149
Obviously, that didn't amount to anything.

560
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,776
Self-pity is not a good look on you.

561
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,568
Yeah. I don't think it's self-pity.

562
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,487
I think it's self-reflection.

563
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,573
If I'm gonna come back to life,

564
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,576
I have to figure out
what it is that I'm living for.

565
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,413
Okay.

566
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,582
I played around with your bicuspid a bit.

567
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,754
The compound definitely broke down
the residual DNA on the tooth.

568
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,672
It's pretty inventive, actually.

569
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:22,010
Is there any way to reconstitute the DNA,
so we have a shot at ID'ing these guys?

570
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,806
No. Once the alleles are decomposed,
they're gone for good.

571
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,557
-Yeah.
-So, since that was a dead end,

572
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,268
I took another look at the polymer
the fake tooth was made of.

573
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:34,439
Uh... I found
faint traces of sodium fluoride.

574
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,606
Like, from water?

575
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,442
There's no way that the
concentration could be high enough

576
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,527
to leave behind any sort of residue.

577
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,987
It would if there was an unusually high

578
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,198
sodium fluoride count
in the drinking water.

579
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,077
Like, say, at a facility that was
closed down for that very reason.

580
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,872
Muller Psychiatric Center.

581
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,707
You gotta admire the irony.

582
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,419
Damien Darhk keeping his army of bad guys
in a defunct loony bin?

583
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:59,630
Not bad for a guy who thinks
his life didn't add up to anything.

584
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,262
Yeah. Never gonna outlive that one.

585
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,181
Everyone clear on the plan?

586
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,059
You know, I wasn't the first 80 times
we went over it,

587
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,435
but now I think I got it.

588
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,896
What's going on, guys?

589
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:19,860
Felicity found a probable location
for the Ghosts' base of operations.

590
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,112
These guys are not
gonna be easy to take out.

591
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,363
How are you feeling?

592
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,449
We're not trying to take down the Ghosts.
We don't have the manpower.

593
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,659
We're going after Andy.

594
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,413
Guys, Oliver nearly got himself killed
trying to help Andy.

595
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,748
I'm not letting you do the same.

596
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,127
I'm sorry,
but it's not really just up to you.

597
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,754
I did everything that I could
to bring my sister back,

598
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,422
and I think your brother
deserves the same.

599
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,592
No, no. That's just it.
I don't think he does.

600
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,719
I don't know what Oliver told you...

601
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:48,930
FELICITY: He told them
the only two things that matter.

602
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,682
Andy's under Darhk's influence,
and we need to get him out.

603
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,519
I can't let you risk your lives for
someone who does not deserve it.

604
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,105
That's your call. But we've made ours.

605
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,107
Let's move.

606
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:12,703
-OLIVER: <i>We're on site.</i>
-Uh...

607
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,206
Satellite's reading a hell of a lot
of activity for 3:00 in the morning.

608
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,583
I'm guessing 50 or so Ghosts,
plus who-knows-how-many recruits.

609
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,628
Wait. If the Ghosts are wearing
their usual Halloween costumes,

610
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,006
then how are we supposed to tell
which one's Andy?

611
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,840
That's what your fancy
new cameras are for.

612
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,551
A little gift from Curtis.

613
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,973
<i>The infrared lenses should
virtually unmask our Ghosty friends.</i>

614
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,099
Sick.

615
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,475
Okay. Ready?

616
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,316
I'm in position.

617
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,652
In position.

618
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,993
This isn't just a base of operations.
It looks like a staging area.

619
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,369
-For what?
<i>-Equipment.</i>

620
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,539
Military crates marked "G-six-five."

621
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:57,999
<i>Does that mean anything?</i>

622
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,709
Maybe they're playing Bingo.

623
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,044
Let's assume that's not it.

624
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,004
-Deadly Bingo.
-No. (CLEARS THROAT)

625
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,547
We need to get an ID on Andy.

626
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,092
When you do,
you wait for my signal before engaging.

Yes.

it completely backfired.

714
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,998
And my bloodlust was gone.

to make that permanent.

you could be a little patient with me?

given the state the city is in.

But I'd like everyone to know that I'm not
blind to Star City's problems.

740
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,893
And I wouldn't be here today

if I wasn't confident that this program
could help solve them.

742
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:45,776
And the reason I chose the Bay
is because it's in the center of the city.

743
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:51,198
It's out in the open, for everyone to see.

744
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,661
The fight to save Star City isn't gonna be
fought in the shadows.

745
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,623
It's gonna be fought in the light of day.

746

748
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,839

to save this city.
