1
00:00:01,076 --> 00:00:03,726
Time travel is real, and all of history

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:06,062
is vulnerable to attack,
which is why we must

3
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:08,030
travel through time to stop the spread

4
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:10,232
of these so-called time aberrations

5
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:12,702
and to erase their damage to history.

6
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:15,204
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

7
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:17,373
so, please, don't call us heroes.

8
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,308
We're legends.

9
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:21,805
Previously, on “Legends of Tomorrow”...

10
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:23,474
- Mick has elected to stay.
- Why?

11
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:25,576
Someone needs to be
present to destroy the Oculus.

12
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,412
Get him out of here.

13
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:35,486
He traded his life
for ours. He was a hero.

14
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:38,022
Leonard. I must be losing my mind.

15
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:39,656
You're not riding ahead, Mick.

16
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:42,226
That's why I'm here...
To set you straight.

17
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,628
The amulet. Why is it so important?

18
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,564
Hand over the box.

19
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:49,066
I swiped it off Darhk.

20
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:51,001
You have something
we need. I would like to

21
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:52,836
- broker a deal with you.
- How did you manage

22
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:54,905
- to defeat him?
- I gave him the amulet.

23
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:56,140
It's a compass.

24
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:58,342
Compasses generally find things.

25
00:00:58,344 --> 00:01:02,012
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

26
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:04,648
It can be used to
rewrite reality itself.

27
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,183
- How do we find it?
- You remember

28
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:10,154
- Captain Rip Hunter?
- Cut!

29
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,475
_

30
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:28,739
Oof.

31
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:30,574
Gideon! What's our status?

32
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:32,843
The Waverider is surprisingly
not destroyed, Captain.

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,447
Though that condition
may not be permanent.

34
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:45,722
How long will it take to effect repairs?

35
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:46,790
15 years.

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,593
Well, that won't do.

37
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:01,305
What is that, Captain?

38
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:04,808
There are some things,
Gideon, I can't even tell you.

39
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:11,381
Initiate repair procedures.

40
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:13,784
Auto-repair engaged.

41
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:15,385
Shogun Ballistic.

42
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:17,588
Captain, that is the shut down code

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,270
for my primary syst...

44
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:36,673
Angels and ministers of grace...

45
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,742
defend us...

46
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:46,325

47
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:02,299
You're my best friend.

48
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:06,803
I love you, man.

49
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,374
What did you hear?

50
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:14,811
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

51
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:17,447
Though... Though if
I did, I suppose I...

52
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:22,152
- I might be flattered.
- I wasn't talking to you.

53
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:24,354
Perhaps you've had enough
to drink for for one night.

54
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:28,525
That's the point. I haven't had enough.

55
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:32,663
So if you weren't talking to me, then...

56
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:34,698
- Snart.
- Snart what?

57
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,734
I've been talking to Snart.
I've been seeing him lately.

58
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:39,903
You... You've been having
hallucinations of Leonard Snart?

59
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,805
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you

60
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:43,974
I believe you.

61
00:03:43,976 --> 00:03:46,243
- You can fix me.
- Me?

62
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:47,911
- You're a doctor.
- Of nuclear physics.

63
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:49,947
- Same thing.
- Mr. Rory, I can't...

64
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,650
You can fix me, but you
can't tell anybody about it.

65
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:54,918
- You got that?
- Yes.

66
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,420
You got that?

67
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:04,394
Nate.

68
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:05,696
- Nate.
- Nate!

69
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:11,602
Sorry, guys. It helps me concentrate.

70
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:13,103
It's 3:00 in the morning.

71
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:15,239
Amaya and I were trying to sleep.

72
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,407
Not together.

73
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:19,743
- What are you doing up so late?
- Just trying to figure out

74
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,512
what the Legion of Doom
wants with those two amulets.

75
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:24,281
The “Legion of Doom”?

76
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:27,284
Darhk, Merlyn, and the Speedster.

77
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:28,852
It's from a Hanna-Barbera cartoon

78
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:31,722
I liked when I was a kid.
Sorry I woke you guys up.

79
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:34,224
- We... We weren't together.
- He knows, Ray.

80
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:35,298
Yeah.

81
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:37,160
Well, have you figured anything out?

82
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:38,962
Well, I carbon dated
the amulet that Sara

83
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:41,965
- took from Darhk in 1987.
- Before she gave it back

84
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,700
to the Legion of Doom, I'm guessing.

85
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:46,970
Yeah, and Gideon puts
the amulet's date of origin

86
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:48,672
around 30 A.D.

87
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:52,109
Huh, high concentrations of
manganese, copper, and zinc,

88
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:54,177
- which would make bronze.
- Correct.

89
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:57,447
Now, Roman Centurions put
bronze in all their metalwork

90
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:59,850
circa 30 A.D. I also sketched

91
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:02,252
the two amulets the
best I could from memory,

92
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:04,721
but they don't match
any artifacts on record.

93
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,793
What if they're not two artifacts?

94
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,766
What if they're one?

95
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:20,871
Shut up.

96
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:26,510
The Longinus Medallion.

97
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:27,811
Huh.

98
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:30,113
Longinus is the name
generally associated

99
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,349
with the Roman Centurion who
pierced the side of Christ

100
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:33,717
during the Crucifixion.

101
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:36,687
Yeah, he was blind and
got the blood of Jesus

102
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:38,121
in his eyes, and then
he could see again.

103
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:40,824
- Look at you.
- What? I went to Sunday school.

104
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:43,493
Now that blood allegedly
got on the medallion

105
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:47,354
and empowered it and the
spear with magical powers.

106
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,678
Well, why does the Legion of Doom

107
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,080
- want the medallion?
- “Legion of Doom”?

108
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:52,649
- Yeah.
- Don't ask.

109
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:55,351
Well, according to legend,
the medallion calls for

110
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,587
the spear and basically
takes you right to it.

111
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:00,256
The spear is also
known as the Holy Lance

112
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,591
or the Spear of Destiny.

113
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,259
Hey, hold on, this all just sounds like

114
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,961
an Indiana Jones movie.

115
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:07,397
“Raiders of the Lost Ark” is
the reason I became a historian.

116
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,799
- Did you know that?
- Okay, so the Legion

117
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,202
wanted the medallion so
they could get the spear.

118
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,870
But what do they want with the spear?

119
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:16,739
Well, the spear allegedly has the power

120
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,508
to rewrite reality.

121
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,477
But how's that different
from us traveling through time

122
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,111
and making changes to history?

123
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:25,181
Changes to history cause
timequakes and aberrations,

124
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:29,619
which we can undo. Changes
to reality, however,

125
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:31,187
those are permanent.

126
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,622
Great.

127
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:35,525
And I just handed them
over the medallion.

128
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:38,428
Whoa, in exchange for Grey's life.

129
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,763
Any one of us would have made that call.

130
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:43,800
Would Rip?

131
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:50,337
_

132
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:53,710
So much for sunny California.

133
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,078
Wh-we're done here, we need to go

134
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,280
to the 1600 block of Vine Street.

135
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:59,249
- Why, pray tell?
- It's where Frank Sinatra's

136
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,818
star is on the Walk of Fame.
I have always wanted to see it.

137
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,119
I'm not sure if that's part of

138
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:04,821
our little trinket's itinerary.

139
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:07,891
I said “when we're done.”
As far as magical artifacts go,

140
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:10,727
this one is frustratingly unspecific.

141
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,762
Actually, like most magical artifacts,

142
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,197
its ways are nuanced.

143
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,099
That's just a fancy word for vague,

144
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,634
and I'm getting tired of walking.

145
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,802
True, we could use some transportation.

146
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:24,574
Oh.

147
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:30,179
- Oh, wow.
- Afternoon, fellas.

148
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:32,282
Not so fast, buddy.

149
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:35,685
Wallets. Now.

150
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:38,454
- Just give us your motorcycles.
- Excuse me?

151
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:42,659
Give us the bikes,
and we'll let you live.

152
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,761
What are you, some sort
of comedians or something?

153
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:47,263
Or something.

154
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,600
That charming-looking
fellow is Cal DeVito.

155
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:52,435
Instead of being killed,
he's supposed to go on

156
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:55,471
to invent a new carburetor
for shovelhead motorcycles.

157
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:57,407
As far as aberrations go,
don't you think that's a bit...

158
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,075
Puny? Yeah.

159
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:01,611
Well, Gideon was going over
autopsy reports, and, well,

160
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:03,313
I'll just let her tell you. Gideon?

161
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,481
Both gentlemen were
killed in close quarters

162
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,550
with sezuki strikes to
the xiphoid processes

163
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:08,751
of their sternums.

164
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,887
A League of Assassins technique.

165
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,922
Weren't Darhk and Merlyn former LOA?

166
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:15,224
They must be getting
closer to the Holy Lance.

167
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:16,859
I'm leaning toward Spear of Destiny.

168
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:19,295
- I prefer Holy Lance.
- Can't imagine why.

169
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,431
Gideon, plot a course
for the point of origin

170
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:22,899
of the aberration.

171
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:26,336
I already have, Captain.
Hollywood, 1967.

172
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,737
Is the professor all right?

173
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,406
Uh, depends on what you
mean by “all right.”

174
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,808
He's helping Mick with something.

175
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,176
I don't know. He's being kind of

176
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,444
quiet about it.

177
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:35,878
Well, I hope he figures it out soon,

178
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,447
'cause if the Legion of Doom is here...

179
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:38,915
Really like how the name's catching on.

180
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,450
We're gonna need Mick and Firestorm.

181
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,086
Let's figure out what's going on first.

182
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:45,955
Look, all I know is
Gideon said the motorcycles

183
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:47,590
Darhk and Merlyn stole are here.

184
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,258
What, so we're just
supposed to walk around

185
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,361
until we see a sign that
says, “this way”?

186
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,996
Good idea.

187
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:55,809
_

188
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:59,302
Subjugating the world to
your rule isn't saving it.

189
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:02,105
You would create a
wasteland, and call it peace.

190
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,941
Do not misquote Tacitus to me.

191
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:06,909
I knew him well. I lived long enough

192
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,512
to watch civilizations rise and fall...

193
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:12,615
Cut, just stop. Cut, please.

194
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:14,384
All right, cut.

195
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:18,021
And everyone take five.

196
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:23,459
I just need to... think.

197
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:27,436
George.

198
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:29,866
What do I do?

199
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:31,734
- I mean, it wasn't that bad.
- What?

200
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,436
You saw him. I just can't seem

201
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:37,006
to get Peter to bring
any menace to the part.

202
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,808
- I may need to recast.
- No, no, no.

203
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,343
You don't have time to recast, okay?

204
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,178
Your thesis film is due
in less than a month.

205
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,747
I know, I know, but a film is only

206
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:47,517
as good as its villain,
and I have an antagonist

207
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,586
who is as threatening as a wiener dog.

208
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:52,121
Rip Hunter.

209
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,223
No, I'm the director.
Rip's being played

210
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:57,226
by Adam Glassman. He's
probably at craft services.

211
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,661
It's nice to see your reputation

212
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:00,329
for dry humor is well-earned.

213
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,098
You see, this is what I am talking about.

214
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,399
You guys are good.

215
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,734
Yeah, these are...
These are great props.

216
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:05,968
Did you make these yourself?

217
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,799
Hey, we are on something of a clock here.

218
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:10,339
Oh, my God. It's Rip.

219
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:12,308
Don't worry. We got you, Rip.

220
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:14,977
Who the hell are you guys?

221
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:16,045
We don't have time for this.

222
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,691
Get out of here. Save yourself.

223
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,393
- No, what about you?
- I can't leave

224
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:31,661
my film in there.

225
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:35,765
Get out of here, man! No film is worth

226
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,967
losing your life!

227
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,340
Get Rip out of here.

228
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:45,675
Hey, come on, we gotta go.

229
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:47,777
Get... away... from... me.

230
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,179
What the hell, man?

231
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,784
Fall back.

232
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,519
- Stay right there!
- Hands! Hands!

233
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:57,787
Freeze! Don't move!

234
00:10:57,789 --> 00:10:59,322
- Hey.
- Whoa, where do you think

235
00:10:59,347 --> 00:11:00,689
- you're going?
- Uh, my movie's inside.

236
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:02,692
- These lunatics just showed up.
- Do you know these people?

237
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,060
- No, no, no, I...
- Against the wall, long hair.

238
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:05,461
What? No, but my movie...

239
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:07,363
Can wait. You're under arrest.

240
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:12,335
What? Oh, my God, oh, my God.

241
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:18,423
Well, that went apocalyptically awful.

242
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:20,025
I got Nate and Amaya researching where

243
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,494
the police took Rip. We'll
spring him, and then...

244
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:24,997
We'll find out what the
hell is going on with him.

245
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:29,301
Dude tried to bludgeon me
with this... non-lethal weapon.

246
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:31,270
Look, we don't know
how long he was in 1967.

247
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:32,838
He could be suffering from time drift,

248
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,239
which is why he doesn't remember us.

249
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:36,275
The question is how?

250
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:37,943
Well, he could have
time-scattered himself

251
00:11:37,945 --> 00:11:39,545
like he did with us.

252
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:42,714
Nah, he sent us his final
message after scattering us.

253
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,578
He wouldn't have been able
to use it for a second time.

254
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:47,719
Well, he got here somehow
and so did Darhk and Merlyn.

255
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:50,389
- The Legion of Doom.
- I'm not calling them that.

256
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,858
- Okay.
- But if they came to 1967

257
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,027
looking for Rip, that means...

258
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,229
The medallion must have led them there.

259
00:11:57,231 --> 00:11:58,997
Rip has the Spear of Destiny.

260
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,634
We gotta bust him out of jail
before they get to him first.

261
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,570
And ever since, I've had...

262
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:07,239
the fear of giant toads.

263
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:11,210
Mr. Rory, while I appreciate
the thoroughness of insights,

264
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:14,646
perhaps we could focus
on the issue at hand.

265
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:17,049
I thought shrinks liked mommy talk.

266
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:18,684
I'm not a shr...

267
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:22,254
You know, I think I've
heard enough on that subject.

268
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:26,258
Now, when did you first
encounter the apparition?

269
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,629
The ghost of Mr. Snart,
when did he first appear?

270
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:32,564
Back in Chicago.

271
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,233
Can you remember anything specific?

272
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:36,301
Something that might
have triggered the vision?

273
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:38,904
He said something
about setting me straight.

274
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:40,272
Why do you think he'd say that?

275
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:42,107
I don't know. Maybe he's...

276
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:45,677
Captain, hello.

277
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,880
How... What can we do for you?

278
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:50,949
It's Rip. Here's here in 1967.

279
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:52,584
That's astonishing. How?

280
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,919
We don't know, but Damien Darhk

281
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:55,420
and Malcolm Merlyn are after him,

282
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:57,422
which means you two
cannot sit this one out.

283
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:58,924
Of course, my apologies.
I was just helping

284
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:03,328
Mr. Rory with his... migraine.

285
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,231
Yes, I... I have a very bad headache.

286
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,866
Well, you're gonna have to suck it up,

287
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:10,302
'cause I need your help
breaking Rip out of jail.

288
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:11,248
What's he doing in prison?

289
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,044
And how do you plan on breaking him out?

290
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:14,435
It involves you playing a shrink.

291
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,255
Do you think you can do it?

292
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:20,746
- If I must.
- Great.

293
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,661
Good day.

294
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:37,396
Can I help you?

295
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:40,732
Yes, I believe you have
one of my patients in custody.

296
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:42,968
Name?

297
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,937
His name...

298
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:48,075
Gideon, a little help?

299
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,479
According to his mug shot, he
was booked as “Phil Gasmer”"

300
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:54,115
Phillip Gasmer.

301
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:55,950
It's imperative that he be released

302
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:57,351
into my custody immediately.

303
00:13:57,353 --> 00:14:00,321
He suffers from
delusions of being pursued

304
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:02,390
by futuristic spacemen.

305
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:05,359
Oh, yeah. That guy.

306
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:07,929
This way.

307
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,371
Astonishing. It's really you.

308
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:20,208
Yeah, it's me. Who are you?

309
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,546
I'm your doctor, Mr. Gasmer.
I'm here to take care of you.

310
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:28,983
I have never laid eyes
on you before in my life.

311
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:31,152
Memory problems are
a part of the delusion.

312
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:35,489
I'll have to admit him.
He can't be treated here.

313
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:40,061
No, don't leave! This
man is not my doctor.

314
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,395
I am not crazy!

315
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:43,364
Hey, I know, I know. It's okay.

316
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,733
Look, my name is Sara
Lance. This is Mick Rory

317
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:48,836
and Martin Stein. We're your friends.

318
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:52,640
- Two of them are.
- You're one of them.

319
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,109
Help!

320
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:58,112
- Hey, okay, hey, hey, hey.
- Help! Help!

321
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,348
Listen to me, all right? Calm down.

322
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,084
We're here to help
you. You gotta trust me.

323
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:07,088
- Your name is Rip Hunter.
- Rip Hunter is a figment

324
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,358
of my imagination. Help!

325
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,492
Mick.

326
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,867
We've got Rip.

327
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:22,703
We're headed for the extraction point.

328
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:26,474
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

329
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:27,909
Oh.

330
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:32,313
Can I help you?

331
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,451
Hey.

332
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:45,293
Sara, you got incoming. Darhk and Merlyn

333
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:47,361
just entered the precinct.

334
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,434
Yeah, I see them. They're
blocking our escape.

335
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:55,002
There must be another way out.

336
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:01,342
Ray, how well can you fly the Waverider?

337
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:03,010
Thought you'd never ask.

338
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:05,646
Wait, you know how to fly the ship?

339
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:07,381
Sure do. I just have to channel

340
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,350
my inner Han Solo.

341
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:11,352
- Gideon does most of the work.
- She does?

342
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,020
- I do.
- Huh.

343
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:14,722
Where to, Cap?

344
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:23,097
All right, we're here.

345
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:25,266
Get to the cargo bay.

346
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:30,171
Ray, do not crash my ship.
You break it, you buy it.

347
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:42,883
- Get away from me.
- Captain Hunter,

348
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:45,353
- you must listen to us.
- Why do you keep

349
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:49,056
calling me that? Is
this some kind of joke?

350
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,559
Rip, just calm down, okay?
We need you to remember.

351
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:55,997
Your name is Rip Hunter.
You are a Time Master.

352
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,766
You fly the Waverider. It's a timeship.

353
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,570
Rip! Rip, just wait.

354
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:15,349
This cannot be happening.
You're... Am I dreaming?

355
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:18,252
- Rip?
- Ooh, God.

356
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,888
Did I drop some really bad acid?

357
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,224
- Rip, be careful.
- Why?

358
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:26,093
I'm hallucinating.
There is no such thing

359
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:29,663
as Rip Hunter, and there's no such thing

360
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:30,998
as a timeship.

361
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:35,836
There's a...

362
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:42,243
Get to the ship. Go!

363
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,182
- Let's go!
- Guys, come on!

364
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:50,951
- Quick! Get on!
- Let's go!

365
00:18:02,378 --> 00:18:04,045
Well, Gideon?

366
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,079
I'm afraid the news isn't good, Captain.

367
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:08,008
A deep scan reveals
that Captain Hunter's

368
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,477
neural architecture has
been completely restructured.

369
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,946
His limbic system reprogrammed
with a new identity.

370
00:18:12,948 --> 00:18:16,050
So it isn't time drift.

371
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:20,621
Rip didn't forget who
he was. He... changed.

372
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:23,090
Reprogrammed? The technology to alter

373
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:26,060
the brain at that level
doesn't even exist.

374
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:29,163
Unless Rip's brain was
somehow altered by impulses

375
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:31,965
from the... uh... From the...

376
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,668
- From the ship's time drive?
- Uh, yeah.

377
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,904
You're talking temporal electrocution.

378
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:40,007
As a method of time travel,
it's practically suicidal.

379
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,176
Does that track?

380
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:46,280
Uh, I'm not sure. Excuse me.

381
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:49,850
- What's his problem?
- I don't know.

382
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:51,785
Captain Hunter must
have shut down my systems

383
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:53,420
because he knew I would never permit him

384
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:55,956
to make physical contact
with the time drive.

385
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,858
For good reason. He could
have ended up anywhere

386
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,560
and in any period in time.

387
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:00,928
But before he deactivated me,

388
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,663
he recovered something from his parlor.

389
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:05,799
A piece of wood
approximately 0.6 meters long.

390
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,000
A piece of wood?

391
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:11,772
- The Spear of Destiny?
- Could be.

392
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,707
I'm gonna go tell the others.

393
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:18,746
I got an idea.

394
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:23,083
So this would be a new
milestone for you then.

395
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,018
What's your idea?

396
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,955
Why don't we use that thing
to see what's up with my brain?

397
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:31,425
I doubt you'd find the
results you're hoping for.

398
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:33,727
These tests are meant to
find neurological changes,

399
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:36,797
while my theory is that your visions

400
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,933
are the result of emotion.

401
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:41,435
You saying I'm crazy?

402
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:44,304
I'm saying you're feeling something,

403
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:46,440
and in the wake of
your partner's demise,

404
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:48,175
that's perfectly normal.

405
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:53,280
I don't do feelings.
Run the test, fix my brain.

406
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,082
Hey, what's up?

407
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:57,217
Sara asked us to find
any physical descriptions

408
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:59,086
of the spear that might help us find it.

409
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:01,989
She thinks Rip had it with
him when he traveled to 1967.

410
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,458
And she, um, also wants you to work on

411
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,127
figuring out, um, a way to reverse

412
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:09,596
the effects, uh, on Rip

413
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:12,199
since he came in contact with the, um...

414
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:14,334
Time drive.

415
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:15,969
I've brought up the
time drive's schematics

416
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:18,772
for you, Dr. Palmer.

417
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:21,108
Well, how do you expect me
to understand any of that?

418
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,077
Uh, maybe using one of your four PhDs?

419
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,348
- I don't have four...
- What's wrong?

420
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,952
It's like I should have
memories that aren't there,

421
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:35,189
and I should understand
what this is, but I don't.

422
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:37,791
Yeah, I feel it, too,
it's happening right now.

423
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:40,894
I'm reading this book about
“Santarion Long-inises,”

424
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:43,831
and it's just a bunch of words.

425
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,066
How long have the two of
you been feeling like this?

426
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:52,072
Since, uh... Film set.

427
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:54,308
- Mr. Hunter's film.
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,544
Sara had Jax go and
recover what he could find.

429
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:00,180
“Glucas.” Wait, isn't that what

430
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:01,715
you pretend you're allergic to, Ray?

431
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:04,451
What? First of all, my gluten allergy

432
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:05,986
is very real and challenging.

433
00:21:05,988 --> 00:21:10,724
Secondly, it's G. Lucas,
as in George Lucas.

434
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:12,426
Wait. George Lucas.

435
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:14,495
How do I know that name?

436
00:21:14,497 --> 00:21:18,198
Gideon, pull up George
Lucas on the historical record.

437
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,367
George Lucas, born
in Modesto, California

438
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:23,470
on May 14th, 1944.
Named Modesto Hartman's

439
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:25,372
“Insurance Salesman of the Year”

440
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:28,575
in 1977, 1980, and 1983.

441
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:32,379
- Three years, hmm.
- That doesn't seem right.

442
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:35,382
No.

443
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:37,985
Gideon, is there a version of history

444
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:41,255
where Mr. Lucas did
something else with his life?

445
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:44,458
Apparently this Mr.
Lucas is an aberration.

446
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,426
He's not the aberration.
The Legion of Doom

447
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:47,861
scaring him is the aberration.

448
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:49,596
An aberration that
directly affects our lives.

449
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:53,400
Okay, calm down. Take it back.

450
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:55,135
Gideon thinks that the Legion's attack

451
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:56,670
on Mr. Hunter's film set caused

452
00:21:56,672 --> 00:21:59,039
this George Lucas guy
to quit movie making.

453
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,008
As a result, he never
made some movie about

454
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,342
space battles or another one about

455
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:04,244
an improbably handsome archaeologist.

456
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:05,979
And we care about this because...?

457
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:08,982
In the unaltered timeline,
Dr. Palmer sees “Star Wars”

458
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,718
as a child, and is inspired
to become an inventor.

459
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,354
Likewise, Dr. Heywood
chooses to be a historian

460
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:17,024
after seeing “Indiana
Jones” instead of becoming

461
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:18,892
a yoga instructor.

462
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:21,061
- Oh, man.
- Wait, so you're telling me

463
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:23,530
that because some film
geek drops out of school,

464
00:22:23,532 --> 00:22:26,833
my inventor and my historian
are now essentially useless?

465
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:28,335
- Yes.
- Hey!

466
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:30,904
If the aberration is not corrected, yes.

467
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:33,240
We need to fix this now.

468
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:35,609
I fear you may already be too late.

469
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:38,245
As of today, George Lucas
is no longer enrolled

470
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:39,546
in film school.

471
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:06,914
There he is.

472
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,516
George Lucas, the man who inspires

473
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:10,718
both of our careers, supposedly.

474
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,921
- Well, let's go inspire him.
- Guys, maybe I should do the...

475
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:15,957
Hey, George. Remember us?

476
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,258
- Hey!
- I had metallic skin.

477
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,559
- No, no.
- Hey...

478
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:20,495
- No, no, no, no.
- Look, time takes

479
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,163
time to harden, and sooner or later,

480
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,865
we're gonna lose our
superpowers the same way

481
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,500
we're losing our memories.

482
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:27,502
If you don't make the
movies that you make,

483
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,270
I don't become a brilliant inventor.

484
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:32,140
And I don't become an
incredibly handsome historian.

485
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:34,375
I haven't made any movies yet, okay?

486
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:37,945
I'm still in film school. Or I was.

487
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:40,782
That's the point. If you
don't go back to school,

488
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:42,250
you screw up both of our lives.

489
00:23:42,252 --> 00:23:43,785
We don't live up to our full potential.

490
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:45,353
And I do not want to be a heart surgeon.

491
00:23:45,355 --> 00:23:47,188
And I don't want to
be a yoga instructor.

492
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,824
Okay, guys, like I
said, why don't I talk to

493
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:51,292
- our time aberration?
- Yeah, but...

494
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,162
- Shh.
- Stay in school.

495
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:59,834
I'm sorry about my
friends, they're just...

496
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:03,304
- Completely insane?
- Yeah.

497
00:24:03,306 --> 00:24:05,673
But what they say is true.

498
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:08,342
Oh, okay, what... What that you guys

499
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:11,546
are from the future,
that you've somehow seen

500
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:13,314
a bunch of movies that
I haven't even made yet?

501
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:15,016
Well, actually, I'm from the past,

502
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:17,084
but that's beside the point.

503
00:24:17,086 --> 00:24:20,421
Look, George, I don't care about movies,

504
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:23,124
but guys like them?

505
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:25,114
They do.

506
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:27,895
So before you get in that
car and drive back to Modesto,

507
00:24:27,897 --> 00:24:30,264
just think about them, okay?

508
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,033
Them, and all the
millions of other people

509
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:35,069
that your stories will someday inspire.

510
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:39,073
The future of the
entire world is at stake.

511
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:41,375
And you're our only hope.

512
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:48,082
I've never actually seen
your quarters, Mr. Rory.

513
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:50,852
They're charming.

514
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:53,387
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

515
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:56,357
Something unusual,
some sort of receiver.

516
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:59,227
Judging by its design, one sensitive

517
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:01,495
to gravitation-wave transmissions.

518
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:04,565
You're telling me I
have an antenna in my head.

519
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:06,901
Well, the good news is you're not crazy.

520
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:08,277
Oh, really?

521
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:11,038
So, seeing and talking to Snart's real?

522
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,975
Well, in a sense,
yes. Your former partner

523
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:16,544
was killed when the Oculus exploded

524
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:18,079
in a blast of temporal energy.

525
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:22,216
Now, if Mr. Snart was able
to bond with that blast,

526
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:24,919
the version of him you're
now seeing could be...

527
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:27,388
Um, how will I put this?

528
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,925
- Like a time-ghost?
- Precisely.

529
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:32,960
But what I want to know
is how did someone manage

530
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:35,963
to put a device inside your brain

531
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:38,065
without you knowing it?

532
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:40,735
You are Chronos.

533
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:42,937
The Time Masters.

534
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:47,341
They did some sick things
to me when I was Chronos.

535
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:50,044
I'm sorry, I forgot.

536
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:52,413
So what you're saying
is Snart's stuck out there,

537
00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:55,816
blasted into a billion
pieces, floating around

538
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:57,551
in time and space?

539
00:25:57,553 --> 00:26:01,389
A rather simplistic way
of looking at it, but yes.

540
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:03,891
- You're an idiot.
- Excuse me?

541
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:07,028
It didn't have to end like this.

542
00:26:08,564 --> 00:26:12,900
- Mr. Snart, is he here?
- “Why am I here”?

543
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:16,337
Why are you here? You're dead.

544
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:18,406
What's he saying?

545
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:22,510
He's telling me I've gone soft
because I'm still on the ship.

546
00:26:25,014 --> 00:26:27,248
Doc, Doc...

547
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,383
you gotta get this thing out of my head.

548
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:31,986
As I explained, I'm
not a medical doctor...

549
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:36,257
But I'm sure Gideon and I
can figure something out.

550
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:40,428
- That could work?
- In theory, yes.

551
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,769
Huh.

552
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:53,674
Groovy office.

553
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:57,712
It used to be yours.

554
00:26:57,714 --> 00:27:00,214
Come on, none of this is bringing back

555
00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:02,283
- any memories for you?
- Listen, lady,

556
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:05,553
I-I wish that I could be
the guy you want me to be.

557
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:09,423
“Rip,” but I am not.

558
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:14,795
I take it you two were... pretty tight?

559
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:18,065
- Yeah, he saved my life.
- Cool.

560
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:19,533
You.

561
00:27:19,535 --> 00:27:23,304
You saved my life. I was lost.

562
00:27:23,306 --> 00:27:26,307
You came, you recruited
me, you gave me purpose.

563
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:31,145
Oh, it sounds like Sandra.
She's the hero of my... my movie.

564
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:32,680
- That's weird that...
- What?

565
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:37,018
A female hero? Get with the times, lady.

566
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,954
Yo, we're all in this movie.

567
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:41,555
I mean, it's different versions of us,

568
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:44,191
but this is definitely the team.

569
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:47,895
Like on, uh, page 89, my character, Max,

570
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:49,764
- he saves everybody...
- Hold on.

571
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:52,333
You're telling me that this
burnout used repressed memories

572
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:55,002
- to write a screenplay?
- That's not all.

573
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:57,171
He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.

574
00:27:57,173 --> 00:28:00,674
Which you had with you
when you time-jumped

575
00:28:00,676 --> 00:28:03,210
- off the Waverider.
- I don't know...

576
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:05,746
- what you are talking about.
- Yes, you do.

577
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:07,314
- Come on, now.
- What?

578
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:10,484
I just made it all up.
The spear is the MacGuffin.

579
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:11,518
The what?

580
00:28:11,543 --> 00:28:13,687
The thing in the movie
that everyone's trying to get.

581
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:15,923
- Well, where is it?
- In the movie?

582
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:19,326
It... It's in pieces. Rip
just has a fragment of it.

583
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:23,164
What inspired you to write it that way?

584
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,765
I don't know.

585
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,333
I just had this old piece of wood.

586
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:29,136
I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.

587
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:30,871
- Where is it?
- Uh, I gave it

588
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:36,977
- to my prop master, George.
- Oh, great.

589
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:39,747
George Lucas has the Spear of Destiny.

590
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,286
Glad you changed
your mind, George Lucas.

591
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:48,456
Going back to film school?
Definitely the right call.

592
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,490
We agree.

593
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,535
Neat trinket. One of the lost

594
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:04,839
totems of Zambesi, right?

595
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:08,542
Ah, Mr. Lucas, you have something

596
00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:11,112
that we have traveled
a very long way to find.

597
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:13,781
A piece of the Spear of Destiny.

598
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:14,982
Where is it?

599
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:22,536
Lady and gentlemen, if you don't mind,

600
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:24,705
- hands up.
- And if you do mind,

601
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:27,507
we'd be happy to kill you.

602
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:31,378
- I'll cover George Lucas.
- And I've got...

603
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,246
- What?
- It's not here.

604
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:34,448
My suit's not here.

605
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,550
I can't steel up.

606
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:37,918
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

607
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,119
Put 'em up!

608
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:40,487
- He was talking.
- Up. Hands.

609
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:43,190
- Shut up.
- They're up.

610
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:45,392
Thank God. I don't think it's here.

611
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:47,160
All right, Spec-y four-eyes. I'm starting

612
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:50,630
to lose my patience with
you. Where is the spear?

613
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:52,899
What spear?

614
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,635
We had a little chat with
the members of your film crew,

615
00:29:55,637 --> 00:29:57,871
and they all claimed the
Spear of Destiny was a prop,

616
00:29:57,873 --> 00:30:00,073
and that you, Mr.
Lucas, were its master.

617
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,476
But the movie was done.
I tossed all the props

618
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:04,044
down the garbage chute.
They were just trash.

619
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:07,981
But, but, but... Shh.

620
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:10,584
I have one question for
you, Mr. Lucas, and your life

621
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:14,020
depends on answering me honestly.

622
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:19,059
Where's the city dump?

623
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:22,596
Gideon, set us down as close
to the location as you can get.

624
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:24,097
Yes, Captain Lance.

625
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:25,699
And, while you're
at it, find Mick and...

626
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:26,867
Grey?

627
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,538
What the hell are you doing?

628
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,340
Brain surgery, what does it look like?

629
00:30:35,744 --> 00:30:37,644
- It's down there somewhere.
- Good.

630
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,913
'Cause you'll never find it.

631
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:43,283
You're right.

632
00:30:43,285 --> 00:30:46,253
You're going to.

633
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:56,196
I could be in Modesto by now.

634
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:58,698
Shut up and dig, George Lucas.

635
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,768
What kind of superheroes
are you guys anyway, huh?

636
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,570
I mean, sure, they have laser
guns, but aren't you guys

637
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:06,440
- supposed to have superpowers?
- Well, we had superpowers,

638
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:08,675
but, because you don't make
“Star Wars,” I don't become

639
00:31:08,677 --> 00:31:10,243
a scientist, and I
don't make the atom suit.

640
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:11,878
Or the serum that turns me into steel.

641
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,480
I can't believe we're all going to die

642
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:14,948
because of a stupid movie.

643
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,117
Perhaps they need a little incentive.

644
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,487
Oh, agreed.

645
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:22,956
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

646
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,357
Oh, no.

647
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,927
What was that? Don't just stand there.

648
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:29,863
- Try and brace it with something.
- Oh, no.

649
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,481
- Oh, guys, I found it.
- Don't show him.

650
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:49,249
What? We are in a trash compactor.

651
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:51,151
- We're going to die.
- No, Ray's right.

652
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:53,086
If we give them what they want,
they're gonna kill us anyway.

653
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,654
-Okay, well, then, what do we do?

654
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:56,623
They're going too
slow. Shoot one of them

655
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,025
- to move things along.
- Which one?

656
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,060
Dealer's choice.

657
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:11,171
What was that?

658
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:39,032
This rescue mission is
not going very well, is it?

659
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:41,201
I'm afraid not, Captain.

660
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:43,937
Would you stop calling me that, please?

661
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:47,307
I am not a captain.
I'm just a regular guy.

662
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,076
So was Captain Hunter.
He had no superpowers,

663
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:53,513
unless you count his
courage, intellect, and honor.

664
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:57,884
Well, what would he do, huh?
Your Captain, if he were here?

665
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,525
You guys, we... we have to give it them.

666
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,160
- There's no other way.
- There is.

667
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:09,796
You have to become a filmmaker.
You have to make movies,

668
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:12,098
and you, George Lucas,
have to believe that.

669
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,833
- What?
- You have to make your movies

670
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:15,635
so that we can become who
we're supposed to become

671
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:17,070
so we can save you.

672
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:18,638
Your movies go on to change the world.

673
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,540
All you have to do is
believe in yourself.

674
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,576
You have to believe you're
gonna make amazing movies.

675
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,778
You have to believe it
like there's no tomorrow.

676
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,613
Say it, George. Say it out loud.

677
00:33:26,615 --> 00:33:29,749
George Lucas, what do you really want?

678
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:32,118
What I really want...

679
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,654
What I really want...

680
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:37,324
What I really
want is to direct!

681
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:39,659
Ahh!

682
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:42,896
Ah!

683
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:03,617
Ahh!

684
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:30,443
- About time you showed.
- Where were you?

685
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:33,413
Always busy, gentleman.
And yet, never late.

686
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:37,384
So who do we kill first?

687
00:34:37,386 --> 00:34:39,853
That would be me.

688
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:46,893
Captain Rip Hunter. It's been ages.

689
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:49,462
I was beginning to think you were dead.

690
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,831
On the contrary, for the first time

691
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:57,937
in recent memory, I am
finally, truly alive.

692
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:03,743
Oh, crap.

693
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:08,214
Hey, does this thing work?

694
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,157
Oh, screw it. Gideon!

695
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,560
Fire! Fire everything!

696
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:26,700
Go!

697
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:35,241
Hey, come on!

698
00:35:35,243 --> 00:35:37,377
Rip! Rip!

699
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:39,512
- Hey, Sara!
- Rip!

700
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:42,015
We gotta go. He's gone.

701
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,918
- Gideon, get...
- Rip!

702
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,041
You couldn't have got him.

703
00:36:07,043 --> 00:36:08,776
You know that, right?

704
00:36:08,778 --> 00:36:10,377
Yeah.

705
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:15,145
Look, Sara, you can't
beat yourself up about this.

706
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,971
It is my responsibility
as Captain to make sure

707
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,273
that everyone gets back on this ship.

708
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:22,308
Everyone.

709
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:26,579
And I failed.

710
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:28,715
You call getting a piece
of the Spear of Destiny

711
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:32,385
and the Medallion a failure?

712
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:35,688
The Legion have nothing.

713
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,758
They have Rip. We lost him, Jax.

714
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,059
Again.

715
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:42,895
But they won't have him for long.

716
00:36:42,897 --> 00:36:47,100
If I know one thing about you,
it's that you don't give up.

717
00:36:47,102 --> 00:36:49,569
When you really want
something, you are unstoppable,

718
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:53,172
and God help anybody that
tries to get in your way.

719
00:36:53,174 --> 00:36:57,243
We are gonna find him, and
we're gonna bring him home.

720
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,754
Is that a promise?

721
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,617
That's a prophecy.

722
00:37:10,158 --> 00:37:11,658
How are you feeling?

723
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,726
Have you seen our mutual
friend around lately?

724
00:37:13,728 --> 00:37:14,994
No.

725
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:17,130
That's because you took the chip out.

726
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,766
Well, actually...

727
00:37:19,768 --> 00:37:21,200
You did take the chip out.

728
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:24,103
Yes, I did, but after
further inspection,

729
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:28,741
I discovered that the device
hasn't functioned in months.

730
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:31,678
It seems you've taken one
too many blows to the head.

731
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,347
So I am going crazy.

732
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:36,182
I'm seeing a ghost.

733
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:38,117
There is no ghost.

734
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,188
Leonard Snart truly is no more.

735
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,925
Then why do I keep hearing his voice?

736
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:49,062
That voice inside your head is your own.

737
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:51,964
If Leonard Snart is second-guessing

738
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:54,500
your moral obligation to this team...

739
00:37:54,502 --> 00:37:57,603
But that's what I feel.

740
00:37:57,605 --> 00:38:00,707
We all hear contradictory voices

741
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,776
inside our heads, Mr. Rory,
creating, what is known

742
00:38:03,778 --> 00:38:07,246
in psychology, as cognitive dissonance.

743
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:11,718
- My brains hurts.
- Well, I'm sure it does.

744
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,153
The complexities of human emotion

745
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:17,990
can at times be mind-boggling.

746
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:22,495
What's this?

747
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:24,163
I thought you got your smarts back.

748
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:26,099
- It's movie night.
- Gideon checked the timeline.

749
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:29,001
It seems all of George's movies
are now part of history again.

750
00:38:29,003 --> 00:38:32,572
Hah, I've almost forgotten how
to perform a median sternotomy.

751
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:34,040
Well, I guess I'll just go back to being

752
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:36,743
a billionaire inventor with four PhDs.

753
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:38,244
So what are we gonna watch first?

754
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:40,012
I mean, after we watch “Raiders.”

755
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:43,483
- Clearly his best film.
- Which he never would've made

756
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:44,684
if he hadn't made “Star Wars” first.

757
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:45,952
Oh, wait, this one sounds cute.

758
00:38:45,954 --> 00:38:47,420
It's called “Howard the Duck”"

759
00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:49,055
No!

760
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:52,291
Okay, maybe movie night
wasn't such a good idea.

761
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:53,926
Maybe you're right.

762
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:57,363
After all, we did just lose Rip.

763
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:00,533
I know Nate and I never
really got to know Rip,

764
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:03,269
but we know how much he
means to the rest of you.

765
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:05,738
- Yeah.
- Might I offer my opinion?

766
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,106
Fire away.

767
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:08,875
I believe Captain Hunter would want you

768
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:11,144
to enjoy yourselves tonight.

769
00:39:11,146 --> 00:39:14,580
All right, then. Dim the lights.

770
00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:17,016
Gideon, pick the movie.

771
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:19,185
We'll watch “Raiders” after.

772
00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:22,188
- Then “Empire.”
- Then “Last Crusade.”

773
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,058
Get comfy. It's gonna be a long night.

774
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:31,764
Uh...

775
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:33,495
hello?

776
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,221
Hello?

777
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,874
Is anybody there?

778
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:46,212
Hey, man.

779
00:39:46,214 --> 00:39:47,880
Welcome, Captain Hunter.

780
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:50,783
Right. You know I was bluffing, right?

781
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:55,788
I am not actually Rip Hunter.

782
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,825
My name is Phil. I am
a full-time film student

783
00:39:58,827 --> 00:40:01,761
and part-time recreational drug user.

784
00:40:01,763 --> 00:40:03,930
Seriously regretting the latter.

785
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:07,166
Oh, I know exactly who you are.

786
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,835
I know that you're one of the protectors

787
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:12,238
of the Spear of Destiny,
and I know that you know

788
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,073
where the other pieces are hidden.

789
00:40:14,075 --> 00:40:16,776
I-I don't know anything.

790
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:20,346
I-I-I-I swear.

791
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:22,448
I am not Rip Hunter!

792
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,750
I am...

793
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:27,887
nobody. I...

794
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:34,907
I can't believe this is happening to me.
