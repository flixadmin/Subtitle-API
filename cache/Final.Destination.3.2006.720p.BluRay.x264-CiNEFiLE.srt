1
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,816
Aah!

2
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,186
- Whoo!
- Ha ha ha!

3
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,198
Aah!

4
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,756
Oh, man! Heh heh.

5
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,263
- Did you see that?
- Woo!

6
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,200
Oh, my God. Ha ha!

7
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,266
- Yes! Yes!
- Nice, nice, nice.

8
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,641
- Aw, sick!
- Worth the wait.

9
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,667
Oh, babe. You missed out.

10
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,701
Yes!

11
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,147
I want to get off.

12
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,558
Whoo! Ow!

13
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,756
Ha ha ha!

14
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,128
That was intense, man.

15
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,395
To feel how that would be
to just crash and burn like that.

16
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,232
Yeah, yeah. Maybe for you,
but our lives are actually goin' somewhere.

17
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,397
Oh! OK, well, where we gotta go
is to the roller coaster.

18
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,236
'Cause our pass is for 9:15.

19
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,673
If we miss that,
we'll stand in line...

20
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,903
for, like, a day and a half,
and that's gonna kill me.

21
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:31,932
- OK!
- All right?

22
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,945
So let's go.

23
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,470
They're totally gonna dig this, man!

24
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,177
OK. Come on, it won't kill us to get
a deep-fried Snickers and a Coke.

25
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,651
Before ridin' Devil's Flight?
Yeah, that might kill me.

26
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,814
No! What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, man.

27
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,050
Ha ha ha!

28
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,271
- Unh!
- Ha ha!

29
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,605
Oh, I'll take that.

30
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,270
No. Come on, gimme.
It's not even mine, Kevin.

31
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,642
It's the yearbook's.
Just... Kevin.

32
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,646
Ha ha!

33
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,341
- Oh!
- Oh, got it.

34
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,180
- Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.
- Hey. Hey. Gimme the...

35
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,083
Ha ha!

36
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,314
- Ow!
- Nice.

37
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,050
Um, could you, like,
please delete that one of Stacy?

38
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,455
Ha ha!

39
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,323
These are for the yearbook.

40
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,487
And I have to turn them in tomorrow
to make a deadline...

41
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,555
and, like, I doubt it if a shot of
Stacy Kobayashi's camel toe...

42
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,759
is gonna make it in there.

43
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,892
Whew. I'd buy two.

44
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,197
Ha ha ha!

45
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,601
Number 38, your order's ready.

46
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,662
That's us.

47
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,173
I am so sorry.

48
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,766
Kevin can get so out of control.

49
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,710
Let me just say
he would make me crazy.

50
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,145
Ha! I mean, you know
I'm such a control freak...

51
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,945
like I couldn't handle that.

52
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,883
I'm breaking up with him.

53
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,982
Couple of weeks.
After graduation.

54
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,356
I've been wanting to for a while.

55
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:56,987
But don't tell anybody, OK?

56
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:58,326
Whoa. Ha ha!

57
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,128
Now, that shot there?
That'll sell some yearbooks.

58
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,658
- I love it.
- I love it.

59
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:08,037
Oh! Oh, all right,
so I'm a total whore.

60
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,564
Come on, go, go, go,
go, go, go go!

61
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,009
Oh, my God, Ashley, you're winning.
You're totally winning.

62
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:14,069
- Am I winning?
- Yeah, come on, hurry!

63
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,978
OK, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

64
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,582
Am I winning? Look around,
I don't want to look.

65
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,846
You're totally winning.

66
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:20,944
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

67
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,353
- Don't look!
- Oh, my God! Come on!

68
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,687
Oh, my God!
I'm winning! I'm winning!

69
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,553
Aah! Aah!

70
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,653
- I won!
- I knew you would.

71
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,324
Oh, my God! Gimme my prize.

72
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,890
- Good job.
- That was so awesome, Ashley.

73
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:35,992
Ashley.

74
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,038
Woo! Ha ha!

75
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:44,600
How ya doin', my brother?
You havin' a good time, huh?

76
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,237
- You like that?
- Ha ha!

77
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,182
Yeah! You like it.
Give it up. Give it up.

78
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,082
Whoo-ooh!

79
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,381
Sam!

80
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,483
Excuse me.

81
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,927
You're not a senior.

82
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,363
And what are
you gonna do about it...

83
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,630
Miss "Cutest Couple,"
Rah Rah? Ha ha!

84
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,398
Mom know you're here?

85
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,134
You are a complete bitch
if you tell her.

86
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,108
Proof where you were.

87
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,770
Take a shot of this.

88
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,039
Ha ha ha!

89
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,677
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
That's three.

90
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,586
# That is three, number three #

91
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,524
# Oh, I'm the man, I'm the man #
Man, I am hot.

92
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,719
- Man, gimme some right here, man.
- Right here! Right here!

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,921
What you doin'?
Get the fuck back. Hoo!

94
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,261
My God, I am good. Here we go.

95
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,664
Boy, I'll tell ya...
Goddamn. Whoo!

96
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,498
Kind sir, step right up!

97
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,504
There ya go. Whaddaya want?

98
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,938
Here we go, baby.
3 for 3. It's all mine.

99
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,635
Here we go. Here we go.

100
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,835
Big prize. Watch out.
Come on.

101
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:51,900
Unh!

102
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,441
Ho ho ho!

103
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,382
# That's what I'm talkin' 'bout #

104
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,146
We gonna get that one.
You want that blue one?

105
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,210
That's the one we gonna get.

106
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,351
Ha ha ha!

107
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:13,629
Ha ha ha ha!

108
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:19,104
You can run, but you cannot hide.

109
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,106
- Yes!
- Whoo! Here we are, baby.

110
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,164
- Yes!
- Whoo!

111
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,233
- There it is.
- Awesome.

112
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,141
Here, get a pic of this. Ahhh!

113
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:28,942
This is the beginning of the end.

114
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,007
Ha ha ha!

115
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,246
Hey, guys, get in line.

116
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,086
Let's go on again!

117
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,151
What's wrong?

118
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,628
I'm...

119
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,826
I was having that feeling
like dejá vu, you know?

120
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,166
Except for something
that hasn't happened yet.

121
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,261
Hey, J.

122
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,532
Come on, man, let's go.

123
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:55,563
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.
- Come on.

124
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,075
What, are you weirded out
by the ride?

125
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,938
'Cause, look, I know you.
And I think that maybe...

126
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,539
you're nervous about
this roller coaster...

127
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:06,210
because they say the real fear
with these rides...

128
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,551
comes from the feeling
of having no control.

129
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:12,716
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.

130
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,420
But it never turns out
to be what they imagine.

131
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,951
Never.

132
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,390
OK.

133
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:23,163
You can run, but you cannot hide.

134
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,898
Oh! Where you guys are right now
if you raise your hands and just...

135
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,906
Ha... cup them slightly...

136
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,340
it'll look you're holding
the devil's balls.

137
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,207
And we'd wanna do that why?

138
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,576
When else you ever gonna see
a dick that big?

139
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:35,875
I'm lookin' at one right now.

140
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:40,443
Ha ha!
Man, you guys are smokin' hot.

141
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,750
- Get out, Frankie.
- Yeah, why are you even here?

142
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,585
Yeah, you graduated,
like, two years ago.

143
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:46,989
I stuck around to monitor
your development.

144
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,891
Yeah. Good to go.
Good to go, baby.

145
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,919
Let's do it. Let's do it.
Come on. Come on.

146
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:55,161
You may never return
from Devil's Flight.

147
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,395
Ha ha ha ha!

148
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,562
You're totally sad.

149
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:04,242
Try not to scream!

150
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:07,211
Ha ha ha!

151
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,650
That was totally awesome!

152
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,016
Yeah! Sweet!

153
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,942
You all right?

154
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,277
There's nothing to worry about.

155
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:44,509
A roller coaster
is just elemental physics.

156
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,576
A conversion of potential energy
to kinetic energy.

157
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,747
Yeah. Odds are like
one in 250 million...

158
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,120
of dying in a roller coaster.

159
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,489
Yeah, yeah,
thanks for that, McKinley.

160
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,824
You're more likely to die
driving to an amusement park...

161
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,852
than dying at one.

162
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,623
Whoo! Heh.

163
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,606
Here we go.

164
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,143
Whoo!

165
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,974
You like this?

166
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,611
Won it on the Wacky Ladder.

167
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,248
You know that ladder deal
that wobbles? Took it.

168
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,020
I like this. It's old school.

169
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,085
Frankie Cheeks
is old school, ladies.

170
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,929
What's that?
Oh, well, it'd be my honor.

171
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,955
Ew.

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,900
Oh! Let's go.

173
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,563
Hey... Baby.

174
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,538
- How many?
- Uh, 4.

175
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,904
- 4.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,272
Uh, gate one.

177
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,571
- Yeah. Front car.
- Yes!

178
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,736
Wait... No. No, please.

179
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,178
I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a hassle.
I just... I can't sit in the front.

180
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,375
I cannot see the tracks. I'll freak.

181
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,941
OK. Take it easy.

182
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,045
Uh, well, Carrie will sit in
the back with you. Right, babe?

183
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,080
Uh! Why me?
What? 'Cause we're girls?

184
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:02,150
Fuck that. I'm going to Berkeley
and I won't get to do this for a while.

185
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,388
I'm sitting in the front.

186
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:05,886
J, just go, OK? I'll live.

187
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:06,226
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

188
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:07,357
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

189
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:09,366
All right, you know what?
We'll just settle this like real men.

190
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,061
How about that? Hmm? Call it.

191
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:12,132
Heads.

192
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,730
Shit! Damn it.

193
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,174
All right, fine, what the fuck.
It's the same ride, right?

194
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,006
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

195
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:23,569
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.

196
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,411
Keep an eye on her, OK?
She's kinda freaked out.

197
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:26,575
- Oh. Cool.
- All right?

198
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,551
Yeah. Boom, buddy.
No problem.

199
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:34,515
Ha ha ha!

200
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:42,093
Aaah!

201
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:54,544
Ohh!

202
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:04,643
Here we go. Hey!

203
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:06,849
J! Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

204
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,188
I'm serious. You know,
payback's a bitch, OK?

205
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:11,023
You know, she might need
some comforting...

206
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:12,653
and I'll be there for her. OK?

207
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:14,960
Hey, no! No.
Get out. Get out.

208
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:16,397
Hey! Find another cockpit,
Top Gun.

209
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,128
No. Get...

210
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:20,193
Let's just get in the back, OK?

211
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,395
Ha ha ha!

212
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,533
Ahem.

213
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,576
Guess who's back?

214
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,171
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

215
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,614
Hey!

216
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,618
I'll meet you at the end.

217
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,988
Here! All right!

218
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,182
Cool!

219
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:43,689
Hey. How'd you guys
get in here?

220
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:45,456
What? I'm 55 inches.

221
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:46,962
- Sure. Come on out.
- Oh, man.

222
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:48,294
You, too. Out.

223
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,526
- Ready?
- Ohh!

224
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:51,966
I told you
we wouldn't get away with it.

225
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:53,026
You OK?

226
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,594
Let's go on the bumper cars.

227
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,572
Come on. Here we go.

228
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,205
Yeah!

229
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,107
What's up, man? I'm good.

230
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:13,449
Dare you to, uh, flash me
them sweet, sweet titties...

231
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,718
when we go through the loop.

232
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:22,021
All right. Ha ha!

233
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:29,499
Yo! What, you can't read?

234
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,743
Oh. Well, can I just put it
in my pocket, man?

235
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:35,802
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

236
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,837
Yeah? Cool.
Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

237
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,048
Oh!

238
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:49,922
Aw, shit!

239
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:54,489
Here you go!

240
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:05,166
Whoo-ooh!

241
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,735
Whoo! Win, baby!
Yes, baby! Win!

242
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,576
Come on!

243
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:12,411
Come on. Get hyped.

244
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:13,746
The first hill's so high.

245
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,217
Yeah.

246
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:18,119
This is what we need!

247
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:20,988
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

248
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:22,252
Whoo!

249
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:24,760
Whoo-hoo!

250
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:26,888
- Let's do this!
- Just win!

251
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,919
Ow!

252
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,767
Whoo!

253
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:34,830
Aw, yeah!

254
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,426
Whoo!

255
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:07,330
Whoo! Shit!

256
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,603
Aah!

257
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,443
Oh, man.

258
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,415
Oh, my God!

259
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,439
Here we go!

260
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:23,179
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

261
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,481
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

262
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,885
Aah!

263
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:27,947
Yeah! Whoo!

264
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:36,526
Aah!

265
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,663
- Aah!
- Aah!

266
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:44,363
Ha ha!

267
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:48,701
Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha!

268
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:50,701
Whoo!

269
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:53,748
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

270
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:56,183
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

271
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:58,483
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

272
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,959
Aah! Aah!

273
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:12,566
Whoo!

274
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:19,837
Yeah! Show me your titties!

275
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:21,002
- Fuck off, Frankie!
- Oh!

276
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:31,650
Aah!

277
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,020
- Aah!
- Aah! Aah!

278
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,525
Aah!

279
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,094
Unh!

280
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:45,867
Oh, shit!

281
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:47,529
- Aah!
- Aah!

282
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,901
Aah!

283
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:53,340
Oh, my God!
We're gonna fall off!

284
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:54,866
Aah!

285
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,614
No!

286
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,621
- Aah!
- Aaah!

287
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:16,798
Aah!

288
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:19,693
Aah!

289
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,532
Oh! Oh!

290
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:29,672
Aah!

291
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:33,612
Unh!

292
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:36,608
Oh!

293
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:38,119
- Yow!
- Kevin!

294
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:40,282
No!

295
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:41,688
Aah!

296
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:50,025
Whoa!

297
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:52,356
Aah!

298
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:56,068
No! Aah!

299
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,647
Aah!

300
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:10,515
Erin, hang on!

301
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:12,919
Erin!

302
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:14,445
- Hang on!
- Don't let go!

303
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,457
I can't.

304
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:17,584
Aah!

305
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:19,254
Aah!

306
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:20,785
No!

307
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:22,953
Aah!

308
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,762
Oh, God!

309
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,359
Hang on, Wen.

310
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:29,303
Hang on! Help me rock it!

311
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:35,935
Unh! Unh! Unh!

312
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,543
Unh!

313
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:43,207
Almost got it! Gently.

314
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,893
Aaaah!

315
00:18:58,101 --> 00:18:59,534
No!

316
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:02,163
Unh! Aah!

317
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:05,174
Aah!

318
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:09,539
Yo. What, you can't read?

319
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:11,240
Oh, well. I'll just...
I'll put it in my pocket, OK?

320
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,373
Yeah.

321
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:13,939
Thanks, bro.

322
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:15,315
Ahh. All right.
Let's do this, Wen...

323
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:17,217
What're you...?

324
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:18,846
Here you go!

325
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:21,118
Yeah! Let's do it, baby! Whoo!

326
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:23,182
We have to get off of here.

327
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,694
No, don't push the button!
Don't! Don't push the button!

328
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:28,391
Unh! Let me off! Let me off!

329
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:29,762
Wen, Wen! It's all right.
Jesus, it's gonna be over...

330
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,528
No! It's gonna crash!
It's gonna crash!

331
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:32,557
Wendy?

332
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:36,197
The hydraulics will rupture!
The tracks'll collapse! Please!

333
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,706
- What's going on?
- Let me off!

334
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,038
Chick's on somethin'.

335
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:40,133
It's all right! You'll be OK!

336
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:41,200
OK, let 'em out. Just the back.

337
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:42,506
Wen. Hey! Wendy!

338
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:45,741
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

339
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:47,977
Relax. Now, what's the matter?

340
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:50,418
I saw it. I saw it in my head.

341
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:52,819
The tracks collapsed.
The roller coaster crashed.

342
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:54,619
No, she was just a little upset before.

343
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:56,683
Man, please, can you please
control that bitch?

344
00:19:56,726 --> 00:20:00,059
Damn. "It's gonna crash!
The hydraulics, the coaster!"

345
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:02,087
Man, she's just trying to get
some fuckin' attention.

346
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:03,861
You know what?
You're a real piece of shit, Lewis.

347
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,367
<i>- Fuck you.
- Fuck moi?</i>

348
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:06,767
No, man, fuck you!
Don't touch me.

349
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:07,770
Ow!

350
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:08,793
Hey, hey!

351
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:10,032
Unh!

352
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:11,040
Just relax!

353
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:12,371
Fight, man!

354
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:13,467
Hey. Hey. Let me out.

355
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,102
Nobody else gets off this ride!

356
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,079
Dude, let me off.

357
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:18,410
So high school.

358
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:19,574
Let's out.

359
00:20:19,616 --> 00:20:20,640
- Calm down!
- Get off of him!

360
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:21,708
- Relax!
- lan!

361
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:24,584
Where you ladies going?
There's a fight.

362
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:28,216
Get him out of here!
Hey! Calm down! Relax!

363
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:30,556
Dude, let me off.
I gotta make sure she's OK.

364
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:32,823
- Relax! Calm down!
- # Hey! Ho! Let's go #

365
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:34,489
- Get your big ass off me, man!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

366
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:36,931
- Let me out!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

367
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,228
Dude!

368
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:41,135
# Hey, ho, let's go,
hey, ho, let's go #

369
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:42,900
- Here we go!
- Let me off!

370
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:44,304
# Hey, ho #

371
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,375
Dude, that's my girlfriend!

372
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:49,400
Oh, my God!

373
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:50,845
Whoo!

374
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,848
Stop it! No! Stop it!

375
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:56,850
Stop it! Please!
Please, the tracks are broken.

376
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,855
Stop! Stop! Please!

377
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:01,413
Jason!

378
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,392
Hey, just relax, OK?

379
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:05,758
- Please!
- Ease up, man. She's all right.

380
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:06,921
OK? Just let her settle down.

381
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:08,430
She can settle down at home!
Now listen...

382
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,057
what is your home phone number?

383
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,069
OK, we're gonna call your mother.
Everything will be taken care of...

384
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:15,094
Aah!

385
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:21,309
Oh, my God! Jason!

386
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:17,292
Ohh.

387
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,500
Hey, Wendy!

388
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,268
Hey!

389
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:02,004
Wait! Wendy!

390
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:03,636
Hey! Hey, Wen. Wait.

391
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,374
I need... I need to talk to you
about something.

392
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:07,211
Just here to pick up my diploma.

393
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:08,511
You're not going to graduation?

394
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,847
No.

395
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:13,616
Look, you're not the only one
in a fucked up place, OK?

396
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:16,317
God, I mean,
I just thought maybe...

397
00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:18,383
it'd be good for you to be somewhere
where other people feel the same way.

398
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:19,416
At graduation?

399
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:21,190
No. Thanks.
I've had enough funerals.

400
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:22,628
Then do it for J and Carrie.

401
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:24,495
Do what? If you die,
then there's nothing...

402
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,865
then you're just dead,
and they don't know.

403
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:28,164
And if they are up in Heaven
with Lincoln and Gandhi...

404
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:30,671
do you think they really care about
our high school graduation? No.

405
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:33,174
I am alive, and I don't care.

406
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,505
As soon as I pull out
of that parking lot...

407
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:36,841
I am so out of McKinley.

408
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:38,243
Without J, what's here for me?

409
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,271
I'm here. OK?

410
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:43,751
I made a promise to J
that I would take care of you.

411
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:46,618
On the ride. For 3 minutes.

412
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:48,680
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.

413
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:50,749
Kevin...

414
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,419
if it wasn't for
you and J being friends...

415
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:54,156
and me and Carrie being friends...

416
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:56,858
we wouldn't have even hung out.

417
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:01,730
We don't even like each other.

418
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:12,812
"lan McKinley."

419
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:15,282
How pathetic is it
that my last name...

420
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:17,012
is the same as my high school?

421
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:19,885
Julie, look who
I got to sign my yearbook.

422
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:22,617
- No way. Nice.
- Yeah.

423
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:32,533
I think we should invite her.

424
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,057
- You think?
- Yeah.

425
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:40,038
Wen? Um...

426
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:42,635
So we're ready
for graduation tonight...

427
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:45,078
we're going to
the tanning salon after this...

428
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:47,547
and we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.

429
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:48,708
Totally.

430
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,809
And just like, talk if you want.

431
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,386
Here's my cell.

432
00:24:54,423 --> 00:24:56,687
I already have your number.

433
00:24:58,894 --> 00:25:00,953
That was so nice of us.

434
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,306
You're not alone.

435
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,171
God, I appreciate
everyone trying to help.

436
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:15,437
OK? I really do.

437
00:25:15,477 --> 00:25:17,206
No, it's happened before.

438
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:20,271
OK? I went online looking for
an explanation about...

439
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:22,579
Wendy, just... just listen
to me, all right?

440
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:25,643
All right, look, I went online
looking for an explanation...

441
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,120
about what happened,
and I found out...

442
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:29,680
about this high school
French class from New York.

443
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:32,717
Six years ago
they went on a trip to Paris.

444
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:34,058
When they were boarding...

445
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:36,530
a kid had a vision that
the plane was gonna explode.

446
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:39,625
Just like you did.

447
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,226
He freaked out...

448
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:43,669
and seven people
got off the plane.

449
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:47,573
Just like us.

450
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:53,308
And on takeoff,
Flight 180 blew up.

451
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:55,680
And over the next several months...

452
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:59,881
everyone who got off that plane
started dying in weird accidents.

453
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:03,379
They died in the order they would've
if they had stayed on the plane.

454
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:06,826
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.

455
00:26:06,862 --> 00:26:09,422
Fuck you, Kevin.

456
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:12,365
W-Wendy! Wendy! Hey!

457
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:39,191
Ohh, every time we come here.

458
00:26:39,227 --> 00:26:42,458
I was thinking of going
for 20 minutes in the Muller.

459
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:45,227
We did that for all the funerals
and it turned out amazing.

460
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:46,700
Yeah, but that was just
a couple of weeks ago, though.

461
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:48,293
I mean, we're still pretty bronzed.

462
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:50,201
I was just thinking
we could go for, like, a tune-up.

463
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:52,638
I just wanna make sure
that we look our best.

464
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:53,936
Yeah.

465
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:56,000
You know, for all those kids
that died that night...

466
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:57,978
who will never get a graduation.

467
00:26:59,781 --> 00:27:01,271
You know what?
You're totally right.

468
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:03,614
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

469
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:29,535
This is my... my good guy
luck bracelet...

470
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:31,808
that Grandma left me in her will.

471
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:34,137
Ohh!

472
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:36,241
Julie?

473
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:39,951
I need...

474
00:27:43,191 --> 00:27:45,022
I could use some help.

475
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:50,758
I have such...
such guilt over Jason.

476
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,825
I should never have let
that ride go.

477
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:57,361
God. I'm usually such
a control freak...

478
00:27:57,405 --> 00:27:58,872
but I didn't do
enough to stop it.

479
00:27:58,907 --> 00:28:02,399
I should've done everything
I could to stop it.

480
00:28:03,411 --> 00:28:06,209
And I would give anything...

481
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:08,375
to have a second chance.

482
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:12,847
But I never can.

483
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:20,256
I don't want to some day
feel that way about you, Julie.

484
00:28:20,295 --> 00:28:23,594
I mean,
I can't talk to Mom and Dad.

485
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,534
You're all I have left.

486
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:31,037
You think when I find a place...

487
00:28:31,072 --> 00:28:33,302
maybe you could come stay
with me for a while?

488
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:37,604
You know I will.

489
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:41,309
You...

490
00:28:43,351 --> 00:28:44,841
keep this now...

491
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:47,377
and I'll get it
when I come see you.

492
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:52,390
Oh. And... hey,
how 'bout on your end?

493
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:55,590
Can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?

494
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,463
Yeah. As long as you bring it back
to school on Monday.

495
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,990
Done.

496
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:02,162
Oh. Um...

497
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:03,636
Actually, the battery is pretty low...

498
00:29:03,672 --> 00:29:06,971
so why don't you go get ready,
and I'll recharge it a bit.

499
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:08,566
Cool.

500
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:24,950
In a hurry, Yuri.

501
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:26,984
Sorry, sorry.
Cell phone signal is shit in here.

502
00:29:27,028 --> 00:29:28,996
I think tanning beds
mess with signal.

503
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,497
I must go outside.

504
00:29:30,532 --> 00:29:33,296
Why don't you just use that phone?

505
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:36,304
I would, but she talks forever,
then my boss gives me shit.

506
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:39,472
Shit. That's her.

507
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:41,441
Ohh!

508
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:42,568
You know what? Just go outside.

509
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,941
We can deal with this ourselves.

510
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:45,503
OK.

511
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:51,511
Hey. No drinks in the room
this time, OK?

512
00:29:51,553 --> 00:29:52,577
Good.

513
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:05,792
What are you doing?

514
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:08,325
Nobody is walking in here
and seein' me naked.

515
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,859
Oh, my God.

516
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,479
Dude, he said no drinks.
If you spill that shit...

517
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:02,312
we're gonna have to clean it
up like last time.

518
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,477
Mmm!

519
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,044
Happy, beyotch?
Nothing to spill.

520
00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:11,253
Why does Yuri keep it
so cold in here?

521
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:14,150
Maybe it's supposed to be colder
for the machines or whatever.

522
00:32:14,194 --> 00:32:16,253
Oh, a few degrees won't hurt.

523
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:43,579
Shit! I forgot my iPod.

524
00:32:43,624 --> 00:32:45,615
Sucks, bitch.

525
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,820
They got CDs.

526
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:53,256
Ew. Celine?

527
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,699
Britney?

528
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:56,930
Dude, are we like the only cool people
that come here or what?

529
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,871
Uh, yeah.

530
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:02,637
Ugh. Whatever.

531
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:19,987
Why are you wearing underwear?

532
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:22,257
Steinmetz says
he gets off on tan lines.

533
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:24,787
All right.

534
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:10,233
# Roller coaster #

535
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:11,574
# Of love #

536
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:12,943
# Say what? #

537
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,107
# Roller coaster #

538
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:17,117
# Ooh ooh ooh #

539
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:18,345
# Roller coaster #

540
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:19,374
# Right #

541
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,012
# Of love #

542
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:23,587
# Roller coaster #

543
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:25,717
# Ooh ooh ooh #

544
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:29,559
# Roller coaster of love #

545
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:31,291
# Roller coaster #

546
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:32,798
# Wow wow wow #

547
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:33,993
# Ooh ooh ooh #

548
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:37,470
# Roller coaster of love... #

549
00:34:58,725 --> 00:35:00,693
# I #

550
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:02,662
# Huh, huh #

551
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,364
# I'm gonna ride, girl #

552
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:09,869
# Yeah #

553
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:11,461
# Whoo-hoo-hoo #

554
00:35:11,505 --> 00:35:13,097
# Wow, yeah #

555
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,232
# Huh huh #

556
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:16,868
# Ow #

557
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,707
# Oh, oh #

558
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:24,978
Whoo.

559
00:35:25,018 --> 00:35:28,044
# Roller coaster of love #

560
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:29,316
# Love roller coaster, girl #

561
00:35:29,356 --> 00:35:31,119
# Roller coaster #

562
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:34,025
# Lovin' you
in a freaky world, child #

563
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:37,030
# Roller coaster of love #

564
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:46,704
Camera charged?

565
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,641
Oh, um, sorry,
the battery's totally dead.

566
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:51,507
Camera's not working. Sorry.

567
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:57,978
Look, Julie, I need a minute, OK?

568
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:00,009
Like private.

569
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:07,526
# That feels nice,
roller coaster #

570
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:09,825
# One more time #

571
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:13,299
# Roller coaster of love #

572
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:16,131
# Roller coaster #

573
00:36:17,204 --> 00:36:21,732
# Roller coaster of love #

574
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:26,402
Ugh.

575
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:28,914
It's way too warm in here now, huh?

576
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:37,123
I fucked up.
I set it too hot in here.

577
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:38,681
Huh?

578
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:53,571
Ow! Aah!

579
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:57,469
Hello?

580
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:00,503
- Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...
- Psych! Leave a message.

581
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:03,246
Hi, Ashley, this is Wendy.

582
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:04,307
Gimme a call whenever
you guys are done.

583
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:05,318
Aah!

584
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:07,217
And thanks again for the invite.

585
00:37:07,254 --> 00:37:09,313
- Someone help!
- Aah!

586
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,259
Sorry I was too late.

587
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:21,026
Aah!

588
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:22,660
Aah! Aah!

589
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:25,194
Aah! Aah! Aah!

590
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,506
Aah! Aah! Aah!

591
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:34,609
Aah! Aah!

592
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:36,513
Oh! Oh!

593
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,017
Oh! Aah!

594
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:40,119
Aaah! Aaah!

595
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:45,283
Hey, open the door!

596
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:56,265
Help me!

597
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:01,367
Aah!

598
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:07,677
Aah!

599
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:10,706
Aah!

600
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:16,755
We may feel that our lives
are not our own.

601
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,783
That Death controls,
frames our lives.

602
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:24,194
Our birth's nothing
but death begun.

603
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:28,827
Yet, whether it is with
this tragic loss of young lives...

604
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:32,270
which we have
suffered much of late...

605
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:37,208
or with the soft passing
of the elderly in the night...

606
00:38:37,244 --> 00:38:41,874
we are all equal in Death's eyes.

607
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:44,611
"Equal in Death's eyes?"

608
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:46,609
All of us?
How can you say that?

609
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:47,881
Shut up, McKinley.

610
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:50,583
Dude, think it through.
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

611
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,649
- Osama? Still kickin'.
- Let's go.

612
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:55,388
Pimps, vice-presidents
walking around.

613
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:58,124
- All the atrocities they've committed...
- Let's just go. Come on.

614
00:38:58,164 --> 00:38:59,426
they're alive and well.

615
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:03,527
These two girls, who'd never
done shit to anybody...

616
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,765
- Shh!
- they don't get to make it to 18?

617
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:07,432
Where's the fucking
equality in that?

618
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:09,742
- What?
- Come on, man.

619
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:11,437
I can... Yeah. Fine.

620
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:13,105
Fine. All right. All right.

621
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:14,909
I'm fine. All right.

622
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:16,711
That's crazy.

623
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:21,483
Those of you who would like
to pay a final remembrance...

624
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:24,684
please step forward at this time.

625
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:34,391
I so feel this is so my fault.

626
00:39:34,434 --> 00:39:36,902
How could it possibly be your fault?

627
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:40,030
Seein' women as nothin' but fun bags.

628
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:44,066
I mean... if I'd've seen their...

629
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,908
whatever... humanity...

630
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:50,006
they wouldn't have felt
the pressure to look so good.

631
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:54,453
Impress Franklin Cheeks.
Go on diets. Deodorize.

632
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:57,854
Stretch. Tan.

633
00:39:58,892 --> 00:40:00,484
Don't be down, Frankie.

634
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:02,290
Be proud of your ability
to make everything...

635
00:40:02,328 --> 00:40:04,592
that happens somehow
a story about you.

636
00:40:09,402 --> 00:40:10,733
God!

637
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:23,541
Yo, man.
These things really suck, man.

638
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,813
Fucking boring.

639
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:28,685
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral...

640
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:30,451
man, bring me a PSP or somethin'.

641
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,151
'Least I have somethin' to do then.

642
00:40:35,995 --> 00:40:38,964
Whew.

643
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,694
Hello?

644
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:43,293
I'm with J.

645
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:12,596
What are you doing up here
in the nosebleeds?

646
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,034
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.

647
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:19,300
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.

648
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:23,503
And I wondered if
maybe here I could feel J's...

649
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:27,479
spirit or presence or...

650
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:29,505
whatever.

651
00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:32,347
But now that I'm here...

652
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:35,980
if there's any place that makes me feel
like there's no life after death...

653
00:41:37,657 --> 00:41:39,625
it's a cemetery.

654
00:41:41,528 --> 00:41:44,497
Yeah, I haven't felt
Carrie's spirit either.

655
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:47,261
And I've tried.

656
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:50,235
Real hard. Heh.

657
00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:56,032
I thought maybe
he's been with me since...

658
00:41:58,044 --> 00:42:02,174
that night...
before I got on the ride...

659
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:04,115
Jason said...

660
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,742
God, and it was just
to get me on the ride...

661
00:42:05,785 --> 00:42:07,582
he said...

662
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:12,182
"Your fear is from a sense
of having no control."

663
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:14,921
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.

664
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:18,897
Even thought it maybe somehow
caused the hallucination...

665
00:42:18,932 --> 00:42:23,528
but this fear is more
than just being scared.

666
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,130
It's like a presence.

667
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:30,074
Like a living thing
always with me.

668
00:42:31,711 --> 00:42:33,235
You think it's J?

669
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,803
No, I know it's not.

670
00:42:34,848 --> 00:42:39,717
This presence is the opposite
of how J made me feel.

671
00:42:39,752 --> 00:42:44,052
It's cold and terrifying.

672
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,352
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.

673
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:23,885
The photographic plate
was broken...

674
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,296
causing a line
that can't be removed.

675
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:28,163
Exactly where he was shot.

676
00:43:30,336 --> 00:43:32,201
Look. See the shadow?

677
00:43:33,806 --> 00:43:36,434
But what do these pictures
have to do with us?

678
00:43:36,476 --> 00:43:39,843
Look. This occurred
one year to the day...

679
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:41,938
of the Flight 180 disaster.
Look at the road sign.

680
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:44,006
Look, I guess you came
to me with this...

681
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,348
because I'm responsible
for putting this in your head...

682
00:43:46,386 --> 00:43:47,614
with the Flight 180 thing.

683
00:43:47,654 --> 00:43:49,679
And it did happen,
and it may be occurring here...

684
00:43:49,722 --> 00:43:51,485
but you can't believe
every weird thing out there...

685
00:43:51,524 --> 00:43:52,650
because you're desperate
for an answer.

686
00:43:52,692 --> 00:43:54,592
I took these.

687
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:56,595
That night.

688
00:44:03,503 --> 00:44:05,334
These?

689
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:10,168
Are these it?

690
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:17,706
Oh, shit.

691
00:44:19,285 --> 00:44:21,185
Oh... shit.

692
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:24,313
Ohh.

693
00:44:26,326 --> 00:44:28,419
Whoa, whoa, hey.
You all right?

694
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:30,088
I'm feeling a little woozy.

695
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:33,698
When was the last time you ate?

696
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:36,526
I don't remember.

697
00:44:37,704 --> 00:44:39,399
All right, come on. I'll drive.

698
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:47,473
OK, those kids on Flight 180
died in accidents...

699
00:44:47,513 --> 00:44:49,845
in the order they would've died
if they'd have stayed on the plane.

700
00:44:49,882 --> 00:44:52,510
OK?
So if this is that, then...

701
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,847
then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.

702
00:44:57,123 --> 00:44:58,420
When I saw Ashley
and Ashlyn's picture...

703
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,483
I felt this instinct.

704
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:02,255
Like there was a hint
in the picture. I even...

705
00:45:02,295 --> 00:45:04,763
I even called to see if
I could keep them from going.

706
00:45:04,797 --> 00:45:06,025
Well, what's
Frankie's picture look like?

707
00:45:06,065 --> 00:45:07,089
It's right here.

708
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:09,465
- You got it?
- Yeah.

709
00:45:12,472 --> 00:45:13,962
- Wait! Watch out!
- Oh!

710
00:45:14,007 --> 00:45:16,066
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

711
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:18,134
Sorry!

712
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:22,444
All right,
let's just eat over there.

713
00:45:22,482 --> 00:45:23,710
And go through
the drive through.

714
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,944
I don't want anyone hearing
what we're talking about.

715
00:45:24,984 --> 00:45:26,679
Well, it's nice to see
that things haven't made you...

716
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:28,084
any less of a control freak.

717
00:45:36,562 --> 00:45:38,189
- You got it?
- Yeah, all right.

718
00:45:38,231 --> 00:45:39,255
Here's Frank's picture.

719
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:40,822
All right.

720
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:43,233
Well, this is obvious.
He's falling off a ladder.

721
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:46,170
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.

722
00:45:47,173 --> 00:45:49,869
Look, or maybe it's not that literal.
All right, what's...

723
00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:51,137
Could there be anything
in these prizes?

724
00:45:51,177 --> 00:45:53,873
Oh, what, like he's gonna get
crushed by a giant Spongebob?

725
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:57,245
Hey, Spongebob lives underwater.

726
00:45:58,684 --> 00:46:01,209
It's so sad that you know that.

727
00:46:01,254 --> 00:46:03,279
All right. He won that tacky
mud-flap girl chain...

728
00:46:03,322 --> 00:46:04,880
on this game, though, so...

729
00:46:04,924 --> 00:46:06,892
aren't those usually
on those big 18 wheelers?

730
00:46:06,926 --> 00:46:08,188
Yeah. Yeah.

731
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:10,092
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere though.

732
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:14,360
All right! God.

733
00:46:17,503 --> 00:46:18,834
All right.

734
00:46:22,575 --> 00:46:23,735
Uh, can I take your order?

735
00:46:23,776 --> 00:46:25,607
Yeah. What do you want?

736
00:46:30,683 --> 00:46:32,116
Are you OK?

737
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:42,887
Please tell me
there's a short in your wiring.

738
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:48,266
Whoa. Whoa. That guy's
way too close to my truck.

739
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:50,394
Hey, you're too fucking
close, man! Pull up!

740
00:46:50,436 --> 00:46:52,028
Hey!

741
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:57,870
# There is someone #

742
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,400
Stop! Stop!

743
00:46:59,445 --> 00:47:00,434
# Walking behind you #

744
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:03,108
Watch out! Shit!

745
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:04,275
- What the fuck?
- # Turn around #

746
00:47:04,317 --> 00:47:06,410
- Oh, my God!
- # Look at me #

747
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:08,511
- Get out! Get out!
- What? What?

748
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:10,215
Behind us!

749
00:47:10,256 --> 00:47:11,621
There's no one in that truck!

750
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:11,948
# Watching your footsteps #

751
00:47:11,657 --> 00:47:12,885
# Watching your footsteps #

752
00:47:12,658 --> 00:47:15,752
Shit! Hey! Pull up, man!
Come on! Pull up!

753
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:20,424
- # Look at me #
- Unh! Shit!

754
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:21,433
- # There is someone #
- Back up!

755
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:22,491
Back up!

756
00:47:23,535 --> 00:47:25,526
# Who really loves you #

757
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:29,234
# Here's my heart #

758
00:47:29,274 --> 00:47:30,434
Watch your eyes!
Watch your eyes! Come here!

759
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:32,671
# In my hand #

760
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:36,442
# Turn around #

761
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:37,813
- # Look at me #
- Come on. Let's go!

762
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,147
Come on, come on, come on.

763
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,355
Unh!

764
00:48:23,962 --> 00:48:25,327
- Oh!
- Unh!

765
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:36,839
We're all done here.
You need a ride?

766
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,343
Um, we can walk to my house...

767
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:41,744
and then I'll give you
a ride to yours.

768
00:48:43,115 --> 00:48:44,377
No, thanks. We'll be OK.

769
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:50,446
Will we?

770
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:54,324
Yeah. We'll be all right.

771
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:56,884
I mean...

772
00:48:56,929 --> 00:48:59,022
how Frank...

773
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:00,861
God, it... it's not only horrible...

774
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:04,130
but can you feel...
can you feel how vicious it was?

775
00:49:04,169 --> 00:49:05,534
Easy.

776
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,505
OK? Easy.

777
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:10,799
Let's just...

778
00:49:10,842 --> 00:49:12,673
let's just take a step back.

779
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,343
All right? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride...

780
00:49:16,381 --> 00:49:18,474
but there was no ladder here.
You know, there was no rope.

781
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:21,042
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

782
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:22,849
We were wrong about the photos.

783
00:49:22,888 --> 00:49:25,755
I should've left town.
It's better not knowing.

784
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:28,783
No, it's never better
staying ignorant.

785
00:49:28,827 --> 00:49:30,886
Willful ignorance
is surrendering control.

786
00:49:31,897 --> 00:49:35,697
What, did you read that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

787
00:49:37,402 --> 00:49:39,597
No. l... you know, I'm not...

788
00:49:39,638 --> 00:49:42,004
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.

789
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,540
OK, that's Lewis after Frank...

790
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:47,636
then lan and Erin.

791
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,806
There's a couple of kids behind them,
but I can't make them out...

792
00:49:49,848 --> 00:49:51,907
because this guy's arm's
in the way. Can you?

793
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:52,939
No.

794
00:49:52,985 --> 00:49:54,850
All right, you know what?

795
00:49:54,886 --> 00:49:57,320
We'll ask Lewis, lan, and Erin
if they remember.

796
00:49:57,356 --> 00:49:58,914
OK?

797
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,482
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

798
00:50:14,773 --> 00:50:17,503
I guess...

799
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:19,100
that kind of thing
is gonna happen to us

800
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:20,338
for the rest of our lives.

801
00:50:20,379 --> 00:50:21,971
Yeah.

802
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:25,746
You know, I was gonna...

803
00:50:25,784 --> 00:50:27,945
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

804
00:50:29,521 --> 00:50:31,489
Right after graduation.

805
00:50:31,523 --> 00:50:33,320
Heh.

806
00:50:45,404 --> 00:50:46,871
Oh.

807
00:50:52,944 --> 00:50:54,912
No, wait.

808
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:56,379
Look, behind Stacy.

809
00:50:57,382 --> 00:50:58,576
That's Frank.

810
00:50:59,718 --> 00:51:01,310
This picture shows how he died.

811
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:06,722
All right, go back to Lewis.

812
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:08,716
All right, go back to Lewis.

813
00:51:10,729 --> 00:51:12,162
OK, he's got that hammer.

814
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:15,064
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...

815
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,897
on his head.

816
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:17,924
No, no, no, check this out.

817
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:21,063
Right now Lewis is down at State
for football training camp.

818
00:51:21,106 --> 00:51:23,506
State's team is called the Sultans.

819
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,168
That's it. That's the clue.

820
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:28,179
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.

821
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,474
Wouldn't you want to know?

822
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:36,418
Wait, there's pictures of us in there?

823
00:51:36,454 --> 00:51:38,149
Yeah.

824
00:51:38,189 --> 00:51:39,451
Yeah, of course.

825
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:41,482
Huh. No.

826
00:51:41,526 --> 00:51:44,290
No. I don't want to see mine.
No. Huh.

827
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:45,626
What about willful ignorance?

828
00:51:45,663 --> 00:51:48,325
Well, I'm full of shit, all right?!

829
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,061
I mean, I never thought
I could see my own death...

830
00:51:50,101 --> 00:51:51,363
before it happened, Wendy.

831
00:51:52,537 --> 00:51:54,698
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

832
00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:57,708
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

833
00:51:57,742 --> 00:51:59,334
I gotta stay focused...

834
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:00,935
and if I look at that picture,
all I'm gonna do is obsess.

835
00:52:00,979 --> 00:52:03,539
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

836
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,811
I mean, unless we have to.

837
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,550
You mean until we have to.

838
00:52:17,528 --> 00:52:19,155
One more thing.

839
00:52:19,197 --> 00:52:21,165
Is it bad?

840
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,464
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?

841
00:52:24,736 --> 00:52:27,000
I mean, there's nothing, like,
up my ass or anything, right?

842
00:52:27,038 --> 00:52:28,630
I'll see you tomorrow.

843
00:52:33,544 --> 00:52:35,171
You on crack. Both of you.

844
00:52:35,213 --> 00:52:37,545
Just listen, OK?
Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

845
00:52:37,582 --> 00:52:39,209
Then Frankie Cheeks
and then you. This is the...

846
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,774
- Aw, come on, Kevin.
- Listen.

847
00:52:40,818 --> 00:52:42,308
McKinley and Erin
were next, all right?

848
00:52:42,353 --> 00:52:44,480
And there were two people in front of us.
Do you remember who they were?

849
00:52:44,522 --> 00:52:46,786
Fuck no, and I don't care.
And you shouldn't care either, man...

850
00:52:46,824 --> 00:52:49,122
'cause what you're tellin' me
right now is straight bullshit.

851
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,218
Just listen, Lewis.

852
00:52:50,261 --> 00:52:52,627
Kevin, it's like those stories.

853
00:52:52,663 --> 00:52:56,497
Like this guy was killed
by a car he sold 10 years ago.

854
00:52:56,534 --> 00:52:59,833
Two sisters, right, were killed when
they were driving to visit each other.

855
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:01,998
You know, shit like that, man.

856
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:03,506
Fuck the Bruins!

857
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:05,771
Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

858
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,573
Bruin faggots!

859
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:09,204
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

860
00:53:12,216 --> 00:53:15,549
Man, you're reading into this shit
like them damn urban legends.

861
00:53:15,586 --> 00:53:17,554
Three people have died, Lewis.

862
00:53:17,588 --> 00:53:18,919
I mean, if you think
this can be written off...

863
00:53:18,956 --> 00:53:20,924
as a simple coincidence
and it ends there...

864
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:22,789
you're in serious denial.

865
00:53:22,827 --> 00:53:24,317
Unh! What about you two, huh?

866
00:53:24,362 --> 00:53:25,624
What?

867
00:53:25,663 --> 00:53:28,791
You both lost people real close
to you in a fucked-up way.

868
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,767
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever...

869
00:53:30,802 --> 00:53:32,531
seeing signs and patterns, man.

870
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:36,336
I don't blame you.
But it's wrong, dawg.

871
00:53:36,374 --> 00:53:38,865
Unh! It's wrong.

872
00:53:40,344 --> 00:53:42,107
That's denial.

873
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:43,977
Unh!

874
00:53:44,982 --> 00:53:47,348
- Unh!
- You got it!

875
00:53:47,385 --> 00:53:49,649
OK, what about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?

876
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:50,676
Wendy saw it.

877
00:53:50,721 --> 00:53:53,588
Man, she got a hunch.
Fuckin' intense, but she got a hunch.

878
00:53:53,624 --> 00:53:56,058
Man, I'm here because I get
good hunches before every down.

879
00:53:56,093 --> 00:53:58,084
No, you know
they're either gonna run or pass.

880
00:53:58,129 --> 00:53:59,721
Hers came to her from nowhere.

881
00:53:59,764 --> 00:54:01,493
You're here and alive because of her.

882
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:03,022
No, I'm alive because of me.

883
00:54:03,067 --> 00:54:04,591
No, listen.
You don't get it, man.

884
00:54:04,635 --> 00:54:06,000
Does that make sense to you?

885
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:07,834
There's nothing to get, Kevin!
It's bullshit.

886
00:54:07,872 --> 00:54:09,635
No, just hear me out, all right?

887
00:54:09,674 --> 00:54:10,698
Unh.

888
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:12,106
# Yeah #

889
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:20,341
Talk about a vision.
Man, I seen my whole life played out...

890
00:54:20,384 --> 00:54:22,784
and it sure as hell
ain't gonna end now. Unh!

891
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,048
It's going just as I saw it.

892
00:54:24,088 --> 00:54:27,319
35 high school games
without an injury.

893
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:29,690
<i>- USA Today All-American.
- Second team.</i>

894
00:54:29,727 --> 00:54:31,695
- Free ride to play for the Sultans!
- The Bruins passed on you.

895
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:33,253
Man, fuck the Bruins!

896
00:54:33,297 --> 00:54:34,787
- Fuck 'em!
- You goddamn right!

897
00:54:34,832 --> 00:54:36,891
What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?

898
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:38,526
Aah!

899
00:54:38,569 --> 00:54:40,901
Unh! Unh! Unh!

900
00:54:40,938 --> 00:54:42,530
Four years from now...

901
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:45,098
Lewis Romero goin' in
the second round to Oakland.

902
00:54:45,142 --> 00:54:46,803
Unh!

903
00:54:46,844 --> 00:54:48,971
He's gonna romp and stomp.

904
00:54:49,013 --> 00:54:53,006
15 seasons, with four Super Bowl
rings on his fingers.

905
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,177
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.
Fuck Death!

906
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:57,619
Death is a fuckin' Denver fan.

907
00:54:57,655 --> 00:54:59,350
Death wear blue and orange.

908
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:02,188
Real men wear black.

909
00:55:02,226 --> 00:55:03,386
Lewis ain't afraid of no Death.

910
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:05,725
Death is afraid of me!

911
00:55:05,763 --> 00:55:07,230
Death fears me!

912
00:55:07,265 --> 00:55:08,493
Kevin.

913
00:55:08,532 --> 00:55:10,625
'Cause, baby, I just win.
I just win, Kevin!

914
00:55:10,668 --> 00:55:14,570
That's all I know how to do!
I just win! Unh!

915
00:55:14,605 --> 00:55:15,902
Fuck Death!

916
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,874
- Fuck the Bruins!
- Yeah!

917
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:19,809
Aah!

918
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:21,277
- Look out!
- Lewis!

919
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:24,881
Man, that was close, Lewis.

920
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:26,907
Hey, did you see that?

921
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:30,409
Whoo! What I tell you,
Kevin, huh?

922
00:55:30,454 --> 00:55:32,388
Fuck Death! I just win!

923
00:55:32,423 --> 00:55:33,822
That's all I know
how to do, Kevin.

924
00:55:33,858 --> 00:55:34,950
Baby, I just win!

925
00:55:36,093 --> 00:55:37,185
Aaaaah!

926
00:55:37,228 --> 00:55:39,526
- Ooooh!
- God!

927
00:55:49,273 --> 00:55:51,741
Did I do something...

928
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,605
to bring this on everybody?

929
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:57,738
Don't, Wendy.

930
00:55:57,781 --> 00:56:00,773
But why me?

931
00:56:00,817 --> 00:56:03,081
All those people out there
wanting to have a premonition...

932
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,952
or see a ghost or whatever,
and I don't.

933
00:56:09,058 --> 00:56:11,822
I just want it to stop.

934
00:56:11,861 --> 00:56:13,692
Just stop.

935
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,426
I don't know why, Wendy...

936
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:19,026
but you didn't do anything.

937
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,695
All right? This is just...

938
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:24,639
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why, you know?

939
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:27,404
I wish I could... I could
come up with a guess even...

940
00:56:27,443 --> 00:56:29,638
to make you feel OK, but...

941
00:56:32,115 --> 00:56:34,515
You know, I can't.

942
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,219
Yeah.

943
00:56:39,222 --> 00:56:40,883
There's nothing I can do.

944
00:56:45,261 --> 00:56:46,694
Can you drive?

945
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:49,289
Heh.

946
00:56:49,332 --> 00:56:50,594
Yeah.

947
00:56:55,405 --> 00:56:56,997
You know, by the way,
that... that picture of me.

948
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,340
My, uh, my head's not, like,
through the windshield or anything?

949
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:03,743
You know,
crushed by a steering wheel?

950
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,611
lmpaled by a gear shift?

951
00:57:08,952 --> 00:57:10,112
Right?

952
00:57:23,867 --> 00:57:25,562
Zip, it's Pip.

953
00:57:25,602 --> 00:57:27,035
Have you cut
those plywood orders yet?

954
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,560
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

955
00:57:28,605 --> 00:57:31,972
Osama bin Supervisor wants me
to get rid of these pigeons first.

956
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:33,600
They keep settin' off the alarms.

957
00:57:46,722 --> 00:57:48,747
Hello, babies.

958
00:57:57,197 --> 00:57:59,427
Ha ha ha!

959
00:57:59,466 --> 00:58:03,368
Oh, ha ha ha! Heh.

960
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:10,506
Hey. After I, uh, restock
this stuff...

961
00:58:10,544 --> 00:58:12,535
that these pinhead customers
can't manage...

962
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:14,479
to return to the shelves
themselves...

963
00:58:14,514 --> 00:58:15,913
we can blow out of here, OK?

964
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:17,576
Righty-o, babe.

965
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:23,048
Aah!

966
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:24,819
Erin, it's Wendy and Kevin.

967
00:58:24,858 --> 00:58:26,450
Shit!

968
00:58:26,493 --> 00:58:28,393
You scared the shit out of me!

969
00:58:28,428 --> 00:58:30,623
Yeah, wait till you hear
what we have to tell you.

970
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:42,141
Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.

971
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:44,905
You are gonna trip
when you hear this.

972
00:58:44,945 --> 00:58:48,142
Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.
I'm on my way.

973
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:51,617
So let me get this straight.
I'm gonna O.D. on nail polish...

974
00:58:51,652 --> 00:58:54,621
and lan is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

975
00:58:54,655 --> 00:58:56,282
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?

976
00:58:56,323 --> 00:58:59,224
What's happened to the others?
I mean, you just saw their pictures.

977
00:59:09,803 --> 00:59:12,237
Oh, my God, guys,
what's going on?

978
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:15,537
What's going on?
That's crazy! That's crazy!

979
00:59:15,575 --> 00:59:17,406
Ha ha!

980
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:21,208
We need to know who was sitting
behind you on the roller coaster.

981
00:59:21,248 --> 00:59:24,615
OK, who was sitting behind us
on the roller coaster?

982
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:27,620
Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn't it
that one guy who got voted...

983
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:30,487
most likely to become
manager at Red Lobster?

984
00:59:30,524 --> 00:59:31,718
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

985
00:59:31,758 --> 00:59:33,521
There was this guy,
uh, black cloak...

986
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,084
I didn't see his face, but, um...

987
00:59:35,128 --> 00:59:37,323
the ride attendant
did take his sickle...

988
00:59:37,364 --> 00:59:40,731
before the ride started
if that's helpful in any way.

989
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:42,632
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?

990
00:59:42,669 --> 00:59:44,159
This is our lives, OK?

991
00:59:44,204 --> 00:59:46,468
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?

992
00:59:46,506 --> 00:59:48,303
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no "it."

993
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:51,242
OK, wait, are you guys saying
that Death is, like, a person?

994
00:59:51,278 --> 00:59:53,906
No. It's like... like a force.

995
00:59:53,947 --> 00:59:57,644
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

996
00:59:57,684 --> 01:00:00,152
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

997
01:00:00,187 --> 01:00:03,645
I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that is a force.

998
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,351
But there is awareness, McKinley.

999
01:00:05,392 --> 01:00:07,826
In fact, in past cases,
if the next in line is saved...

1000
01:00:07,861 --> 01:00:10,125
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.

1001
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:11,926
Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?

1002
01:00:13,366 --> 01:00:16,199
Ha ha!

1003
01:00:18,505 --> 01:00:20,973
- Top shelf.
- OK.

1004
01:00:28,982 --> 01:00:31,712
Kevin! Those banners.
They're in the picture.

1005
01:00:33,353 --> 01:00:34,877
lan, watch those boxes!

1006
01:00:40,026 --> 01:00:42,859
What the fuck, man?
You said those boxes were falling!

1007
01:00:42,896 --> 01:00:44,659
No, I said watch the boxes.

1008
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:46,325
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.

1009
01:00:46,366 --> 01:00:49,301
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

1010
01:00:49,336 --> 01:00:53,204
You haven't seen or been through
what we have... yet.

1011
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,832
Oh. Yet.

1012
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:58,106
OK, so who's next in this theory
you have, me or lan?

1013
01:00:58,145 --> 01:01:00,511
Well, we know the order of how
we were sitting on the roller coaster...

1014
01:01:00,547 --> 01:01:02,981
but not how it works
with people who sat together.

1015
01:01:03,016 --> 01:01:05,814
OK, we don't know
if Ashley or Ashlyn died first.

1016
01:01:05,852 --> 01:01:08,480
Hmm. God, Death is
fucking complicated.

1017
01:01:08,522 --> 01:01:09,955
Ha ha!

1018
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,083
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

1019
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:14,685
It's simple. People die.

1020
01:01:14,728 --> 01:01:16,127
That's just part of life.

1021
01:01:16,163 --> 01:01:18,927
150,000 people a day, actually.

1022
01:01:18,965 --> 01:01:20,865
You know? I mean...

1023
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:22,926
we're biological entities,
and death is just...

1024
01:01:22,969 --> 01:01:25,267
- Top shelf.
- the end of biological function.

1025
01:01:25,305 --> 01:01:26,294
It's as simple as that.

1026
01:01:33,213 --> 01:01:35,681
How can you explain
what happened to us as simple?

1027
01:01:35,715 --> 01:01:37,512
I mean, if Wendy never had
that premonition...

1028
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:40,042
and none of us had gotten off that ride,
we'd all be dead right now.

1029
01:01:40,086 --> 01:01:42,418
- Does that not make sense to you?
- Oh, yeah.

1030
01:01:42,455 --> 01:01:46,357
Kevin, how come when a guy dies
of a plain heart attack...

1031
01:01:46,393 --> 01:01:48,020
no one goes, like...

1032
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:51,189
"Oh, wow, he was
eating French toast...

1033
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,028
"when Princess Diana
died in Paris...

1034
01:01:53,066 --> 01:01:56,229
"and then he saw her funeral on TV,
and now he's dead"?

1035
01:01:56,269 --> 01:01:57,793
You know why?
Because they'd sound crazy...

1036
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:01,296
so guess how you two
sound right now? Crazy.

1037
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:03,741
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting those orders...

1038
01:02:03,777 --> 01:02:05,108
- so we can get out of here.
- OK!

1039
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:54,115
Unh!

1040
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:57,619
Heh heh!

1041
01:03:10,643 --> 01:03:12,076
Ugh!

1042
01:03:12,111 --> 01:03:13,703
Sick.

1043
01:03:48,981 --> 01:03:50,812
OK.

1044
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:52,818
Let's go with
what you guys are saying.

1045
01:03:52,852 --> 01:03:54,149
Let's just say, you know...

1046
01:03:54,186 --> 01:03:56,620
that Death does have
a conscious plan...

1047
01:03:56,656 --> 01:03:58,988
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

1048
01:03:59,025 --> 01:04:02,188
So, Newton's third law of motion,
and, well, look...

1049
01:04:02,228 --> 01:04:04,059
I'm just guessing
that it goes for Death, too...

1050
01:04:04,096 --> 01:04:05,927
when he's working in our world.

1051
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:09,901
Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

1052
01:04:09,936 --> 01:04:12,996
So, that means that...

1053
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:16,941
if Death has taken action,
so can we.

1054
01:04:16,976 --> 01:04:19,171
And that that action
we take might have...

1055
01:04:19,211 --> 01:04:21,771
an opposite reaction
that thwarts Death's intent.

1056
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:23,543
You're being a fucker, but go on.

1057
01:04:23,582 --> 01:04:26,449
OK. OK.

1058
01:04:26,485 --> 01:04:29,716
What if, for example...

1059
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:34,556
the last in line were to make
the utilitarian choice...

1060
01:04:35,895 --> 01:04:37,055
Kill themselves.

1061
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:41,665
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan...

1062
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:44,397
that Death's put in motion.
And even better...

1063
01:04:44,437 --> 01:04:48,305
hey, it's gonna save
five skipped lives.

1064
01:04:54,413 --> 01:04:56,005
Any takers?

1065
01:04:58,617 --> 01:05:00,915
Nah, I didn't think so.

1066
01:05:10,596 --> 01:05:12,063
There! Those!

1067
01:05:15,568 --> 01:05:17,297
Ugh!

1068
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:18,701
Aah!

1069
01:05:21,374 --> 01:05:22,932
Ooh!

1070
01:05:30,249 --> 01:05:31,238
Aah!

1071
01:05:32,251 --> 01:05:33,240
Unh! Unh!

1072
01:05:35,454 --> 01:05:36,682
Unh!

1073
01:05:49,935 --> 01:05:52,199
Aah!

1074
01:06:10,956 --> 01:06:13,083
I didn't say anything.
I mean, I think...

1075
01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:14,592
they were trying to scare us
into saying something...

1076
01:06:14,627 --> 01:06:16,618
but they had nothing
to keep me there.

1077
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,095
What'd you tell 'em?

1078
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,360
Everything.
I didn't do anything.

1079
01:06:20,399 --> 01:06:22,196
I told them about
the pictures in the camera...

1080
01:06:22,234 --> 01:06:23,394
and Flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis...

1081
01:06:23,436 --> 01:06:25,802
and why we went to see
lan and Erin and...

1082
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:27,271
Did they believe you?

1083
01:06:27,306 --> 01:06:29,331
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?

1084
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:31,866
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.

1085
01:06:31,911 --> 01:06:34,345
10 hours they had us in there.

1086
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,745
For all we know...

1087
01:06:35,781 --> 01:06:37,646
whoever was sitting
behind Erin is already dead.

1088
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:39,241
And we're next.

1089
01:06:39,285 --> 01:06:40,809
Now.

1090
01:06:43,656 --> 01:06:47,752
lan almost died first,
but we intervened.

1091
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:51,160
So it skipped lan.
That's... that's how we regain control.

1092
01:06:51,197 --> 01:06:52,494
If someone intercedes...

1093
01:06:52,531 --> 01:06:54,396
the life that was supposed
to be next is skipped.

1094
01:06:54,433 --> 01:06:55,661
All right, wait, wait, wait.

1095
01:06:55,701 --> 01:06:58,192
So, going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...

1096
01:06:59,672 --> 01:07:02,835
Well, I'm next... and then you.

1097
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:06,038
We can beat this.

1098
01:07:06,078 --> 01:07:08,842
We're so close.
We can't give up.

1099
01:07:10,082 --> 01:07:13,313
All right, my dad's here.
He's gonna give me a ride back.

1100
01:07:13,352 --> 01:07:16,321
But are you sure
we shouldn't stick together?

1101
01:07:16,355 --> 01:07:18,220
It's just for a couple of hours.

1102
01:07:18,257 --> 01:07:19,246
All right? A couple of hours.

1103
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:22,226
Go back, look at the pictures,
see if you can find any more clues...

1104
01:07:22,261 --> 01:07:25,992
and I'll ask everybody I see if they know
if anyone else got off the ride.

1105
01:07:26,031 --> 01:07:28,090
OK?

1106
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:32,734
Was there something
I should know about going?

1107
01:07:34,573 --> 01:07:36,734
No, it's just...

1108
01:07:36,775 --> 01:07:39,266
I'll just be freaking out
every second...

1109
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:41,245
hoping you're OK.

1110
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,271
Why?

1111
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,484
I mean,
we don't even like each other.

1112
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:49,147
Heh.

1113
01:07:50,222 --> 01:07:51,712
Come here.

1114
01:07:56,762 --> 01:07:57,956
OK?

1115
01:07:57,996 --> 01:07:59,759
All right, I got my cell.

1116
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:01,095
OK.

1117
01:08:19,217 --> 01:08:20,479
Hey, Wen?

1118
01:08:20,518 --> 01:08:22,281
So we're meeting some guys
at that centennial thing...

1119
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:26,484
and I could really use
my good-luck... bracelet.

1120
01:08:43,308 --> 01:08:44,297
Mmm.

1121
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,146
Huh.

1122
01:09:27,385 --> 01:09:31,253
Hey, this is Julie.
Leave a message.

1123
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:33,189
Call me on my cell right away.

1124
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:39,992
Hello?

1125
01:09:40,031 --> 01:09:41,931
Do you remember Julie
being on the roller coaster?

1126
01:09:41,966 --> 01:09:43,797
What, your sister? No.

1127
01:09:43,835 --> 01:09:45,166
No, she would've said
something by now.

1128
01:09:45,203 --> 01:09:46,761
The person sitting
behind lan and Erin...

1129
01:09:46,805 --> 01:09:48,432
was wearing the exact same
charm bracelet...

1130
01:09:48,473 --> 01:09:50,202
our grandmother gave her.

1131
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:52,232
Amber or Perry
were probably with her...

1132
01:09:52,277 --> 01:09:54,006
so they're next.

1133
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:55,410
I gotta find Julie.

1134
01:09:55,447 --> 01:09:56,539
She went to
the tricentennial thing.

1135
01:09:56,581 --> 01:09:58,572
Well, l... I'm here now,
working security.

1136
01:09:58,616 --> 01:10:00,243
I'll start looking for her.

1137
01:10:00,285 --> 01:10:02,219
- I'm on my way.
- Wen, wait.

1138
01:10:02,253 --> 01:10:03,948
Look, after them, we're next.

1139
01:10:03,988 --> 01:10:06,252
So in case somethin'
happens to 'em...

1140
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:07,952
before we meet up...

1141
01:10:07,992 --> 01:10:09,721
remember that time
we talked about?

1142
01:10:09,761 --> 01:10:11,456
When to look at our pictures?

1143
01:10:11,496 --> 01:10:13,225
It's now.

1144
01:10:22,807 --> 01:10:24,536
Great. Mine has no clue.

1145
01:10:24,576 --> 01:10:27,340
It's just me standing in front of
a blank background...

1146
01:10:27,378 --> 01:10:29,744
with Jason at
the amusement park.

1147
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:32,750
Wait. McKinley.

1148
01:10:32,784 --> 01:10:35,878
lan? Is he in the picture?

1149
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,515
No, but it... it feels like a clue.

1150
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:43,124
And yours is the picture
that I took...

1151
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:44,890
when I flashed the camera
in your face.

1152
01:10:44,929 --> 01:10:48,888
It's all out of focus
and overexposed, like...

1153
01:10:54,472 --> 01:10:56,167
Like a firework
went off in my face?

1154
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:24,896
# There is someone #

1155
01:11:24,936 --> 01:11:28,064
# Walking behind you #

1156
01:11:31,309 --> 01:11:34,540
# Look at me #

1157
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:36,410
# There is someone #

1158
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:40,349
# Watching your footsteps #

1159
01:11:43,087 --> 01:11:44,987
# Look at me #

1160
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:49,958
# There is someone #

1161
01:11:49,994 --> 01:11:52,224
# Who really loves you #

1162
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:54,390
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

1163
01:11:54,432 --> 01:11:56,957
- Whoo!
- Yay!

1164
01:11:57,001 --> 01:11:58,593
Get 'em while they're hot!

1165
01:12:03,308 --> 01:12:05,469
Take it to those Redcoats!

1166
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,808
Column, advance!

1167
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:21,757
The kite is aloft.

1168
01:12:23,227 --> 01:12:26,025
Now, let us hope
for some lightning.

1169
01:12:26,064 --> 01:12:28,624
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

1170
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:40,071
But he kept insisting.
"Get over here," right?

1171
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,373
This is awesome, dude!

1172
01:12:44,415 --> 01:12:45,677
Heh heh.

1173
01:12:45,717 --> 01:12:47,082
Whoa. Hey!

1174
01:12:47,118 --> 01:12:48,551
Ha ha! Come on!

1175
01:12:48,586 --> 01:12:50,577
Hey, get out of here with those, man!
You're gonna set these off!

1176
01:12:50,622 --> 01:12:52,089
Hurry, dude.

1177
01:12:52,123 --> 01:12:53,522
Come on, man, let's go!
Hurry up!

1178
01:12:55,026 --> 01:12:58,757
Ladies and gentlemen,
to celebrate McKinley's tricentennial...

1179
01:12:58,796 --> 01:13:01,526
the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.

1180
01:13:06,671 --> 01:13:08,195
Oh, my God. Julie.

1181
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:09,206
- What?
- Look.

1182
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,140
There's Kahlil.

1183
01:13:11,175 --> 01:13:12,767
Should we?

1184
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,471
Hey, guys. I'm sorry,
but you can't be here, OK?

1185
01:13:14,512 --> 01:13:16,810
The viewing site is over there.
You too, sir. Come on.

1186
01:13:16,848 --> 01:13:18,679
They're not gonna
make us move, are they?

1187
01:13:18,716 --> 01:13:20,308
I don't fucking believe them.

1188
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:22,842
- OK, we gotta clear out.
- Mm-hm.

1189
01:13:29,427 --> 01:13:30,917
Excuse me.

1190
01:13:56,054 --> 01:13:57,578
- Ladies.
- Boys.

1191
01:13:57,622 --> 01:13:58,611
What's going on?

1192
01:13:59,824 --> 01:14:01,655
Hey, Julie.

1193
01:14:01,693 --> 01:14:04,127
- You three need to come with me.
- What did we do?

1194
01:14:04,162 --> 01:14:05,857
Look, it's for your own safety,
Julie, all right?

1195
01:14:05,897 --> 01:14:07,728
I'll tell you about it as soon as
we get away from here, OK?

1196
01:14:07,765 --> 01:14:09,596
Let go of me!

1197
01:14:09,634 --> 01:14:10,692
Julie.

1198
01:14:10,735 --> 01:14:11,929
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1199
01:14:11,969 --> 01:14:13,129
Julie!

1200
01:14:40,932 --> 01:14:41,956
Heh heh heh!

1201
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:44,934
- Sweet.
- Ha ha!

1202
01:14:48,206 --> 01:14:49,195
Yeah!

1203
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,805
Light it! Light it!
Go, go, go, man!

1204
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:01,347
Julie!

1205
01:15:05,123 --> 01:15:06,613
Uh! Oh!

1206
01:15:11,028 --> 01:15:12,586
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!

1207
01:15:27,078 --> 01:15:28,375
- Aah!
- Unh!

1208
01:15:28,412 --> 01:15:30,744
Unh! Hey!

1209
01:15:32,216 --> 01:15:35,413
Julie! No, wait, wait.

1210
01:15:35,453 --> 01:15:37,921
You're in danger, OK?
I'm trying to explain something.

1211
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:40,685
Let me explain this to you.

1212
01:15:44,595 --> 01:15:46,028
Julie, look out!

1213
01:15:47,398 --> 01:15:49,195
- Aah!
- Unh!

1214
01:15:50,735 --> 01:15:52,532
Aah!

1215
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:53,662
Julie!

1216
01:15:54,672 --> 01:15:56,196
Unh!

1217
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,071
Aah! Unh!

1218
01:15:59,977 --> 01:16:01,501
Cut him off!

1219
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:07,714
Unh!

1220
01:16:09,287 --> 01:16:10,276
Aah!

1221
01:16:13,558 --> 01:16:14,547
Aah!

1222
01:16:17,028 --> 01:16:18,427
Aah!

1223
01:16:25,937 --> 01:16:27,268
OK, OK.

1224
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,005
Stay back! He's dangerous!

1225
01:16:34,445 --> 01:16:35,571
I got him.

1226
01:16:35,613 --> 01:16:37,808
- Just let me go.
- No, Julie.

1227
01:16:37,849 --> 01:16:39,043
You have to tell me,
you have to listen.

1228
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:41,347
Tell me who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

1229
01:16:41,385 --> 01:16:43,250
Oh, my God,
Julie, are you all right?

1230
01:16:44,956 --> 01:16:46,253
Listen to me!
You have to tell me...

1231
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:48,155
who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

1232
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:50,592
Who? She's next!

1233
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:56,861
Aah!

1234
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:10,544
Kevin.

1235
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:22,115
Aah!

1236
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:23,820
Fire!

1237
01:17:23,861 --> 01:17:26,056
Kevin.

1238
01:17:26,097 --> 01:17:29,624
You saved my life.

1239
01:17:35,339 --> 01:17:36,738
Thanks for that, McKinley.

1240
01:17:36,774 --> 01:17:38,742
- Shut up, McKinley!
- No!

1241
01:17:38,776 --> 01:17:40,243
We have to get out of here now.

1242
01:17:40,278 --> 01:17:41,438
What's the deal?

1243
01:17:41,479 --> 01:17:44,073
lan McKinley.
He causes my death.

1244
01:17:44,115 --> 01:17:46,242
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley grad night shirt.

1245
01:17:46,284 --> 01:17:48,047
- He's the clue.
- What?

1246
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:50,076
There's a first aid tent,
there should be security.

1247
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:54,224
Get the fuck outta here, McKinley!

1248
01:17:54,258 --> 01:17:58,319
Hey, I'm just celebrating
our town's tricentennial.

1249
01:18:01,432 --> 01:18:02,490
You followed me!

1250
01:18:02,533 --> 01:18:04,433
Oh! You are paranoid.

1251
01:18:04,468 --> 01:18:06,527
But, hey, I saw what happened.

1252
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:09,334
You're next, right?
You're the end of it, aren't you?

1253
01:18:09,373 --> 01:18:10,772
Man, I would be paranoid, too.

1254
01:18:10,808 --> 01:18:12,605
You didn't even believe me!

1255
01:18:12,643 --> 01:18:15,703
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

1256
01:18:15,746 --> 01:18:17,441
Then you have
to stay away from me!

1257
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:20,712
"Have to"?
Wow, that's extreme.

1258
01:18:25,423 --> 01:18:27,550
Oh, no way.

1259
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:30,921
Do I cause your death?

1260
01:18:32,596 --> 01:18:34,530
Just like you caused Erin's?

1261
01:18:35,566 --> 01:18:37,557
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what? What?

1262
01:18:37,601 --> 01:18:40,468
You have a vision? Was I in it?

1263
01:18:40,504 --> 01:18:42,404
Was I in a picture?

1264
01:18:44,675 --> 01:18:47,109
Just tell me how to start it off!

1265
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:49,806
Let's get this over with!

1266
01:18:49,847 --> 01:18:52,577
You'll save me
if you just stay away!

1267
01:18:52,616 --> 01:18:53,913
Then it'll all be over!

1268
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,920
What do I care? It skipped me.

1269
01:18:56,954 --> 01:18:58,751
For me, it is over.
I'm not dying.

1270
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:01,656
I'm not dying!

1271
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:13,864
Ha ha ha!

1272
01:19:13,904 --> 01:19:15,963
You see?

1273
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:17,269
I'm not gonna die!

1274
01:19:17,308 --> 01:19:19,606
It's you, Wendy! You're dead!

1275
01:19:55,244 --> 01:19:58,441
# Came back down
from this fight #

1276
01:19:58,481 --> 01:19:59,971
- Hi!
- # Will get ya deeper #

1277
01:20:00,016 --> 01:20:01,381
# And make you right #

1278
01:20:01,417 --> 01:20:02,441
Thank you.

1279
01:20:02,485 --> 01:20:05,249
# Bruno's drops
threaten her... #

1280
01:20:05,288 --> 01:20:06,516
Wait, what about
that great curry place?

1281
01:20:06,556 --> 01:20:07,955
Don't we get off at Booth?

1282
01:20:07,991 --> 01:20:09,856
Oh, you mean Gupta's.
You get off at Oswald.

1283
01:20:09,892 --> 01:20:11,450
Oh, that's right.

1284
01:20:12,695 --> 01:20:15,163
You know, if I can't be home
for Thanksgiving...

1285
01:20:15,197 --> 01:20:17,961
I need some semblance
of a traditional dinner.

1286
01:20:17,999 --> 01:20:20,194
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

1287
01:20:20,468 --> 01:20:21,765
If you don't have turkey
for one Thanksgiving...

1288
01:20:21,803 --> 01:20:23,430
is that really gonna kill you?

1289
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:27,567
# There is someone #

1290
01:20:27,608 --> 01:20:31,066
# Walking behind you #

1291
01:20:31,112 --> 01:20:34,411
# Turn around #

1292
01:20:34,449 --> 01:20:38,146
# Look at me #

1293
01:20:38,186 --> 01:20:41,553
# There is someone #

1294
01:20:41,589 --> 01:20:45,457
# Watching your footsteps #

1295
01:20:45,493 --> 01:20:46,755
# Turn around #

1296
01:20:54,302 --> 01:20:57,567
# There is someone #

1297
01:20:57,605 --> 01:21:01,735
# Who really needs you #

1298
01:21:01,776 --> 01:21:04,643
# Here's my heart #

1299
01:21:33,841 --> 01:21:36,401
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1300
01:21:39,213 --> 01:21:40,578
This is Booth Street.

1301
01:21:40,615 --> 01:21:45,052
Next stop is Oswald.
End of the line.

1302
01:21:45,086 --> 01:21:49,147
The next stop
is the end of the line.

1303
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:52,955
Wendy! Next stop after this.

1304
01:21:52,994 --> 01:21:55,258
- Let's just walk.
- It's freezing out.

1305
01:21:55,296 --> 01:21:56,923
Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

1306
01:21:56,964 --> 01:21:59,728
I could use some air.

1307
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:04,830
Yeah!

1308
01:22:04,872 --> 01:22:06,100
Ha ha ha! Yeah, man!

1309
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,471
All right, man. See ya.

1310
01:22:07,508 --> 01:22:08,532
Let's go, Bruins!

1311
01:22:08,576 --> 01:22:09,565
Bruins, yeah!

1312
01:22:25,459 --> 01:22:26,983
Hey, man, peace out!

1313
01:22:27,028 --> 01:22:28,552
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

1314
01:22:28,596 --> 01:22:30,996
- Watch out!
- Hey, Bruins!

1315
01:22:31,032 --> 01:22:33,023
You missed the beginning.
Did you see that?

1316
01:22:33,067 --> 01:22:34,193
This is it!

1317
01:22:34,235 --> 01:22:37,864
Yo, comin' through. Excuse me.

1318
01:22:39,907 --> 01:22:41,841
Oh, my God.

1319
01:22:42,843 --> 01:22:46,609
I can't believe this. Here.

1320
01:22:48,349 --> 01:22:51,318
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1321
01:22:51,352 --> 01:22:54,014
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

1322
01:22:54,055 --> 01:22:56,489
Well, Dad's car just, like,
dies out of nowhere...

1323
01:22:56,524 --> 01:22:58,321
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday...

1324
01:22:58,359 --> 01:22:59,724
so instead of sitting around
for a few hours...

1325
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,694
I lucked out and caught
an early train.

1326
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:03,492
I hope I'm not messing you up or...

1327
01:23:03,531 --> 01:23:05,692
No, no, it's just, um...

1328
01:23:05,733 --> 01:23:09,464
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.

1329
01:23:13,374 --> 01:23:15,808
I was just...

1330
01:23:15,843 --> 01:23:19,176
I was feeling like I did that night.

1331
01:23:20,181 --> 01:23:22,172
No. No, it's over.

1332
01:23:22,216 --> 01:23:25,083
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

1333
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:26,416
lan was gonna cause your death...

1334
01:23:26,454 --> 01:23:28,251
you intervened,
and it skipped us.

1335
01:23:34,929 --> 01:23:37,659
Look, I'm not worried.

1336
01:23:37,698 --> 01:23:40,633
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.

1337
01:23:40,668 --> 01:23:41,930
And, if I were you...

1338
01:23:41,969 --> 01:23:44,335
until something happens
to me and then Kevin...

1339
01:23:44,372 --> 01:23:45,999
you've got nothing
to worry about.

1340
01:23:47,341 --> 01:23:49,172
You're right.

1341
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:51,041
Uhh.

1342
01:23:51,078 --> 01:23:53,239
Hey, l... I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, OK?

1343
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,372
Yeah.

1344
01:23:56,317 --> 01:23:57,716
Hey, guys. This is Julie, my...

1345
01:24:09,363 --> 01:24:11,695
What are you doing here?

1346
01:24:11,732 --> 01:24:13,927
Wendy! Julie!

1347
01:24:13,968 --> 01:24:15,868
What are the chances?

1348
01:24:15,903 --> 01:24:17,268
How long have you been
on this train?

1349
01:24:17,304 --> 01:24:18,896
Uh, since home.

1350
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:20,770
I was headin' up
to check out the game.

1351
01:24:20,808 --> 01:24:22,366
I was gonna look you up
afterwards.

1352
01:24:24,979 --> 01:24:26,207
You OK?

1353
01:24:26,247 --> 01:24:28,010
Is something wrong?

1354
01:24:36,624 --> 01:24:37,613
Aah!

1355
01:24:48,969 --> 01:24:50,630
Aah!

1356
01:24:56,877 --> 01:24:58,139
Aah!

1357
01:25:00,715 --> 01:25:03,411
- Aah!
- Unh!

1358
01:25:05,953 --> 01:25:07,944
- Julie, stay down!
- Aah!

1359
01:25:07,988 --> 01:25:10,218
Julie!

1360
01:25:10,257 --> 01:25:11,246
Aah!

1361
01:25:16,397 --> 01:25:17,864
- Kevin!
- Unh!

1362
01:25:19,467 --> 01:25:20,559
Aaaaaah!

1363
01:25:21,569 --> 01:25:23,400
Oh, God!

1364
01:25:23,437 --> 01:25:24,563
Aah!

1365
01:25:25,573 --> 01:25:27,973
Aah!

1366
01:26:14,688 --> 01:26:16,781
Aah! Unh!

1367
01:26:35,309 --> 01:26:38,904
No!

1368
01:26:38,946 --> 01:26:42,245
I was gonna look you up
afterwards, but...

1369
01:26:43,651 --> 01:26:44,709
You OK?

1370
01:26:44,752 --> 01:26:47,243
Is somethin' wrong?

1371
01:26:48,322 --> 01:26:50,517
The train...

1372
01:26:50,558 --> 01:26:53,584
Oh, shit. Not again.

1373
01:26:53,627 --> 01:26:55,219
We gotta get out!

1374
01:26:55,262 --> 01:26:58,288
It's not working.
