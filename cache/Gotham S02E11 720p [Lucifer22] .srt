Gotham will be redeemed

5
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,276
By killing nine random people?

6
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,878
You're insane.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,647
And not all the victims
are random.

8
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:16,215
The Son of Gotham.

9
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:19,452
I'm going to make sure
that you are telling the truth.

10
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:22,255
Touch me and my uncle

Are we good?!

12
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:25,491
Yes.

13
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:26,826
Bruce.

14
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,127
I never bought your stupid act.

15
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,562
You pretended to be my friend.

16
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:31,163
Good-bye, Silver.

17
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,467
(grunts)

18
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,536
Kill him.

19
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,272
(gunshots)

20
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,741
Where's Galavan?!

21
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:43,175
What do you want?

22
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:47,179
Why, your life,

23
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,915
of course.

24
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,456

00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:32,058
(door closes)
Hey, guys.

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,993
I fixed the hard drive.

29
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,462
(calling out):
Bruce?

30
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:38,631
Alfred?

31
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,411
(Bruce crying out, panting)

32
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:02,154
You okay?

33
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,590
Glass of water?

34
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,659
I won't sign those papers,
no matter what you do.

35
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,561
I'm resigned to that.

36
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:10,630
You're a very brave boy.

37
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,699
I'll just have to acquire
your company by other means.

38
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:17,970
My true name is Dumas.

39
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,606
And a long time ago,

40
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:24,443
my family were dishonored
and degraded

41
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,379
by yours.

42
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:29,115
I'm sorry about that, but...

43
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,549
For centuries our noble clan

44
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,986
lived in vile, squalid
obscurity.

45
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,921
But we lived in hope.

46
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,324
Because our patron saint

47
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,860
spoke of a glorious day
to come.

48
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:42,662
But that day would only come

49
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,530
when nine men of Gotham

50
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,932
and the last son
of our mortal enemy

51
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:50,369
are slain by righteous hands.

52
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,840
That's you, Bruce.

53
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,144
You're the last son.

54
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,926
Stop that.

55
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:16,862
Be glad, boy.

56
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,964
You're the anointed redeemer

57
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,499
of your family.

58
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,467
For seven generations,

59
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:24,737
the Wayne family
has wallowed in vice

60
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,605
and corruption.

61
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:31,410
So tonight, at the forewarned
hour of midnight,

62
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,647
the Dumas will be avenged,

63
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:37,783
and the sins
of the Wayne family

64
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:41,954
shall wash away in your blood.

(laughs)

He's a friend.

00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,940
A friend?

83
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:09,608
You're welcome, by the way.

84
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,111
No thanks needed,
saving your life and all.

85
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:13,946
Yeah, thanks, I guess.

86
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:16,182
No, really.

87
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,819
What are friends for?

88
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,422
You got beat pretty bad.

89
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,826
That Galavan is a<i> pistol,</i>
isn't he?

90
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,095
Yeah, he is.

91
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,698
Oh, you're free to go,

92
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,733
of course, Jim.

93
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,269
Desperate fugitive
from the law, though you be.

94
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,771
But I beg of you,

95
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,840
sit and consider.

96
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:46,145
You and I share a bond
in Theo Galavan.

97
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:49,181
A passion, if you will.

98
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:53,786
If there was ever a time
for us to work together,

99
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:56,455
now is that time.

100
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,897
(footfalls approaching)

101
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:10,169
Yes, brother,
it's all yours.

102
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,004
For God's sakes,
smile.

103
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:14,473
Did you find the manservant?

104
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,208
Nope.
(liquid pouring)

105
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,978
You lost him?

106
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,280
What can one old butler do?

107
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:22,715
That's not the point.

108
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:25,417
The point is your
lackadaisical attitude.

109
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,419
We're building
an empire here.

110
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,656
Getting nervous, are we?

111
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:33,292
Your childishness
is no longer funny.

112
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:35,427
You need to grow up.
Oh, please.

113
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,830
Pull the stick out, big shot.

114
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,766
Like I don't know you
from<i> way</i> back.

115
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,601
Don't.

116
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,237
Without all of this wealth
and power, what are you?

117
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:49,074
A sad little...

118
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,776
(quietly):
I said don't.

119
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,380
Uncle Theo?

120
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,217
Yes, my dear.

121
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,519
What is it?

122
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,655
I'm fighting off a cold.

123
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,224
I was thinking

124
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:08,794
I'd go to bed early tonight,
if it's okay to miss out on...

125
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,297
the ceremony?

126
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,799
A cold?

127
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,602
Really?

128
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,038
I'm beginning
to wonder,

129
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,641
Silver, if you're cut out
for the task ahead of us.

130
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,045
I am.

131
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:27,913
Bruce Wayne bested you,

132
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,648
and yet you still feel for him.

133
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,150
He should be nothing to you.

134
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:32,484
He is.

135
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,019
He's nothing to me.

136
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,988
But you can't watch him die,

137
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,489
can you?

138
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,958
You're soft, Silver.

139
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,559
You have compassion.

140
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,561
No.

141
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:46,031
No?

142
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,967
Let's see, shall we?

143
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,637
Hmm.

144
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,941
I'm going to give you a test.

145
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:58,911
Anything.

146
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:02,114
Make Bruce Wayne fall
in love with you

147
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:03,549
all over again.

148
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,985
I want to see him kiss you
before he dies.

149
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,419
But he knows.

150
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,254
He knows what
I am now.

151
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,856
He hates me.

152
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,959
(laughs):
Well, that's what
makes it a test.

153
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,529
If you're guileful enough
to win back his heart

154
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,866
and cruel enough to smile
at his killing,

155
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,335
then I'll know you're worthy
of the family name.

156
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,637
Brother, seriously?

157
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,140
Cut the poor kid some slack.

158
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,742
More from you?

159
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:30,676
Really?

160
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,411
Isn't there some other way?

161
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:34,646
Oh, my dear,

162
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,582
I like you very much,

163
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,450
but family interests
come first,

164
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,919
and there are other girls
of the Dumas blood

165
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,354
I could turn to,

166
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,124
should you fail
to prove your mettle.

167
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,792
Understand?

168
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,229
Do you?

169
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:51,730
My charming brother here

170
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,932
will throw you
out on the street,

171
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,568
if he's kind enough
not to kill you.

172
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,138
Well, let's not dwell
on the negative, hmm?

173
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,773
You can do it.

174
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,074
I know you can.

175
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:04,943
Be resourceful,
be ruthless.

176
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:09,915
Why don't you get yourself
something pretty to put on.

177
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,839
(clattering, latch clicks)

178
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,084
(door closes, latch clicks)

179
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:54,426
(softly):
Hey.

180
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:57,596
Why are you here?

181
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:02,334
I wanted to say...

182
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,837
I'm really,

183
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,973
really sorry
for what's happened.

184
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,012
And I'm sorry
that I had to lie to you.

185
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:18,484
I had to do
what my uncle said.

186
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:25,290
But I think
you're a good person,

187
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,661
and if I could help you,
I would.

188
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:34,266
But I can't,
and I'm sorry.

189
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:36,869
And I thought maybe
you would like some company.

190
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,374
But if you don't, that's fine,

191
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,943
I'll go.

192
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,379
Yes.

193
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,114
Please go.

194
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:53,085
(sighs softly)

195
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,954
You really hate me?

196
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,391
I have no feelings for you
whatsoever.

197
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,560
Well, I like you.

198
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:04,429
And I'm sorry.

199
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,765
That's all.

200
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:13,005
You can stay if you like.

201
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,759
(gasps, groans)

202
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,060
(car horn honking)
Excuse me.

203
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,828
Stop, stop, stop!

204
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,133
Stop, sir! Stop, sir!
Stop, stop, stop!

205
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,501
Excuse me, sir.

206
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:43,869
Oh, what, are you crazy
or something?

207
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:44,670
Stop!

208
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:45,671
Hey, come on!

209
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:47,906
Come on, I got to get to work!

210
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,474
I am most terribly sorry, sir.

211
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,443
I'm in the most frightful hurry.

212
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:52,611
OFFICER:
Freeze!

213
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:53,745
Oh, Officers...

214
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,214
(electrical crackling)

215
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,352
Captain, what the hell?

216
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,753
You put out a warrant on Jim?

217
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,555
"Armed and
dangerous"?

218
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,556
That's right.

219
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,725
He's not a criminal.

220
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,493
He was obviously
abducted

221
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:09,928
or-or-or something.

222
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,129
Look, I hope you're right,

223
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,398
but the facts on the ground
don't look that way.

224
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,499
He assaulted the mayor

225
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,634
and escaped
GCPD custody

226
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,202
with Penguin.

227
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,438
Two good cops died
and now he's a fugitive.

228
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,707
What would you call that,
if not criminal?
Well...

229
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,075
Galavan was obviously...

230
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,710
Galavan is innocent
until proven otherwise.

231
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:26,678
If Jim isn't dirty,

232
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,013
I need to hear that from him.

233
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,148
Where is he?
Do you know where he is?

234
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,516
No.

235
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,685
Do you know how long
he's been working with Penguin?

236
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,387
He's not working with Penguin.

237
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,788
And he's not dirty,

238
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,523
and I resent
being questioned like this.

239
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,525
Oh, stop it.
You're his girlfriend.

240
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,227
You know I have to ask you
these questions.

241
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,962
I'm gonna ask you again
if you know where he is,

242
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,932
because if you do,
and you don't tell me,

243
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,967
that makes you an accomplice
after the fact.

244
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,969
I don't know where he is.

245
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,272
I don't like this
any more than you do.

246
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,806
Jim is like a son to me.

247
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,543
A father would have
shown more faith.

248
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,279
Are you sure you know Jim

249
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,147
as well as
you think you do?

250
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,454
Is your lover-man alive?

251
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,024
Go to Grundy. 805.

252
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,796
(ticking)

253
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,199
SILVER:
Will you please
talk to me?

254
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,168
Silence makes me sad.

255
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,172
Talk about what?

256
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,044
It doesn't matter.

257
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:33,779
Anything.

258
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:36,581
Top ten lists...

259
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,851
best vacations.

260
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,953
What's your favorite animal?

261
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,955
Owls.

262
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,123
Owls.

263
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,760
Owls, okay.

264
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,663
Owls are cool.

265
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,667
Did you ever swim
with a dolphin?

266
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,236
No.

267
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,238
I did, once.

268
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,641
Oh, my gosh.

269
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,142
It was magical.

270
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,479
It was...
like we were friends, like...

271
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:09,881
They have
this power.

272
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,651
They can, like,
read your mind.

273
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:14,386
No, they can't.

274
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:17,456
No, they<i> can.</i>

275
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,691
They can see your brain waves.

276
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,829
They have a form of sonar,

277
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:27,099
so they can see inside you
and detect tumors,

278
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:29,167
that sort
of thing.

279
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,236
But they can't read minds.

280
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,874
Well, the one I met
could read my mind.

281
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,248
(boat horn blows)

282
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
(guns cocking)

283
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,536
Lee.

284
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:06,104
What the hell
are you doing?

285
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,472
I need to get you
out of town.

286
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,975
Penguin has a reliable man
who can take you upstate.

287
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,844
Things are gonna be
unsettled here for a while.

288
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:13,879
Unsettled?

289
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:16,114
We're gonna take
down Galavan.

290
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,749
Are you out of your mind?

291
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,452
Ms. Thompkins,
I can assure you...

292
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,154
He has to be stopped, Lee.

293
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,255
By you?

294
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,756
And... these people?

295
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:25,824
He has to be stopped.

296
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,794
You keep trying
to kill yourself.

297
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:30,162
Have I got you all wrong?

298
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:31,696
Are you just crazy?
Of course not.

299
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,165
You're on the run from the law.

300
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,900
You want to attack the mayor

301
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,968
with the help
of a depraved sociopath.

302
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,203
That's not crazy?

303
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,004
I can hear you.

304
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,105
Shh! Don't speak.

305
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,641
Jim, don't do this.

306
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,142
Let's get out of town together.

307
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,044
I don't care
what you've done already

308
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,879
or what you have
to leave undone. Let's just go.

309
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,448
I can't.
Jim, please.

310
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,184
I can't. I can't let Galavan
win this way.

311
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,753
I'm pregnant.

312
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,689
(Oswald gasps)

313
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,524
(sighs)

314
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:06,131
There were
silver-white roses

315
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,867
and red lilies
all over the house.

316
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,069
All of my friends
were there.

317
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,940
There was music
and dancing.

318
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,143
And my mom
made me a cake

319
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,744
with my name
spelled out in chocolate.

320
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,814
That was the year
before she died.

321
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,919
She looked so beautiful.

322
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,421
And happy.

323
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,423
So, yeah...

324
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:36,027
...that's my favorite memory.

325
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,963
My ninth birthday.

326
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,970
How about you?

327
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,775
I don't know.

328
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,444
Come on.

329
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,079
You must have one.

330
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,816
So your parents
really are dead, are they?

331
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,555
Yeah.

332
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,528
I wasn't lying about that.

333
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,398
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,201
Hey...

335
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,403
that's show business.

336
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,617
We went camping once,
in a forest.

337
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:36,855
My father and I

338
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,124
climbed an oak tree
and ate oranges.

339
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,629
We could hear my mom
singing to herself

340
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,264
as she built the fire.

341
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,004
That was a good day.

342
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:00,245
Damn it...

343
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,048
Damn it. I can't do this.

344
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,318
I can't let you die.

345
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,254
That's good of you to say so,
but is it up to you?

346
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,656
If we can get out of the cell
and past the guard,

347
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,492
I know a back stairwell
that isn't watched.

348
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,827
That's a big if.

349
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,295
What are you going to do?

350
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,865
I<i> am</i> a Dumas.

351
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,068
I have some pull around here.

352
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,538
Open up.

353
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,107
(lock clicks)

354
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,910
Come in.

355
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,480
Give me your gun.

356
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,084
(screams)

357
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,253
(guard groaning)

358
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,128
(panting)

359
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:52,631
Come on!

360
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,142
(Silver screams)

361
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,415
Oh, you silly girl.

362
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,351
What were you thinking?

363
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,030
(crying quietly)

364
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,334
LUCIUS:
<i>Bruce and Alfred</i>

365
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,735
have been gone
for at least 12 hours.

366
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:31,936
I'm afraid
they've been abducted.

367
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,205
We're very busy now, Mr. Fox.

368
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,207
12 hours
isn't very long.

369
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,243
I am sure that
something has happened.

370
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:40,245
We usually don't post
missing persons

371
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,180
until they've been
missing for 24 hours,

372
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:46,017
but out of respect
for Wayne Enterprises...

373
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,919
(line ringing)

374
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,788
Bruce Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth.

375
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,756
Run them through the system.

376
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,224
Thank you.

377
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,959
Was there any evidence
of an abduction?

378
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,795
There was a lamp stand
knocked over

379
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,029
and there was a window opened.

380
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,731
Uh-huh.

381
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,366
Who do you think abducted them?

382
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,835
Well, Theo Galavan
is the obvious suspect.

383
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:05,070
Do you have any proof of that?

384
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:07,172
Uh... threats made,

385
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:08,673
physical
evidence?
No.

386
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,008
But it's obvious.

387
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,509
He's trying to take
over the company.

388
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,111
Captain, we know
the man's dirty.

389
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:14,312
Of course we know he's dirty.

390
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,314
We know the names
of every dirty crook in Gotham.

391
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,183
So what?

392
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:20,318
Proof, Bullock!
Proof!

393
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,753
To get a warrant
against Galavan,

394
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:22,854
we need proof of a crime

395
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:23,988
and proof that he's involved.

396
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,457
(phone ringing)

397
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,325
Speak.

398
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,629
Huh.

399
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:36,134
(sputtering)

400
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,306
Where's Master Bruce?

401
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,808
We were hoping you knew.

402
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,711
I was in the process of
commandeering a vehicle

403
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,414
when two of your...
idiotic cozzers shot me

404
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,516
straight in the bloody
face with a stun gun.

405
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:52,467
Here I am.

406
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:53,417
And there's your
warrant, Captain.

407
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Where?
He was assaulted

408
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,554
on Galavan's
property

409
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,856
by known associates
of Galavan.

410
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,191
While trespassing
in Galavan's Tower.

411
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:03,027
He was lawfully pursued
off the property

412
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,162
by the rightful
occupants.

413
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:05,230
You got nothing there.

414
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,031
Galavan's got Bruce Wayne, boss,

415
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,299
sure as eggs.

416
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,502
Give me real proof.

417
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:12,337
We already jumped the gun once
with Galavan

418
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,072
and we got screwed.

419
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,074
Without solid proof,
no judge is gonna sign

420
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:18,109
a warrant... eggs or no eggs.

421
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,978
So what do you propose we do?

422
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,979
You hang tight.

423
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:22,781
We'll dig up some...

424
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:23,715
health and safety issue.

425
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:26,317
Get a backdoor warrant
for Galavan Tower.

426
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,719
ALFRED:
Right, how long's
that gonna take, then?

427
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,187
BARNES:
Probably till
tomorrow morning.

428
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,389
But...
That's the best
we can do.

429
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:33,324
Oh, uh...

430
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,859
you're free to go.

431
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,327
We'll drop your charges.

432
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,363
Right, well, you know, thank you

433
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,598
very much indeed.

434
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,200
Look, Bullock,
I'm gonna need some

435
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:44,102
clean bandages, I'm gonna need

436
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:45,336
a car...

437
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,539
and a couple of guns.

438
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,373
You got it.

439
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,607
What are you going to do?

440
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,076
I've got no choice. No time.

441
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,778
I've got to go visit him.

442
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,613
I'll come with you.
LUCIUS:
Are two men enough?

443
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,283
It wouldn't seem so, but
violence is not my métier.

444
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,418
No. Two men are not enough.

445
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,521
I would gladly join you, but I
imagine an amateur is no asset.

446
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,090
A hindrance, perhaps.
That's very true.

447
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,559
We need Jim Gordon.

448
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,160
He's perfect
for this kind of thing.

449
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,162
Where is he?
Yeah, where is Jim Gordon?

450
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,264
It's a long story,
but nobody knows.

451
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,966
(chuckles)

452
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,501
Something funny, Ed?

453
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,036
Do you know
where Gordon is?

454
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:20,371
Do you?

455
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,773
Start speaking,
Windows.

456
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:24,709
Um, uh... A diamond plate,

457
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,178
a glowing grate, a place
you never leave. Where am I?

458
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,581
What?

459
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,248
Home.

460
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,150
Whose home? Your home?

461
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:33,718
Gordon's at your home?

462
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,487
N... No. Yes.

463
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,558
Who are you?

464
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,897
Good luck, old friend.

465
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,065
See you around.

466
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,700
I hope not.

467
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,068
Good-bye, Penguin.

468
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,404
Good-bye, Ms. Thompkins.

469
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,406
Please don't think too badly
of me.

470
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,609
We are what we are.

471
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,611
(chuckles)

472
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:01,112
That's true.

473
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,248
Good-bye,
Mr. Cobblepot.

474
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,219
(siren wailing in distance)

475
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,430
(tires screeching)

476
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:23,902
GORDON:
Huh.

477
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,337
Let's go.
Yeah.

478
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:33,778
Wait here.

479
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:54,399
Galavan has Bruce.

480
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,334
I understand.

481
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:59,938
Just promise
me...

482
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,206
What?

483
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,142
Never mind.

484
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,277
Do what you think is best.

485
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,547
Call me when it's over.

486
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:27,365
(crying)

487
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:35,173
I must look terrible.

488
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:40,211
No. You don't.

489
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,649
Thank you.

490
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,321
You're so calm.

491
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,790
It's like you're not scared.

492
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,360
I guess I'm not.

493
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,729
It's weird.

494
00:24:57,731 --> 00:25:01,599
You... are weird.

495
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,668
But I love you.

496
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,438
Do you?

497
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
I do.

498
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,277
Do you love me?

499
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,681
No.

500
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,287
No?

501
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,289
Silver, I don't know
why you're doing it,

502
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,626
but I know
you're playing with me.

503
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:31,162
I know that whole escape
was a ghoulish charade.

504
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:32,964
That's a horrible lie.

505
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:36,167
I'm only telling you this
because, when I'm dead,

506
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:37,702
you may feel bad,

507
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,038
and I don't want you to think
you tricked me.

508
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:44,709
Silver, I don't love you.

509
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,846
I pity you.

510
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:51,049
(exhales)

511
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,490
Why do you do this?

512
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,693
What's the point?

513
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:08,099
Uncle Theo made me.

514
00:26:09,436 --> 00:26:12,437
He said if I can't make you
love me again,

515
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:14,705
if you don't kiss
me good-bye,

516
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:18,209
then I'm not good
enough for the family.

517
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:22,780
He's going to kick me out.

518
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:25,783
Or kill me.

519
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:29,754
Same thing, really.

520
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,193
I see.

521
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,361
God, I'm such a loser.

522
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:39,897
An evil, pathetic loser.

523
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,365
You're not.

524
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:44,435
You're young and scared

525
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,105
and under the control
of bad people.

526
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,375
You can change.

527
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:54,045
There's hope.

528
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,314
You can't even imagine

529
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:59,117
the things I've done.

530
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,653
There's no hope.

531
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:06,257
There's no going back
to normal life.

532
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:09,927
My family is
all I have.

533
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:14,132
Now I've lost them, too.

534
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:20,204
All right.

535
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,405
Everybody set? Let's go.

536
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,207
Whoa, whoa.
What's the plan?

537
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,343
We get into that building,
find Galavan,

538
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:27,011
put a gun in his mouth
until he gives up Bruce.

539
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,347
Then I kill
him slowly.

540
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,748
No. Then we arrest him.

541
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,718
Yeah, no.

542
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,253
Are you nuts?

543
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:36,254
After all that he has done?

544
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:37,622
He's going to stand trial.

545
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:39,390
Gotham needs to know
who he really is.

546
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,759
Gotham needs him dead!
ALFRED:
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.

547
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,695
Can we just stop the bunny and
just first get in there, please,

548
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,164
chaps?
Yes.

549
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,267
Let's go.
LUCIUS: Seriously, that's
it? You have no plan?

550
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:51,269
How are you even going to get
into the building?

551
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:54,172
I know a way.

552
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,109
Who is she?

553
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,143
Fox, that's Cat.

554
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,878
Cat,
Fox.

555
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,846
You know a way in?

556
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:02,847
Yeah.

557
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,081
I know a way in, Gordon.

558
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,117
ALFRED:
How do we know
you haven't stitched us up?

559
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,318
I mean,
you've switched

560
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,920
sides often enough.
How do we know

561
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:10,788
that you're not
working with Galavan now?

562
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,857
How do I know you're not
a Martian in a rubber suit?

563
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,026
I trust her.

564
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,460
You're in, Cat.

565
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,329
Thanks
for your help.

566
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:19,197
Grab a vest and let's go.

567
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,731
People,

568
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:21,465
surely
we should have

569
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,067
a backup
strategy, given

570
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,468
the strong possibilities
of failure.

571
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,870
Au contraire, Mr. Fox.

572
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,606
Failure is not an option!

573
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,642
What he said.

574
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:34,478
As you like.

575
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:40,885
Stop acting like
you're not scared.

576
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,654
I know you are.

577
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:46,190
Sure.

578
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:51,195
Maybe a little but...

579
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:54,665
mostly, I feel very alive.

580
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,669
Happy, even.

581
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:03,441
I'm going to see my parents.

582
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:06,043
(footfalls approaching)

583
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,646
Hold that thought.

584
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,491
Showtime.

585
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,771
One moment, please.

586
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,280
Good-bye, Silver.

587
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,016
I love you.

588
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:47,285
And I forgive you.

589
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:00,665
Hey.

590
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,267

Prepare yourself, boy.

You're a deluded, old fool.

And you'll pay for this.

Ancestors,

00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:45,095

The prophecy is fulfilled.

Stop!

Sacrilege.

(shouting)

619
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:14,558
Listen to me very...
Hold on just a moment.

620
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,261
All right, Mr. Fox,
make it quick, what do you got?

621
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:20,331
I have the current location
of James Gordon.

622
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,635
I'll call you back.

623
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:26,604
(grunting)

624
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,050
Drop the knife, old man.
It's over.

625
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,953
So it would seem.
(shouts)

626
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:44,989
(gunshot)

627
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:49,126
That was a lot of stairs.

628
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,200
You all right?

629
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,275
Where's Galavan?

630
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,346
Only one way out of here now...

631
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:11,782
straight down.
There's only
two of them.

632
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:13,784
Oh.

633
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,986
Yeah.

634
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,523
Silver isn't coming.

635
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:21,091
I just wanted

636
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:23,193
to take a moment,
sweetheart,

637
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,930
to express my deep...

638
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:29,333
disappointment in you.
Theo, leave her be.

639
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:30,668
Silence!

640
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:42,346
Bite me.

641
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,090
What...

642
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,124
what are you doing?

643
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,693
I don't know who
you are anymore.

644
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:58,963
Oh, please, that is such
a ridiculous cliché...

645
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:00,364
(grunts)

646
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,733
Forget it, brother. You lost.

647
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,471
It's time for me to
look out for number one.

648
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:09,473
Sorry.

649
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,175

650
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:24,421

GORDON:
Theo Galavan.

653
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,135
You're under arrest.

654
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:41,505
Oh, God. Uh...

655
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:44,341
you scared me, man. I thought
you were gonna shoot me.

656
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,010
Oh.

657
00:35:46,012 --> 00:35:49,146
Cuff yourself.

658
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,982
Well, thank goodness for...

659
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,184
simple men of principle.

660
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:58,288
Who believe in the system.

661
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,624
This time you'll get the chair.

662
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:06,263
You want to make a bet?
(chuckles)

663
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,966
Whoa.

664
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,101
Maybe you're right.

665
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:13,904
Steady now, Jim.
I was just talking big,

666
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:16,306
as they say.

667
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,341
You caught me fair and square.

668
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,109
Had you that way the last time.

669
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:20,711
You turned it around.

670
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:23,380
Jim.

671
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:25,382
Back up.

672
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,917
I got him.

673
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,218
Back up, I said.

674
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:32,389
And you--
on your knees.

675
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:34,458
I have a warrant
to search these premises.

676
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,627
Jim,

677
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:39,463
now, you put your gun on
the ground and put your hands

678
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:40,731
on top of your head.
What?

679
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:42,332
You heard me.
You're still a fugitive.

680
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,001
Captain, I've done
nothing wrong.

681
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:45,469
I want to believe you, Jim.

682
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:47,204
So we're gonna do this
by the book.

683
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,339
Put your gun on the ground

684
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:51,642
and let's handle this
the right way.

685
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,379
You're making a mistake.

686
00:36:58,784 --> 00:36:59,983

Whoa, whoa, whoa,

689
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:06,957
we are all friends here.

690
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:07,958
Like hell we are.

691
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,359
I apologize for that.

692
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,662
But there we are.
Done now.

693
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:13,363
They're still alive.
That's something.

694
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:16,500
Look forward now, Jim.
What now?

695
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:19,603
I will kill you
to get to him if I have to.

696
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:25,509
Forget that this man
sicced Barbara Kean on you.

697
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:27,244
Forget that he nearly killed

698
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,646
the mother of your child.

699
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:33,283
Forget revenge.
Think of the greater good.

700
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,252
Think of Gotham.

701
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,788
He has the courts
in his pocket and billions

702
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,990
of dollars
at his command.

703
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:41,658
Are you 100% sure that

704
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,994
he won't beat this
and walk free again?

705
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:45,629
Are you sure, Jim?

706
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:46,697
Think of Gotham.

But think fast.

710
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,039
I do believe,
Master Bruce,

711
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,841
this falls
very firmly

712
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,977
into the category
of "I told you so".

713
00:37:59,979 --> 00:38:01,812
I told him so, too, Alfred.

714
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:03,413
Yes, well,
thank you both for your help,

715
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,616
but I had a perfectly
feasible escape plan.

716
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:20,030
You're a man of conscience, Jim.
You'll regret this.

717
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:22,032
I have many regrets.

718

This won't be top of the list.

719
