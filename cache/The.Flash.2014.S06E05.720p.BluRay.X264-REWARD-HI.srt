I'm Cisco, by the way. You must

00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:07,842

You're the person that
I want to run this team when I'm gone.

8
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:20,146
Sorry I went all ice-daggery on you.
I still don't like you.

00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,606
Ramsey, don't do this.

[Cisco] Sometimes the truth is
the hardest lie to see through.

And when you can't put your faith
in the truth,

00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:48,133
all you have left... is yourself.

[Iris West] Barry,
we don't have to do this.

19
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,819
[Barry] It's Tahiti, not Iron Heights.

20
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:11,197
I know, but we've got too much going on
right now to be taking a vacation.

21
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,534
Okay. Look, it's two days, all right?

22
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:16,953
Ramsey's been off the grid
for two weeks.

23
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:19,914
And Crisis is coming, no matter what.

24
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,834
Let me take you someplace special,

25
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,961
where we can have
fruity umbrella drinks,

26
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,963
and get sand between our toes.

27
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:29,007
I do like us.

00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,719
And we're even better with mai tais.

[Cisco chuckling]

Hey, thought you guys
fathwoomed out of here.

32
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:41,620
Uh, we just wanted to make sure
you guys were okay

00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,205

while we were gone.

We're good. Rest easy, lovebirds.
"Team Leader" is my new middle name.

00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:47,984
What was it before?

36
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,278
- Baracus.
- As in Barracas, Argentina?

37
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:55,283
No, as in Mr. T. What...
My mom was a big <i>A-Team</i> fan.

38
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,077
Wish mine was.
Could've been Hannibal Dibny.

Hannibal?
Please, you're Murdock on your best day.

You guys have fun.

00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,376
I'm gonna hold it down with a little
help from my friend, the B.A.R.I.

Aw.

00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,387
It's my decision-making algorithm.

47
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,973
So, if there's a problem,
this is gonna tell us what to do?

48
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:22,268
Yes, and since it's based on
his past leadership choices,

49
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:25,688
it'll tell me how to handle
any situation exactly like he would.

50
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,191
I'm flattered... I think.

51
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:32,070
Huh. What is Barry's favorite thing
that I make him for breakfast?

Uh, banana.

what's Barry's favorite movie?

Oh, thank God. [sighs]

Actually, I mean, I love...
Loved <i>Empire Strikes Back</i> my whole life,

61
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,012
but now that I think about it...

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,267
Oh, God.
My favorite movie is <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

63
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,310
- There it is.
- [Barry] How does it do that?

64
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,272
Fuzzy logic and AI intuition, my guy.

65
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,858
With the B.A.R.I. by my side,
it'll be like you never left.

66
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,777
[Iris West] Well, okay.

67
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,863
I guess we should, uh, get going.

68
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,197
Yes, we should.

69
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,867
- Send me a postcard.
- Hey, look, remember.

70
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,827
I'm leaving you in charge.

71
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:22,287
I'll see you when you get back.

00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:24,288
Bye.

00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,752
So, you got any marching orders,
boss?

[computer processing]

76
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,131
The B.A.R.I. wants me to stay here,

77
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,050
and you to go with Frost,
to stake out Ramsey's lab.

78
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,012
I love it when a plan comes together.

Just so you know...

00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,444
I let you follow me here.

83
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,487
Ah. I'll let you think that.

84

Captain Joe West, C.C.P.D.

85
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,955
So, uh, what brings you down here?

86
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:09,918
People with your face
usually have something to hide,

87
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,794
so when my son Barry told me

88
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,174
that there was a new Wells,
I started keeping tabs on you.

89
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,468
I don't know how new a Wells I am,

90
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,529
and, second, "keeping tabs,"
if that's what you mean by spying on me

91
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,764
from that nondescript sedan
parked up on Lake Avenue?

92
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:28,561
Well observed. So, why are you...
digging holes in the city?

93
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:32,982
[sighs] Well, perfect stranger,
[clears throat]

94
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:36,235
the reason I'm digging holes
underneath the city is... Oh, wait.

95
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,155
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Try me.

96
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,238
Nah.

97
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,222
- [power surging]
- [Joe] No, no, no!

[yells]

99
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,918
[Kamilla] You need some rest.

100
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,045
All those late nights
working on the B.A.R.I.,

101
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,256
- you've barely slept this week.
- Tonight, I'm gonna sleep like a child.

102
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,423
'Cause I got the B.A.R.I...

103
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,843

104
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,553
and I got my boo.

00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,241
Babe, you okay?

109
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,493
No, not really.

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,329
I just almost went Sweeney Todd
on myself.

111
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,583
Why would I do that?

112
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,877
Maybe I was sleepwalking?

113
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:38,006
Yeah, that's, um...
That's kind of your new thing.

114
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,257
Huh?

115
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:41,426
Yeah, you woke me up last night, too.

116
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,928
I heard the front door shut,
and you were standing there

117
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:45,812
with your keys in your hand
and your shoes on.

118
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,100
I was half asleep,
so I just put you back to bed.

119
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,310
- Okay, why didn't you say anything?
- Well, I didn't think it was a big deal.

120
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,230
Just like a one-off,
'cause you're so exhausted.

121
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,442
Well, it is a big deal,
and it's not a one-off anymore, is it?

122
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,193
That's twice now that's happened.

123
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:02,071
Babe, relax. Okay, you just launched
the B.A.R.I. today.

124
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:05,158
You need time to rest
that sexy brain of yours.

125
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:08,453
My brain is the Ryan Gosling
of genius intellects.

126
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:09,829
Okay.

127
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:11,996
Will you please let me know
next time that happens?

128
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,542
- Yes.
- And hide those scissors from me.

129
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,378
- Okay.
- Good night, babe.

130
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:18,462
Good night.

131
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,799
I love... I look...

132
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,763
forward to spending time
with you tomorrow.

133
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,392
Uh, thank you.

134
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:35,730
You're welcome.

135
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,944
Yeah, okay. Good night.

136
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:49,660
[electricity crackling]

137
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:50,787
Oh, my God.

138
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,416
[Cisco] Uh.

139
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,842
It's okay. I know him.

140
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,636
He's my ex's dad.

141
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:11,974
Hey, Breacher,
long time no try to kill me.

142
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,062
What brings you to my bedroom... again?

143
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,483
Breacher?

144
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,153
Hey.

145
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,157
Josh.

146
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,411
It's Cynthia.

147
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,623
She's dead.

148
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,928
I can't believe she's gone.

149
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,598
And I never get to see her again.

150
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:57,103
Cynthia was tracking
a high-level hacker.

151
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:01,858
Goes by the name of, uh, Echo.

152
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,235
She mentioned him before.

153
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,613
Nobody's ever been able to figure out
who he really is, right?

154
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,365
We think Cynthia did.

155
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,201
How he got the jump on her,
we don't know.

156
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,079
I don't see her losing a fight
to anyone.

157
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,207
She won the fight.

158
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,042
Dying here just, uh...

159
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,671
triggered her Collector QT-net.

160
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,549
The quara-temporal containment barrier?

161
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:31,345
Gypsy once said these barriers
were like super-sized

162
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,182
vibe fields around a planet.
The collectors put them up

163
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,726
so a suspect can't breach away
to another world.

164
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,519
And only the Agency can lift it.

165
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:41,314
Meaning her killer is still here.

166
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,317
I'm going to avenge Cynthia's death.

167
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,154
And Vibe is gonna help me do it.

168
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,242
Cisco isn't Vibe anymore.

169
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,329
He decided to take the meta-human cure.

170
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,831
Weren't you worried
about breach psychosis?

171
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,919
It happens sometimes
when you suppress your powers.

172
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:05,421
It's really gnarly.

173
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:07,715
How gnarly?

174
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,929
Hallucinations, weird blackouts,

175
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,554
dry mouth.

176
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,849
My powers weren't suppressed.
They're gone.

177
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,019
Well, even without his meta-powers,
Cisco can still help you.

178
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,021
He's a genius.

179
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,152
[tablet processing]

180
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,654
What would Barry do?

181
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:31,446
[tablet chimes]

182
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,333
The B.A.R.I. wants us to go
to the crime scene.

183
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:42,875
Listen, you don't have to go back there.
I'll go.

184
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,544
I'll come with you.

185
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,590
Kamilla, this could be dangerous.

186
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,260
I mean, we're dealing
with a killer here.

187
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,886
I can't ask you to come with me.

188
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,973
You didn't. I volunteered.

189
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,648
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

190
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,738
[Nash and Joe coughing]

191
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,499
[Nash clears throat] Okay.

192
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,335
[both groan]

193
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,213
[cell phone beeps]

194
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,800
[Nash chuckles] You can dance around
with that thing all you want.

195
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:35,803
This place was a dead zone
long before that wall came down.

196
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,948
Well, it might eventually go through.
At least I'm trying to help.

197
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:38,930
What are you doing?

198
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,475
I'm getting us out of here,
that's what I'm doing. Stupid.

199
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,770
Well, I have a team
that could help us get out of here.

200
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,040
How? How are they gonna help us?
No one knows we're down here.

201
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,524
I am a precinct captain.

202
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,736
I have dozens of cops,
and a whole support staff

203
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,279
that depends on me 24/7.

204
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,049
If I don't show up for a couple
of hours, they're coming looking for me.

205
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,867
All right, somebody's overconfident.

206
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,178
You know what you don't have?
You don't have cell phone service.

207
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,454
You don't have Wi-Fi.

208
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,931
- You have no way of telling anyone...
- [weapon charging]

209
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,416
- What are you doing?
- That we're down here. Right?

210
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,626
- Put it away.
- This is our only option.

211
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,790
- I'm gonna get us out of here.
- What are you doing?

212
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,964
[both screaming]

213
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,682
[both] What is wrong with you?

214
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,769
Why did you not tell me
that this Earth's vibrational frequency

215
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,854
is calibrated at a molecular level?

216
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,065
- You're supposed to be the expert!
- Shush.

217
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,233
Shush me one more time,
we're gonna have a problem.

218
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,401
We already do.

219
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:36,155
It turns out that that fireball
sapped 80...

220
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:37,615
[device beeps]

221
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,743
87% of the oxygen in this chamber,

222
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:44,997
which means that you and I have
42 minutes left to breathe.

223
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,132
[sizzling]

224
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,350
You know, the idea was you'd call me
before he started killing people.

225
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,394
He showed up out of nowhere.

226
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,021
Rat and Pops tried to run for it.

227
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:10,898
They didn't get far.

228
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,486
Frost, that guy's next-level creepy.

229
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,863
I wouldn't go looking for him.

230
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:18,947
[door opens]

231
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,241
Smart move.

232
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,827
Especially without a partner.

233
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:23,994
[Killer Frost sighs]

234
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:26,455
How's business, Snake-shack?

235
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,250
Eh, had better days.

236
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:33,337
You mind giving us a minute?
Need to have a little chat with Frosty.

237
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,719
What are you doing here?

238
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,140
Looking for you. What happened
to staking out Ramsey's lab?

239
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,826
Norvok texted me.
He said he saw Ramsey here.

240
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,102
Frost, as your life coach,
going after Ramsey alone

241
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,812
is probably gonna put me out of a job.

242
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:50,980
This isn't a joke.

243
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,525
This is a fight, my fight,
so stay out of it.

244
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,820
We're a team. Your fights are my fights.

245
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,948
So, why don't you just take a breath
and try trusting a friend?

246
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:04,910
I knew from day one
not to trust this guy, but we did.

247
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,747
And now people are dead,
so I've gotta fix this.

248
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,875
Wasn't that long ago
that I felt the same.

249
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,003
Blamed myself.
Never asked anyone for help.

250
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,379
And you know where it got me?

251
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:18,174
Eyeball-deep in Gingold and self-pity.

252
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,968
So, believe me when I say
that life is better

253
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,053
if you have faith
in the people around you.

254
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:29,185
What?

255
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,480
I know who Ramsey has faith in.

256
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,024
I gotta go.

257
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,402
Did you hear anything I just said?
You can't go alone.

258
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,988
I know what I'm doing. And don't worry.

259
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:42,698
I won't be alone.

260
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,002
Listen, Kamilla,

261
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,005
there's something I've been wanting
to say to you.

262
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:01,008
I've been trying to figure out
how to say it,

263
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,054
but, I don't know, I think I should just
come right out and say it.

264
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,265
- Kamilla, I...
- Holy crap.

265
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,977
- [indistinct chattering]
- [computers processing]

266
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,192
I thought C.C.P.D.'s crime scenes
were serious.

267
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,110
Yeah.

268
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:24,698
Earth-19 Collector Agents take
investigations to a whole other level.

269
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,825
[Zak] Agent Zak Zeal.

270
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,204
Kamilla Hwang, Cisco Ramon.

271
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,122
Yeah, I heard you'd be coming.

272
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:37,878
I thought you'd be taller, you know,
from the way Gypsy talked about you.

273
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:41,257
Now that's funny.
She never mentioned you at all.

274
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,632
[Zak] Hmm.

275
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:47,346
Hey, make sure Walker's updating
the dimensional output report.

276
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,431
Thanks.

277
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,892
You gotta keep on them constantly
when you're in charge.

278
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:54,853
Breacher understands.
Where is he anyway?

279
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,855
He already saw everything
he needed to see.

280
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,148
We're here in his place.

281
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,193
Well, the Agency authorized you
to join this investigation,

282
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,571
so I guess I'll just have to let you.

283
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,656
Is there a time of death?

284
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:10,035
Due to multi-dimensional signal speed,

285
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,872
our best guess is that it happened
sometime between 2:30 and 4:30 a.m.

286
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,041
That's a pretty good guess.

287
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,293
Yeah, I know.

288
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,795
And we found this.

289
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,968
301-H energy cartridge.
Standard issue. No prints.

290
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,848
Combine it with the Sigma baryon residue
we also found, and it looks like...

291
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,310
Echo killed Gypsy
with a transonic-demolecularizer?

292
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,810
Show us.

293
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:37,730
Now.

294
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,359
Her body, clothes,

295
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:45,070
even her communicator,
were all vaporized.

296
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,743
[breath trembling]

297
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,960
Me being like this...

298
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:06,050
I don't want you to think I'm still
hung up over Cynthia or something.

299
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,137
Cisco, someone you cared about died.

300
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,973
I'd be worried if you weren't sad.

301
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:23,484
So, earlier, when we first got here,

302
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,653
you were gonna say something.

303
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:37,748
Kamilla...

304
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,542
- [Zak] We're locking down the area.
- For the love of God.

305
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:42,920
You two need to leave.

306
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,097
Ramon.

307
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,228
I just wanted to say again
how much I truly admired Gypsy.

308
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,481
I've got some big shoes to fill.

309
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,907
We're not seriously just gonna give up,
are we?

310
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,660
No, we're not.

311
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,706
Have you noticed he's the only one
who benefits from Cynthia's death?

312
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,207
So, what's the plan?

313
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,583
[tablet processing]

314
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,253
The B.A.R.I. suggests
a dual course of action.

We may live longer.

What evidence do you have
that anyone, literally anyone,

No.

You selfishly don't believe in anything
or anybody.

335
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,150
I used to be like that.

336
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,196
When my ex-wife left me
and my daughter...

337
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,616
I was broken.

338
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:41,580
So much so that I went somewhere
where I almost never go.

I didn't go there to pray or anything.

I went there to yell at the universe
for destroying my life.

Next day, I'm at home,

You can have faith in anything,

[Cisco] According to B.A.R.I.,

352
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,764
we can use low-level
delta-wave vibrations

353
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,559
to stimulate harmonic resonance
in my prefrontal cortex.

If I think of memories with Cynthia,

355
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,938
we'll be able to absorb
the residual vibe energy

from the object that killed her.

357

Can this machine restore my vibe powers?

358
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,529
No. We're not the generators
of the vibe,

359
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,906
but we will be the receptors of it.

360

But I'm gonna have to see Cynthia die,
won't I?

361
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:11,169
It's the only way we have
of finding out who killed her.

I don't know how it got there.

00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,498
[Kamilla] Anymore?

475
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:11,126
You stopped trusting yourself
the moment Barry asked you

476
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,710
to take over as team leader.

477
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,438
I mean,
you've built this elaborate device

478
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,065
just so you wouldn't have to make
any decisions for yourself.

479
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,800
- That's...
- Let me make this decision for you.

480
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,468
You are innocent.

481
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,472
How can you be so sure?

482
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,100
Because I have faith in you.

483
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,166
The real question is, why don't
you have any faith in yourself?

484
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,940
Because Barry's gonna die!

485
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,485
What if I can't keep people safe
the way he does?

486
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,370
I'm not the Flash.

487
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:48,455
Babe...

488
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,542
Barry didn't choose you to be the Flash.

489
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,878
He chose you to be you.

490
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,720
All these doubts, they aren't you.

491
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,015
They're just noise in your head.

492
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
[machine beeps]

493
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,531
It's been in Wi-Fi mode this whole time.

494
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,161
[Kamilla] What is it?

495
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,621
[Cisco] This code,

496
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:33,458
it's turned my white noise machine
into a micro neural impulse disrupter.

497
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,668
It could go all Wreck-it Ralph
on my brainwaves.

498
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:38,213
Might even look like breach psychosis.

499
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:40,048
Who'd be smart enough to code like that?

500
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,132
Me.

501
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:55,647
Sometimes the truth is
the hardest lie to see through.

502
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,691
And when you can't put your faith
in the truth,

503
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,487
all you have left... is yourself.

You're under arrest, Ramon.

506
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,370
I surrender.

507
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:16,793
I'm guilty.

508
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,795
Suspect is in custody.

509
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:23,299
Initiate QT-net removal, so the prisoner
can be transferred to Earth-19.

510

- [man over earpiece] <i>Copy that.</i>
- [Cisco] Breacher,

511
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,762
that holo-cube will tell you
everything you need

512
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,014
to know about what happened to Cynthia.

513

- [man] <i>QT-net is off.</i>
- [device beeps]

QT-net's down, sir.

515
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,105
I'll cuff him.

516
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:53,580
I'm sorry it had to go down this way,
but I needed you to lift the net.

517
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,541
Re-engage the QT-net.

518
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:57,542
[man]
<i>That'll take four minutes.</i>

519
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,961
I don't care if it'll take four minutes.
Just get on with it!

520
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:01,004
[yells]

[force field crackling]

522
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,010
I hate force fields.

523
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:11,681
- I know.
- Cisco, you think I'm gonna let the man

524
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,684
that murdered my daughter escape?

525
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:18,396
No, sir. And neither am I.

526
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:25,694
[sighs]

527
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:28,572
I'm here.

528
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,576
<i>There's no sign of him.</i>

529
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,787
His breach portal energy puts him
at the east end of the warehouse.

530
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,499
[typing]

531
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,002
Game over, Echo.

532
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:45,214
[sarcastically] Oh, no, you found me.
How did you find me?

533
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,925
I tricked the collectors
into lifting the QT-net.

534
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:51,471
When they did, I knew you'd jump
at the chance to get out of here,

535
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:52,805
and try to open a breach.

536
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,350
I just had to track the portal energy.

537
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,061
Babe, just get him back here
so the agents can take him down.

538
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:01,981
You have approximately two minutes
before my ride out of here boots up.

539
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:07,362
I go bye-bye, and you take my place
in an Earth-19 collector jail.

540
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,072
But you're the one with the gun.

541
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:10,822
So...

542
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:14,160
do you have it in you to stop me?

543
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:16,495
[weapon charging]

544
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,665
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

545
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,168
You are an anomaly.

546
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:29,133
Makes me wonder
why it was so easy to frame you.

547
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:33,596
Don't you wanna know how I did it?
You might learn something.

548
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,390
No, I pretty much figured it all out.

549
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:38,768
After you got here, you killed
the top agent in the Collective,

550
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,853
but you still needed a way out.

551
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,523
<i>So, you used your face to get
into S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

552
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,733
<i>and plant this gun in my workshop.</i>

553
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,907
- Is that right?
- So far so good.

554
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,076
But hacking my white noise machine

555
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,661
<i>to make me sleepwalk...</i>

556
00:33:58,788 --> 00:33:59,788
[yells]

557
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,708
That's when you tipped your hand.

558
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,711
I'd recognize that coding anywhere.

559
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,296
And since I didn't hack it,

560
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,633
I knew it had to be
some other version of me.

561
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,470
I'm not just some other version of you.

562
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,724
I specialize in hacking
multi-versal databases

563
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,600
to create new identities.

564
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:22,437
I could change your world...
[snaps fingers]

565
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,188
in an instant.

566
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,233
You see, somewhere out there

567
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:31,863
is a Cisco Ramon
who isn't as lucky as you are.

568
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:36,826
Who doesn't have the job,
the mind, the life you have.

569
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,787
But if the price is right,

570
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:44,041
Echo can reverse those fortunes.

571
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,880
And you might just wake up tomorrow
living someone else's life.

572
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:50,107
[Cisco] Is that why you killed her?

573
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:53,384
So you could keep peddling
these fake identities to people?

574
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,720
I didn't kill Gypsy.

575
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:57,596
You did.

576
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,515
[laughing slyly]

577
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,435
I'll give her this.

578
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,604
She was a formidable fighter,

579
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,939
but not even the smartest
guy in the room

580
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,649
could beat her in hand-to-hand combat.

581
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,237
But it didn't matter. Even though
she'd been chasing me for years,

582
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:16,824
she never even knew what I looked like.

583
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:20,995
So, when she caught me
and she saw my face,

584
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:24,415
all it took was
one moment of her flinching,

585
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,543
and that gave me the second I needed

586
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,589
to use that gun, the same gun
that's in your hands right now.

587
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:35,051
Do you need me
to spell it out for you, genius?

588
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:40,640
Gypsy is dead because when she saw me,

589
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:43,976
- she saw you.
- Stop talking.

590
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,313
She didn't have to die,
but she couldn't let me go.

591
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,608
She breached me to this Earth,
and I vaporized her!

592
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,735
- No.
- [Echo] Yes.

593
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,197
[both grunt]

594

[weapon charging]

595
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,310
[Echo] Don't feel bad, Cisco.

596
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,606
You're just not wired like me.

597
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:38,781
[Cisco] You're right.

598
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:41,284
I'm a hell of a lot smarter.

599
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:47,582
I programmed that weapon to trigger
an anti-vibrational force field

600
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,208
around whoever fires it.

601
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,669
In this case...

602
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,171
that's you, genius.

603
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,458
Did you get my holo-cube message?

604
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:08,853
It took you long enough.

605
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:25,286
Echo is in an Earth-19 cell,

606
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,455
where he belongs.

607
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,916
I'm sorry I lost faith in you, Cisky.

608
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,003
You know what? It's okay.

609
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,131
Things were looking pretty bad there
for a second.

610
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,173
Yeah.

611
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:43,179
But what I don't get...
If she was dying, why come here?

612
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,105
Because she knew
you would bring Echo to justice.

613
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:57,777
She had to lure him here, to this Earth.

614
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,073
She never lost faith in you, Cisco.

615
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:13,125
Now that this is over with,
what am I gonna do?

616
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,252
[sighs] Same thing I have to do.

617
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:17,964
We start healing.

618
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,342
I wanna invite you

619
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:25,888
to Cynthia's remembrance ceremony
on Earth-19.

620
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,308
You, too.

621
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,019
I'd be honored.

622
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,271
Cynthia would have liked you.

623
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,192
I do, too.

624
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,153
What's not to love?

625
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,201
Awkward.

626
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,288
I have to go now.

627

Well, I... Yeah, I, um...

00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,387
Well, we haven't said it.

631
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,097
Yeah, I know.

632
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:12,435
So... Yeah. I, um...

633
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:18,190
Me, too. Big time.

634
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:19,483
Oh, thank God.

635
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:20,734
[Kamilla chuckles]

636
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,702
Please tell me you went home
at some point.

637
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,413
I knew I smelled SPF 90.

638
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:36,625
- How was it?
- [Iris West] Amazing.

639
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:39,128
Fifteen beaches in 24 hours.

640
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,213
One of the many perks
of marrying a speedster.

641
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:43,049
- [chuckles]
- [computer beeps]

642
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,174
[Barry] Yo.

643
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:47,303
Chester's energy level's
already up to 87%?

644
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:51,682
Yeah. Yeah. The, uh, M.A.C.'s gonna
be done cooking them up any day now.

645
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:55,978
So, the B.A.R.I. was a success?

646
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,439
Actually, I had to get rid of it.

647
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,816
I did use it.
I tried to use it at first,

648
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:05,529
but over time, I finally realized...

649
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:09,950
And you already knew
that was gonna happen.

650
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:12,674
It's just more proof that you're
the right person to lead the team.

651
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:13,746
[Cisco] Mmm.

652
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:18,751
Cisco, we got your message.
I'm really sorry to hear about Gypsy.

653
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,920
Some things you never get over.

654
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,591
Well, her service is next week.

655
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:27,843
You want us to come with you?

656
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,087
- Yeah, I mean, we loved her, too.
- [Cisco] Thank you.

657
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,723
Uh, Kamilla's coming with me, so...

658
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,811
I'm very lucky to have her.

659
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:43,025
Is it wrong to feel that way?

660
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:46,695
I mean, with everything
that just happened.

661
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:50,241
It's like I'm moving on.

662
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,369
What kind of person does that?

663
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,372
Someone who is very much in love.

664
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:01,919
It's funny.

665
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:05,131
Cynthia wasn't the person
I ended up with.

666
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,591
But, um...

667
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,888
I think she taught me
how to be the person I needed to be...

668
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:15,808
for when the right person came along.

669
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,104
And for that, I will never forget her.

670
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:27,945
Your vitals are good, Joe.

671
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,134
[Dibny] You know, with all the hubbub
of saving your keisters,

672
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:35,077
I never got to ask
what the hell you were doing down there.

673
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,496
Hey, 1940s, no one says keisters.

674
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,833
Nash, if you would just tell us
what you're looking for down there,

675
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,668
we might be able to help you.

676
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:47,840
All right, tomorrow morning,
nine o'clock, tunnels.

677
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,216
Bring your whole fancy team.

678
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:51,562
- Why should we do that?
- [Nash] Because...

679
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,138
I know how to save Barry Allen.
