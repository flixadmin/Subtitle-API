192
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,261
Light the trench!

193
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,888
Light the trench!

194
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,149
Soldier 2: Wait!

202
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,111
- Right there.
- Soldier 2: Torch it!

203
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,780
Light the trenches!

204

(Unsullied grunting)

230
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,737
Clegane.

(Baby crying)

232
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,621

You must try not to worry yourself.

(People whispering indistinctly)

234

(Sighs)

235
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,095
At least we're already in a crypt.

236
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,018
If we were up there,

237
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,022
we might see something
everyone else is missing.

238
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,459
Something that makes a difference.

239
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,651
(Scoffs)

240
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,445
What?

241
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,507
Remember the battle of Blackwater?
I brought us through the mud gate.

242
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,617
- And got your face cut in half.
- And it made a difference.

243
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,580
If I was out there right now...

244
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,748
You'd die.

245
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,918
There's nothing you can do.

246
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,467
You might be surprised
at the lengths I'd go

247
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,053
to avoid joining
the army of the dead.

248
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,181
I could think of no organization
less suited to my talents.

249
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,974
Witty remarks
won't make a difference.

250
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,438
That's why we're down here,
none of us can do anything.

251
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,067
It's the truth.

252
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,653
It's the most heroic thing
we can do now...

253
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,157
Look the truth in the face.

254
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,373
Maybe we should have stayed married.

255
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,750
You were the best of them.

256
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,170
What a terrifying thought.

257
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,595
It wouldn't work between us.

258
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,056
Why not?

259
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,058
The dragon queen.

260
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,230
Your divided loyalties
would become a problem.

261
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,065
Missandei: Yes.

262
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,111
Without the dragon queen,
there'd be no problem at all.

263
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,822
We'd all be dead already.

264
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,964
(Wind whistling)

265
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,345
They lit the trench.

266
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,152
Bran...

267
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,576
I just want you to know...

268
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,622
I wish...

269
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,417
The things I did...

270
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,295
Everything you did
brought you where you are now.

271
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,756
Where you belong.

272
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,051
Home.

273
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,564
I'm going to go now.

274
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,735
Go where?

275
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,240

Get out there! Get moving!

292
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,243
Come on. Come on! Come on!

293
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,332
Go, go, go!

294
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,042
Come on!
