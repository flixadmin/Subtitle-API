1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,137
English tour guide:
Right this way, please.

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:09,508
Prepare to gaze upon
england's greatest mystery.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,778
Stonehenge lies
just beyond that hill.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,950
Who assembled
these massive stones,
and why? No one knows.

5
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:20,386
But one thing is certain.

6
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:23,555
Stonehenge shall
forever be--whoa!

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,657
(Gasps)

8
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,862
Missing?

9
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,251
There it is.

10
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,221
Your very own
fax machine.

11
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,327
I do not need
such a device, Jackie.

12
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,097
Uncle gets all his facts
from books.

13
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,866
Not facts, uncle. <i> Fax.</i>

14
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:45,070
It can transmit
and receive documents
electronically.

15
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:48,474
It sends paper
through the telephone.

16
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,478
This could
take a while.

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,246
Here. I will
show you.

18
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,083
Jade, please
find something
we can fax.

19
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,352
How 'bout the news?

20
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,154
Whoa. Check it out.

21
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,157
"Stonehenge disappears."

22
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,258
Come on.

23
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,594
This sounds like a job
for Jackie chan.

24
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,163
No, it does not.

25
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,398
While I am
very concerned
about this theft

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,967
as an archaeologist,

27
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,768
I am an archaeologist,

28
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,838
and this is a job
for the proper
authorities.

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,707
Oh!

30
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,477
Besides, we already
have an exciting mission
planned.

31
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,712
We do?

32
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,782
I am taking you
overseas

33
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,786
on a real live
archaeological dig!

34
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,358
Here.
Your very own set

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,226
of excavation
brushes.

36
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,096
Oh, Joy.

37
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,135
Jade: England?!
I can't believe this.

38
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,671
The stonehenge crime scene
is 50 miles from here,

39
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,606
and you don't even want
to check it out?

40
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:58,343
Look, Jade. A button.

41
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:05,584
Jackie, everybody knows
stonehenge has magical powers.

42
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,352
What if it's fallen
into the wrong hands?

43
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,189
Some people think
stonehenge is magic,

44
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,457
but some people think
it is a beacon

45
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,760
for signaling
alien spaceships.

46
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,897
No one knows what
stonehenge does, Jade,

47
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,766
if it even does
anything at all.

48
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,134
Hmmph!

49
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:25,938
Besides,
what wrong hands
are you talking about?

50
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,906
Evil organizations
are not hiding behind

51
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,575
every <i> cornerrrr!</i>

52
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,913
Jackie?

53
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,082
<i>...ner!</i>

54
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,620
All, chanting:
<i>Ad nocendum potentes sumo!</i>

55
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,322
<i>Ex metu, vires...</i>

56
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,526
Aah!

57
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,531
Unh.

58
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,433
Huh?

59
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,503
Uh, hello.

60
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,306
Uh, sorry
to interrupt
your function.

61
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,374
I will just
find my way--

62
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,443
thou knoweth too much.

63
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,212
Thou must be smoten.

64
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,916
(Gasp)
Wait. I do not
knoweth anything.

65
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,985
(All chanting
in whispers)

66
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,724
Aah!

67
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,733
He seeketh to learn
the mysteries
of our fortress.

68
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,943
He hath spied
the secret library!

69
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,412
Um, library?
What library?

70
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,147
Uhh! Oh!

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,589
He hath discovered
the hidden armory.

72
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,858
I'm just looking
for an exit!

73
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,563
Aah! He has hath entered

74
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,365
the private
water closet.

75
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,401
He is privy
to our privy.

76
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,338
(Cell phone rings)
Aah!

77
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,539
Hello?

78
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,674
Where did you go?

79
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,642
I've been looking
all over.

80
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,943
Did you know
this place has, like,

81
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,045
a million
secret passages?

82
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:14,780
Aah!
- Aah!

83
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,520
Whoa. Who are they?

84
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,755
(Chanting in whispers)

85
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,357
I have no idea.

86
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,578
They must be some kind
of secret society.

87
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,514
An ancient one,
judging by the way
they spoke.

88
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,883
Cool. Taking on these
magical mystery men

89
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:52,951
almost makes up
for missing out

90
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,353
on the stonehenge caper.

91
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,822
We're not taking on anybody.

92
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,424
These, uh, <i> people,</i>
should also be handled

93
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,226
by the proper authorities.

94
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,797
Captain black?
Jackie. How's england?

95
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,032
Dangerous.

96
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,667
I fell into
a hidden fortress,

97
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,169
and men in robes
attacked me with magic spel--

98
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,604
don't! Oh, no.

99
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,373
The "m" word,
Jackie.

100
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,142
My superiors
already think
I'm cracking up,

101
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,643
and they're
<i>istening-lay</i>

102
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,612
to my <i> onecalls-fay.</i>

103
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:21,780
But--

104
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,281
sounds like that
went well.

105
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,851
(Scoffs)
We'll probably never

106
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,320
see those wizards again,
any--wha!

107
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,024
Yon knave telleth others
of the magisters.

108
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,292
Magisters?

109
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,794
He knoweth our name.

110
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,796
He just said it!

111
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,197
(Chanting)

112
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,566
Aah!

113
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,869
(Chanting)
Oh!

114
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,937
Go find the...

115
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,239
Proper authorities.

116
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,650
Help. Bad guys are
attacking my uncle.

117
00:06:58,652 --> 00:06:59,951
Come on!

118
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,188
Um, <i> hello?</i>

119
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,963
Hot! Hot! Hot!

120
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,404
What kind of
proper authority
are you?

121
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,277
(Groaning)

122
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,878
Jackie!

123
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,114
Uhh. Ee-yaa!

124
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,156
Tour guide:
Right this way...I think.

125
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,425
I've only ever done
stonehenge, you know,

126
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,827
and since it's
gone missing,

127
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,930
I'm afraid I'm a bit fuzzy
on the rest of england.

128
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,331
We must away,

129
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,901
lest more outsiders
learneth of our
existence.

130
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,610
Well, we know one thing
about these guys.

131
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,278
They like tacky jewelry.

132
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,247
I don't suppose
either one of you

133
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,816
knows the way
to big Ben?

134
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,555
(Snoring)

135
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,962
Now all we do
is fax it to uncle.

136
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,030
Maybe research
is a bad idea.

137
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,366
If they are after us
because of what we know,

138
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,235
do we really want
to know more?

139
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,270
(Scoffs)
They're hiding
something, Jackie,

140
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,439
and we gotta
find out what.

141
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,307
(Fax machine ringing)

142
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,850
Hello?
(Fax transmission beeping)

143
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,752
Huh?!

144
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,023
Ee-yaa! Ee-yaa!

145
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,293
Tohru! The giant phone
is possessed!

146
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,862
Jade: Transmission
interrupted?

147
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,099
I do not think
this is going to work.

148
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,503
Thou hast faxed
our insignia.

149
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,005
It didn't
go through.

150
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,940
(Chanting in whispers)

151
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,616
All: Aah! The light...

152
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,819
Whither didst they goeth?

153
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,090
Oh. Officer!

154
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,561
Right. What seems
to be the problem,
then?

155
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,863
Ok, this is gonna sound
a little crazy,

156
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,032
but these robed
magister guys are
hunting us down and--

157
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,234
say no more.
You're safe now.

158
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,806
See, Jade?
We just needed
a little help

159
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,975
from the proper...

160
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,443
Authorities?

161
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,814
Thou knoweth too much.

162
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,249
(Both gasp)

163
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,421
(Car starts, idles)

164
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:55,126
Mayhaps we ought
sojourn to someplace
more private.

165
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,635
Uhh!

166
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,172
Jade, I told you to--

167
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,740
oh.
- Aah!

168
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,874
Aah!

169
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,882
(Siren blaring)

170
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,496
Give us the key.

171
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,032
Jade. <i> Please</i>
give us the key!

172
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,369
(Whistling)

173
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,141
(Policeman whistles)

174
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,946
(Policeman whistles)

175
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,556
Yon twain
knoweth too much.

176
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,458
No, we don't.

177
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,527
These guys
are everywhere.

178
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,098
Uhh-uhh-uhh!

179
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,537
Being handcuffed
together is cool.

180
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,705
Unh!
Unh!

181
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,573
Sometimes.

182
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,046
Halt!

183
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,381
Ye shalt be smoten
posthaste.

184
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,054
This way. Aah!
This way. Aah!

185
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,422
Ok.
- Ok.

186
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,723
Uhh!
- Uhh!

187
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,641
Forget stonehenge.

188
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,810
This adventure rules,
Jackie!

189
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,745
We should leave before--

190
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,815
methinks yon varlet
wisheth to challenge us

191
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,149
in armed combat.

192
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,684
What?

193
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:03,154
No! I don't wisheth that
at alleth.

194
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,529
Have at thee!

195
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,172
Jackie!

196
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,290
Aah!

197
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,432
(Creaking sound)

198
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,305
<i>Ex metu, vires!</i>
<i>Ex metu, vires!</i>

199
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,640
Ex metu, vires!

200
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,709
You don't say.

201
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,446
Aah! Unh!

202
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,547
Oh.

203
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,284
I know your
magic words.

204
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,155
<i>Ex metu, vires!</i>
<i>Ex metu, vires!</i>

205
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,457
E<i> x metu, vires!</i>
Ex metu, vires!

206
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,560
(Laughing)

207
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,264
Come on already!

208
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,202
Ye twain knoweth nothing
of our magicks.

209
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,571
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

210
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,173
Smite them.

211
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,875
All: <i> Ex metu, vires!</i>
<i>Ex metu, vires...</i>

212
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,447
Whoa!

213
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,582
Aah!

214
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,262
We have to get help
before they find us again.

215
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,530
(Scoffs)
From who?

216
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,899
We're fresh out
of proper authorities.

217
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,068
Anybody here could be
another magister.

218
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,636
Captain black
has magic issues.

219
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,538
The only one
who will help us
is uncle,

220
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,507
and he can't even use
a fax machine.

221
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,976
You're right.
We are on our own,

222
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:09,047
so we had better find out
exactly what they don't
want us to know.

223
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,988
Let's hope
they don't notice
the missing robes.

224
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,691
Relax. This is probably
the only place in england

225
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,359
where they <i> aren't</i>
looking for us.

226
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,468
"The brotherhood
of magisters

227
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,604
"was founded during
the dark ages,

228
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,639
"when their magic
inspired fear.

229
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,408
"But as science progressed,
their magic was eclipsed

230
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,077
"by the wonders
of technology,

231
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,279
and their power declined."

232
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,981
But what are they
up to now?

233
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,415
Uh, Jackie?

234
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,489
The wizards
stole stonehenge?

235
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,625
Told you it has
magic powers.

236
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,799
Uncle?
Uncle: Jackie?!

237
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,534
This machine is evil.

238
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,737
I am performing
a cleansing spell.

239
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,705
More seaweed, tohru.

240
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,008
Uncle, please listen.

241
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,176
Evil wizards have
stolen stonehenge,

242
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,645
and--
(Gasps)

243
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,680
Jackie?

244
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,354
Let go!

245
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,556
Deny it no further.

246
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,725
Thou knoweth too much.

247
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,794
Well, duh. We do now.

248
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,597
And thou shalt pay
for such knowledge

249
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,999
with thine lives.

250
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,042
Since ye twain dost
knoweth too much already,

251
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:47,245
I shalt reveal unto thee
what no man knoweth--

252
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,581
the true usage
of stonehenge.

253
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,951
Uh, if you don't tell us,

254
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,919
will we still have
to be smoten?

255
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,556
We magisters hath learnt
yon stonehenge

256
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:03,261
to be a magical weapon
of mass destruction.

257
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,629
(Scoffs)

258
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,798
And some people think
it's a beacon

259
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,633
for signaling
alien spaceships.

260
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,867
Ha ha ha.

261
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:13,304
Thou art ignorant
and doomed.

262
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,740
Let the magicks begin.

263
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,976
With the power
of stonehenge,

264
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:22,914
we shalt destroy
thine major cities
one by one.

265
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,851
Thine loathsome
modern world

266
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,887
shalt plunge
into a new dark age,

267
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:35,193
which we magisters
shalt rule once more.

268
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,162
All, chanting: <i> Ad nocendum</i>
<i>potentes sumos...</i>

269
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,603
The fiery blast
we conjureth

270
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:49,273
shalt broil
yon London town.

271
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,942
(Others chanting)

272
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,244
For somebody who likes
his privacy,

273
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,446
this dude is such
a blabbermouth.

274
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,248
Maybe I can...
(Strained groan)

275
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,218
Break these...Chains.

276
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,120
And just in case you can't...

277
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,993
Hey, Jackie.

278
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,095
(Strained groan)
Yes, Jade?

279
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,563
(Loud click)

280
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,067
Did I ever thank you
for these?

281
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,737
Let them escapeth not.

282
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,773
Jackie: Get help.

283
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:27,745
Aah!

284
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,647
Unh.

285
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,782
Huh?

286
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:33,818
Aah!

287
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,755
Ok, let's try this
one more time.

288
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,224
Uncle, evil wizards
stole stonehenge and--

289
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,094
Jackie told me,
so we did research.

290
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,563
Jade, the wizards
are called magisters.

291
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,631
I know.

292
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,732
One more thing.

293
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,301
The society
is very secretive.

294
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,103
I know.
One more thing.

295
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,705
They use magic words
to cast spells.

296
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,641
I know.
One more thing.

297
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,511
Bad day. Bad day.
Bad day.

298
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,448
Ach!

299
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,650
Ye doest more harm
than good.

300
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,785
Thou.

301
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,489
Destroy yon knave
by your hand.

302
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,227
Whoa!

303
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,328
Oh.

304
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,731
Oh! Uhh-unh.

305
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,668
Uncle, on phone:
...And begin a new dark age.

306
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,902
One more thing.

307
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,170
No. No more things.

308
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,839
I already know
all that stuff.

309
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,474
The only thing
I don't know is how
to stop stonehenge

310
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,375
from leveling London
and Jackie.

311
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,444
Why did you not say so?

312
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,480
Magic must defeat magic.

313
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,220
(Uncle chanting over phone)

314
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,387
Uncle?

315
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,658
I may not knoweth
any magicks,

316
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,160
but I know uncle.

317
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,829
(Chanting)

318
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,799
He can understand
sending a spell
through the phone,

319
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,001
but not a piece
of paper?

320
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,402
Oh!
- Ow!
- Ooh!

321
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,542
Yon spell must
be finished.

322
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,377
<i>Ex metu, vires!</i> Unh!

323
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,599
London town
be not destroyed?

324
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,669
Then what dost
this stonehenge doeth?!

325
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,571
Put your hands
in the air.

326
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,578
Whoa! Who are
these guys?

327
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,513
The proper
authorities?

328
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,316
With your testimony,
Mr. chan,

329
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:48,019
interpol should
be able to lock up
these magisters

330
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,086
for some time.

331
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,856
I will tell you
everything I know.

332
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,194
Well, Jade,
your wish came true.

333
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,764
You helped solve
the mystery
of stonehenge.

334
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,899
Yeah, but I still
wanna know

335
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,701
what it's
supposed to do.

336
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,670
We may never know,
Jade.

337
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,519
Hey, Jackie,
how do you keep up
with all your work?

338
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:24,322
I love movies.
I love my work.

339
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,957
The things just
keep coming, keep coming,

340
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,525
keep coming.

341
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,228
We have I don't know
how many restaurants
in China,

342
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,996
Hong Kong, in Japan.

343
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:35,866
I have a camera team.
I have my stunt team.

344
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,935
I have been working
on so many scripts.

345
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:43,007
4 movies. Dubbing
and filming myself. Idea.

346
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,244
So many things.
So many projects.

347
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,946
Yes, I'm sometimes tired,
but I'm happy.
