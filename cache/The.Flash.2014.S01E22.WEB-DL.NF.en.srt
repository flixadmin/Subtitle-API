161
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,538
It was. We've been a little busy.

162
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,001
Well, if they stay in there, they die.
And if we let them go, they destroy the city.

163
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,129
-We're gonna have to move them.
-Move them where?

164
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,923
-Iron Heights can't handle metahumans.
-You're right.

165
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,341
But Lian Yu can.

166
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,303
What the hell's a Lian Yu?

167
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,347
Lian Yu's the island where Oliver
was stranded for five years.

168
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,725
A.R.G.U.S. built a covert military prison on it.

169
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,643
It's where we sent Captain Boomerang.

170
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,063
Oliver keeps his worst criminals there.
They won't be able to escape.

171
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,232
More importantly, they won't hurt anybody.

172
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,650
JOE:
Great.

173
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,987
So we ship them
from one illegal black site to another.

174
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,073
Yeah, I guess so. Yes.

175
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,161
How do we move them
to Oliver's own private Alcatraz?

176
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,121
I'll call him. Maybe he can help.

177
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:49,167
And, Cisco, if we do this,
nobody can get loose.

178
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,003
I might have a way
of getting them out safely.

179
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,671
All right, get on it.

180
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,007
Bar, this is insane.

181
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,425
Joe, we have to do this.

182
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,471
You don't think that if we start bussing
supervillains through downtown...

183
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,847
...nobody's gonna notice?

184
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,391
Oh, they'll notice.
That's where you'll come in.

185
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,271
Oh.

186
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,232
Cecile.

187
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,526
Aw. Mwah. How's my favorite DA?

188
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,280
-Thanks for stopping by.
-Hey, anything for my favorite detective.

189
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,955
Hey. So, what can I do for you?
You sounded a little cryptic on the phone.

190
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,458
Yeah, I wanted your opinion on something.

191
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,836
These people with powers?
The metahumans?

192
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,965
Is that what they're calling them?
People love their labels.

193
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:42,887
Yeah. So let's say, hypothetically,
I know a prison, of sorts.

194
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,556
A place that can do what Iron Heights can't...

195
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,434
...where these metahumans, the bad ones...

196
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,062
...are being locked up.

197
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,564
I'd be very concerned.

198
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,652
Especially if, hypothetically,
you had anything to do with it.

199
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,530
Why are you asking me about this?

200
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,491
Well, because Singh's on his honeymoon...

201
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,203
...and you're the only other person
I can trust to know this.

202
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,374
Okay, what are you asking me to do?

203
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,919
I need to clear a route through the city.

204
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:19,048
-Barricades, police cars. The works.
-What am I to tell people? President's in town?

205
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,510
-I don't know. You think they'll believe you?
-No, Joe. They wouldn't.

206
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,015
What you're doing, it's called unlawful
imprisonment and human smuggling.

207
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,017
Joe, those are very bad things.

208
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,895
These are some bad people, Cecile.

209
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,939
But their lives are in danger.

210
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,568
I can't. I can't get involved in this, Joe.
I can't.

211
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:45,867
And as your friend, and possibly the attorney
who will one day be prosecuting you...

212
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,579
...I am telling you,
get as far away from this as possible.

213
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:04,093
Okay, so A.R.G.U.S. has a transport plane
that can take the metahumans to Lian Yu.

214
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,472
-We need to get them to Ferris Airfield.
-Oliver Queen came through.

215
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,767
No, actually. It was not him.
Apparently he's in Nanda Parbat.

216
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,227
-What?
-Wherever that is. I don't know.

217
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,229
I called Lyla, Diggle's wife.

218
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,607
She's gonna hook us up.

219
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,026
So, what about C.C.P.D. giving us an escort?

220
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,237
Man, it ain't happening.
You saw me talking to the DA.

221
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,906
She was very clear.

222
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,242
I could lose my badge. I could go to jail.
We could go to jail.

223
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,620
We are protecting people.

224
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:35,583
We are, Barry, but I'm a cop.
There's a certain set of rules I need to follow.

225
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,294
And this year, I broke all of them.
Lying to my boss...

226
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,671
-I know.
-...ignoring the law.

227
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,175
At what point do we become no different
than the people we're fighting?

228
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,843
-We are way different.
-How?

229
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,596
We only break the rules to help people.

230

If it isn't the Scarlet Speedster.

234
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,249
We need to talk.

00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,257
You want anything? Beer? Food?

236
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,218
Pickled eggs here are fantastic.

237
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,096
No, I'm good.
I need your help with a problem.

238
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:34,559
Must be pretty desperate to come
asking for my assistance, but I'll bite.

239
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,893
What do you need?

240
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,396
Help transporting
some people out of the city.

241
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,647
How many?

242
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,691
Five.

243
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:46,070
Five very bad, very angry people...

244
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,738
...who have powers.

245
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,949
Powers, hmm?

246
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,577
So you want me to, what,
freeze the problem?

247
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,413
Protect you from them
if anything goes wrong?

248
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,960
First rule of business,
always protect yourself.

249

I'm not gonna help
usher your enemies out of town.

250

They're not just my enemies.
They're yours too.

251
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,884
I doubt it.

252
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,181
They will destroy Central City.

253
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,183
It's not my problem.

254
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,477
You said you love it here. That this is home.

255
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,020
I do, and it is.

256
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,605
Well, guess what.

257
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,442
These people get loose,
there won't be a city to love anymore.

258
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,362
You won't be able to rob anyone
if everybody's dead.

259
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,493
It's a compelling argument.

If I'm gonna help you out...

261
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,375

He didn't do anything to me, Iris.
It's what he showed me.

Why would you do something so stupid?

Because, Joe,
we have already tried everyone else.

with so much power...

to disrupt the metahumans' powers.
