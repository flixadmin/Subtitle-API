This business directly affects Arthur,
but he's not here,

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,320
so we'll take a vote without him.

215
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,876
What business?

216
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,315
Official business that wasn't
on your agenda, Ada.

217
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,957
An informant told us

218
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,954
that six years ago, Luca Changretta
came from New York to Birmingham

219
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,952
to be best man at his cousin's wedding.

220
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,600
POLLY: We found out that they used
Reid and Dunn on Broadgate

221
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,909
for the photographs.

222
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,719
The photographer kept the negatives.

223
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,156
I persuaded him to give us copies.

224
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,472
And to enlarge this one.

225
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,232
That is Luca Changretta.

226
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,836
TOMMY: I've seen his face,
so I could pick him out.

227
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,794
Half the men in the photograph
are Changrettas,

228
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,873
which means the chances are
they are the men who come to kill us.

229
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,030
We need to get both these photographs
into pubs and on street corners.

230
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,919
Then we put it about
that there's a reward for information.

231
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,911
We also propose that we give a copy
of this photograph to Mr Aberama Gold.

232
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,272
We need to forget the idea that it
has to be Arthur that pulls the trigger.

233
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,794
Tradition will just fuck us up.

234
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,070
We should wait for Arthur.

235
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,913
Arthur's not here, Ada.

236
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,037
We need Luca Changretta dead. That's it.

She has every right to come in here.

let someone know.
We thought you were dead.

No there's not, there's 13.

I just killed two of them.

Ripped out their hearts
and burnt their bones to ash.

341
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,797
I did it.

342

You took a vote in my absence.

All right, calm down
and tell me about the men you killed.

my fucking job anyway.

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,514
How did the men get in the factory?
I need to know.

362
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,716
Through the back fucking door

00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,711
that was supposed to be
locked and bolted.

00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,709
Some bastard gave me up.
Somebody with keys.

Yeah. Why don't you sit down
and work it out for yourself.

What are you doing?

395
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,638
Now fire it into the fireplace.

Please.

397
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,797
- All right.
- Fire it.

398
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,514
Get rid of it.

399
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,953
Then we'll go to bed.

We'll do anything you like.

401
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,916
Just fire the gun, Arthur.

402
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,280
Fire it.

You go tell Polly...

405
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,469
there are rules between a man and woman.

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,793
There are rules.

That I have to do this.

408
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,318
I have to do it.

00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,632

Was what fear or hatred?

Now, I'm gonna ask you again.

419
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,197
Was it fear of the Italians

420
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,069
or hatred of us

421
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,231
that made you unlock the door
and give up my brother?

422
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,717
I didn't unlock any door.

423
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,038

You mean you don't know?

431
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,672
I run a factory
full of black leg non-union labour.

432
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,358
I live in a street
full of men laid off or on strike.

433
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,276
Look at the photograph, Mr Devlin,
and tell me who are the men

434
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,113
- that contacted you.
- No.

435

- No, you listen to me.

and burnt on my shift.

439
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,919
And you ask me why I'm getting on
the midnight train to Glasgow.

440
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,472
Who else has the keys to that door?

441
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,755
They hang on a hook inside my office.

442
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,077
Today I left the office unlocked.

443
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,038
- Why?
- Because I forgot.

444
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,795
Because I left in a hurry.

445
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,475
Because there were men
trying to set fire to the factory.

446
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,872
Mr Shelby, may I tell you something?

447
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,512
You have a lot of enemies.

448
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,032
Communists. Italians.

449
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,037
Before the factory came out on strike,

450
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,354
I heard word that two Italians attended
a communist party meeting in Stechford.

451
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,233
They hardly spoke English.

452
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,751
Now, if they got a party man
into the factory,

453
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,275
it might have been him
that unlocked the door for them.

454
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,514
Mr Shelby, my train leaves at 12:00.

455
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,037
It's just gone 11:00.
I can still make it.

456
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,437
Please. For my kids.

457
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,040
I need you here.

458
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,511
Isiah, get three of our men
with police badges

462
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,233
For the curtains.

463
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,590
Before you, I was
an ordinary working man.

- Do I not get a drink?
- No.

in this photograph before?

What?

You're a member

I did some research on you.

It turns out I know someone
who used to know you very well.

KittyJurossi.

501
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,839
You were in love with Kitty's sister.
Greta Jurossi. Before the war.

502
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,593
Do you remember Greta Jurossi?

503
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,712
Her parents were Italian.

504
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,916
They didn't approve of a Watery Lane
Gypsy, but you won them over.

With your charm. Sweetness.

Very, very thorough research.

507
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,357
Greta died at the age of 19.
Of consumption.

508
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,235
And Kitty said you were at her bedside
for three months.

509
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,152
Every day, holding her hand.

510
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,757
And after she died you went away to war.

511
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,674
Kitty said that the sweet boy who left
never came back.

512
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,594
No one came back.

Here's the funniest thing.

514

She said in those days
you believed in things.

515
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,315
In justice. Fairness.

516
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,556
Once you saw a man beating his horse
and you fought him.

517

He was twice your size but you beat him.

518
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,313
And then you beat him with his own whip.

519

Kitty always liked to tell tall tales.

520

She's a party member now.

521
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,677
She swears
before you enlisted in the army

522
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,036
you joined the Communist party yourself.

I've also done my research.

529

Your sweetheart was at Passchendaele.

he was listed among the shell shocked.

This afternoon two men came into
my factory and tried to kill my brother.

535
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,119
I believe a Stechford Communist party
member let him in.

I was wondering if you might be able
to help me in my investigations.

Kitty said next time I see you,
before we start fighting,

I should send you her love
from the good old days

Two former workhouses.

00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,437
I want you to be
in charge of the project.

Why?

660
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,833
Because I promised someone
I'd change the world.

661
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,672
You do realise, Tommy,
we're all going fucking mad here.

662
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,359
Yeah, I know.

663
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,275

- How was your day?
- Yeah, it was okay.

667
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,034
Good man. Well done.

668
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,000
No trouble?

669
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,117
No. No trouble.

670
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,714
And she looked after you?

671
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,232
I don't want it like that
ever again, Tom.

672
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,834
Not when they don't even want to do it,

674

Everything's for the money, Finn.

675
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,555
Yeah, I know. But...

676
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,199
She said, "Be a man."

677
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,630
And were you a man?

678
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,756
Yeah.

679
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,950
But then I apologised to her.
Because she looked so tired.

680
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,873

She was right.

684
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,796
You need to be a fucking man.

686
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,633
Working in a fucking factory
gets you tired.

687
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,316
I don't go round apologising.
Do I?

688
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,676
No.

689

- Yeah.
- So...

692
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,154
Be a fucking man.

693
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,313

Yes.

The boy in the hospital

to spare Finn and Arthur.

In return for what?

710
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,835
Tommy Shelby.

711
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,554
And, uh, why should I trust you?

712
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,513
Because you know our history.

713
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,799
You know what happened between us.

714
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,996
You are an unlikely Cassius.

You know, my mother...

00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,993
My mother knew your mother.

718
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,631
She taught her how to read.

719
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,518
Did she tell you
that John and Arthur spared her life?

720
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,114
When Tommy wanted her dead.

721
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,794
Yeah.

722
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,072
And now she's given me
the information about you people.

723

So Tommy Shelby was right.

His, uh, ruthlessness

725
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,318
was justified.

726
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,599
You should have killed her
when you had the chance.

727
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,792
John was a good boy.

728

Arthur tries.

729
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,478
Tommy's different.

730
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,038
You take Tommy.
Spare the rest.

"That Polly Gray,
