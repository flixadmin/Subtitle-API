1
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,544
Wait for it.

2
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,464
- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.

3
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,471
Jane, you can't keep doing this.

4
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,309
The last 17 occurrences
have been predictable to the second.

5
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,895
Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.

6
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,814
I'm telling you, there's a connection

7
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,692
between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.

8
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:52,363
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you
to fly out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.

9
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:53,823
Jane?

10
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,491
I think you want to see this.

11
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,997
What is that?

12
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,007
I thought you said
it was a subtle aurora!

13
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,258
Go!

14
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,517
- Get closer.
- Right. Good one.

15
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,685
Go!

16
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,662
What are you doing?

17
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,832
I am not dying for six college credits!

18
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,772
I think that was legally your fault.

19
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,357
Get the first aid kit.

20
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,108
Do me a favour and don't be dead.

21
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,485
Please.

22
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,325
Where did he come from?

23
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,844
<i>Once,</i>

24
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:42,681
<i>mankind accepted a simple truth,</i>

25
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:46,435
<i>that they were not alone
in this universe.</i>

26
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:52,441
<i>Some worlds man believed
to be home to their gods.</i>

27
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,528
<i>Others, they knew to fear.</i>

28
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,869
<i>From a realm of cold and darkness
came the Frost Giants,</i>

29
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,762
<i>Threatening to plunge the mortal world
into a new ice age.</i>

30
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,189
<i>But humanity
would not face this threat alone.</i>

31
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:13,105
<i>Our armies drove the Frost Giants
back into the heart of their own world.</i>

32
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,736
<i>The cost was great.</i>

33
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,155
<i>In the end,</i>

34
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,449
<i>their king fell.</i>

35
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,123
<i>And the source of their power
was taken from them.</i>

36
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,293
<i>With the last great war ended,</i>

37
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,714
<i>we withdrew from the other worlds
and returned home</i>

38
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,966
<i>to the Realm Eternal,</i>

39
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,969
<i>Asgard.</i>

40
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:18,254
<i>Here we remain as a beacon of hope,</i>

41
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,174
<i>shining out across the stars.</i>

42
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,554
<i>And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,</i>

43
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,140
<i>it was Asgard</i>

44
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,226
<i>and its warriors</i>

45
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,769
<i>that brought peace</i>

46
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,521
to the universe.

47
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,236
But the day will come

48
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,114
when one of you

49
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,033
will have to defend that peace.

50
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,953
Do the Frost Giants still live?

51
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:52,288
When I'm king,

52
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,292
I'll hunt the monsters down
and slay them all!

53
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,961
Just as you did, Father.

54
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,088
A wise king

55
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:05,259
never seeks out war.

56
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,683
But he must always be ready for it.

57
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,947
- I'm ready, Father.
- So am I.

58
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,909
Only one of you can ascend
to the throne.

59
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,997
But both of you were born to be kings.

60
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,102
Oh, please.

61
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:57,204
Thor Odinson,

62
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,290
my heir,

63
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,254
my firstborn.

64
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:11,510
So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer Mjolnir,

65
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,680
forged in the heart of a dying star,

66
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:18,016
its power has no equal,

67
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,811
as a weapon to destroy

68
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,105
or as a tool to build.

69
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,400
'Tis a fit companion for a king.

70
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,487
I have defended Asgard

71
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,658
and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms

72
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:37,119
<i>from the time of the great beginning.</i>

73
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,455
<i>Though the day has come...</i>

74
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,776
Do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms?

75
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,402
I swear.

76
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,697
And do you swear
to preserve the peace?

77
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,282
I swear.

78
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,367
Do you swear

79
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,996
to cast aside all selfish ambition

80
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,957
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the Realms?

81
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,209
I swear!

82
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,878
Then, on this day,

83
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,589
I, Odin Allfather,

84
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,675
proclaim you...

85
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,482
The Frost Giants!

86
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,821
The Jotuns must pay
for what they've done!

87
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,240
They have paid, with their lives.

88
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,410
The Destroyer did its work,

89
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,745
the Casket is safe, and all is well.

90
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,080
All is well?

91
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,625
They broke into the weapons vault!

92
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,295
If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

93
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,630
- They didn't.
- Well, I want to know why!

94
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,635
I have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotuns.

95
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:03,307
He just broke your truce!
They know you are vulnerable!

96
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,350
What action would you take?

97
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:08,812
March into Jotunheim as you once did.
Teach them a lesson.

98
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,314
Break their spirits

99
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,524
so they'll never dare
try to cross our borders again.

100
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,904
You're thinking only as a warrior.

101
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,235
This was an act of war!

102
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,571
It was the act of but a few,
doomed to fail.

103
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,156
Look how far they got!

104
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,662
We will find the breach in our defences
and it will be sealed.

105
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,076
As King of Asgard...

106
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,913
But you're not king!

107
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,167
Not yet.

108
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,910
It's unwise to be in my company
right now, Brother.

109
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,830
This was to be my day of triumph.

110
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,376
It'll come.

111
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,962
In time.

112
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,297
What's this?

113
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,885
If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.

114
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,805
About the Frost Giants,
about Laufey, about everything.

115
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,767
If they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defences once,

116
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,394
who's to say they won't try again?

117
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,521
- Next time with an army.
- Exactly.

118
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,399
There's nothing you can do
Without defying Father.

119
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,403
No, no, no. I know that look.

120
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,700
That's the only way
to ensure the safety of our borders.

121
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,864
Thor, it's madness.

122
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,784
Madness? What sort of madness?

123
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,078
We're going to Jotunheim.

124
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,706
What?

125
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,000
This isn't like a journey to Earth

126
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,127
where you summon
a little lightning and thunder,

127
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,879
and the mortals worship you as a god.

128
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,256
This is Jotunheim.

129
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,633
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

130
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:04,469
defeated their armies
and took their Casket.

131
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,221
We would just be looking for answers.

132
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,597
It is forbidden!

133
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,936
My friends, have you forgotten
all that we have done together?

134
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,063
Fandral, Hogun.

135
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,025
Who led you
into the most glorious of battles?

136
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,985
You did.

137
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,404
And Volstagg,
to delicacies so succulent,

138
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,073
you thought you'd died
and gone to Valhalla?

139
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,492
You did.

140
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:28,618
Yes!

141
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,662
And who proved wrong
all who scoffed at the idea

142
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,206
that a young maiden could be
one of the fiercest warriors

143
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,294
this realm has ever known?

144
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,375
I did.

145
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,420
<i>True, bum supported you, all.</i>

146
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,838
My friends,

147
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,257
we're going to Jotunheim.

148
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,684
You leave this to me.

149
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,980
- Good Heimdall...
- You're not dressed warmly enough.

150
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,190
I'm sorry?

151
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,068
Do you think that you can deceive me?

152
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,095
- You must be mistaken...
- Enough!

153
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,742
Heimdall, may we pass?

154
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:57,332
Never has an enemy slipped my watch
until this day.

155
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,836
I wish to know how that happened.

156
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,547
Then tell no one where we have gone
until we've returned.

157
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,465
Understand?

158
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,097
What happened?
Silver tongue turn to lead?

159
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,185
Be warned.

160
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:02,856
I will honour my sworn oath
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

161
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,318
If your return
threatens the safety of Asgard,

162
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,778
Bifrost will remain closed to you

163
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,324
and you'll be left to die
in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

164
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,367
Couldn't you just
leave the bridge open for us?

165
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,744
To leave the bridge open

166
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,996
would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost

167
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,082
and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.

168
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,460
I have no plans to die today.

169
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,253
None do.

170
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,801
We shouldn't be here.

171
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,596
Let's move.

172
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,781
Where are they?

173
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,199
Hiding,

174
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,868
as cowards always do.

175
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:34,591
You've come a long way to die,
Asgardians.

176
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,218
I am Thor Odinson!

177
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,304
We know who you are.

178
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,973
How did your people get into Asgard?

179
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:55,445
The House of Odin is full of traitors.

180
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,031
Do not dishonour my father's name
with your lies!

181
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,951
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

182
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,413
And why have you come here?
To make peace?

183
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,750
You long for battle. You crave it.

184
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,336
You're nothing but a boy

185
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:14,005
trying to prove himself a man.

186
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,718
Well, this "boy"
has grown tired of your mockery.

187
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,852
Thor, stop and think.

188
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,646
Look around you, we're outnumbered.

189
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,439
Know your place, Brother.

190
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:35,110
You know not
what your actions would unleash.

191
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,114
I do.

192
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,993
Go now, while I still allow it.

193
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,007
We will accept your most gracious offer.

194
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,105
Come on, Brother.

195
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,863
Run back home, little princess.

196
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,322
Damn.

197
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:27,954
Next?

198
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,350
At least make it a challenge for me!

199
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,372
That's more like it.

200
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,284
Don't let them touch you!

201
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,412
Thor!

202
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,790
- We must go!
- Then go!

203
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,024
Run!

204
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,319
Thor!

205
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,386
Heimdall!

206
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,388
Open the bridge!

207
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,539
Father! We'll finish them together!

208
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,040
Silence!

209
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,423
Allfather.

210
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,926
You look weary.

211
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,221
Laufey,

212
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,140
end this now.

213
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,267
Your boy sought this out.

214
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,186
You're right.

215
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,732
And these are the actions of a boy,
treat them as such.

216
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,987
You and I can end this here and now,
before there's further bloodshed.

217
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,741
We are beyond diplomacy now,
Allfather.

218
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,495
He'll get what he came for.

219
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:01,621
War

220
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,706
and death.

221
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,834
So be it.

222
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,526
Why did you bring us back?

223
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,989
Do you realise what you've done?
What you've started?

224
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:36,155
- I was protecting my home.
- You cannot even protect your friends!

225
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,990
How can you hope
to protect a kingdom?

226
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,784
Get him to the healing room! Now!

227
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,663
There won't be a kingdom to protect
if you're afraid to act.

228
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:48,251
The Jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.

229
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,962
That's pride and vanity talking,
not leadership.

230
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,090
You've forgotten everything I taught you
about a warrior's patience.

231
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,844
While you wait and be patient,
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

232
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,303
The old ways are done.

233
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:02,056
You'd stand giving speeches
while Asgard falls.

234
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,643
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

235
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,771
And you are an old man and a fool!

236
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,779
Yes.

237
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,282
I was a fool

238
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,534
to think you were ready.

239
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,160
Father...

240
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,792
Thor Odinson,

241
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,547
you have betrayed
the express command of your king.

242
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,425
Through your arrogance and stupidity,

243
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,386
you've opened these peaceful realms
and innocent lives

244
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,181
to the horror and desolation of war!

245
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:54,150
You are unworthy of these realms!

246
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:57,069
You're unworthy of your title!

247
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,821
You're unworthy

248
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:05,953
of the loved ones you have betrayed.

249
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,424
I now take from you your power!

250
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,595
In the name of my father

251
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,889
and his father before,

252
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:27,850
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

253
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,777
Whosoever holds this hammer,
if he be worthy,

254
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,528
shall possess the power of Thor.

255
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,263
I think that was legally your fault.

256
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,015
Get the first aid kit.

257
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,517
Do me a favour and don't be dead.

258
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,608
Does he need CPR?
Because I totally know CPR.

259
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,956
Where did he come from?

260
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:36,877
You all right?

261
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,045
Hammer?

262
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,338
Hammer?

263
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,582
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
It's pretty obvious.

264
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,593
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

265
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:47,471
We have to move quickly
before this all changes.

266
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,224
Jane, we have to take him
to the hospital.

267
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,727
- Father!
- He's fine, look at him.

268
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,814
Heimdall! I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!

269
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,816
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

270
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,402
You. What realm is this?

271
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,987
Alfheim? Nornheim?

272
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,113
New Mexico?

273
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:08,534
You dare threaten me, Thor,
with so puny a weapon?

274
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,040
What? He was freaking me out!

275
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,500
Next time
you decide to taser somebody,

276
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:19,003
make sure he's already in the car, okay?

277
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:22,298
Jane! Come on.

278
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:41,358
Name?

279
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,986
He said it was Thor?

280
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:47,323
T-H-O-R.

281
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:50,409
- And your relationship to him?
- I've never met him before.

282
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,994
Until she hit him with a car.

283
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,789
I grazed him, but she tasered him.

284
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,415
Yes, I did.

285
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,126
Hi.

286
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:01,583
Just taking a little blood.

287
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,006
How dare you attack the son of Odin?

288
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,966
I need some help!

289
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,594
Call security!

290
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,013
Security to ER 3, stat!

291
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,987
You're no match for the Mighty...

292
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,302
<i>You don't think
this was just a magnetic storm, do you?</i>

293
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:34,388
Look, the lensing around these edges

294
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,891
is characteristic
of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

295
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,142
A what?

296
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,314
- I thought you were a science major?
- Political science.

297
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,229
She was the only applicant.

298
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,982
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection

299
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,320
between two different points
of space-time.

300
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,735
It's a wormhole.

301
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,821
- Erik, look. What do you see?
- Stars.

302
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,740
Yeah, but not our stars.

303
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:56,577
See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year,

304
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,788
and unless Ursa Minor decided
to take a day off,

305
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,082
these are
someone else's constellations.

306
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,001
Hey! Check this out.

307
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,593
No, it can't be.

308
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,764
I think I left something at the hospital.

309
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,365
It's not possible!

310
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,756
He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.

311
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,058
Oh, my God.

312
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,605
I just lost
my most important piece of evidence.

313
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:07,731
Typical.

314
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,984
- So now what?
- We find him.

315
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,443
Did you see what he did in there?

316
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,320
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

317
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,743
Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event,

318
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,492
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

319
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,618
Okay.

320
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,329
So we're gonna look
all over New Mexico, right?

321
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:23,747
Exactly.

322
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,044
What?

323
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:33,257
I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

324
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,942
I got it, I got it.

325
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:03,579
Come on, kick it in now!

326
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,464
Did it work?

327
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,404
Sir, we found it.

328
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,998
You know, for a crazy homeless person,
he's pretty cut.

329
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,128
Hey, sorry I tased you!

330
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,549
Excuse me, excuse me!

331
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,308
What is this?

332
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,479
My ex.

333
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:15,025
Good with patients
and bad with relationships.

334
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,531
They're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.

335
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:18,654
They will suffice.

336
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,739
You're welcome.

337
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,282
This mortal form has grown weak.

338
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,201
I need sustenance.

339
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,264
We should never have let him go.

340
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,015
There was no stopping him.

341
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,059
Well, at least he's only banished,
not dead.

342
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:50,436
Which is what we'd all be

343
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,230
if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

344
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,113
How did the guard even know?

345
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,698
I told him.

346
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:05,200
What?

347
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,870
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

348
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,375
He should be flogged for taking so long.

349
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:10,998
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

350
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,124
You told the guard?

351
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,209
I saved our lives.

352
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,128
And Thor's.

353
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,672
I had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.

354
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:20,883
Loki.

355
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,428
You must go to the Allfather
and convince him to change his mind.

356
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:27,139
And if I do, then what?

357
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,058
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know What he is.

358
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,270
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.

359
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,314
You saw how he was today.

360
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:37,206
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

361
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:46,575
He may speak of the good of Asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

362
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:49,745
We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

363
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,914
Laufey said

364
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,500
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

365
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,421
A master of magic
could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

366
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,925
Loki's always been one for mischief,

367
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,427
but you're talking
about something else entirely.

368
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,282
Stop!

369
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,454
Am I cursed?

370
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:33,956
No.

371
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,294
What am I?

372
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,797
You're my son.

373
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,976
What more than that?

374
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,400
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,

375
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:02,484
was it?

376
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,576
No.

377
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:13,745
In the aftermath of the battle,

378
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,665
I went into the temple
and I found a baby.

379
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,006
<i>Small for a giant's offspring.</i>

380
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,342
<i>Abandoned, suffering, left to die.</i>

381
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,012
<i>Laufey's son.</i>

382
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,515
Laufey's son.

383
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:38,353
Yes.

384
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:42,941
Why?

385
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,695
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood,
why would you take me?

386
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,280
You were an innocent child.

387
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:52,367
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

388
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,040
Tell me!

389
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,544
I thought
we could unite our kingdoms one day.

390
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:05,964
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

391
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,633
Through you.

392
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:08,884
What?

393
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,304
But those plans no longer matter.

394
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:17,142
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

395
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,686
locked up here
until you might have use of me.

396
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,229
Why do you twist my words?

397
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,318
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,

398
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,399
why didn't you?

399
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,817
You're my son.

400
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,487
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

401
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,573
Because I'm the monster

402
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:33,742
parents tell their children about
at night?

403
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,911
- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!

404
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,747
Why you favoured Thor all these years!

405
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,708
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

406
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,420
you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

407
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,775
Guards!

408
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,778
Guards, please, help!

409
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,369
How'd you get inside that cloud?

410
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,122
Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts

411
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,748
and still be this hungry?

412
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:29,923
- This drink, I like it.
- I know. It's great, right?

413
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,133
Another!

414
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,219
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

415
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:39,891
- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.

416
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:42,185
- Well, you could have just said so.
- I just did.

417
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,689
- No, I mean, ask nicely.
- I meant no disrespect.

418
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,132
All right. Well, no more smashing.

419
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,442
Deal?

420
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:51,903
You have my word.

421
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:54,197
Good.

422
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,451
The usual, please, Izzy.

423
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,078
You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.

424
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,582
They're saying some kind of satellite
landed out in the desert.

425
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,542
Yeah, we were having
a good time with it

426
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,335
until the Feds showed up.

427
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,255
Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?

428
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,381
Yeah.

429
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:13,884
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook.
Smile.

430
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,180
What did it look like, the satellite?

431
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:21,933
I don't know anything about satellites,
but it was heavy.

432
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:26,188
I mean, nobody could lift it.

433
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,940
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

434
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:30,692
Which way?

435
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:34,863
Fifty miles west of here.

436
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:36,907
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

437
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,990
Looked like the whole Army
was coming when we left.

438
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,165
Dumbass!

439
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,334
Where are you going?

440
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,753
- Fifty miles west of here.
- Why?

441
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:53,215
- To get what belongs to me.
- So you own a satellite now?

442
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,302
It's not what they say it is.

443
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,425
Well, whatever it is,

444
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:56,847
the government seems to think
it's theirs.

445
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:58,970
So, you just intend to go in there
and take it?

446
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,138
Yes.

447
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:02,808
If you take me there now,

448
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,571
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

449
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:06,144
- Everything?
- Yes.

450
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:09,022
All the answers you seek will be yours
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

451
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,149
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

452
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,193
Can I have a word, Jane?

453
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,740
Please don't do this.

454
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,909
You saw what I saw last night.

455
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,415
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.

456
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,459
But I'm not talking about the crater,
I'm talking about him.

457
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:28,250
- But he's promising us the answers.
- He's delusional.

458
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,379
Listen to what he's saying.

459
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:33,380
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

460
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,924
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

461
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,844
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

462
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,054
He's dangerous, Jane.

463
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:49,896
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

464
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,439
Then this is where we say goodbye.

465
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,577
Thank you?

466
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,079
Jane Foster,

467
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,747
Erik Selvig,

468
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,332
Darcy,

469
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,876
farewell.

470
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:15,839
All right.

471
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:18,091
Back to work.

472
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,113
That's my stuff!

473
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,119
What the hell is going on here?

474
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,204
Ms Foster,
I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

475
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:49,956
Is that supposed to mean something
to me?

476
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,333
- You can't do this!
- Jane!

477
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,544
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realise. Let it go.

478
00:45:54,628 --> 00:45:56,671
Let it go? This is my life.

479
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:59,007
We're investigating a security threat.

480
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,801
We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.

481
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:04,304
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

482
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,097
Here, this should
more than compensate you

483
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:07,182
for your trouble.

484
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:09,851
I can't just buy replacements
at Radio Shack,

485
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:11,645
I made most of this equipment myself!

486
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,066
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

487
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:16,274
And I'm sure I can sue you
for violating my constitutional rights!

488
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,860
I'm sorry, Ms Foster,
but we're the good guys.

489
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:21,029
So are we!

490
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,324
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

491
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,201
And everything I know
about this phenomenon

492
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,161
is either in this lab or in this book.

493
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,956
And you can't just take this away... Hey!

494
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,834
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...

495
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,089
Thank you for your cooperation.

496
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,775
Years of research,

497
00:46:58,858 --> 00:46:59,859
gone.

498
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,779
They even took my iPod.

499
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:05,532
- What about the backups?
- They took our backups.

500
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:09,285
They took the backups of our backups.
They were extremely thorough.

501
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:11,705
I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.

502
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:14,708
Could you please stop with your iPod?

503
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,419
Who are these people?

504
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,880
I knew this scientist.

505
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:23,925
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

506
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:26,136
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up

507
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:29,055
and he wasn't heard from again.

508
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,309
They're not gonna do that to us.
I'm gonna get everything back.

509
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:36,187
Come on, please.
Let me contact one of my colleagues.

510
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,773
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

511
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:41,484
I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.

512
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:43,987
They took your laptop, too.

513
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,665
Allfather,
we must speak with you urgently.

514
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,513
My friends.

515
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,515
Where's Odin?

516
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:15,685
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.

517
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:19,856
Mother fears
he may never awaken again.

518
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,566
We would speak with her.

519
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:24,944
She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.

520
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:29,949
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

521
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,708
Your king.

522
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:54,265
My King, we would ask
that you end Thor's banishment.

523
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:02,357
My first command
cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.

524
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,612
We're on the brink of war
with Jotunheim.

525
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,658
Our people need a sense of continuity,

526
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,536
in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.

527
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:17,539
All of us must stand together

528
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:20,041
for the good of Asgard.

529
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:24,087
Yes, of course.

530
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,382
- Good. Then you will wait for my word.
- If I may

531
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:33,555
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty
to perhaps reconsider...

532
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,889
We're done!

533
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:39,871
I need a horse!

534
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:45,293
We don't have horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds...

535
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,629
Then give me one of those
large enough to ride.

536
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,797
Hey, you still need a lift?

537
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,722
I've never done anything like this before.

538
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:02,477
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

539
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,062
Many times.

540
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,397
But you're brave to do it.

541
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:09,025
Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.

542
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,027
I don't really have much left to lose.

543
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,404
Yeah, but you're clever.

544
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,408
Far more clever than anyone else
in this realm.

545
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:20,036
"Realm"? "Realm"?

546
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,206
- You think me strange.
- Yeah, I do.

547
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,084
Good strange or bad strange?

548
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,253
I'm not quite sure yet.

549
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:34,926
I'm sorry.

550
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,182
But who are you?

551
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,769
Really?

552
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,731
You'll see soon enough.

553
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:51,192
You promised me answers.

554
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,739
What you seek, it's a bridge.

555
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,992
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

556
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:00,243
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

557
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,707
God, I hope you're not crazy.

558
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,886
I never get used to seeing him like this.

559
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:22,807
He's put it off for so long now,
that I fear...

560
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,061
How long will it last?

561
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:31,733
I don't know. This time it's different.
We were unprepared.

562
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,653
So Why did he lie?

563
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:40,742
He kept the truth from you
so that you would never feel different.

564
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:43,161
You are our son, Loki,

565
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,788
and we, your family.

566
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,669
We mustn't lose hope
that your father will return to us.

567
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,339
And your brother.

568
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:57,592
What hope is there for Thor?

569
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:01,429
There's always a purpose
to everything your father does.

570
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,797
That's no satellite crash!

571
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,135
They would have hauled
the wreckage away,

572
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:38,895
they wouldn't have built a city around it.

573
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:43,721
- You're going to need this.
- What? Wait, why?

574
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:48,393
Now stay here.

575
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:52,313
Once I have Mjolnir, I will return
the items they've stolen from you.

576
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:53,648
Deal?

577
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,317
No. Look what's down there.

578
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:59,278
You think you're just gonna walk in,
grab our stuff and walk out?

579
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:01,406
No. I'm going to fly out.

580
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,083
Sir, feed from the keyhole
can barely penetrate the cloud cover.

581
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,709
Tech's barely working as it is,

582
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:16,003
with all the interference
that thing's giving off.

583
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,840
And we've got a commercial aircraft
coming right over us.

584
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:22,009
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.

585
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,333
Reroute it like all the others.

586
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,096
Hold a sec.

587
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,516
We've got something outside the fence,
west side.

588
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:32,061
<i>Delancey, Jackson.
West side perimeter. Go check it out.</i>

589
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:35,898
There it is.

590
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:46,325
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

591
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,544
Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.

592
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:13,644
<i>You've reached Dr Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.</i>

593
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:17,648
Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, I'm fine,

594
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,359
but just in case
you don't hear from me in the next hour,

595
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:23,321
just come by the crater site
and try and find me, okay?

596
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:26,240
I did exactly what you told me not to.
I'm sorry.

597
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:27,992
So sorry. Bye.

598
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,122
Bravo quadrant, move!

599
00:55:46,636 --> 00:55:47,762
Entering south tunnel!

600
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,432
Negative, negative.
I have no comms.

601
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,323
Target sighted, east tunnel!

602
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,283
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

603
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,269
Moving north!

604
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:45,236
What have we got?

605
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,824
There's a massive
electromagnetic surge

606
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,030
coming off that thing.

607
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:49,907
Systems are barely coping.

608
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,826
Barton? Talk to me.

609
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,829
You want me to slow him down, sir?

610
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,291
Or are you sending in more guys
for him to beat up?

611
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,001
I'll let you know.

612
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,183
You're big.

613
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,644
Fought bigger.

614
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:06,984
Better call it, Coulson,
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

615
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:28,673
Last chance, sir.

616
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,841
<i>Wait. I want to see this.</i>

617
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:42,872
All right, show's over.
Ground units, move in.

618
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,551
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

619
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:39,804
- I can't just leave him there!
- Why?

620
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,056
You didn't see what I saw!

621
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,391
Look! Look, it's Myeu-muh.

622
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,231
Where'd you find this?

623
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:51,649
The children's section.

624
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,151
I just wanted to show you
how silly his story was.

625
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:56,153
But you're the one
Who's always pushing me

626
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:58,364
to chase down every possibility,
every alternative!

627
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,699
I'm talking about science, not magic!

628
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,038
Well, magic's just science
that we don't understand yet.

629
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,746
- Arthur C. Clarke.
- Who wrote science fiction.

630
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,332
- A precursor to science fact!
- In some cases, yeah.

631
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,087
Well, if there is
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

632
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,547
then there's something
on the other side.

633
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:13,337
And advanced beings
could have crossed it!

634
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:14,505
Jane.

635
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:17,595
A primitive culture like the Vikings
might have worshipped them as deities.

636
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:19,426
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

637
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,352
You made my men,

638
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,896
some of the most
highly trained professionals in the world,

639
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,774
look like a bunch of minimum-wage
mall cops.

640
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,819
That's hurtful.

641
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:41,365
In my experience, it takes someone
who's received similar training

642
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:42,904
to do what you did to them.

643
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:47,037
Why don't you tell me
where you received your training?

644
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:51,000
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?

645
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,504
No, you strike me
more as the soldier of fortune type.

646
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,174
Where was it? South Africa?

647
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:04,597
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

648
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,350
Who are you?

649
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:15,733
One way or another,
we find out what we need to know.

650
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,401
We're good at that.

651
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:24,491
Don't go anywhere.

652
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:33,459
Loki! What are you doing here?

653
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,294
I had to see you.

654
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,297
What's happened?

655
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:40,633
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

656
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,384
Let me explain to Father.

657
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:43,802
Father is dead.

658
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,310
What?

659
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:54,813
Your banishment,

660
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,983
the threat of a new war,

661
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:00,819
it was too much for him to bear.

662
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:05,658
You mustn't blame yourself.

663
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:07,993
I know that you loved him.

664
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:11,664
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

665
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,168
It was so cruel
to put the hammer within your reach,

666
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,212
knowing that you could never lift it.

667
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,801
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

668
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,059
Can I come home?

669
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:35,980
The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.

670
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:42,444
- Yes, but couldn't we find a way...
- And Mother has forbidden your return.

671
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:47,408
This is goodbye, Brother.

672
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:51,745
I'm so sorry.

673
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,502
No.

674
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:01,672
I am sorry.

675
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:09,346
Thank you for coming here.

676
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,185
Farewell.

677
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:29,533
Good bye.

678
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,535
Good bye?

679
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,454
I just got back.

680
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,407
Sir?

681
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:12,659
He's got a visitor.

682
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:19,833
His name is Donald Blake?

683
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,752
Dr Donald Blake.

684
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,712
You have dangerous coworkers,
Dr Selvig.

685
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:27,841
He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all our research.

686
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,928
That was years of his life, gone!

687
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,182
You can understand
how a man could go off like that.

688
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,726
A big, faceless organisation like yours

689
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,728
coming in with their
jackbooted thugs and...

690
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:43,357
That's how he put it.

691
01:05:43,524 --> 01:05:44,566
That still doesn't explain

692
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,370
how he managed
to tear through our security.

693
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,947
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.

694
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,783
Sir?

695
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,789
It says here that he's an MD.

696
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,333
Well, he is! Or he was.

697
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,961
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

698
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,963
A brilliant physicist.

699
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:08,257
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

700
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:13,554
Donny, Donny, Donny!

701
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:18,058
There you are. You're gonna be all right.
I'm taking you home now.

702
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,991
Dr Selvig!

703
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,494
Just keep him away from the bars.

704
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:39,329
I will!

705
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:44,001
- Where are we going?
- To get a drink.

706
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,669
Follow them.

707
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,261
You know, I had it all backwards.

708
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,848
I had it all wrong.

709
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:04,938
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

710
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,191
You start asking the right questions.

711
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:15,365
For the first time in my life,

712
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:20,078
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

713
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,082
Anyone who's ever going to
find his way in this world

714
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:27,294
has to start by admitting
he doesn't know where the hell he is.

715
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:30,797
Thank you for what you've done.

716
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,300
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.

717
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:37,554
Her father and I
taught at university together.

718
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:39,473
He was a good man.

719
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:41,558
He never listened.

720
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:44,478
Neither did I.

721
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,814
My father
was trying to teach me something,

722
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,816
but I was too stupid to see it.

723
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:54,947
I don't know if you're delusional
or if you're pulling some kind of con,

724
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:56,365
I don't care.

725
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:57,783
I just care about her.

726
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,578
I've seen the way she looks at you.

727
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:07,501
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

728
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:08,752
Good.

729
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:13,423
In that case, I'll buy you another round,
and you leave town tonight.

730
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:20,430
Two boilermakers.

731
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:13,608
Kill him.

732
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,195
After all I've done for you?

733
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:24,202
So you're the one
who showed us the way into Asgard.

734
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:26,705
That was just a bit of fun, really.

735
01:09:27,873 --> 01:09:30,876
To ruin my brother's big day.

736
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:35,547
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

737
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,176
I will hear you.

738
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:47,059
I will conceal you
and a handful of your soldiers,

739
01:09:47,726 --> 01:09:52,731
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

740
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:54,858
Why not kill him yourself?

741
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,613
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly

742
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,948
to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

743
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:06,203
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you

744
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:11,291
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

745
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:15,504
Glory.

746
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:18,131
I...

747
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,468
Accept.

748
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:28,892
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

749
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:34,147
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

750
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:36,066
You were shrouded from me,

751
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,318
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

752
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:41,988
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

753
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:43,740
Or perhaps someone has found a way

754
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:46,910
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

755
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,247
You have great power, Heimdall.

756
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,251
Did Odin ever fear you?

757
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:58,171
- No.
- And why is that?

758
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:01,508
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

759
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:06,012
He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.

760
01:11:06,847 --> 01:11:07,931
Yes?

761
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:14,771
Yes.

762
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,191
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

763
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:21,111
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

764
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:37,878
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

765
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,213
He's fine. Not injured at all.

766
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:42,632
I'm sorry, my friend.

767
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,551
- What happened?
- We drank, we fought,

768
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,136
he made his ancestors proud.

769
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:48,430
Put him on the bed.

770
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:03,236
I still don't think
you're the God of Thunder.

771
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:06,072
But you ought to be.

772
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:18,668
Are these your chambers?

773
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,756
It's more of a temporary living situation.

774
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:27,427
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

775
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,931
Actually, I never have guests.

776
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,268
That's not the right place for it.

777
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,938
I'm sorry.

778
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,067
Can we go outside?

779
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,361
Yes, of course.

780
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,160
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

781
01:12:52,244 --> 01:12:56,373
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

782
01:12:57,624 --> 01:13:00,961
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

783
01:13:04,965 --> 01:13:06,883
I'm really glad you're safe.

784
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:10,470
You've been very kind to me,

785
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,390
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

786
01:13:13,557 --> 01:13:15,267
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

787
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:17,394
so I think that kind of evens things out.

788
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:21,648
Perhaps I had it coming.

789
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:28,822
Oh, my God!

790
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:31,408
I don't believe it!

791
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:35,078
It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

792
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:39,833
No, no, this is great! This is...
I don't have to start from scratch now.

793
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,501
Thank you.

794
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,591
What's wrong?

795
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:50,010
S.H.I.E.L.D.

796
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,428
Whatever they are,

797
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,559
they're gonna do
everything in their power

798
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:57,350
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

799
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:58,852
No, Jane.

800
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,354
Listen to me. You must not give up.

801
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:03,607
- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

802
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:05,442
Because you're right.

803
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,277
Here, look.

804
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:13,366
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

805
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,703
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

806
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,886
What is that?

807
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:37,015
My father explained it to me like this,

808
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,850
that your world

809
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,770
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,

810
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:44,856
linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,

811
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,150
the Worlds Tree.

812
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,070
Now you see it every day
Without realising.

813
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,406
The images glimpsed through...
What did you call it?

814
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:55,659
This Hooble Telescope.

815
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:59,079
- Hubble.
- Hubble Telescope.

816
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,500
Tell me more.

817
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,585
So, the Nine Realms.

818
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,755
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

819
01:15:09,089 --> 01:15:10,590
This is Alfheim.

820
01:15:10,924 --> 01:15:13,593
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.

821
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,762
And Asgard.

822
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:18,181
<i>And that's where I come from.</i>

823
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:36,950
Thank you, Jane.

824
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:43,331
Our dearest friend banished,
Loki on the throne,

825
01:15:43,415 --> 01:15:46,793
Asgard on the brink of war,
yet you've managed to consume

826
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,046
four wild boar,
six pheasant, a side of beef,

827
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:53,591
and two casks of ale. Shame on you.
Don't you care?

828
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:56,469
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

829
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,555
Stop it, both of you!

830
01:15:58,888 --> 01:15:59,889
Stop.

831
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,643
- We all know what we have to do.
- We must go.

832
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:08,565
We must find Thor.

833
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:10,734
It's treason.

834
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:12,736
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

835
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:14,988
Thor would do the same for us.

836
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,407
Now shush.

837
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:21,244
Heimdall might be watching.

838
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:28,918
Heimdall demands your presence.

839
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:34,758
We're doomed.

840
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:38,511
You would defy the commands of Loki,
our king,

841
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:41,598
break every oath you
have taken as warriors,

842
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:44,017
and commit treason to bring Thor back?

843
01:16:44,184 --> 01:16:45,685
- Yes.
- Good.

844
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,353
So you'll help us?

845
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,317
I am bound by honour to our king.
I cannot open the bridge to you.

846
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:54,694
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

847
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,613
Now what do we do?

848
01:16:58,031 --> 01:16:59,282
Look!

849
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,014
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, sir.

850
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,391
We got massive energy readings
out of nowhere

851
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:23,973
and then they just disappeared.
Fifteen miles due northwest.

852
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:25,391
Let's go take a look.

853
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:51,626
Thank you.

854
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,711
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

855
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:03,680
<i>Base to Team 2,
we've got activity outside the town.</i>

856
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:04,889
<i>Stay on your target.</i>

857
01:18:14,232 --> 01:18:16,734
Ensure my brother does not return.

858
01:18:20,572 --> 01:18:22,240
Destroy everything.

859
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:34,419
Mom?

860
01:18:42,302 --> 01:18:44,304
Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?

861
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:45,722
Call it in.

862
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:47,390
Yeah.

863
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:52,896
Base, we've got Xena, Jackie Chan
and Robin Hood.

864
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,732
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

865
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:59,736
But you won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.

866
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,154
Not without hard evidence.

867
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,072
Found you!

868
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,080
My friends!

869
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,584
This is good! This is good.

870
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,169
I don't believe it.

871
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:19,297
Excuse me.
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

872
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:23,593
My friends,

873
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:26,179
I've never been happier to see anyone.

874
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,056
But you should not have come.

875
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:31,351
We're here to take you home.

876
01:19:32,894 --> 01:19:34,520
You know I can't go home.

877
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,441
My father

878
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:40,610
is dead because of me.

879
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:43,821
And I must remain in exile.

880
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:45,114
Thor,

881
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,158
your father still lives.

882
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,510
Tell me, Loki,
how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?

883
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:09,222
You think the Bifrost is the only way
in and out of this realm?

884
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,852
There are secret paths
between the worlds

885
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:13,643
to which even you, with all your gifts,
are blind.

886
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,896
But I have need of them no longer,
now that I am king.

887
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,648
And I say, for your act of treason,

888
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:21,651
you are relieved of your duties
as Gatekeeper,

889
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:23,528
and no longer citizen of Asgard.

890
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:26,614
Then I need no longer obey you.

891
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:50,013
Get somebody from Linguistics
down here.

892
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,000
Was somebody else coming?

893
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:24,297
Is that one of Stark's?

894
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,967
I don't know.
The guy never tells me anything.

895
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:32,930
<i>Hello.</i>

896
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:35,725
<i>You are using
unregistered weapons technology.</i>

897
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:36,976
<i>Identify yourself.</i>

898
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:41,731
Here we go.

899
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,486
Incoming!

900
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:55,536
Jane, you have to leave.

901
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,663
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm staying here.

902
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:59,582
Thor's going to fight with us!

903
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,250
My friends,

904
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:05,671
I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way,
or worse, get one of you killed.

905
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:07,840
But I can help
get these people to safety.

906
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:10,176
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

907
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,762
- We'll need some time.
- You'll have it!

908
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,889
Okay, move it, people!

909
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:17,934
Everybody out! Use the back door.

910
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:19,936
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

911
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,534
Keep it distracted.

912
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,634
For Asgard!

913
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:28,004
Fall back!

914
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:45,730
Go. Now. Run!

915
01:24:14,008 --> 01:24:16,510
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

916
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:19,096
No. I will die a warrior's death.

917
01:24:19,347 --> 01:24:21,307
Stories will be told of this day.

918
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:24,310
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

919
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,439
Now go.

920
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:38,866
You must return to Asgard.
You have to stop Loki.

921
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,534
What about you?

922
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:43,120
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.

923
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:45,039
Come on.

924
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:51,420
We need to fall back. Come on.

925
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:52,505
Come on.

926
01:25:00,388 --> 01:25:01,555
Wait!

927
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,648
What's he doing?

928
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:41,178
Brother,
whatever I have done to wrong you,

929
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:44,515
whatever I have done
to lead you to do this,

930
01:25:44,849 --> 01:25:46,684
I am truly sorry.

931
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:49,895
<i>But these people are innocent.</i>

932
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:54,358
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.

933
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:03,367
So take mine

934
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:05,411
and end this.

935
01:26:19,467 --> 01:26:20,468
No.

936
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:37,902
It's over.

937
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,571
No. It's not over.

938
01:26:41,155 --> 01:26:43,115
I mean, you're safe.

939
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:45,201
We're safe.

940
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:46,911
It's over.

941
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:54,168
No.

942
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,646
No.

943
01:27:39,505 --> 01:27:41,674
- We're spiking.
- Levels increase!

944
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:43,634
Whosoever holds this hammer,

945
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,179
if he be worthy,

946
01:27:50,558 --> 01:27:52,351
shall possess the power of Thor.

947
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:09,243
Jane!

948
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,790
- No.No.No!
- Come!

949
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:39,231
Oh. My. God.

950
01:29:48,676 --> 01:29:50,052
So, is this how you normally look?

951
01:29:50,928 --> 01:29:51,929
More or less.

952
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,515
It's a good look.

953
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:58,102
We must go to the Bifrost site.
I would have words with my brother.

954
01:29:58,185 --> 01:29:59,270
Excuse me!

955
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:04,525
Donald?

956
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,072
I don't think
you've been completely honest with me.

957
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,362
<i>Know this, Son of Coul.</i>

958
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:11,615
You and I, we fight for the same cause,
the protection of this world.

959
01:30:11,699 --> 01:30:13,742
From this day forward,
you can count me as your ally

960
01:30:13,826 --> 01:30:16,829
if you return the items
you have taken from Jane.

961
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,581
- Stolen.
- Borrowed.

962
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:21,584
Of course,
you can have your equipment back.

963
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:23,836
You're gonna need it
to continue your research.

964
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,922
Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?

965
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,216
Sure.

966
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:32,886
Wait, I need to debrief you!

967
01:30:40,102 --> 01:30:41,312
Welcome to Asgard.

968
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,131
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

969
01:31:16,847 --> 01:31:18,140
Heimdall?

970
01:31:22,353 --> 01:31:23,687
<i>Heimdall!</i>

971
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,232
He doesn't answer.

972
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:29,485
Then we are stranded.

973
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:32,488
Heimdall!
If you can hear me, we need you now!

974
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:36,158
<i>Heimdall! We need you now!</i>

975
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:43,874
Heimdall!

976
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:01,558
I must go back to Asgard,
but I give you my word,

977
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:05,104
I will return for you.

978
01:32:12,695 --> 01:32:13,904
Deal?

979
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,794
Deal.

980
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,312
Get him to the healing room!

981
01:32:48,731 --> 01:32:50,315
Leave my brother to me.

982
01:33:15,174 --> 01:33:16,675
It's said

983
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:21,680
you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.

984
01:33:23,015 --> 01:33:25,184
I hope it's true,

985
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:29,188
so that you may know

986
01:33:30,189 --> 01:33:34,151
your death came at the hand

987
01:33:35,027 --> 01:33:36,361
of Laufey.

988
01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:47,998
And your death came
by the son of Odin.

989
01:33:53,879 --> 01:33:55,255
Loki!

990
01:33:55,339 --> 01:33:56,840
You saved him!

991
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:03,597
I swear to you, Mother,

992
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,141
that they will pay for what
they've done today.

993
01:34:06,517 --> 01:34:07,559
Loki.

994
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:09,394
Thor!

995
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,314
I knew you'd return to us.

996
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:19,363
Why don't you tell her

997
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:23,075
how you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?

998
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,159
What?

999
01:34:24,243 --> 01:34:26,662
Why, it must have been enforcing
Father's last command.

1000
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:29,623
You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been.

1001
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:31,500
It's good to have you back.

1002
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:35,504
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

1003
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:18,422
You can't stop it.

1004
01:35:18,505 --> 01:35:21,842
The Bifrost will build until
it rips Jotunheim apart.

1005
01:35:43,697 --> 01:35:44,865
Jane?

1006
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:48,327
Why have you done this?

1007
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:52,331
To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

1008
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:55,250
When he wakes,
I will have saved his life.

1009
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:58,045
I will have destroyed that
race of monsters.

1010
01:35:58,128 --> 01:36:00,255
And I will be true heir to the throne!

1011
01:36:00,631 --> 01:36:02,633
You can't kill an entire race!

1012
01:36:02,716 --> 01:36:04,051
Why not?

1013
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:10,098
And what is this newfound love
for the Frost Giants?

1014
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:14,519
You could have killed them all
with your bare hands.

1015
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:16,688
- I've changed.
- So have I.

1016
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,942
Now fight me.

1017
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:24,780
I never wanted the throne!

1018
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,950
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1019
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:30,786
I will not fight you, Brother!

1020
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:32,287
I'm not your brother.

1021
01:36:33,038 --> 01:36:34,331
I never was.

1022
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:35,916
Loki, this is madness.

1023
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,126
Is it madness?

1024
01:36:38,961 --> 01:36:40,128
Is it?

1025
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:42,798
Is it?

1026
01:36:43,882 --> 01:36:47,886
Come on. What happened to you
on Earth that turned you so soft?

1027
01:36:48,679 --> 01:36:51,390
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1028
01:36:53,392 --> 01:36:54,601
It was!

1029
01:36:54,685 --> 01:36:58,814
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,
I'll pay her a visit myself!

1030
01:37:41,148 --> 01:37:43,066
Thor!

1031
01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:51,324
Brother, please.

1032
01:38:02,836 --> 01:38:04,004
Enough!

1033
01:38:47,798 --> 01:38:48,965
Look at you,

1034
01:38:51,635 --> 01:38:52,969
the Mighty Thor,

1035
01:38:56,056 --> 01:38:58,225
with all your strength,

1036
01:38:58,892 --> 01:39:01,561
and what good does it do you now?

1037
01:39:02,896 --> 01:39:06,691
Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!

1038
01:39:24,668 --> 01:39:25,961
What are you doing?

1039
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:31,049
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

1040
01:39:40,684 --> 01:39:42,352
Forgive me, Jane.

1041
01:40:20,849 --> 01:40:22,851
I could have done it, Father!

1042
01:40:23,852 --> 01:40:25,687
I could have done it!

1043
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:27,439
For you!

1044
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:29,649
For all of us!

1045
01:40:31,818 --> 01:40:33,153
No, Loki.

1046
01:40:41,912 --> 01:40:42,913
Loki, no.

1047
01:40:44,164 --> 01:40:46,333
No!

1048
01:40:50,587 --> 01:40:51,755
No.

1049
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:09,439
It's gone.

1050
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:24,806
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1051
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:29,144
I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!

1052
01:42:29,311 --> 01:42:32,897
Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?

1053
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:38,987
As a matter of fact, falling was a tactic
lulling the Destroyer...

1054
01:42:53,168 --> 01:42:56,004
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1055
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:03,178
<i>How is he?</i>

1056
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,515
<i>He mourns for his brother.</i>

1057
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,018
<i>And...</i>

1058
01:43:11,186 --> 01:43:12,771
<i>He misses her.</i>

1059
01:43:13,772 --> 01:43:15,106
<i>The mortal.</i>

1060
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:33,291
You'll be a wise king.

1061
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:40,131
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

1062
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,218
Or a better father.

1063
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:57,273
I have much to learn.

1064
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:00,777
I know that now.

1065
01:44:05,782 --> 01:44:07,742
Someday, perhaps,

1066
01:44:09,035 --> 01:44:10,954
I shall make you proud.

1067
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:20,797
You've already made me proud.

1068
01:44:35,353 --> 01:44:37,355
So Earth is lost to us.

1069
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:39,691
No.

1070
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:42,694
There is always hope.

1071
01:44:46,698 --> 01:44:48,199
Can you see her?

1072
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:52,454
<i>Yes.</i>

1073
01:44:56,124 --> 01:44:58,042
I have the particle detectors!

1074
01:44:58,126 --> 01:45:00,211
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

1075
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:02,380
Yeah. Have you seen my taser?

1076
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,882
<i>How is she?</i>

1077
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:06,050
In the car. Come on, Jane!

1078
01:45:06,384 --> 01:45:08,470
<i>She searches for you.</i>

1079
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:19,961
Dr Selvig.

1080
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:24,966
So you're the man behind all this?

1081
01:53:27,134 --> 01:53:29,136
It's quite a labyrinth.

1082
01:53:29,887 --> 01:53:33,808
I was thinking
they're taking me down here to kill me.

1083
01:53:40,982 --> 01:53:43,985
I've been hearing
about the New Mexico situation.

1084
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:48,489
Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.

1085
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:50,574
I have a lot to work with.

1086
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:54,453
The Foster Theory.
A gateway to another dimension.

1087
01:53:55,121 --> 01:53:56,122
It's unprecedented.

1088
01:53:58,833 --> 01:54:00,084
Isn't it?

1089
01:54:03,504 --> 01:54:06,841
Legend tells us one thing,
history, another.

1090
01:54:07,174 --> 01:54:11,387
But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.

1091
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:20,187
What is it?

1092
01:54:20,271 --> 01:54:21,397
Power, Doctor.

1093
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:23,941
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1094
01:54:24,358 --> 01:54:25,860
maybe unlimited power.

1095
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:33,868
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1096
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:37,872
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
