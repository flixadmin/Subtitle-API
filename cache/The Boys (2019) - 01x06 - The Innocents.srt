I love it.

11
00:00:47,894 --> 00:00:48,979
If we're airing on TLC

12
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,897
between My 600-lb Life

13
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,399
and Little People, Big World.

14
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:53,567
But we're not.

15
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:56,236
'Cause we're not
cheap reality garbage.

16
00:00:56,278 --> 00:00:58,697
Sorry, Courtenay,
I thought, um...

17
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,967
I-I was trying to go for
something a bit more personable,

18
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:03,285
- down-to-earth.
- Not this down-to-earth.

19
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:05,304
I need them to look like
someone you'd want in the Army.

20
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:08,290
We here are not
fucking Heidi and Spencer.

21
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:11,709
We are The Seven, James.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,212
And why isn't there anything
on Starlight?

23
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:16,840
She actually hasn't really made
herself available to the crew.

24
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:18,884
Where the hell is she?

25
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:21,386
Has a heavenly body
lost her luster?

26
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,555
Two weeks after
Starlight's shocking appearance

27
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:25,015
at the Believe Expo...

28
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:26,600
Social media is still buzzing

29
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,435
about her controversial speech.

30
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:29,978
Was it a breakdown

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,730
- or a triumph?
- Of course,

32
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,565
my thoughts are with Starlight,

33
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:36,651
and, uh,
I support her in every way.

34
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:38,153
What I want to know,
who's that dude

35
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:39,905
that stuck his in her face?

36
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,199
She should that er in the hole.

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,951
O-kay.

38
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:48,288
Of everything that I said,
that's what they focus on.

39
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,290
Hey. Eye of the tiger.

40
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:53,168
You and me, we have
a Panera gift card to win.

41
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,004
- No distractions. Come on.
- Ah, good one here.

42
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,506
Before joining The Seven,

43
00:01:57,547 --> 00:02:00,050
which hero led
a search-and-rescue team...

44
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:02,177
- Mm...
- Oh, my God. -...After the 1994.

45
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,845
Northridge earthquake?

46
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:05,055
Isn't it your job

47
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:06,431
to know this kind of stuff?

48
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:07,641
Eh...

49
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:09,768
- It's Lamplighter.
- Thank you.

50
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,953
Yeah, I had
all the trading cards.

51
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:11,977
Of course you did.

52
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:14,814
Hughie?

53
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,652
- Hey.
- Where the hell have you been?

54
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:19,736
After Gary's store,

55
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:21,822
we all thought that...

56
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:23,615
Oh. H-Hi.

57
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:25,158
Uh, Anthony.

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,869
Hughie's best-looking friend
since fourth grade.

59
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:28,995
Hi, I'm Annie.

60
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:30,205
It's nice to meet you.

61
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:32,374
You look familiar.

62
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:33,959
- Did you go to Kennedy?
- She's, uh,

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,002
- new in town.
- Mm-hmm. -Fantastic.

64
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:38,630
So, what are we drinking,
New-to-Town Annie?

65
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:40,132
Mmm.

66
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:42,843
So, uh, Gretchen Scaramucci...

67
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:44,553
- No, no.
- She was bigger

68
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,555
than all the guys. Like,

69
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:48,236
André the Giant-big.
So when Gretchen says

70
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:52,394
she wants to beat
the living fuck out of this guy

71
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:54,771
for making a crack
about her girlfriend...

72
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:56,481
- Oh, you didn't.
- Hughie gives her

73
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:59,526
this Clint Eastwood stare,
like...

74
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:01,403
And then, bam, runs,

75
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:03,989
like Forrest Gump-runs,

76
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,324
five blocks down
into a pet store

77
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,827
where he hides behind
this jumbo bag

78
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:12,247
of Kibbles 'n Bits
for four hours.

79
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:13,582
Oh...

80
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:14,958
I'll be right back.

81
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,086
I know it! I know this!

82
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,773
Surprised to run
into you here, man.

83
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:21,965
Yeah. Same goes for you.

84
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:24,259
I've been worried, asshole.

85
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:26,261
Ever since Robin, you...

86
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:28,513
you weren't answering
your phone.

87
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:31,349
Like, for all I knew,
you were chugging Drano.

88
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:33,852
I'm sorry, man.

89
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,270
Yeah, you should be.

90
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:37,439
No, really,
I-I should've called.

91
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,024
You think?

92
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:40,609
I'm okay.

93
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,861
Really. I-I just...

94
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,779
n-needed a fresh start.

95
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:47,324
Fresh start?

96
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:54,039
Your fresh start
is way out of your league.

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,624
Um, you know that, right?

98
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:57,042
I am aware, yes.

99
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,295
Annie's great, man.

100
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:01,713
Live your life.

101
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:03,423
That's what Robin would want.

102
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:12,557
Sync mark.

103
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,892
We're good.

104
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,728
- You rolling?
- And... action.

105
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,564
My grandfather built this place
with his bare hands.

106
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,608
He was, uh, an amazing man.

107
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,944
Oh, the old piano.

108
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:25,171
Every night, Mom would sit here

109
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:27,405
and she would play some songs
and...

110
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,075
I got to be honest, most of the
time, me and my dad would be...

111
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:31,368
We'd be making model planes.

112
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:35,163
I can almost smell
the... silver paint.

113
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:39,084
I really wish
he'd lived long enough

114
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,586
to see me fly
with the Blue Angels.

115
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,546
That would have blown his mind.

116
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:44,965
That's me in the middle.

117
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,219
Love you, Mom, Dad.

118
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,805
Welcome to my bedroom.

119
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:53,765
The Baseball Hall of Fame,
you might call it.

120
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,141
Hasn't changed a bit.

121
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:57,060
Oh, there they are, the Tigers.

122
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:58,436
It's my little team.

123
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:00,272
I played shortstop. Of course,

124
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:01,856
I couldn't show
everything I had.

125
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:04,526
But... let's just say we, uh...

126
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,861
We-we did a lot of winning.

127
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:10,115
This is just, um...

128
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,952
Really just, uh...

129
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:16,037
It's so special to come back.

130
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,331
Hmm.

131
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:21,209
Uh, I'm sorry,

132
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,544
why is that there?

133
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:23,962
Sorry?

134
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,547
Who put the fucking blanket
on the bed?

135
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:27,215
Uh, R-Randy Set-Dec, I think.

136
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:28,300
Who's Randy Set-Dec?

137
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:29,551
He's-he's over there.

138
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:30,802
Randy, why?

139
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:32,220
You fucking asshole.

140
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:34,389
- Uh...
- Amateur fuck.

141
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:36,057
What just happened?

142
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:43,356
Samaritan's Embrace,

143
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:46,776
led by Ezekiel
but bankrolled by Vought,

144
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:48,611
has been shipping Compound V

145
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,864
to 53 hospitals
across the country

146
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:54,617
since 1971
and gift wrapping it...

147
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,748
gift wrapping it

148
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,499
- as polio vaccine.
- Are you telling me.

149
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,668
God's not reaching up the twats
of American girls

150
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,961
and blessing babies?

151
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:06,588
Butcher, can you leave God out
of this?

152
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:10,008
H-Hold on, hold on.
So, no hero was born?

153
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,636
None of them? They're all just
kids dosed with the blue shit.

154
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:14,846
I mean, even...

155
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,097
Even fucking Starlight.

156
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:23,605
Do you think...
Do you think they know...

157
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:25,774
what really happened to 'em?

158
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:28,193
What about Homelander?

159
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:29,444
Homelander's a black hole.

160
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:31,529
Never had any public records
and never will.

161
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:33,406
However,
every single other Supe...

162
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:35,116
Juiced-up lab rats.

163
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:36,409
My God.

164
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:37,619
I'm trying to give

165
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,206
a tremendous fucking TED Talk
here, and this...

166
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:42,832
Frenchie,
can you control her, please?

167
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,834
I do not control her.

168
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:47,837
Do you see
what I'm dealing with?

169
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,422
Well, spot on, M.M.

170
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:52,634
We got Vought for child
endangerment, drug trafficking,

171
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:56,638
and possibly the largest fraud
in American fucking history.

172
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,973
Raynor's gonna love it.

173
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:00,642
You better hope she does...

174
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,356
Uh, hi.

175
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,529
Hughie, no!

176
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,114
No, no, no.

177
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:16,324
Not if you're attached
to that hand, no.

178
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,577
It's okay. Yeah.

179
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:23,331
Well, you know,
all of this, uh, it's...

180
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:26,167
But it's only part
of the story, no?

181
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,671
I mean, what about
our petite Lazarus here?

182
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:31,005
She's not an infant.

183
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,259
And she was injected
in a basement, not a hospital.

184
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,262
And there is the small matter
of that she rose from the dead.

185
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,597
Well, your feral pixie dream
girl ain't exactly dictating

186
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,558
her fucking memoirs,
is she, Frenchie?

187
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,768
I'm feeling
she's trying to communicate.

188
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,521
I mean,
she's been doing this for...

189
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:48,314
Maybe that means something, huh?

190
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,583
Yeah, maybe they're
just fucking chicken scratches.

191
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:50,483
Let's find out.

192
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:51,609
Nah, you've been burned.

193
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,111
It's not safe out there for you.

194
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:55,447
M.M.'s right. You got
to fucking stay put, son.

195
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:58,741
Fantastique.

196
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:00,785
- All right, I'm off.
- Okay.

197
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:04,622
I'll just, uh,
keep on Starlight then, right?

198
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,418
Her phone's been tits-up
for a week.

199
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,921
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

200
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:14,257
No.

201
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:16,926
But I can, uh... I can check.

202
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:22,682
All right.

203
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:23,892
You're with me.

204
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,394
- He is?
- I am?

205
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:27,937
What, to the CIA lady?

206
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,274
No. We're gonna go
on a little detour.

207
00:08:31,316 --> 00:08:33,526
You'll love it.

208
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:35,403
Come on.

209
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,656
No, I have been working
with her!

210
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:41,284
I've been fucking working
with her! I can't believe this.

211
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:43,286
Who the fuck are you gonna get
to replace me?

212
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:46,748
I'd like to see
what bitch that is!

213
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,166
You okay?

214
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:56,007
You know that pledge
you mentor during rush week

215
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:58,426
because she seems sweet
and a little naive

216
00:08:58,468 --> 00:09:00,112
and she doesn't know
she's not supposed to wear UGGs?

217
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:02,639
And then, once she's active,

218
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,098
she stabs you in the back,

219
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,351
gets you kicked out
of the house?

220
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:09,788
- I'm sorry. I don't...
- It was

221
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:12,565
my big idea to book you
for the Believe Expo.

222
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:15,235
What could go wrong, I thought.

223
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:18,446
You were playing to your base.

224
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:20,591
At least I don't have to kiss

225
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:22,992
your ass anymore.

226
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:30,333
Come in.

227
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,001
Thank you for coming, Starlight.

228
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,796
You fired Ashley?

229
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:36,798
It was actually
a mutual decision.

230
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,467
She wanted to explore
different career paths,

231
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,469
and, um, we wished her well.

232
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,888
So, I would like you
to take this

233
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,016
in the constructive spirit
that it is intended.

234
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:48,977
Okay.

235
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:53,022
You are a selfish,
arrogant child.

236
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:54,440
Wow.

237
00:09:54,482 --> 00:09:56,109
Back in Iowa,

238
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,695
I bet you watched a lot
of Queen Maeve's movies, right?

239
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:01,114
I did.

240
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,699
She was a rebel.

241
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,117
Didn't take anyone's shit,

242
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:05,535
didn't play by the rules.

243
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:06,869
That's what you wanted to be.

244
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:08,997
That's what American heroes are.

245
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,748
But it's a myth.

246
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,294
I should know,
because I wrote it.

247
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:16,629
The truth is,

248
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:18,798
dozens of people in this company

249
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,800
spent hundreds of hours

250
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,928
to create the thing that is you.

251
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,222
I never asked for that.

252
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:29,642
Then why don't you burn
the sparkly outfit

253
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:31,603
and become a cop?

254
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:35,398
You want to be a superhero.

255
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,442
You want to be famous.

256
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:40,820
But nobody's famous alone.

257
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:45,658
So, why don't you cut
the petulant diva shit,

258
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,660
show a little fucking gratitude,

259
00:10:47,702 --> 00:10:49,537
and let us do our job?

260
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,003
No.

261
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,340
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:02,675
I mean,
I don't mean to be ungrateful.

263
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:05,928
But... no red carpets,

264
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,847
no reality TV,

265
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,683
and no Noxzema commercials.

266
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:14,103
And I want my old uniform back.

267
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:16,105
I'm gonna save people.

268
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:18,900
Then I think
we may need to reconsider

269
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,319
your position in The Seven.

270
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,448
And I think
that firing an employee

271
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,701
after she reported
sexual assault on live TV

272
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,578
might tank your stock price.

273
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,708
Well, I hope
we can count on your discretion.

274
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,711
I'm sorry,
I don't do discretion anymore.

275
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:42,048
If anyone asks me who did it,
I'm gonna answer honestly.

276
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,134
Well, I think it's great
that you want to tell the truth.

277
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,637
I just don't know
to whom you're referring.

278
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,056
Oh, I think you know.

279
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:53,851
I think you've known
for a long time.

280
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:58,981
Thank you so much for coming,
Starlight.

281
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:00,817
I have a lot to think about.

282
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:17,834
Okay.

283
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,169
I mean, you take
Tek-Knight's Knightracer?

284
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:22,422
Had a carbon footprint
the size of a 727.

285
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:24,549
The thing literally shot fire.

286
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,759
Thanks to me,
now he drives a hybrid.

287
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:28,970
That's what the Green Crusader
initiative is all about.

288
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:33,099
To respect what's, what's
beautiful in the world.

289
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,311
- What's up?
- Hi.

290
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:43,359
So... everything.

291
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:45,153
So beautiful.

292
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:46,654
Good. Let's reset.

293
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:48,364
Trash back on the beach, please.

294
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:50,366
Background, put the trash back
on the beach.

295
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:51,993
All right.

296
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:55,037
Um, well, we lost my dad
at a young age,

297
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,748
and my mom, she worked two jobs,

298
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:59,083
so, it was, uh, my older brother
Nathan who,

299
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,210
who pretty much raised me up.

300
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:03,313
And when I was three, it's like
these guys started shooting

301
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:05,006
in front of my building

302
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,841
and I outran the damn bullet.

303
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,426
That's kinda how
I figured out...

304
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:09,778
Can I, can I stop you
right there for a second?

305
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:12,889
What if we ixnay
the gun violence?

306
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,266
Maybe make it
a click more upbeat?

307
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:18,394
Yeah, yeah.

308
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:20,772
All right, little bro,
I know you're the fastest man

309
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:22,982
in the world and all that,
but your work ain't done.

310
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,067
Set. Go.

311
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,237
♪ Ring the alarm... ♪

312
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,198
Nope. You're off, bro.

313
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,283
Go again.

314
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:33,534
Go.

315
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,036
Nope. Go.

316
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:36,412
No.

317
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:38,039
No?

318
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,499
What is going on with you, man?

319
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:45,963
Here comes the A-Train!

320
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,966
Hey, you knew Popclaw, right?

321
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:50,927
What? I don't, uh...

322
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:52,929
You guys were
in Teenage Kix together?

323
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,473
You, you heard
she passed away, yeah?

324
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,850
Yeah, they're,
they're saying it was a stroke,

325
00:13:57,892 --> 00:14:00,394
but between you and me,

326
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:02,313
I think it was probably
a drug overdose.

327
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:06,651
You want to maybe say
a little something in her honor?

328
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:13,908
I haven't seen her in years,
so, you know...

329
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:31,133
Boy, you're really milking
this thing for all it's worth.

330
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:34,595
- Excuse me?
- This empowerment act.

331
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:36,931
I mean, every time
I'm on a red carpet now,

332
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:40,393
they're asking me
how I'm supporting Starlight.

333
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:44,105
But, hey, as long
as you're trending, right?

334
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:45,898
I know that you might not
get this,

335
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,776
but it's not an act.

336
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,319
I'm just trying to be honest.

337
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:53,030
Okay. Yeah.

338
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:57,660
When I was younger,

339
00:14:57,702 --> 00:15:02,248
I read your autobiography so
many times that I wore it out.

340
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,709
I had to buy a second one.

341
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,462
I wanted to live my life
exactly like yours.

342
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:10,840
Because you didn't just break
all the bones

343
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:13,301
in your right arm
stopping that school bus

344
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:15,261
from falling off of a bridge,

345
00:15:15,303 --> 00:15:19,974
but you also went to every kid's
physical therapy afterwards.

346
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,894
Just to show the world
that they were heroes, too.

347
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:26,022
You really stood for something.

348
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,984
But now...

349
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:33,905
I'm pretty sure that was just
written by the marketing guys.

350
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:41,037
Hunting for his own food.

351
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:44,916
When fully mature, this immense
predator of the sea

352
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:48,210
can reach sizes
of up to 25 feet in length

353
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:50,379
and over 4,000 pounds.

354
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:54,759
They can reach speeds
of up to 35 miles per hour...

355
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,427
Mon coeur.

356
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:01,265
Would you like me to change it?

357
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:10,066
Incroyable.

358
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:11,275
You talked to me.

359
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,586
- She talked to me.
- That's talking?

360
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,779
Well, she communicated anyway.

361
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,989
- She likes Shark Week, huh?
- I'll call BuzzFeed.

362
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:19,742
I wonder if she lived
by the water.

363
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:27,917
You know, you can't fool me.

364
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,380
Who is she? What does she want?
Why is she here?

365
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,340
She could be the key to it all.

366
00:16:34,382 --> 00:16:37,259
- That's what you think, huh?
- No, that's not what I think.

367
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:39,929
Yes, you do. It torments you.
It's okay.

368
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:41,973
Listen, I got one word for you.

369
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,225
It's a surefire way
to solve this puzzle.

370
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,394
Once and for all.

371
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:47,645
Tell me.

372
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:48,854
Mesmer.

373
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:50,815
Mesmer?

374
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:52,692
You want help from a Supe?

375
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:55,861
He despise Vought, hates them,
hates the other Supes.

376
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:57,697
And the enemy of your enemy...

377
00:16:57,738 --> 00:17:01,492
Frenchie, what part of "you're
burned" do you not understand?

378
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,119
Oh, come on. It's a quick trip.

379
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,787
She and I will hide in the van.

380
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,247
Let's go. In, out, boom, bing.

381
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:09,125
Boom, bing? Look, I'll tell you
what I can do.

382
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,420
I can... possibly

383
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:15,131
tattoo "fuck no" on your ass.

384
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:16,173
Ah, come on.

385
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:17,258
Best I can do.

386
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,301
You know...

387
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:23,305
I've seen you eat ice cream.

388
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:25,349
- Oh, my God.
- Chunky Monkey, I believe.

389
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,059
- Where is this going?
- Well, you know,

390
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:29,061
you take a spoonful...
A chunk of fudge, perhaps.

391
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:31,355
But then I see you
with the surface is uneven.

392
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:33,065
So what do you do?
You take another scoop,

393
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:35,359
you try to even it out,
which, tragically,

394
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,069
creates a corresponding divot.

395
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:39,780
Ultimately, there is only
but one choice for you, no?

396
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:41,657
To consume the entire pint.

397
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,993
No, you don't want to,
you don't want to.

398
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:45,369
But you must.

399
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:46,912
And I tell you why, my friend,

400
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:50,082
because you cannot bear things
out of order.

401
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:54,628
And she...

402
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:57,882
she's out of order.

403
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,929
All right. You want to tell me
where we're going?

404
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:08,601
You don't do it anymore.

405
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:10,895
- What?
- You know that feeling you get

406
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:13,147
when you tip your chair back
too far,

407
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:15,316
and you catch yourself
just before you fall?

408
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:16,901
Yeah?

409
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,611
You used to look like that
all day long.

410
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:20,196
But now look at you,

411
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:24,366
neck-deep in shit,
cool as a cucumber.

412
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:28,537
You ain't half the twat
I thought you were, Hughie.

413
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:32,833
You know, you're always calling
people "cunts" or "twats."

414
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,336
But I just... I never really got
how that's an insult?

415
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:37,963
They're flexible,
take a pounding,

416
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:39,357
and they're
the reason behind, like,

417
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:40,925
98% of my life decisions.

418
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:43,552
You're doing good, Hughie.

419
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:46,388
And you're a good cunt.

420
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:51,477
Well, here we are.

421
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,062
Church?

422
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:57,608
Seek and ye shall find, me son.

423
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,860
Come on.

424
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:03,572
Uh, some days are harder

425
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:07,576
than others, obviously, uh...

426
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:09,745
You know, the other day,

427
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:11,455
I-I wanted to talk to my friend

428
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:14,458
about all this, but I couldn't.

429
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,627
That's why this group
is-is so great.

430
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:19,255
It's so important.

431
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,757
I know it's wrong to feel angry.

432
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:26,846
After all, Tek-Knight saved me.

433
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:28,389
I-I just wish he'd been

434
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,683
a-a little more gentle
with my spine.

435
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:34,562
It's about acceptance, isn't it?

436
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:36,814
Letting go. Moving on.

437
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,570
Seth, you're up.

438
00:19:47,783 --> 00:19:49,702
Hey... Hey, everybody.

439
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:51,620
Hey, Seth.

440
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:53,372
Uh, so I'm kind of a writer.

441
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:55,124
Uh, I work in marketing.

442
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,668
Uh, there's this one hero,
who shall remain nameless,

443
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,211
but has ice powers.

444
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:01,964
Ice Princess.

445
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:05,718
I'm not allowed to say.

446
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,429
Anyway, she, uh,
took a liking to me.

447
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,140
It was heady, man.

448
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:13,642
Intoxicating.

449
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,437
No one wants to fuck the writer.

450
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:19,648
Needless to say,
I fell for her, big-time.

451
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,318
What kind
of nobber falls for a Supe?

452
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,572
Anyway, we were, uh,
you know, being intimate,

453
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:30,868
when she climaxed and
accidentally turned into ice.

454
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,661
Just for a second,

455
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:35,122
but I was, uh,

456
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:38,709
still in there,

457
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:41,587
at negative 346 degrees.

458
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:44,215
Same temperature
as liquid nitrogen.

459
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:47,593
As you can imagine, um...

460
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:51,472
it snapped off.

461
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:57,895
The crazy thing is,
I still miss her.

462
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:02,358
It's like, that's the cost
of a mortal like me

463
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:05,402
for being with a god like her.

464
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,529
If a Supe done that
when she was happy,

465
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:10,199
imagine what one would do
if she found out

466
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:12,076
you'd been lying to her
from the get-go?

467
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,119
Excuse me.

468
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,957
You have something
you'd like to share?

469
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:19,917
No, no. A-Apologies.

470
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,337
Please do, uh,
continue the Ice Capades.

471
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:26,757
We don't make jokes
or judgments here.

472
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,094
Why don't you take the talking
stick and tell us your story?

473
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,972
Nah, I'm good.

474
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:35,182
You know, I've seen guys
like you before.

475
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:36,642
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

476
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:38,143
The smirk, the jokes,

477
00:21:38,185 --> 00:21:39,979
it's all a defense mechanism.

478
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,605
But you don't have
to do that here.

479
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,608
This is a safe space.

480
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,902
I said I'm good.

481
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,904
Time to move on.

482
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:52,324
Go ahead, Seth.
Give him the stick.

483
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:57,246
You, back off,
or I'll shove this stick

484
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:59,206
where your dick used to be.

485
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,044
You're a bunch of pathetic
Supe-worshipping cunts.

486
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:07,840
I bet you'd thank a Supe if they
shat on your mum's best china.

487
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:10,801
Did it ever occur to you
that they split your spine

488
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:14,763
or broke your dick
just for a laugh?

489
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:18,517
Where's your fucking rage?!

490
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,020
Your self-respect?!

491
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:24,648
Sitting here
in your little share circle.

492
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:27,776
Having a little whinge
and a moan.

493
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:30,195
Fuck "letting go."

494
00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:31,965
You should be out there
with a fucking chain saw,

495
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:33,532
going after 'em!

496
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:38,579
Just a bunch of scared
fucking rabbits.

497
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:41,832
Supes are all the same.

498
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:43,584
Every fucking one of 'em.

499
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:49,465
Uh, he's, um...

500
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:52,343
Sorry.

501
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:00,827
Oh, Ms. Stillwell, hey,
you wanted to see me, right?

502
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,895
Yeah, I'm running late.
Can you walk with me?

503
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:05,230
Yeah, sure. Hey, look,
I brought a little present

504
00:23:05,272 --> 00:23:07,232
- for your little guy.
- Ah.

505
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:09,294
Never, uh, too young to start
saving the world, right?

506
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:12,654
I'm gonna need you
to make a public apology.

507
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:16,158
And you're going to be taking
a sabbatical from The Seven.

508
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,619
- What?
- We are going to be stationing you

509
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,746
in Sandusky, Ohio for a while.

510
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:23,665
Okay, okay, look, I-I know,
I know, I know my brain wasn't

511
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:25,376
in the right place,
but, but my heart was.

512
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,795
And it's just that,
that damn Oceanland.

513
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:29,689
- They wouldn't let me...
- This is not about the dead dolphin.

514
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:31,090
This is about Starlight.

515
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:32,800
Starlight? What are you...

516
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:34,343
What about Starlight?

517
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:35,677
Everybody seems to want to know

518
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,513
who she was referencing
in that speech,

519
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:39,473
and it is not going away.

520
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:42,851
It's only a matter of time
before she, or, let's be honest,

521
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:45,062
some of the other women,
speak up.

522
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:47,815
- So we need to get ahead of it.
- Okay.

523
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:50,442
There may have been
a misunderstanding, I know that,

524
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:52,653
but can't you just...

525
00:23:52,694 --> 00:23:55,656
you know, handle it?
Like, like you do?

526
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:59,159
This is the way
we are handling things now.

527
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:05,499
I'm in full support of women

528
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,836
and their ongoing bravery
in speaking out.

529
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,507
I'm sorry...
let me start that over.

530
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:15,789
I'm in full support of women
and their ongoing bravery...

531
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:18,554
Fuck, I'm sorry.

532
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:19,930
Yeah, let's just cut. I'm sorry.

533
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,390
Scene take two. Alpha mark.

534
00:24:21,432 --> 00:24:24,768
Starlight,
I hope you can forgive me.

535
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,478
- Harder to sell.
- To sell it. Yeah.

536
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,164
- Just a little harder.
- Perfect. Let's do that.

537
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:30,357
Speaking out.
We can all become stronger...

538
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,484
by listening. Okay.

539
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,778
I realize that my behavior

540
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,906
has caused Starlight
a great deal of pain,

541
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:41,743
and I sincerely apologize
for this.

542
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:43,537
Though at the time I believed

543
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:45,122
that our encounter
was consensual,

544
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:48,208
I now realize that, um,
I misread the moment...

545
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,711
Our new movie, Insurrection,
it's really exciting.

546
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:52,312
It's my first, uh, movie
with the, uh...

547
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:55,507
in the Vought Cinematic
Universe, uh, the VCU.

548
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:57,176
New York. The hearts

549
00:24:57,217 --> 00:24:59,970
of seven million men and women
beat inside this city.

550
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:03,348
But there's only one person
who can see inside their hearts

551
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,726
and read their minds.

552
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:07,269
This man is the rapist.

553
00:25:12,316 --> 00:25:14,276
There are no secrets from me.

Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

564
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,271
- Okay.
- "There are no secrets from me."

565
00:25:51,313 --> 00:25:54,149
- There are no secrets from me.
- There are no secrets from me.

566
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:58,028
Hey.

567
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,280
What number am I thinking of?

568
00:26:00,322 --> 00:26:02,950
867?

569
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:05,118
Fucking amazing.

570
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,246
This guy's fucking amazing.

571
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:10,457
So, what am I thinking of?

572
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:14,503
I'm thinking the same thing.

573
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:16,171
Cool.

574
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:19,258
- Now, why don't I put this down.
- Okay.

575
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:20,842
- Yeah. Okay.
- Cool.

576
00:26:20,884 --> 00:26:23,345
- Thank-thank you.
- Yeah.

577
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:25,472
- Mr. Mesmer.
- Ah, just-just Mesmer.

578
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:26,807
No "mister" necessary.

579
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:29,268
- You know, I'm a big fan, man.
- Thanks.

580
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:30,870
- Weren't you in Teenage Kix with A-Train?
- Yep.

581
00:26:30,894 --> 00:26:33,105
Yeah. Yo, A-Train's
really blown up, hasn't he?

582
00:26:33,146 --> 00:26:34,690
- Yeah.
- He's doing his thing.

583
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:36,376
Yeah, he's great.
I'm-I'm really happy for him.

584
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,151
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

585
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:39,820
You a fan of the show?

586
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:42,072
Oh, nah, man.
I've never seen it.

587
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,533
- Okay.
- You know what I'm a fan of?

588
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:46,618
Your insider trading.

589
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,473
The way you brushed your hand
up against that Wall Street guy?

590
00:26:50,497 --> 00:26:54,209
Brother, that shit right there,
now, that was ruthless.

591
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:56,461
I mean, Vought dropped you
like a hot potato afterwards,

592
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:59,006
which I think is some bullshit,
but with the SEC coming...

593
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:00,549
Who the fuck are you?

594
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:04,803
Why don't you take a peep
and see?

595
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:13,895
How do you know about Cleo?

596
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:18,525
There are no secrets from me.

597
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:20,402
Well, I work for Child Services.

598
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:23,989
My colleague Tina,
she owes me a favor.

599
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:27,784
See, she, just like I,
believe in second chances.

600
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:29,453
Cut the shit.

601
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,413
I lost custody three years ago.

602
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:32,724
Nobody believes
in second chances

603
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:34,708
for fuckups like me.

604
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:44,926
She's waiting on you.

605
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:50,557
Tina. Hey.

606
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,476
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

607
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:54,436
Good to see you, too.

608
00:27:54,478 --> 00:27:56,772
Five minutes.
Next time you owe me.

609
00:27:56,813 --> 00:27:58,523
I do.

610
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:00,525
Hey, Cleo.

611
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,946
You remember your old man?

612
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:07,491
Hi, Charles.

613
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:21,672
I'm-I'm sorry that, uh...

614
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:28,887
I'm gonna try and be
in your life a little bit more.

615
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:31,890
Would that be okay?

616
00:28:31,932 --> 00:28:33,892
I guess.

617
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:36,311
Okay, Cleo.

618
00:28:36,353 --> 00:28:38,897
We got to get back.

619
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,608
- Bye.
- Hey, uh...

620
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:50,826
I-I just...

621
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,994
I just want to know
you don't hate me.

622
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:56,957
I don't really know you.

623
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:05,549
Hey, wait, um...

624
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:10,971
So you can know me
a little better.

625
00:29:11,012 --> 00:29:14,141
I don't have a DVD player.

626
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:17,185
Bye.

627
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:21,106
Thanks again.
I'll call you next week.

628
00:29:21,148 --> 00:29:23,150
Okay. You all right?

629
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,490
I can see her every month?

630
00:29:30,532 --> 00:29:32,868
One hour, supervised.

631
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:34,494
You clean?

632
00:29:34,536 --> 00:29:36,496
- I-I can be.
- Good.

633
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:39,458
Who do you want me to read?

634
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:43,628
What are we doing here?

635
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:52,888
My wife, Becca,
used to hum the Spice Girls.

636
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:55,557
Drove me round the fucking bend,
you know.

637
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,309
All day long,

638
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,853
walking around the house,
humming.

639
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:01,897
She was happy.

640
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:06,359
Now, fuck know why
she was happy with me, but...

641
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,321
she was happy.

642
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:28,381
Homelander raped her.

643
00:30:35,388 --> 00:30:37,390
Jesus.

644
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:44,815
I-I'm sorry.

645
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:57,410
Not long after that,
she came and sat right here.

646
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:01,665
I know this
'cause she got tagged

647
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,667
in that security camera
right there.

648
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:12,509
She sat here for three hours.

649
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:16,930
Didn't move a muscle.

650
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:24,521
Then she just got up
and walked away.

651
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:32,946
That was eight years ago.

652
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:36,491
And nobody's seen her since.

653
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:42,497
Either Homelander killed her

654
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,542
or she killed herself.
Same difference.

655
00:31:51,882 --> 00:31:53,842
You see,

656
00:31:53,884 --> 00:31:56,845
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

657
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:03,894
You and me,
we're in this together.

658
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,190
For Robin...

659
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:11,234
and Becca.

660
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:18,575
That is why
you can't allow yourself

661
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:22,120
to be distracted
by another bird.

662
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,416
Especially not a Supe.

663
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:38,678
Just remember...

664
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:43,683
who your friends

665
00:32:43,725 --> 00:32:46,686
and who your enemies are.

666
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:15,674
That is gonna kill somebody
when it lands in Boston.

667
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:22,097
Look, I heard what happened.

668
00:33:23,264 --> 00:33:26,893
I am so, so sorry.

669
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,437
What kind of place
did you grow up in?

670
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:31,314
Well, I moved around a lot,

671
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,566
so, uh, it was
a bunch of condos.

672
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:36,069
So, what if I took you
to a house

673
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:39,948
you'd never seen before,
full of photos

674
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,242
of parents you never met,

675
00:33:42,283 --> 00:33:44,661
toys you never played with,

676
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:47,706
Hardy Boy books
that you never read?

677
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:51,835
And then I asked you

678
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:56,006
how much all that fake
fucking bullshit meant to you?

679
00:33:57,841 --> 00:34:00,051
How would that make you feel?

680
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:02,595
I wouldn't like that.

681
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:10,645
I'm really sorry
about the blanket.

682
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:12,522
It never should have been there,

683
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:14,774
and Randy Set-Dec
has already been terminated.

684
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:20,238
But right now...

685
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,992
we need to finish that tour

686
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:26,619
and to show how down-to-earth

687
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:29,205
and ready to serve you are.

688
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:32,417
And I need you
to tell the mother story.

689
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:34,335
Please.

690
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:42,093
Please do it for me.

691
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,474
It was actually my mom
who dragged me along

692
00:34:47,515 --> 00:34:49,225
to my first
Little League practice,

693
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,144
and, uh, pretty soon after that,

694
00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:52,395
I-I just loved the game

695
00:34:52,437 --> 00:34:54,022
more than anything else
in the world.

696
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:56,024
So every year

697
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:58,610
she would bake me
a birthday cake

698
00:34:58,651 --> 00:35:00,695
in the shape
of a baseball diamond.

699
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:05,075
And... oh, I got to tell you,
it was perfect.

700
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:06,743
Perfect.

701
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:10,371
Everything, down to
the last minute details.

702
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:14,375
Just like her.

703
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:19,339
Cut. Perfect. So great.

704
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,591
- So we're done?
- Uh, yes.

705
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:23,343
Great.

706
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,399
So...

707
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:41,277
she can't talk or won't talk?

708
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,612
That's what
you're gonna tell us.

709
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:44,405
Anything in particular
you want to know?

710
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:46,509
- Everything there is to know.
- Well, that narrows it down.

711
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:48,493
Mon coeur.

712
00:35:48,535 --> 00:35:50,495
Will you come?

713
00:35:50,537 --> 00:35:52,539
Have a seat.

714
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:57,085
It's okay. Have a seat.

715
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:06,970
Gentle.

716
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:08,763
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

717
00:36:33,246 --> 00:36:35,582
- Jesus fucking...
- Goddamn it.

718
00:36:35,623 --> 00:36:37,542
- Relax!
- No.

719
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:38,793
Everyone relax!

720
00:36:38,835 --> 00:36:40,187
- Just-just go walk it off.
- Walk it off?

721
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:41,880
She broke my fucking wrist!

722
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:43,965
She didn't intend any harm.

723
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:45,300
Oh, could have fooled me.

724
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:48,386
Get out!
I'm going to the hospital.

725
00:36:48,428 --> 00:36:49,655
Not till we get
what we came for, Mesmer.

726
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,514
- Fuck you! The session's over!
- Sit down!

727
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:54,934
Okay, listen.

728
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:56,895
I was a field medic.

729
00:36:56,936 --> 00:36:59,439
Don't look at her. Look at me.

730
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,815
I can patch you up better

731
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:02,734
than any of those
oxy junkies in the E.R.,

732
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:04,861
or I can break your other wrist.
You decide.

733
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,617
Good. Now, do you have
any bandages or a splint?

734
00:37:10,658 --> 00:37:13,036
No, I don't have
a goddamn splint!

735
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:17,207
It's Butcher.

736
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:18,666
Be quiet.

737
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,628
- Butcher.
- Where are you?

738
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,129
Shake Shack.

739
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:24,631
Really?

740
00:37:24,672 --> 00:37:27,258
Fucking magic, that place.

741
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,052
- What'd you get?
- ShackBurger,

742
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:31,095
uh, cheese fries,

743
00:37:31,137 --> 00:37:33,973
- cookie dough concrete.
- Sounds good.

744
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:35,308
Does it taste like lies?

745
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,768
I got your phone linked

746
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:38,686
to my
Find-Your-Shithead-Friends app.

747
00:37:38,728 --> 00:37:41,481
Now, where the fuck are you?

748
00:37:50,156 --> 00:37:53,451
Yes, this...
this is a superhero.

749
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:55,870
- This is good.
- Okay.

750
00:37:55,912 --> 00:37:58,498
- We just keep...?
- Yeah, yeah.

751
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:00,500
Well, people are
always asking me, you know,

752
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:03,503
what it's like to live
with my coworkers, and...

753
00:38:03,544 --> 00:38:05,880
the truth is,
we're all great friends,

754
00:38:05,922 --> 00:38:08,591
you know, behind the scenes
just as much as we are to the...

755
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:10,218
uh...

756
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,095
Oh, hey, Elena.

757
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:13,888
- Hey.
- This is my friend.

758
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,598
I left a pile of messages for...

759
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,600
Yeah, that's what we are.
We're friends.

760
00:38:17,642 --> 00:38:19,394
Can you ask them
to turn that off, please?

761
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:21,354
I'm gonna need
five minutes, okay?

762
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:24,941
Yeah, we're, uh,
doing a reality show.

763
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:28,569
- That's invasive.
- What are you even doing here?

764
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:31,489
I would never turn up
to your work.

765
00:38:31,531 --> 00:38:33,700
- I was worried about you.
- I had a bad night.

766
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:36,703
This Teflon shit, it might work
for everybody else,

767
00:38:36,744 --> 00:38:38,955
- but not with me.
- Will you keep your voice down?

768
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:41,541
Just tell me what's going on.

769
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:44,335
Did you ever think that, um...

770
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:49,132
maybe I was just looking
for a hookup?

771
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:50,675
I know you think you know me...

772
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:53,469
- I used to.
- Yeah, used to. I've changed.

773
00:38:54,512 --> 00:38:55,763
Yeah.

774
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,140
I still know you.

775
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:59,100
- Oh, come on.
- Afraid to be seen with me.

776
00:38:59,142 --> 00:39:02,228
Afraid to ask for help.

777
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,731
Just... afraid.

778
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:18,244
Are you filming, Courtenay?

779
00:39:18,286 --> 00:39:20,955
I told you to turn
the fucking cameras off!

780
00:39:20,997 --> 00:39:22,540
We cut... we cut a while ago.

781
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:24,208
We're setting up a shot
for later.

782
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,377
- Fucking bitch.
- B-roll on the building.

783
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:28,171
All right, you can cut it, guys.

784
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:30,131
It's okay.

785
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:31,257
Everything is okay.

786
00:39:35,678 --> 00:39:38,181
Gentlemen.

787
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:42,018
Wow. Mesmer.

788
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,770
Hello.

789
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:45,521
Big fan.

790
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:46,814
Be with you in a minute.

791
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:50,568
Well, now we got to kill him.

792
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,111
No, we don't have to kill him.

793
00:39:52,153 --> 00:39:54,113
Look, we made a deal
with the guy.

794
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:56,991
If he keeps his trap shut,
he gets to see his kid.

795
00:39:57,033 --> 00:39:58,618
He's just a dad with his kid.

796
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:00,620
He's a fucking Supe with a kid.

797
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:02,622
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

798
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:05,333
- You know better than that.
- Sometimes you get further

799
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:08,169
with people
by treating them like people.

800
00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:13,508
Nice decor.

801
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:16,094
'80s serial killer. Love it.

802
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:19,138
All right, then,
let's get cracking.

803
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:37,365
There's a camp in a...
in a jungle.

804
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:43,496
She's a soldier.

805
00:40:46,165 --> 00:40:49,794
There's a-a flag
with a two-headed snake on it.

806
00:40:49,836 --> 00:40:51,796
Two-headed snake?

807
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:53,548
Like...?

808
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:55,258
Yeah.

809
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:57,301
- With red rays behind it?
- What does that mean?

810
00:40:57,343 --> 00:40:59,387
It's the flag of the
Shining Light Liberation Army.

811
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:00,763
Frenchie...

812
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:03,266
you're dating a terrorist.

813
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:06,936
Is this true?

814
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:09,749
Ah.

815
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,306
There must be more
to all of this.

816
00:42:25,348 --> 00:42:28,100
She can't be a terrorist.

817
00:42:28,142 --> 00:42:29,828
Yeah, well, you just fucking
keep her under control.

818
00:42:29,852 --> 00:42:31,771
Okay, so they smuggle in

819
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:33,773
a top-shelf extremist recruit

820
00:42:33,814 --> 00:42:35,775
and pump her up with Compound V.

821
00:42:35,816 --> 00:42:37,044
And then,
when she's good and ready,

822
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:38,253
they cut her loose
to wreak havoc.

823
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:39,529
- She wouldn't.
- Wait.

824
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,572
Why would Vought give
Compound V to terrorists?

825
00:42:41,614 --> 00:42:44,408
'Cause the only thing
more dangerous than a terrorist

826
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,786
is a Supe terrorist,
and the only way to fight it...

827
00:42:46,827 --> 00:42:48,955
Is with Sergeant
Fucking Homelander.

828
00:42:48,996 --> 00:42:51,666
Got to let the cunts
in the army now.

829
00:42:51,707 --> 00:42:54,377
Those fuckers are creating
super villains.

830
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:57,046
And maybe there's more of 'em,
God knows how many.

831
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:58,631
Holy shit.

832
00:42:58,673 --> 00:43:01,259
Okay, this is a clusterfuck,
even for us.

833
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,053
No, listen to me, okay? Maybe
that's what they want her to be.

834
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:06,222
But that's not who she is.

835
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,144
- That's not what she wants.
- And you know this

836
00:43:08,182 --> 00:43:09,767
'cause she bends
your fucking ear off?

837
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:11,852
She saved my life!
She's not bad.

838
00:43:11,894 --> 00:43:13,771
She just want to go home.

839
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:16,566
She's a fucking Supe,
just like the rest.

840
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,735
How many times do I have
to fucking say it, eh?

841
00:43:23,364 --> 00:43:25,992
Mon coeur,
I know you understand me.

842
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:27,868
Please. Please.

843
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,579
Tell them who you are.

844
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,997
Tell them what I see.

845
00:43:41,674 --> 00:43:42,925
No.

846
00:44:11,996 --> 00:44:14,332
The drawings are, uh,
palm trees in front of the moon.

847
00:44:14,373 --> 00:44:16,584
It's where she grew up.

848
00:44:20,254 --> 00:44:21,672
They killed her parents.

849
00:44:21,714 --> 00:44:23,924
They kidnapped her
and her brother.

850
00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:26,093
Forced them to be soldiers.

851
00:44:32,016 --> 00:44:33,476
No, Kimiko...

852
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:35,895
You eat it.

853
00:44:35,936 --> 00:44:39,357
She just wants to go back and
get her brother out of there.

854
00:44:42,777 --> 00:44:44,779
Her name's Kimiko.

855
00:44:50,951 --> 00:44:52,411
Kimiko.

856
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:59,418
Bonjour, Kimiko.

857
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:08,511
All right, take her back
to the safe house.

858
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:11,931
MOTHER'S MILK Where you headed?

859
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:13,808
I'm gonna go see Raynor.

860
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:16,977
We've got more than enough
to get the Feds on board now.

861
00:45:19,397 --> 00:45:23,859
You tell anyone what you saw
or heard here today,

862
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:27,363
and I'll cut your hands off and
shove 'em so far up your ass,

863
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:30,866
your fingers'll give us a little
wave out your throat, yeah?

864
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:37,248
Fuck off, wanker.

865
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:42,920
Some controversial news today

866
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:44,481
as the Deep went public
with his apology.

867
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:46,215
I realize that my behavior

868
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,968
caused Starlight
a great deal of pain,

869
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:51,637
and I sincerely apologize.

870
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,433
Fuck you, fish dick!

871
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,936
Keep speaking your truth!

872
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:01,313
I'm in full support of women

873
00:46:01,355 --> 00:46:03,774
and their ongoing bravery...

874
00:46:03,816 --> 00:46:07,027
Never got the point of these.

875
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:09,029
To me, they always looked
like Grandad's bollocks

876
00:46:09,071 --> 00:46:10,281
flopping in the wind.

877
00:46:12,575 --> 00:46:15,453
Do you have
the Compound V or not?

878
00:46:15,494 --> 00:46:17,913
I've got the Compound V...

879
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:21,375
proof that Vought's injected
babies right across the country,

880
00:46:21,417 --> 00:46:24,879
and... something
even more fucking diabolical.

881
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,422
Worse than dosing babies?

882
00:46:26,464 --> 00:46:28,382
Let's just say,
with these cunts,

883
00:46:28,424 --> 00:46:30,384
there ain't no rock bottom.

884
00:46:30,426 --> 00:46:32,970
Let's get it to the lab...

885
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:35,347
Not so fast.

886
00:46:37,975 --> 00:46:40,269
First things first, eh?

887
00:46:41,937 --> 00:46:43,439
A list of your demands.

888
00:46:43,481 --> 00:46:45,816
How in character.

889
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:48,319
Exorbitant salary.
Same for your team.

890
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,987
Office space,

891
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:51,489
in the Flatiron Building,
no less.

892
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,532
Security clearance.
Indemnity clause.

893
00:46:53,574 --> 00:46:55,284
Legal protection.

894
00:46:55,326 --> 00:46:57,703
A formal guarantee that
Homelander will be prosecuted

895
00:46:57,745 --> 00:46:59,872
under the full extent
of the law.

896
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,833
Any of that a problem?

897
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,085
No, gonna pass it up the chain.

898
00:47:05,127 --> 00:47:07,797
And, uh, while they hash it out,

899
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,424
you and I go forward
on good faith.

900
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:14,595
I'm fresh out of good faith.

901
00:47:14,637 --> 00:47:16,096
Now, you and I both know

902
00:47:16,138 --> 00:47:18,349
that you can rubber-stamp
all of that.

903
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,100
So what's it gonna be...

904
00:47:20,142 --> 00:47:21,560
Deputy Director?

905
00:47:21,602 --> 00:47:24,021
I can give you...

906
00:47:24,063 --> 00:47:26,816
everything you want
on this list...

907
00:47:26,857 --> 00:47:28,609
Except?

908
00:47:28,651 --> 00:47:31,654
Except Homelander.

909
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:38,244
You know what he's done.

910
00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:51,674
I sympathize.

911
00:47:52,716 --> 00:47:54,051
I really do.

912
00:47:54,093 --> 00:47:55,970
- But it's suicide.
- Yeah, well,

913
00:47:56,011 --> 00:47:58,848
- that's a small fucking price to pay, isn't it?
- Not for you.

914
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:01,642
For thousands of people
if you push him too hard.

915
00:48:01,684 --> 00:48:03,644
You're fucking scared.

916
00:48:03,686 --> 00:48:05,604
I'm fucking terrified.

917
00:48:05,646 --> 00:48:07,648
And you should be, too.

918
00:48:14,196 --> 00:48:15,197
Butcher!

919
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:18,409
Butcher!

920
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,055
This small-town girl-next-door

921
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:41,849
wanted to change the world.

922
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:43,601
Since when did hopeful

923
00:48:43,642 --> 00:48:46,562
and naive become the same thing?

924
00:48:46,604 --> 00:48:48,981
But the world had other plans.

925
00:48:49,023 --> 00:48:50,691
Starlight,

926
00:48:50,733 --> 00:48:51,692
I hope you can forgive me.

927
00:48:51,734 --> 00:48:53,485
Battered and beaten,

928
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:56,530
a phoenix rose from the ashes
with a message so loud,

929
00:48:56,572 --> 00:49:01,619
so raw, it couldn't come forth
as anything less than a roar.

930
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,787
Witness her power.

931
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:05,748
Hear her truth.

932
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:07,958
And I'm done taking
any more shit.

933
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,127
Watch her stand up

934
00:49:10,169 --> 00:49:12,546
and fight back for all of us.

935
00:49:12,588 --> 00:49:16,091
Citizen Starlight,
coming this fall from Vought.

936
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:19,428
- ♪ You're gonna hear me roar. ♪
- The house always wins.

937
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:26,226
I'm sorry.

938
00:49:38,197 --> 00:49:39,490
While little is known about...

939
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:43,827
the blacktip reef sharks
can be found mating

940
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:45,287
in the summer months

941
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:47,623
off the coast
of Northern Australia.

942
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:51,085
I know you want
to go back to your brother.

943
00:49:54,588 --> 00:49:57,841
But the people
who did this to you...

944
00:49:57,883 --> 00:50:01,345
You know, they might be doing it
to others.

945
00:50:01,387 --> 00:50:03,472
We can use your help
stopping them.

946
00:50:11,647 --> 00:50:13,607
It's your choice.

947
00:50:13,649 --> 00:50:18,237
You give me a nod, and we go
to the airport right now.

948
00:50:18,278 --> 00:50:21,365
And is following her closely

949
00:50:21,407 --> 00:50:23,701
in hopes of securing a mate.

950
00:50:23,742 --> 00:50:25,911
When the female returns
his feelings,

951
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:27,871
she will swim slowly

952
00:50:27,913 --> 00:50:29,957
in a sinusoidal pattern...

953
00:50:35,295 --> 00:50:37,256
No.

954
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:40,259
Baby, why you want
to do me like that?

955
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,153
'Cause if you watch that episode
of Downton Abbey,

956
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:43,762
then I'm gonna be one behind...

957
00:50:43,804 --> 00:50:45,490
and we're not gonna be able
to binge-watch together.

958
00:50:45,514 --> 00:50:46,890
Just-just hold off

959
00:50:46,932 --> 00:50:48,559
until I get home.

960
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,519
Uhp, there's a fight
in the yard, baby.

961
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:53,188
I got to go. All right.

962
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,149
How'd it go with Raynor?

963
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,234
No dice.

964
00:50:57,276 --> 00:50:58,652
What?

965
00:50:58,694 --> 00:51:01,155
Said she got cold feet.

966
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:03,282
Well, why?
Did you tell her everything?

967
00:51:03,323 --> 00:51:06,702
Yeah, I laid it all out,
even the sample of V.

968
00:51:06,744 --> 00:51:08,704
Said she couldn't
fucking authorize

969
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:10,456
that kind of action
against Vought.

970
00:51:10,497 --> 00:51:12,791
Too much of a risk.

971
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:15,461
Hmm. Did she?

972
00:51:15,502 --> 00:51:17,337
Fucking spineless cunt.

973
00:51:17,379 --> 00:51:19,339
So we are royally fucked.

974
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,301
No, we ain't.

975
00:51:22,342 --> 00:51:24,428
Fuck 'em.

976
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,430
We don't need 'em.

977
00:51:26,472 --> 00:51:30,851
We got everyone and everything
we need right here in this room.

978
00:51:30,893 --> 00:51:34,313
We'll take down Vought
ourselves. Yeah?

979
00:51:34,354 --> 00:51:36,231
Yeah.

980
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:40,319
Where's Hughie?

981
00:51:42,362 --> 00:51:44,239
This is Tina Mitchell,

982
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:46,241
Department of Child Protection
and Permanency.

983
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:48,285
Leave a message.

984
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:50,370
Tina, um, it's Mesmer.

985
00:51:50,412 --> 00:51:52,206
You met me earlier.

986
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,918
Um...

987
00:51:55,959 --> 00:51:59,755
Cleo, uh, didn't really
want to see me today.

988
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:01,924
She was just being polite.

989
00:52:04,134 --> 00:52:06,678
I'm pretty good at reading stuff
like that, so...

990
00:52:08,013 --> 00:52:10,307
Um, you-you don't have
to-to call me,

991
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:13,018
um, or any of that anymore.

992
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:16,271
Just, um... it's-it's okay.

993
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:19,566
Just... just... please...

994
00:52:19,608 --> 00:52:22,027
uh, look after her.

995
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,072
Thank you.

996
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:37,292
I'm sorry.
The, uh, elevator was out.

997
00:52:38,794 --> 00:52:41,547
Um, you...
you probably don't remember,

998
00:52:41,588 --> 00:52:43,090
but, um, we've met before.

999
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:47,136
Oh, I...
I would never try and read you.

1000
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:48,595
Let's be clear.

1001
00:52:48,637 --> 00:52:50,806
I don't know you,

1002
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:52,850
and I don't want to.

1003
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:56,478
A-Train said
that you have some information.

1004
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,148
Yeah, we, um... we go back
to the Teenage Kix days.

1005
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:01,358
- We-we still keep in touch.
- Oh, golly gee shucks.

1006
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,361
What makes you think I would
give two fucks about that?

1007
00:53:04,403 --> 00:53:08,240
Now, do you have something
for me or not?

1008
00:53:08,282 --> 00:53:10,409
Yeah.

1009
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:14,371
He said you were looking
for a, um, French guy...

1010
00:53:14,413 --> 00:53:18,417
and a black guy...

1011
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:20,335
a skinny white guy,

1012
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:22,379
British guy.

1013
00:53:23,422 --> 00:53:25,382
Where are these from?

1014
00:53:25,424 --> 00:53:29,261
Shitty little $85 camera
I put in my doorbell casing.

1015
00:53:29,303 --> 00:53:31,638
I know there's no reward,
but I was hoping

1016
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,391
you could put in a word for me
at Vought?

1017
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:36,518
I'll take any posting.

1018
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,563
Uh, low five-figures
would be fine.

1019
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,443
I just want to be one
of the good guys again.

1020
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,793
Oh, that's my phone.

1021
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:06,465
I mean, I don't remember,

1022
00:54:06,506 --> 00:54:09,343
but my mom said
that when I was born,

1023
00:54:09,384 --> 00:54:11,094
I almost blinded the doctor.

1024
00:54:11,136 --> 00:54:13,847
So, I had powers from the start.

1025
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:15,307
Why?

1026
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:18,435
No, no, I'm just, uh, curious.

1027
00:54:18,477 --> 00:54:20,479
Mm.

1028
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,481
Do you mind if we just...

1029
00:54:22,522 --> 00:54:24,566
not talk
about hero stuff tonight?

1030
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:26,568
Yeah, yeah. Bad day at work?

1031
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,238
Yeah. It's an understatement.

1032
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:31,907
You know,

1033
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:34,576
there's this beach
in the Bahamas

1034
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:37,162
where the sand is pink,

1035
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:39,706
like, cotton-candy pink.

1036
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:40,832
What's it called?

1037
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:41,917
Pink Sands.

1038
00:54:43,043 --> 00:54:45,254
It's not the most creative name,

1039
00:54:45,295 --> 00:54:48,048
but... let's just go.

1040
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,050
Yeah. No, I can, uh...

1041
00:54:50,092 --> 00:54:51,927
learn how to play
the steel drum.

1042
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:53,845
You can get cornrows.

1043
00:54:53,887 --> 00:54:55,097
How about tonight?

1044
00:54:55,138 --> 00:54:56,431
Book that ticket.

1045
00:54:59,601 --> 00:55:02,396
Are...
are we talking about this?

1046
00:55:03,438 --> 00:55:05,565
I don't know. I...

1047
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:07,609
I just know that,

1048
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:10,612
for me, New York has been such

1049
00:55:10,654 --> 00:55:13,740
an endless shit show.

1050
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:15,993
Except for you.

1051
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:20,455
Somehow, in the middle
of it all...

1052
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,752
you found me.

1053
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:55,449
Hughie.

1054
00:55:57,826 --> 00:55:59,953
I thought that was you.

1055
00:55:59,995 --> 00:56:01,955
Ha. Oh.

1056
00:56:01,997 --> 00:56:03,373
Oh, I apologize.

1057
00:56:03,415 --> 00:56:04,833
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1058
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,251
No.

1059
00:56:06,293 --> 00:56:07,919
Hi, I'm Annie.

1060
00:56:07,961 --> 00:56:09,588
Billy. Old mate of Hughie's.

1061
00:56:09,629 --> 00:56:11,173
Ah, boy, you really...

1062
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:13,258
You have a lot of friends
showing up here.

1063
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,052
Yeah.

1064
00:56:15,093 --> 00:56:16,470
Seems like it.

1065
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:19,973
You're that new girl
in The Seven, ain't you?

1066
00:56:20,015 --> 00:56:21,516
Guilty.

1067
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:23,602
Wow. It is a pleasure
to meet you.

1068
00:56:23,643 --> 00:56:25,645
And I must say
how marvelous it is

1069
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:28,190
that so many more women are
in positions of power.

1070
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:29,900
- You know what I mean?
- Mm.

1071
00:56:29,941 --> 00:56:33,195
You know,
I-if I'm perfectly honest,

1072
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:36,114
Translucent's always been
my favorite.

1073
00:56:36,156 --> 00:56:37,908
What's he up to?

1074
00:56:37,949 --> 00:56:40,243
I think he's on a mission.

1075
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:42,704
Huh. Yeah, I think
I read that, actually.

1076
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:44,623
He's been gone a long time,
though, hasn't he?

1077
00:56:44,664 --> 00:56:47,459
I do hope he's all right.

1078
00:56:48,502 --> 00:56:50,128
You know what?

1079
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,130
I'm gonna go...
get us a pitcher.

1080
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:54,508
- Ah.
- Billy, you like...

1081
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:55,926
Let me guess. Guinness?

1082
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:58,053
I like what you like.

1083
00:56:58,095 --> 00:57:00,389
All right. Be right back.

1084
00:57:01,932 --> 00:57:04,684
- Well, well, well.
- Butcher...

1085
00:57:04,726 --> 00:57:07,145
She's quite tasty
up close and personal.

1086
00:57:07,187 --> 00:57:09,272
- I get what you see in her.
- That wasn't what...

1087
00:57:09,314 --> 00:57:11,274
I thought
we had an understanding.

1088
00:57:11,316 --> 00:57:12,651
We do. We do.

1089
00:57:12,692 --> 00:57:15,487
- It... It's not what...
- Not what it looks like?

1090
00:57:15,529 --> 00:57:17,781
'Cause from where I'm sitting,
it looks like

1091
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,826
you've got your tongue halfway
down the opposition's throat.

1092
00:57:20,867 --> 00:57:23,120
She is not the opposition.

1093
00:57:24,996 --> 00:57:27,624
She's a good person, okay?

1094
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,959
I mean, she could help us.

1095
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,877
- Help us?
- Yeah.

1096
00:57:33,588 --> 00:57:35,715
And what do you think
she's gonna do

1097
00:57:35,757 --> 00:57:38,718
when she finds out
you murdered Translucent?

1098
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:42,389
When she finds out?

1099
00:57:47,227 --> 00:57:49,479
Give her my best.

1100
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,152
