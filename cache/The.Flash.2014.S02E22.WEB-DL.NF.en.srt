-Oh.

-I didn't know you were here.
-What are you doing?

158
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,514
Jesse asked me to run some tests to see
if her genetic structure had changed.

159
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:04,896
Why did you ask Dr. Snow
to run tests on you again?

160
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,064
Because I got hit
with the dark matter, okay?

161
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,941
I mean,
that must have affected me somehow.

Yeah, fine.

-DR. McGEE: That's the one.

All right, great.

173
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,581

why don't you guys crack this open,

174
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,749
-see what you can find?
-Sure.

175
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,711
We'll go see what kind of meta-human
powers can take down a building like that,

176
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,337
-and how to stop it.
-Great.

177
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:12,504
Sounds like fun.

178
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,341
All right, I'm gonna go see
if Joe needs any help in the streets.

-Can I talk to you for a minute?

182
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,229
Yeah, sure. What's up?

183
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,231
Well, I know you said

184
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:32,859
that what happened to you
in the Speed Force

185
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,111
changed the way you see things.

186
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,238
-Yeah.
-But you seem very optimistic,

187
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:40,199
you know, with a lot of meta-humans
running around, tearing up the city.

188
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,534
What, did you see the future in there?

189

(CHUCKLES) Um...

190
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,873
Not this time. No, I... Look,

191
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,169
what I was shown in the Speed Force,
it didn't just change my mind,

192
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,838
it changed me.

193
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,217
I don't know, I mean,
what you're seeing as optimism is...

194
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:02,721
For the first time,
I'm just not afraid anymore.

195
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,683
Great. That's...

196
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,857
But you know
you still have to be careful, right?

197
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,819
-What do you mean?
-Well...

198
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,947
I don't... Why are you trying

199
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,909
to take something from me
that I've fought so hard to get to?

I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

Barry, I don't want to take anything
from you, I believe in you.

This isn't about my not believing in you.

210
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,605
I know that. And I'm fine, okay?

211
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,359
Thank you.
Thank you very much for worrying about me.

And how do you propose we do that

laying waste to Central City?

We're a team.

We start with the meta-humans,
they're his armor.

263
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,913
We take them down first,
then Zoom's more vulnerable.

Barry, we don't know even know
how many of his minions there are.

There could be hundreds, a thousand.

And all of them,
they're all working with different powers.

It could take weeks to track 'em all down.

Guys, we don't have weeks.

-Right.

466
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,942
So, I ran this all past Hartley, right?

467
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:36,237
And he postulated that we could create
a sort of dimensional tuning fork. <i>Voilà!</i>

468
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,739
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.

469
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,658
-Just let me have this one, okay?
-HARRISON: <i>All right, have it.</i>

470
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:45,330
Thank you. So, if you run around the city
fast enough to create a refracting field,

471
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:51,377
the device can send out a pulse
that will bounce off of it, split apart,

472
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,880
and collide with itself over and over.

473
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,632
Amplifying it to an erratic frequency
on the Earth-2...

474
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,510
-Higher. Higher frequency.
-Higher frequency on the Earth-2 spectrum.

475
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,637
And when that pulse hits anyone
from Earth-2...

476
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,306
It'll disrupt their nervous system.

477
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,475
Earth-2 metas go night-night.

478
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,769
-Even Zoom?
-Even Zoom.

479
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,354
Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.

480
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,022
How do we keep the pulse
from hurting them?

481
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,482
Detective, I didn't know you cared.

482
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:13,775
Yes, you did.

483
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,362
(CHUCKLES) Well, we designed these
headphones to protect us from the pulse.

484
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,239
-Beats By Wells.
-(HARRISON CHUCKLES)

(BEEPING)

486
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,744
Cisco, it's your meta-human alert app.

487
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,578
That's the high-rise development
on the west side.

488
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,997
Hundreds of people live there.

489
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,625
Ramon, we're up. Let's go.
Set that pulse off right now.

490
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,336
Allen, you need to start generating
that refracting field right now.

491
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,546
Black Siren could take down this building
at any point.

492
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,714
(STUTTERS) All those people, Wells...

493
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,591
How many more people are gonna die
while we wait?

494

(SIGHS)

495
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,762
Guys, which is it?

496
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,891
I think I just got
the worst idea of all time.

497

(CHUCKLES)

498
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,489
I don't think I've taken down
so many buildings at once.

499
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,659
WOMAN: <i>Maybe you're not as powerful
as you think!</i>

500
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,176
What are you two doing here?

501
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,470
Why should you have all the fun?

502
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:32,103
I thought you two were dead.

503
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:36,942
Zoom thinks that, too.
And we'd like to keep it that way.

504
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,734
For now.

505
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,115
You think you two can pull one over
on Zoom?

506
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,493
<i>Well, enjoy being dead.</i>

507
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,079
I told you.

508
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,789
Give her a chance.

509
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,249
What chance?

510
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,918
She's not ready.

511
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,130
BLACK SIREN: <i>Excuse me.</i>

512

Do you know what I'm capable of doing?

513
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,970
Try it and I'll shatter
your entire nervous system

514
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,554
without breaking a sweat.

515
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,765
Wow, you really think
you can take on Zoom.

516
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,060
We can.

517
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,856
You don't even know how powerful you are.

518
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,484
With a single call,
you can take down a building.

519
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,944
I'd call that impressive.

520
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:26,241
But why stop there?

521
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,161
Why serve a master
when you can be a master,

522
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,998
when you can be a god?

523
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,169
We could be gods.

524
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:47,095
-All right.
-All right.

525
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,848
All right, we're synced up
with whatever the heck that thing is.

526
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,599
Finally, something we're both baffled by.

527
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,853
I'm kidding.
That, my friend, is a 75-KTSB,

528
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,313
<i>40,000 watt reverberating sound amplifier,</i>

529
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,690
designed to single out
the operating frequency

530
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,526
of every single Earth-2 being
on this planet,

531
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,862
which, when contained and magnified

532
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,656
by The Flash creating
a sound pressure wall around the city,

533
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:10,618
will render
all of us Earth-2 beings unconscious.

534
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,247
Hence, the safety precautions.

535
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,167
I'm baffled by it.

536
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,085
(CHUCKLES) Are we ready?

537
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,879
Yes, we are.

538
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,047
All right.

539
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,719
Here we go.

If I were interested
in forming an alliance with you two,

542
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,991
what's your plan, exactly?

543
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,870
We ambush Zoom at C.C.P.D.

544
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,041
With our three powers combined,
he'll be no match for us.

00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,753
Well, I like the sound of that.

00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,715
Great. Then let's go.

548
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,219
There's just one more thing.

did you?

554
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,822

created a breach and escaped.

00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,181
Listen, uh, I've been thinking
about Wally some more.

623
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,015
Are you gonna talk to him again?

624
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,227
-No, I'm not.
-Why not?

625
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,936
Because he's your son, Joe.

626
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,688
I know he's my son.

627
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:33,858
Look, no, what I mean is,
he's got your values.

628
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,111
He's got your inner drive
to help people do what's right.

629
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,906
We're supposed to think we're something
we're not until we become that thing.

630
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,158
That's the path that Wally's on.

631
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:47,872
I'm not gonna stop him from being the hero
that he's gonna become.

632
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,208
I really don't think you should, either.

633
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,087
I can't wait till you have kids
and they torture you.

634
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,006
-I'm gonna laugh in your face.
-(LAUGHS)

635
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,300
All right, gramps.

636
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,176
-Poppa.
-What?

637
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,304
My grandkid's gonna call me Poppa.

638
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,975
(LAUGHING) All right.

639
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,652
What in the world?

640
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,364
-What is this?
-CISCO: Blame Iris.

641
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,867
Okay, I just figured that since Henry
is officially back for good,

642
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,369
<i>we should celebrate.</i>

643
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,414
And since Zoom is gone
and the city is quiet right now.

644
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,667
I appreciate it, Iris. Thank you.

645
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,170
-Hi, Tina.
-DR. McGEE: <i>Hello, Henry.</i>

646
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,922
-Jesse. Hi.
-Hi.

647
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,927
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you, too.

648
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:45,555
-You look great.
-Thank you.

649
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,057
I hope you don't mind
that I invited Dr. McGee.

650
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,602
Seems like somebody's glad you did.

651
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,563
-Mmm-hmm.
-(CHUCKLES)

652
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:56,148
So, I guess you are invincible.

653
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,444
-Told you. The Speed Force is with us.
-Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

654
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,826
Since I'm feeling extra invincible lately,

655
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,621
what do you say you and I

656
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,500
give this a shot?

657
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,920
Yeah, I would like that.

658
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,302
So, is it true?

659
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,304
You saved The Flash's life?

660
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,808
Oh, I mean, I was just in the right place
at the right time.

661
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,436
Proud of you, Wally. You did good.

662
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:35,938
Thanks, Dad.

663
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,649
-(CHUCKLES)
-What?

664
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,985
Uh, I'm just... I'm proud of you, too.

665
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,695
-Soup's on.
-CISCO: <i>Hey!</i>

666
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,615
Taking out a city full of monsters
makes a man hungry.

667
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,700
First,

668
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,660
a toast.

669
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:53,122
-To family.
-ALL: To family.

670
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,166
That's my kind of toast, short and sweet,
let's eat.

671
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,335
(LAUGHING)

672
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,967
<i>Oh. You guys. Great.</i>

673
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,261
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

674
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,598
<i>It's Earth-2.</i>

675
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,736
Cisco, what, what is it?

676
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,572
What'd you see?

677
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,783
What do you mean, see?

678
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:30,368
Cisco gets visions.

679
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,327
-I don't understand.
-What, Cisco?

680
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,708
Earth-2 splitting in half,
straight down through the poles.

681
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,210
Tell me I didn't just vibe the future.

682
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,381
Please, tell me I did not just see
the end of the world.

683
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,851
Our story continues, Flash.

684
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,899
-DR. McGEE: <i>Henry!</i>
-Oh, my God!

685
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,411
Dad? Dad?

686
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,080
(GASPS)

687
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,209
It's poetic,
returning to your childhood home.

688
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,422
Jay, don't do this.

689
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,341
All right? I'm begging you.
I'm begging you!

690
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,844
-Take me. Kill me.
-No!

691
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,262
You still won't believe me
that you and I are the same.

692
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,431
Come on, come on.

693
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,099
Barry, look at me, son. Look at me.

694
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:37,810
So, I'm gonna have to make you believe me.

695
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:42,106
Whatever happens,
you have made me the happiest father.

696
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:43,398
-Dad.
-This time,

697
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,985
you're gonna watch your parent die,
just like I did.

698
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:47,945
-No! No!
<i>-And this is what's gonna make you</i>

699
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,822
just like me.

700
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,699
-Your mother and I love...
-Jay!

701
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,576
No!
