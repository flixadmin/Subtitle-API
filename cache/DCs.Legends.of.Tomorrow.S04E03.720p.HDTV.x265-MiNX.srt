1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,702
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:02,632
Hello.

3
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,703
Mallus wasn't the only
prisoner to escape.

4
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:07,385
And now there's magic.

5
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:09,054
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:11,012
An unknown number of
dangerous magical beings

7
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:12,591
got spat out across the timeline

8
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:13,993
and now must be sent to hell.

9
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:15,728
Going somewhere, Raymond?

10
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,304
You think it's Nora.

11
00:00:17,307 --> 00:00:19,505
And if the Time Bureau finds
her first, she's going to tell

12
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:22,085
them you're the one
who helped her escape.

13
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:32,978
Ma'am, your crown jewels are here.

14
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,115
There's absolutely no reason to worry.

15
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:38,651
All is in order.

16
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:40,552
Excellent.

17
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:45,157
I shall wear them out so my
people can adore their queen.

18
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,292
Yes, of course, ma'am.

19
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:51,864
Will you be waving from the
north balcony or the south?

20
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:56,201
I was thinking something
a little more intimate.

21

22
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:41,213
Wow. Red beans and rice
didn't miss Her Majesty.

23
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:42,390
Now I understand

24
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,216
how Mr. Mix-a-Lot got his knighthood.

25
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:45,726
- Ha ha.
- ♪ Sir, Sir ♪

26
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,629
Guys, guys, a little
professionalism, please.

27
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:48,854
What kind of ripple effect are we really

28
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:49,922
looking at here, Nate?

29
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:51,557
Okay. Right now, the queen

30
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,158
gets institutionalized,

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,060
the British monarchy fails,

32
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:57,896
and England descends into chaos.

33
00:01:57,898 --> 00:01:59,264
Anarchy in the UK.

34
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,934
Which is weird but... paranormal?

35
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,435
Well, something freaky

36
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:04,851
is definitely at the heart of this.

37
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:07,840
Our magic-tracking device
detected a massive spike.

38
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:09,875
All right, then we got a live one.

39
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:13,879
Punk rock London. Nate, you ready?

40
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:18,617
Um, well, Ava asked me to
stick around and help launch

41
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:20,219
the magic operations here.

42
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,426
We need to establish
procedure, protocols,

43
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:23,722
command structure.

44
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:26,291
So... desk job.

45
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:28,861
Nate Heywood, cubicle guy.

46
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:30,596
Sad little plant on his desk. Really?

47
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:32,197
It's prestigious, Sara.

48
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,099
And then when
everything's up and running

49
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:36,969
I come back to the Waverider.

50
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:38,537
Fine.

51
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:41,907
Cool kids are off to the Jolly Old.

52
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,980
Ha. This is very sleek.

53
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:49,874
Ah, handles all your messaging and data,

54
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:53,418
keeps accurate time in any
era, and counts your steps,

55
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,954
which, to me, is a little overrated...

56
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:57,824
And it also contains the air totem.

57
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:59,424
Thanks, Ray. I love it.

58
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:02,589
Well, you're actually the
one I should be thanking.

59
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:04,426
I feel like you're the
only one I can talk to

60
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:05,998
about this whole Nora thing.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,766
Secret's safe with me.

62
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:09,168
Doing bad things for good reasons

63
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,303
is practically our mission statement.

64
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:12,718
Even Amaya did it.

65
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:15,173
Yeah, but this is kind of complicated.

66
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:17,776
The others can handle complicated.

67
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:19,144
Maybe.

68
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:21,046
And then there were five.

69
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,710
Shorter bathroom lines.

70
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:25,450
Yeah, but no one to watch
Patrick Swayze movies with.

71
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:27,152
Nate will be back soon.

72
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:29,188
In the meantime, we need to go back

73
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,491
before the monarchy goes anarchy.

74
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:34,835
Never thought I'd get to meet the Queen.

75
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:36,295
Not gonna happen.

76
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:37,396
Too risky.

77
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:39,498
And besides, she's not the one

78
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,201
setting off Ray's magic-o-meter.

79
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:44,269
The Queen's favorite new band is...

80
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:45,938
The Smell.

81
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,073
"The Smell"?

82
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:50,008
Never heard of them, and
I know of every rubbish

83
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,632
punk band there is in London.

84
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:54,079
That's because they didn't
exist in this timeline.

85
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,280
Gideon?

86
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:56,948
The Queen's cheeky jig launched

87
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,417
The Smell's rise to stardom.

88
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,037
They were known as much for their music

89
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,913
as for a series of improbable
anti-establishment pranks.

90
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,582
All with a magical signature.

91
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,658
Okay, so we're looking
for someone in the band.

92
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,360
We could be dealing
with demonic possession,

93
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:10,429
mind control, illusion,

94
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:13,765
or maybe just the
run-of-the-mill royal dementia.

95
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,567
Hold on a minute.

96
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,468
There's your magic man right there.

97
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,772
Obsessed with riches, given to mischief.

98
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:23,208
That Irishman there is a leprechaun.

99
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,844
S-sorry. Are you being
serious or racist?

100
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:27,015
Both, love.

101
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:29,213
Why is the weasel running the show?

102
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:31,383
If you've got a problem
with me, pie-head,

103
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:32,885
why don't you just say?

104
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:34,222
I got a problem with you.

105
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:36,129
I'm running it, and I say

106
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,123
we need to get close to that band,

107
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,461
which shouldn't be a problem

108
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:41,519
because everybody left
on this ship is a punk.

109
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:42,861
Except for haircut.

110
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:45,197
He hasn't broken a rule in his life.

111
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,533
Yep. Not a single rule.

112
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:03,410
The Hole... Cradle of punk rock

113
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:05,784
and the stickiest floor
in the British Isles.

114
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,619
Sounds lovely. You kids have fun.

115
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:10,689
I'll have a bottle of hand
sanitizer when you come back.

116
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:27,039
Ah, you got to love that sound.

117
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,038
What?

118
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,366
The music... It's the dog's bollocks.

119
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:35,380
Sorry, I can't hear you
over the terrible music.

120
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:38,383
We're The Smell, and
you're a bunch of mingers.

121
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:41,420
And we'll be back when we feel like it.

122
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:43,172
All right, guys, here's our chance.

123
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,941
Somebody's got to slip backstage

124
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,325
and get in with the band.

125
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:47,546
Yeah, leave it to me.

126
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:49,594
I used to play here
with Mucous Membrane.

127
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:50,663
I know my way around.

128
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,480
And besides, you're all bloody Yanks.

129
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:54,099
- Not you.
- Why not?

130
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,467
I don't like him.

131
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,336
Always perfidious Albion, is it?

132
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:58,603
Never trust a Brit.

133
00:05:58,605 --> 00:05:59,757
Something like that.

134
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,639
Guys, really, we don't
have time for this.

135
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:03,842
Somehow Mister Rory here hasn't realized

136
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:05,444
that if he's going to play with fire,

137
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:07,512
he's going to get burned.

138
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:13,530
Don't.

139
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,314
Oi! You lot!

140
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:48,987
- Thanks for the lift, mate.
- Get us out of here!

141
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:51,522
Come on! Go! Let's go!

142
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,280
Oh, let me out, I'm gonna puke.

143
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,517
Don't let the suit fool
you. Our man's a punk.

144
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,858
He drove on the wrong side of
the road the whole way here.

145
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:15,156
- I did?
- Nice.

146
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:16,625
See you around, mate.

147
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:21,329
All right, Sara, I found their hideout.

148
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,732
Heading back to the Waverider.

149
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,501
No, Ray, you are our guy on the inside.

150
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:28,970
Look, loud music makes my nose bleed.

151
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:30,939
I am not a punk.

152
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,808
Well, you are now. You
stay with that band.

153
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,543
Ray? Ray, you there?

154
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:37,145
Ah, you're pressing the button too hard.

155
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:38,847
Oh, right, yeah, it's my first time.

156
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,326
Listen, mate, there's an old trick

157
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,947
for unmasking leprechauns.

158
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,185
You spill a bunch of grain
in front of them on the floor,

159
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:47,322
and they're compelled
to count every kernel.

160
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:49,891
Really? That sounds
bizarre. That's not true.

161
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:51,326
Is that true?

162
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,994
That's a stupid plan.

163
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:54,496
Have you got a better one, big man?

164
00:07:54,498 --> 00:07:55,964
I don't do magic tricks.

165
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:58,133
Oh, great, so the plan is no plan.

166
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:00,368
- Is that your idea?
- Enough! Both of you.

167
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,872
You know what? It is
1977 in London Town.

168
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm going to enjoy the sights.

169
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:07,509
Good luck with your magic problem.

170
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:10,779
Did you guys just
make Constantine leave?

171
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,134
We'll get back to you, Ray.

172
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:16,845
- Not your finest work, bud.
- He's gonna get us killed.

173
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,845
You just don't like guys with ties.

174
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,415
That's right. It's like a little flag

175
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,552
hanging from someone's
neck, saying, "I'm a liar."

176
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:25,056
Look, I'll have Zari
follow him, all right?

177
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:27,062
But in the meantime, you
and I need to help Ray

178
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:29,230
find this magical creature
so we can send it to hell

179
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:31,399
before this whole team falls apart.

180
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:37,338
- How's it going?
- Good

181
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,650
Great.

182
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:41,329
All right. This should be all of it.

183
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:43,912
These protocols were
developed by Rip and myself

184
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:45,150
over the last six years.

185
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:47,001
- I did the drawings.
- Thank you, Gary.

186
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,201
So your job is to
just update all of this

187
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:51,586
for our new magical fugitives, okay?

188
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:53,021
You got it, boss.

189
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:55,023
And as we say at the Time Bureau,

190
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:58,526
the adventure is in the details.

191
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:00,261
- Hmm.
- Have fun.

192
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,832
You okay?

193
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,822
Um, I'm good, I'm good.

194
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,902
It's just... I know you guys
do things differently here

195
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:10,197
I just didn't know it
was so protocol-centric.

196
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,411
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

197
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:13,347
Look, I know you're
used to zooming around

198
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,743
in a time machine with
all your best friends,

199
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:18,155
shooting from the hip
and saving history.

200
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,647
Always.

201
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,318
But you know, the Bureau
is not all protocols.

202
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,767
I'm listening.

203
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,902
Come with.

204
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:29,580
Buckle up Nate, it's Taco Monday.

205
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,174
- Instead of Taco Tuesday?
- Oh, we dare to defy.

206
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:33,843
- Whoa.
- Taco delivery.

207
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:35,662
Are you Mr. Green?

208
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:37,283
Oh. Name's Gary.

209
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,244
Mr. Green's in the
conservatory with the lead pipe.

210
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,600
Sorry. Bad joke.

211
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:47,242
No, that was great. Um, yeah.

212
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:50,979
My name's Mona, by the way,
just... kind of like Mona Lisa

213
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,981
without the Lisa, so it's just Mona.

214
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,616
Cool.

215
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:59,186
Time Bureau? Huh. Is
that what this place is?

216
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:00,588
You know, they just never tell us.

217
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,072
What's a Time Bureau?

218
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:05,913
Um, you know, like, daylight savings

219
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,482
and time zones and stuff like that?

220
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:08,717
We're in charge of that.

221
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,320
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

222
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:12,764
Oh, it's actually just one...

223
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,803
- Oh...
- One per person.

224
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,189
Okay. Bye.

225
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:19,673
Okay. Shh. Got it.

226
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:21,976
Yeah.

227
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:27,287
What, did we forget
something in the van?

228
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,259
No, I...

229
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:31,916
Seeing as I drove you
guys and you didn't pay me,

230
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,022
I thought maybe I could
hang out with you blokes.

231
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:37,792
Down with the monarchy, right?

232
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:39,627
I didn't catch your name.

233
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,130
Ray... ge.

234
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:43,338
Rayge?

235
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,533
Yep, Rayge... That's what they call me,

236
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:48,970
on account of all my various rages

237
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:50,839
against, um, the machine.

238
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:54,309
Well, I'd like to see some rage, Rayge.

239
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,411
I'm Charlie. Come on in.

240
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,549
Guys, do you remember our driver?

241
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:03,651
Well, he goes by the name Rayge,

242
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,253
because of his wicked rages.

243
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:07,455
Yeah? About what?

244
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:09,490
Oh...

245
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:11,860
Disco music, right?

246
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:13,252
The Queen, obviously.

247
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,797
Doing chores in a timely fashion.

248
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,264
We hate disco, too.

249
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:21,035
Yeah. Hate disco. Hate it.

250
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:23,004
I had to move from New
York just to get away

251
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:25,440
from tight trousers and platform shoes.

252
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:27,308
Do you know how hard
it is to walk in those?

253
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,017
Right, let's hear a rage, then.

254
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,619
Ah, go on.

255
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:33,313
Uh, at this hour? No, I
don't like to force them.

256
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:35,650
You know, I just let
them come naturally.

257
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,352
But it'll happen.

258
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:40,421
What about you guys? You
know? What makes you tick?

259
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:42,814
We're The Smell. We're a band.

260
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,197
What more is there to say.

261
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,166
Uh, we're a bit more than that, Declan.

262
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,952
We're a movement. We're
gonna shock the system.

263
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:50,339
Wake up all the drones.

264
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,111
Present company included.

265
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:55,068
Oh!

266
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:57,272
Sorry, the rice... Everywhere.

267
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:58,706
Sorry. You see that, Declan?

268
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,861
What?

269
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:02,376
The rice. The grains of
rice... they're everywhere.

270
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,976
Sorry if you feel the urge

271
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:06,478
to have to pick up every single piece.

272
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:09,728
Mate, are you trying the
leprechaun test on me?

273
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,048
Do you know how hurtful
you're being right now?

274
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:14,108
Deeply.

275
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:16,291
Declan's a bit touchy
about being ginger.

276
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:19,262
- You're all right, Rayge.
- Well, Rayge has got to leave.

277
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:21,962
We've got to plan Operation Mum's Bum.

278
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,259
Mum's Bum. Mum's Bum?

279
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:26,401
Hey, that sounds fun.
I could get into that.

280
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:28,002
Well, we could use a driver.

281
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:29,330
Can we trust him?

282
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,595
Well, there's only one way to find out.

283
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:37,044
So that's the big highlight?

284
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,747
Eating tacos one day
before the rest of America?

285
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:41,749
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

286
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:45,119
Oh, hey. There's a blip
on the magic-o-meter.

287
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:47,922
It's from the Pleistocene period.

288
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,924
Clear your schedule.

289
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:51,627
We've got a report to write.

290
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,961
Or... or... or...

291
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:56,720
Or we can handle this ourselves.

292
00:12:56,723 --> 00:12:57,932
Without approval?

293
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,306
That sounds dangerous.

294
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:02,532
You've got two, but I'm sort
of down to my last nipple.

295
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:05,244
Gary, Ava hired me to
optimize this department, okay?

296
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:08,543
And I can't do that waiting
three days for approval.

297
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:15,181
And we can be time bros.

298
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:16,550
What?

299
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:18,319
We can be time bros.

300
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:22,090
- Time bros?
- Yeah.

301
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,650
- Me and you?
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:24,910
Oh, but...

303
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:26,960
We can reheat your tacos later.

304
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:28,166
- Okay.
- Yeah.

305
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,964
- Yeah, let's go. Okay.
- This way.

306
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:41,931
Okay, here we are. Uh, where are we?

307
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:45,627
St. James's Park, next
to Buckingham Palace.

308
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,314
St. James's Park, you say.

309
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:48,783
All right, Ray, we're listening.

310
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:50,251
The Queen's royal corgis are taking

311
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:51,853
their afternoon constitutional.

312
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:53,650
You're gonna nab one
of those little yippers

313
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:56,002
And bring him back to us.

314
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:58,259
We're not gonna hurt the dog, are we?

315
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:00,400
No. We're gonna hurt the Queen.

316
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:02,130
She treats her dogs to beef Wellington

317
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,831
while poor people are starving.

318
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,533
It's time to expose her hypocrisy.

319
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:07,602
Okay, yeah. No problem. Dogs love me.

320
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:09,670
Yes, problem. They're the Queen's dogs.

321
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:11,103
They're gonna be guarded.

322
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:14,208
Question... will the
dogs be heavily guarded?

323
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,576
Well, that's your problem.

324
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:17,211
It's time to see how far you'll go.

325
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:20,048
If you got a rage stored
up, now's the time.

326
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,294
Ray, we can hear you gulping

327
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:34,595
through the comms.

328
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,264
Do we really have to do this?

329
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,266
I mean, we know that
Declan is not a leprechaun.

330
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,447
Well, your machine says
one of them is magical,

331
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,104
so our job is to find
'em and get it gone.

332
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,491
You're gonna have to do
this the old-fashioned way.

333
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:46,741
Corgi-napping?

334
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:49,777
Gaining their trust and betraying them.

335
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,780
We'll help you out with the corgis.

336
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:55,249
- QB or wet work?
- QB.

337
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:57,652
Ray, Rory is going to
walk you through this one.

338
00:14:57,654 --> 00:15:00,521
Easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy.

339
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:03,324
Oh, I see them.

340
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:06,080
Let's go, pups.

341
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,662
Up and at 'em, Sparky.

342
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:09,263
You see that bench in front of you?

343
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:11,103
- Yeah.
- Sit on it.

344
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:13,295
Okay.

345
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:14,902
All right, Ray.

346
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:16,470
I feel like I should do something,

347
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:18,252
like maybe a distraction.

348
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:19,940
Just wait.

349
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:21,609
This would go a lot faster

350
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:24,112
if you just do your thing, Gordon.

351
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,267
Can we just nick his van already?

352
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:49,303
- That's why we're here, innit?
- Give him a minute.

353
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:52,840
Mick, you were right. It's
just the dog walker now.

354
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:54,375
Go and ask for the corgi.

355
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,913
Ah, excuse me, sir.

356
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:01,150
I don't know if this is royal etiquette,

357
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:04,033
but, uh, if it may please the Crown...

358
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:08,189
May I borrow one of those corgis?

359
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,853
Just take him.

360
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:12,960
Oh. There are those famous
British manners I've heard of.

361
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:14,362
Thank you.

362
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,197
Good choice.

363
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,368
How long do you think the
poor lad is going to last

364
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:22,670
in the clink?

365
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:24,939
Blimey.

366
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:29,544
My word, that young
man stole a royal corgi.

367
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:34,015
He did it. He bloody did it.

368
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:36,050
Go on, roll up, Declan.

369
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,488
Go, go, go, go, go!

370
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:48,336
We start off the hour with an update

371
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,945
of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth's

372
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:51,703
beloved corgi, Sparky.

373
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,593
Reported missing earlier this afternoon,

374
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,654
he has finally been found behind bars

375
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:59,258
at the South West London
Animal Rescue for Dogs.

376
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,695
From the looks of it, the pooch

377
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:02,295
has fallen in with a bad crowd.

378
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:06,098
Well, at least someone
from Buckingham Palace

379
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,533
has glimpsed the real world.

380
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:10,670
Rayge, Rayge, Rayge!

381
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,339
To the table!

382
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:16,108
Oh! Snacks, I'm famished.

383
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,277
It'll only hurt for a minute, love.

384
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,586
- Hurt?
- A tattoo.

385
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,703
Yeah, we all have 'em.

386
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,080
Get 'em after our first prank.

387
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,749
It's a Smell tradition.

388
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,485
Once you get one,
you're one of us, mate.

389
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:30,456
Oh, that needle's
been sterilized, right?

390
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,226
See, Charlie, told ya. He's a narc.

391
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:35,595
No, he just doesn't get it.

392
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,997
This isn't a tattoo, it's a statement.

393
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:39,906
That ink says you won't swallow the crap

394
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:41,575
they force down our throats.

395
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:44,937
Sometimes you have to do
bad things for good reasons.

396
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,606
So what do you say?

397
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,674
You in?

398
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,109
Yeah.

399
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,944
I'm in.

400
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,614
- Give me the tattoo.
- Yeah.

401
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:59,151
Now that you're officially one of us,

402
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:01,578
the corgi was just for a laugh.

403
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,582
We're gonna make the Queen
hand over her precious jewels.

404
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:08,754
Yeah. Just one question... how?

405
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:13,031
Leave that part to
me. I'll work my magic.

406
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:27,046
Another pint?

407
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,617
- Yeah, I'd love one.
- You should probably have

408
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,716
something in your stomach with this one.

409
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,328
Aren't you kind looking after me?

410
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:36,022
I try my best.

411
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,618
Did he tell you he's a dark soul

412
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:40,892
cursed to walk the world alone?

413
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:42,862
Something like that.

414
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,563
I'll be right back.

415
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,666
Thanks, love.

416
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,423
How the bloody hell did you find me

417
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:52,237
up here in Liverpool, eh?

418
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,387
Sara had me install a
tracker in your comm.

419
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,929
Ah.

420
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:58,485
No one trusts old Johnny Boy.

421
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:01,313
Can't say I blame you lot.

422
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:04,784
Yeah, she had a hunch
your baser instincts

423
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:06,000
would pull you off mission.

424
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:08,242
Oh, she'd be the one to
bloody know, wouldn't she?

425
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,556
- Here you are, love.
- Thanks.

426
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,426
Just give me a shout
if you want a water.

427
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:14,894
Will do.

428
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:18,898
That brooding, anti-hero crap

429
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,100
must be a real panty dropper, huh?

430
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:22,735
You tell her you have four roommates

431
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:24,136
and sleep on the couch?

432
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:27,673
No, I didn't. She's my mum.

433
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:33,746
I'm really wishing I had
not said "panty dropper."

434
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,148
Yep.

435
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:42,722
Ah, feels so good to
be back in the field.

436
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:46,459
Feel that cold Pleistocene
breeze in our hair.

437
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,027
Only thing is I do feel a little naked

438
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,929
without a clever costume on.

439
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:52,832
Oh, I'm sort of off
of costumes right now.

440
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,735
Oh, because of your John Cos-play.

441
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,070
What's going on with you two anyway?

442
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,973
Well, he dropped me, which sucks.

443
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:02,975
I mean, you know.

444
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:04,710
Why would you say that?

445
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:06,712
Oh, there's no shame in it.

446
00:20:06,714 --> 00:20:09,961
You know, I just used to think
of you as Amaya's arm candy.

447
00:20:09,964 --> 00:20:11,078
So it's nice to know

448
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:13,711
you're more than just
the guy Amaya dumped.

449
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:16,200
She didn't dump me... we
broke up to save the timeline.

450
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:18,991
Yeah, Constantine let me down easy, too.

451
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:21,327
Said it was about the
balance of good and evil.

452
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,529
Wait, did she dump me?

453
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:25,164
Well, all I know is she started

454
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,489
a family with another guy real fast.

455
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,601
You tell me.

456
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,996
Oh, but hey, hey, you
get back out there.

457
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,834
Meet some new people.
Change up your scenery a bit.

458
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:34,974
Hide.

459
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:36,542
Yeah, hide if it heals
your heart better.

460
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:37,543
Shut up. Hide.

461
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,885
- Quitting time.
- No, shut that off.

462
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:46,955
You're gonna get us killed.

463
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:47,860
If we don't get back to the office,

464
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:49,395
Director Sharpe is going to kill us.

465
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:50,961
She hates overtime.

466
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:52,558
- You're kidding.
- No.

467
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:55,562
- On three.
- Yes.

468
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:57,262
- One, two...
- Two...

469
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:59,198
Three, go.

470
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,834
Gary, go!

471
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:12,111
Psst. It's me, Ray.

472
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:13,379
Look straight ahead.

473
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:14,913
Talk straight into your newspaper.

474
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,649
No one will suspect a thing.

475
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,051
What do you got on them?

476
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:23,823
Gilly loves monkeys,

477
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,858
Ian's first language was Yiddish,

478
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,686
and Declan, his nose
crinkles when he smiles,

479
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:28,496
it's actually pretty cute.

480
00:21:28,498 --> 00:21:29,789
I don't want to date them, Haircut.

481
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,749
Just tell me which one
of them I'll have to off.

482
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:37,788
Well, it appears that Charlie
is our mystery... or fugitive.

483
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,057
Good.

484
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,661
We'll nab her and send her to hell.

485
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:43,708
Hell? What?

486
00:21:43,711 --> 00:21:46,245
Look, all she is guilty
of is questionable hygiene,

487
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:49,288
playing bad music, and
pulling a couple pranks.

488
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,684
We started this mess. We
got to take care of it.

489
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,653
All right, well, just give me some time

490
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:56,922
to figure out what her powers
are before we move on her.

491
00:21:56,924 --> 00:22:00,259
You've got until the weasel gets back.

492
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:02,428
What the hell is that on your arm?

493
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,063
It's my tattoo.

494
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:06,365
It's a corgi with a mohawk.

495
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,367
You've lost it, Haircut.

496
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,870
You finally lost it.

497
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,638
It's Rayge, mate.

498
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:17,209
Were you and your mom close?

499
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,245
Just met her 20 minutes ago.

500
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:20,980
Died in childbirth.

501
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,617
Two for two. Sorry.

502
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:26,385
My dad used to call me "Killer."

503
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,454
Never let me forget what I did.

504
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:31,524
- Mm. Father of the year.
- Hmm.

505
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:35,461
Wouldn't guess that to
look at him, would you?

506
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:43,569
You didn't just happen to run
into your parents, did you?

507
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,905
I've ruined a lot of
lives, and that bastard

508
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:49,475
is just the first one
to call me out on it.

509
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:51,744
Listen, if want to wallow in self-pity,

510
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,480
the Waverider has got
a lot of rooms for that.

511
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:56,460
I'm partial to the kitchen myself.

512
00:22:56,463 --> 00:22:58,584
Oh, I'm not here to wallow, love.

513
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,185
I'm here to fix it.

514
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:02,960
Give him the old Manchester mangler.

515
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:05,891
- What?
- Back-alley vasectomy.

516
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:07,259
Back-alley vas...

517
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,162
No, John, you can't...

518
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:11,468
Oh, what happened?

519
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:13,965
Ball kick paradox... you can't
kick your own dad in the junk

520
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:15,935
because you'd erase
yourself from the timeline,

521
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:16,938
which means there would be no one

522
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,573
to kick your dad in the junk.

523
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:20,765
Bloody hell I can't.

524
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:26,530
Toss off, you legless wanker.

525
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,053
Tommy! Tommy, are you all right?

526
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,854
Get the hell out of my pub.

527
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:39,024
I never want to see your face again.

528
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:41,060
You won't.

529
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:46,632
Another cracking
Constantine family reunion.

530
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,740
Look, I get it.

531
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:57,319
There's a lot of things
I wish I could change.

532
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:59,645
But you can't mess with your past.

533
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,947
Time travel 101.

534
00:24:03,684 --> 00:24:07,152
Oh, it's not just my mum.

535
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,456
There are others I've hurt.

536
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:14,059
My past...

537
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:16,829
is coming for me.

538
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,263
What do you mean?

539
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,740
You know what? Forget it.

540
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:30,186
Ray will be needing us now, won't he?

541
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:37,311
Hello, punk friends.
Anyone seen Charlie?

542
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:39,132
We know what you've been up to.

543
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:41,801
You do? Of course you
do, I'm a terrible liar.

544
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:43,022
Shut it, Rayge.

545
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,657
If that is your real name.
Which I'm pretty sure it's not.

546
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,494
You said you left New York
to escape the disco scene.

547
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:50,429
Then explain this?

548
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,934
Mamma Mia.

549
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:02,913
"Mystery disco band
leaves the audience saying,

550
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:05,149
'Thank you for the music.'"

551
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:07,284
Can you even name a punk song?

552
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:09,086
Well... I...

553
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:12,347
I told you idiots we couldn't trust him.

554
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,325
- He's a narc.
- Yeah. Disco narc.

555
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:17,461
Look, can we just
talk about this calmly?

556
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:18,890
Calmly?

557
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:22,733
Is this Rayge chap ever
gonna have a rage or not?

558
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:24,801
I think we should glue
sequins all over him

559
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:27,012
and string him up like
a disco ball at the Roxy.

560
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:28,438
Shut it!

561
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,140
Listen to yourselves.

562
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,476
You lot sound like brainwashed pigs.

563
00:25:32,478 --> 00:25:35,379
So what, the bloke
fancies a bit of disco?

564
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:38,749
Gilly used to be a nun. Ian was a mime.

565
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:40,784
I've done a stint in the lockup.

566
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:42,853
Declan's not even Irish.

567
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,824
I thought it sounded more street.

568
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:51,295
We've all got a past. And
it is just that... a past.

569
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:53,282
I don't care who you were before.

570
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,952
Whoever you want to be
now... That's what matters.

571
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,441
Did you put butter in the
coffee machine again, Gary?

572
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:07,444
- Yes.
- Hey, Ava.

573
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:09,479
Oh, hey. Happy Tuesday.

574
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:10,686
How was your evening?

575
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:12,848
Actually, it was nice. What about you?

576
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,218
You ready to get back out there?

577
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,552
Gary told me you guys wrapped up

578
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:16,820
yesterday's mission without a hitch.

579
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,155
I am very impressed.

580
00:26:18,158 --> 00:26:19,790
I look forward to reading the report.

581
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,191
Good job.

582
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:24,527
We wrapped it up?

583
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,949
It wrapped itself up. The blip is gone.

584
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:29,233
What do you mean it's gone?

585
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:31,368
Don't overthink it, Nate. Take the win.

586
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,733
Oh, I got you something to commemorate

587
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:37,541
our first mission together as time bros.

588
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:39,943
It's an exotic plant to
spruce up your work space.

589
00:26:48,254 --> 00:26:49,653
Looks good.

590
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:52,286
Mixtape.

591
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:53,363
If you're gonna be in the band,

592
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:56,475
you should be able to at
least name one punk song.

593
00:26:56,478 --> 00:26:58,495
Cool. Thank you.

594
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:00,964
And thank you for earlier.

595
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:02,766
Oh, sometimes the others think

596
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:05,302
they're the damn punk police.

597
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:07,604
I have to tell you something.

598
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:09,373
My name is not really Rayge.

599
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:12,309
In fact, it's nothing anger-related.

600
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:15,312
It's just Ray.

601
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:17,748
- Just Ray?
- Yeah.

602
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,716
I like that.

603
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:23,620
So, Just Ray, what
happened to your old crew?

604
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:25,989
Well, Sara met a special someone,

605
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:27,585
and they're trying to make it work.

606
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:29,192
- Oh, that will kill a band.
- Mm.

607
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:33,397
My best friend, Nate, he has a desk job.

608
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,233
And, Amaya... Well, she's gone.

609
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:38,602
I actually really miss her.

610
00:27:38,604 --> 00:27:41,390
She was kind of our moral compass.

611
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,893
Helped us do the right thing

612
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:45,408
when it wasn't always
easy to do the right thing.

613
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:47,477
I never knew disco could get so barmy.

614
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:50,013
Well, I guess the way we did it,

615
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:52,686
yeah, it did get pretty barmy.

616
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:57,654
So, um, how long were you locked up?

617
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:03,627
Long enough to know I
ain't ever going back.

618
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:05,262
What happened?

619
00:28:05,264 --> 00:28:07,564
Small-minded people got scared.

620
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:12,469
Turned to law and order to
make themselves feel big.

621
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:16,673
Prison seems extreme for
a little bit of mischief.

622
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:19,609
I wasn't sent away for stealing corgis.

623
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:22,946
You sure you can handle
the truth, Just Ray"?

624
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:25,248
Yeah, try me.

625
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,522
Whoa.

626
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:39,796
This doesn't freak you out?

627
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:41,531
No.

628
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,832
Such rapid molecular
transformation is...

629
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:46,169
To quote an old friend... Astonishing.

630
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:49,940
How do you choose who to
be when you can be anybody?

631
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:52,843
Just saw this mug on a
toothpaste ad on the tube.

632
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:54,678
I liked her smile.

633
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,146
Huh.

634
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:59,950
Wow. Must be strange
to completely change.

635
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:02,953
It is. That's why I have to
hold tight to what I believe...

636
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:06,323
Strong drinks, loud music,
and screwing the system.

637
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:09,226
Otherwise I'd lose myself.

638
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:10,827
You're a pretty cool lady...

639
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:11,895
or man...

640
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:14,164
or whatever you want to be.

641
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,097
I wish the humans who
threw me in the slammer

642
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,335
felt that way.

643
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,970
They just saw a magical
creature and panicked.

644
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:22,739
I'm so sorry.

645
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,241
Oh, don't be.

646
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:26,743
You're one of the good ones, Just Ray.

647
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:32,849
Sara, I figured it out.

648
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:34,551
All right, Ray. What
are we dealing with?

649
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:36,147
She's a shapeshifter.

650
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,554
She doesn't kidnap the
Queen. She becomes the Queen.

651
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:39,702
I knew it.

652
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:41,190
You definitely said leprechaun.

653
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:42,694
So I have an idea.

654
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,328
What if I just ask her to
stop impersonating the Queen?

655
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,027
History goes back to the way it was,

656
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,665
and we don't have to send her to hell.

657
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,534
Ray, so far we've learned that unicorns

658
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:51,624
are homicidal maniacs

659
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:53,537
and fairy godmothers are psychopaths.

660
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:55,152
And they're supposed
to be the nice ones.

661
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:56,573
And these shapeshifting bastards...

662
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:57,944
They put the rest to shame.

663
00:29:57,947 --> 00:30:00,643
We're talking killing sprees,
world wars, you name it.

664
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,612
Yeah, but she's not doing any of that.

665
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,847
She's manipulating you.
Don't fall for it, mate.

666
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,083
Too late. He's got a tattoo.

667
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:10,082
Oh, please let it be a tramp stamp.

668
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:12,022
She's not hurting anyone.

669
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:14,458
Sit tight, Haircut. We'll work this out.

670
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,593
Thank you, Mick. Maybe we could...

671
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:18,428
He's in too deep.

672
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,960
For once I agree with you.

673
00:30:19,963 --> 00:30:22,801
Ray has no bloody idea
what he's dealing with.

674
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:24,394
Ray has been doing this a long time.

675
00:30:24,397 --> 00:30:25,444
He can handle himself.

676
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:27,941
Sara, if this thing gets
loose, there is no stopping it.

677
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:29,144
Trust me.

678
00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:30,307
Zari, what do you think?

679
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:34,044
Has the shapeshifter gotten to Ray?

680
00:30:34,046 --> 00:30:35,979
Yeah.

681
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:39,816
All right, then, squad save the Queen.

682
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:50,527
That's not the plan.

683
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:58,101
Do you trust me?

684
00:30:58,103 --> 00:30:59,669
Of course. You're my friend.

685
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:01,505
- We got to go.
- What? Why?

686
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:03,840
Because my friends don't trust me.

687
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:09,163
Ray? We just want to talk.

688
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,615
So your disco mates
think I'll come quietly.

689
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,550
Who are you really?

690
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:16,105
Look, Declan was right. I am a narc.

691
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,554
I'm a magic narc.

692
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:20,490
I was sent here to capture
you and take you in, but...

693
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:22,492
You ain't sending me back to prison.

694
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:23,827
I'm not gonna do it.

695
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:26,029
Haircut!

696
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:27,631
Then what are you gonna do?

697
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:32,469
You told me that you
wanted to shock people

698
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:33,970
and wake them up.

699
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:36,706
Well, that's what I'm
gonna do... to my own team.

700
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,909
You asked me who I really am?

701
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:42,178
I'm a punk.

702
00:31:47,786 --> 00:31:49,452
Come on, Ray, open the door.

703
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:51,021
Or we burn it down.

704
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,788
Ah. Lunch is here.

705
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,559
Yes.

706
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,095
Hey, I have an idea for you guys.

707
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,697
- Who guys?
- You guys. The Time Bureau.

708
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,332
Oh.

709
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:19,801
Sorry, uh, that was
supposed to be top secret.

710
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:22,471
Oh, no worries, because I was thinking,

711
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,749
you know how time zones go up and down?

712
00:32:24,752 --> 00:32:27,376
Well, what about sideways?

713
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,212
Sideways time zones. Huh? Like across?

714
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,180
So you wouldn't have to
change your clock when took...

715
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:35,517
A solo road trip across America!

716
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,220
- That's genius.
- Thanks!

717
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,487
What is happening?

718
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,724
Sorry I have to do this.

719
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:46,495
And have a nice day.

720
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:51,600
Okay, you got a sandwich.

721
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,369
I got a sandwich.

722
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:57,472
Pro tip... Bureau pays for
lunch so make sure you eat enough

723
00:32:57,474 --> 00:33:00,075
so you're not hungry
again until tomorrow.

724
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:02,644
You really do know
all the boring tricks.

725
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:07,983
I can see you're in a funk.
Is this still about Amaya?

726
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:10,666
Lay it on the Gar-Bear.
It's okay to cry.

727
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:12,054
In fact...

728
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,022
it's encouraged.

729
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,010
Gary, where did you get that plant?

730
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:20,862
It's from our first mission together.

731
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:23,732
I wanted it to have a
special meaning for us.

732
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:27,502
Gary?

733
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:29,638
Gary, it's magical.

734
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,273
It is?

735
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,082
Gary, stapler.

736
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:44,653
Today we ride! Hyah!

737
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:49,591
Well, no sign of Ray or
the creature, Captain.

738
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:52,294
Sara? Sara?

739
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,297
Hmm. Maybe you should have
put a tracker in her comm.

740
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:01,737
What the hell, Ray?

741
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,372
All right, come on.

742
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,546
Sara, Charlie decked me.

743
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:15,951
Oh, no.

744
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:20,488
No.

745
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,425
Sara? Sara?

746
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:24,793
Mick.

747
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,131
Oh, no.

748
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,673
Stop.

749
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,518
Don't hurt my friends.

750
00:34:39,521 --> 00:34:41,376
Your friends are drones.

751
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,478
No, they're better than that.

752
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,780
I'm not taking the chance.

753
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,015
No way I'm going back to prison.

754
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:48,354
Atom suit... disassemble.

755
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:50,519
Dr. Palmer voice authenticated.

756
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:07,526
- Guess you're a drone, too.
- That's enough.

757
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:08,937
Zari.

758
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:14,076
Great. Now let's send
this beast to hell.

759
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,377
Wait.

760
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,401
Hell? What the hell?

761
00:35:17,404 --> 00:35:18,761
Guys, come on, look...

762
00:35:18,764 --> 00:35:20,215
let's think about this, all right?

763
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:21,883
She is not evil.

764
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:24,752
She stole your suit and
tried to kill us, Ray.

765
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,354
That's the ballsiest thing
you've ever done, Haircut.

766
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:29,324
She's only doing what any
one of you would have done

767
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:30,346
if you were cornered.

768
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:32,468
We let her out, this is on us.

769
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,533
The portal is open, now
send the monster through.

770
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:41,588
I'll show you what a
real monster looks like.

771
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:42,970
Like this.

772
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:47,509
Like someone who'd
rather do what's easy...

773
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:50,579
than figure out what's right.

774
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,981
Someone who'd send an innocent to hell.

775
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:55,413
Don't fall for its bloody parlor tricks.

776
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:58,653
Ray said your team's
moral compass is missing.

777
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,823
Can you send her to hell?

778
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:06,962
Zari, you're too smart to
fall for this bloody creature.

779
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,096
Now send it through.

780
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,465
I can't keep the portal open forever.

781
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:18,440
No, I can't do it.

782
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:24,446
All right, we're gonna
figure this out on the ship.

783
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,814
Fine. But I'm not letting

784
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,583
a shapeshifter on the bloody ship.

785
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:35,689
What did you do to me, you ass?

786
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:38,493
It's a lobotomy of sorts.

787
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:41,463
Your shapeshifting days
are over, sweetheart.

788
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,998
No!

789
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,632
Come on, you cowards!

790
00:36:53,635 --> 00:36:55,977
Come on down here.

791
00:36:55,979 --> 00:36:57,879
We can't just leave her
locked in there forever.

792
00:36:57,881 --> 00:37:01,460
You are on thin ice in terms
of what we can and cannot do.

793
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:03,507
Those punks were a bad influence on you.

794
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:05,932
Oh, well, maybe you just
don't know as much about me

795
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:08,155
as you think you do.

796
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:11,360
You were an Eagle Scout,
former CEO of Palmer Tech.

797
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,495
Your favorite musical
is "Singing in the Rain."

798
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,335
You're allergic to cats and Grodd,

799
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:17,065
and you were knighted by Queen Guinevere

800
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,905
Sir Raymond of the Palms.

801
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:21,203
- Okay, so you know a lot.
- Yeah.

802
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:24,366
But you don't know that I was the man

803
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,075
who helped Nora Dark
escape the Time Bureau.

804
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,877
You what?

805
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,413
She's not going to
sleep with you, Haircut.

806
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,382
That is not why I did it.

807
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,687
I just believe she
can be a better person.

808
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,369
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she's
a terrible, horrible monster.

809
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:41,122
But I believe she should be
given the chance to find out.

810
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,792
Everyone else on this ship
has been given a second chance.

811
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,424
Why doesn't she get one?

812
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:47,863
Look, you better not be wrong about her.

813
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,799
But right now we need to
deal with our current captive.

814
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,570
She cannot stay on the ship.

815
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:54,487
Yeah, especially now with Amaya's face.

816
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,890
It's frickin' creepy.

817
00:37:55,893 --> 00:37:58,707
You broke her, you fix her, weasel.

818
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,809
Make her not Amaya again.

819
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,378
Spell doesn't work like that, Womble.

820
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,695
I took away her power to transform.

821
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:08,116
It's like clipping an angel's wings.

822
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,386
You can't exactly unclip them.

823
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:13,422
Whoo!

824
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,958
That was one surprisingly
strong little plant.

825
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,354
Surprisingly full of goo.

826
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:20,961
I like what you've done with the place.

827
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:24,599
Sort of a little
office of horrors theme.

828
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:27,201
Nate showed the plant
who's boss, Captain Lance.

829
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,178
Oh, yeah?

830
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,304
Although the plant did
get in a lot of punches.

831
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,573
Okay, Gar-Gar.

832
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,942
All right, let's leave a little
something to the imagination.

833
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,477
Speaking of, you should
probably change your shirt

834
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,432
before Ava gets back.

835
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:38,702
I can see where your nipple was.

836
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:46,820
And the handshake.

837
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:48,289
Aw.

838
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,792
You already found a new time bro.

839
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:52,369
He's growing on me.

840
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,705
Okay, but really, when are
you coming back to the ship?

841
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,768
There's a situation

842
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:57,893
that I could really use your input on.

843
00:38:57,896 --> 00:39:00,696
When I took this job at the Time Bureau,

844
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:02,702
I thought I was doing it for my dad

845
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:05,407
or even maybe a little bit for Ava.

846
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:09,711
But, um, the truth is, I was
trying to avoid the Waverider.

847
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:11,073
Why?

848
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:13,487
Because every room I
went into on that ship,

849
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,316
I was hoping she'd be there.

850
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,021
- Amaya.
- Yeah.

851
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:22,390
But I'm over it.

852
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:26,428
Amaya is no longer on the Waverider.

853
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,530
That's it.

854
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,566
I'm sorry, you wanted
to talk about something?

855
00:39:31,568 --> 00:39:35,336
Um, no, it can... it'll wait.

856
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:39,007
Maybe a little Bureau time
is exactly what you need.

857
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,176
So I think you should stay here...

858
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,205
because I like to watch you grow.

859
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,715
- Mm. Thank you, Sara.
- Yeah.

860
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,049
Hi.

861
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:50,685
Uh, wow.

862
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,057
So enough chitchat. Dinner? Drinks?

863
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,759
Should we just get straight to it?

864
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,261
Whoa, whoa, what did I say
about professional boundaries.

865
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:01,463
Sorry.

866
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,365
I mean, look at this place.

867
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,830
Can you please tell me...

868
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,570
How do you keep five
Legends on a leash at once?

869
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,010
Very loosely,

870
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:13,323
because sometimes we pull
you in the right direction.

871
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,081
Hey, you got a minute?

872
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:23,616
I just wanted to say... About the pub...

873
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:25,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

874
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:28,156
Listen, if you're here to have
some weepy, heart-to-heart,

875
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:30,125
end-of-the-mission hug
fest where you tell me

876
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,593
that my problems are your problems

877
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,394
and that happiness is
just one friend away

878
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:36,498
and all that bollocks,
don't bother, yeah?

879
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:40,969
Hey, you don't know me.

880
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,404
I wouldn't do that. That would be lame.

881
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,407
Yeah, it would.

882
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:48,643
So why are you here?

883
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:54,616
I wanted to give you
this surveillance photo

884
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,452
I took of you and your mom.

885
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:02,791
Thank you...

886
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:07,462
you know, for not
doing any of that stuff.

887
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,631
Yeah. Anytime.

888
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:27,448
I hate cops.

889
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,084
I am well aware of that, Mick.

890
00:41:30,086 --> 00:41:33,421
Well, today we nearly became cops.

891
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:35,557
Yeah, but we didn't.

892
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,476
No. Thanks to you, Rayge.

893
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:41,162
Aw. Thanks, Mick.

894
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:42,530
All right, are you two plonkers

895
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:44,332
just gonna stand there and stare at me,

896
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:46,768
or is one of you gonna
poor me a bloody pint?

897
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,994
- She definitely isn't Amaya.
- Ahh!

898
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:51,263
No.

899
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:52,625
But I do like her.

900
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:55,888
