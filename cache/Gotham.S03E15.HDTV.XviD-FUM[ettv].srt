1
00:00:00,944 --> 00:00:02,601
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:05,383
- Bruce Wayne?
- No.

3
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:06,609
But you could be.

4
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:10,409
They've done a wonderful
job erasing the scars.

5
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:12,146
- Are you prepared?
- Yes.

6
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:14,283
But I still don't understand
how I can help save Gotham.

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:16,080
You're only part of the plan.

8
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:18,450
You know what must happen

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,453
if he refuses.

10
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:21,589
No one refuses the Court.

11
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:23,758
- You lied to me.
- I didn't tell you the truth.

12
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,214
- It's the same thing.
- Perhaps.

13
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:26,737
But telling you your mother
was a con artist

14
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:28,233
who'd only sought you out
for the purposes of

15
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:31,655
getting money from me didn't seem like
a very attractive alternative.

16
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:35,703
I don't love you.

17
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:37,939
You need me, Edward Nygma!

18
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,874
Just as I need you.

19
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,475
You killed Isabella.

20
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,377
I loved her, Oswald.

21
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:09,737
Greetings, Professor.

22
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:11,706
Oh! Somebody help!

23
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,204
The building's empty.
No one's coming to help.

24
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:17,955
Have a seat.

25
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,782
Wh-Who are you?

26
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:24,319
That...

27
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:26,197
is an excellent question.

28
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:28,775
But I get to ask the first one.

29
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:34,262
I can fill a room or just one heart.

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,659
Others may have me,
but I cannot be shared.

31
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:37,917
What am I?!

32
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:40,083
What?

33
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,692
It's a riddle. Answer the riddle!

34
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:45,039
Uh... I...

35
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:46,107
Knowledge?

36
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:50,564
Knowledge can't be shared, Professor?

37
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,525
Really? You are the chair

38
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,298
of a chemistry department.

39
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,845
You've spent a career

40
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:58,920
sharing knowledge!

41
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,188
No!

42
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:07,995
I apologize.

43
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,634
I'm not myself these days.

44
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,739
Hands, please.

45
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:27,014
I can be a member of a group,
but I can never blend in.

46
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:29,420
- What am I?
- I... Uh...

47
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:30,918
A shadow?

48
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,439
The answer is an individual.

49
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,882
Duh! I expected more.

50
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:40,094
But then,

51
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:42,886
none of the others did very well either.

52
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:45,199
- The others?
- Oh, you'd know them.

53
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,975
One was an artist,

54
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:50,585
one was a writer,

55
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:53,850
one was a philosopher.

56
00:02:55,948 --> 00:03:01,256
The stars of Gotham's
intellectual and artistic...

57
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,082
constellation.

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,269
Fallen stars now.

59
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,808
Wh-Why are you doing this?

60
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:12,058
My best friend recently said

61
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:16,816
there was no me without him.

62
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:21,523
I shot him and dumped him in the river.

63
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:26,156
He was a sort of guide
to me on my journey.

64
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:29,771
You see, I know who I am, Professor.

65
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:33,975
It's how to... be him...

66
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,258
that is eluding me.

67
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,686
I seek guidance.

68
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,431
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

69
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:46,225
I'm with you from birth,
and I'll see you when you rot.

70
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:49,703
- What am I?!
- I don't know.

71
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,109
Well, that's just too bad.

72
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,054
No, no!

73
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:18,854

74
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:21,645
We'd gone to the movies.

75
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:24,807
My father wanted to cut through
the alley to get an uptown cab.

76
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:29,083
The man came out of nowhere.

77
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:31,858
His face was covered.

78
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:34,518
He had a gun.

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,166
I remember how cold it was.

80
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,510
I heard a cat.

81
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:42,787
He shot them both, and I did...

82
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,724
I did nothing.

83
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,299
Excellent, my dear.

84
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:53,757
You truly are Bruce Wayne.

85
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:04,936
Yes?

86
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:06,148
We're ready.

87
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,583
Then proceed.

88
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:08,751
I'll see you tomorrow.

89
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:12,760
And on your end,
I hope your nephew is amenable.

90
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:15,651
Should he refuse,
you know what must happen.

91
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,394
I know the rules, Kathryn.

92
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,247
We are to proceed.

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,893
Do the rest.

94
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,551
Alfred Pennyworth is my guardian.

95
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:37,364
He has been with me
since I can remember.

96
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:43,671
_

97
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:04,477
What did I tell you
about dripping on the couch?

98
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,609
You are the only person I know
who frets about

99
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:09,174
his drug-induced hallucination
making a mess.

100
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,987
But...

101
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:12,840
if it makes you happy.

102
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,075
Thank you.

103
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,010
I wonder how long you will be
the public face of grief

104
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,892
when people hear that
you killed your best friend.

105
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:26,503
And then there are your

106
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,659
extracurricular activities.

107
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:33,002
How many are we up to now?

108
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:35,207
Five? Six?

109
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:41,237
There was the curator,
the writer... pretentious ass.

110
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:42,737
So frustrating.

111
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:48,050
They all fit the profile...
High I.Q., driven, creative.

112
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,567
Yet each one failed.

113
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:55,347
You must be the first person in
history to go on a killing spree

114
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,050
in order to find a life coach.

115
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:58,928
Perhaps you should ditch the riddles.

116
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:00,759
No.

117
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,472
A good riddle reveals the asker.

118
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:05,817
To solve it is to solve the
mystery of the person posing it.

119
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:08,314
If I can find someone
to solve my riddles,

120
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:10,564
I can find someone to help me.

121
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:12,067
Do you really think
you're gonna find someone

122
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:13,473
who can teach you how to be a villain?

123
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:14,653
Yes!

124
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:16,279
Of course I am.

125
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,935
You said yourself there is no
Edward Nygma without the Penguin.

126
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:23,419
But knowing who I am...

127
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:26,638
and knowing how to be him...
those are separate things.

128
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,874
Ed, villains do not have teachers!

129
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:32,735
I made myself into the Penguin when
I threw Fish Mooney off a building.

130
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,102
I didn't have anyone's help.

131
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:37,712
Oh, how interesting.

132
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,626
Perhaps I'm thinking
about this all wrong.

133
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:42,592
Obviously.

134
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,423
I don't need a teacher.

135
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,025
I need an enemy.

136
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,682
- No, that is not...
- The greatest villains

137
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:51,807
have always been defined by
the men that try to stop them!

138
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:55,144
And I know the perfect man.

139
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:59,666
Please, do not say...

140
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,502
Jim Gordon.

141
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:06,455
A serial killer of smart people?

142
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:08,791
In the last few weeks,
six members of Gotham's

143
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:12,040
intellectual and artistic elite
have killed themselves

144
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:13,839
or died in strange accidents?

145
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,933
Last night, an old professor
of mine died in a lab fire.

146
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,941
At a certain point,
coincidence becomes pattern.

147
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:22,447
You getting bored
down in the lab, Lucius?

148
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:24,952
Yes, but that is not
why you should look at this.

149
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:27,810
Listen, we are still finding bodies

150
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:29,878
from Jerome's night
of murder and mayhem,

151
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:33,790
not to mention out looking for
our dear missing mayor.

152
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:38,298
I do not have the resources
to allocate to your hunch.

153
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:41,048
Did you hear how I used
that word "allocate," hmm?

154
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,257
Let me call Gordon.

155
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:45,527
No, no. The man's due R&R.

156
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:49,774
Besides, he's reconnecting with
some long-lost uncle or something.

157
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:52,975
Jim Gordon? Detective Jim Gordon?

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,672
Gordon ain't here.
So give me the message, fruit guy.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

167
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:18,438
One more time.

168
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:21,630
What the hell is this?

169
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:23,836
"Six masters passed."

170
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:25,776
That could be the six murders.

171
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:27,104
I told you...

172
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,638
Harvey, the killer's
sending Gordon a clue.

173
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:31,473
He's gonna kill again.

174
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,641
Okay, say you're right.

175
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,099
- Now, which way is up on this thing?
- Let me see that.

176
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:36,787
"A king, a queen and her corps..."

177
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:39,083
It's a drawing of the Knight's Tour.

178
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:40,449
Right.

179
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:43,085
So the target is...

180
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,708
Come on.

181
00:10:05,842 --> 00:10:06,909
Thanks for coming.

182
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:08,477
Like I had a choice?

183
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:10,283
Oh, you'll thank me.

184
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,775
This is gonna be electrifying.

185
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,161
Knight to Queen 3. Mate in two.

186
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:30,683
- Shh!
- Quiet, please.

187
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,720
Oh, honestly.

188
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:34,155
They call anyone a
grandmaster these days.

189
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:38,125
Can we discuss why you're doing this?

190
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:40,141
I've told you why.

191
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,273
The real reason.

192
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:49,072
See, Ed, the trouble with talking to
projections of your psyche...

193
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:51,486
and you of all people
should know this...

194
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,181
is that they know everything you know.

195
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,480
Including the things
you're trying not to know.

196
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:00,522
Gordon can't help you.

197
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:02,506
No one can.

198
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,233
Face the truth.

199
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:19,089
Excuse me, sir.

200
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:21,642
No Jim Gordon.

201
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:23,872
Well, then who solved...

202
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,308
All right, officers. Of course.

203
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,676
- How can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am,

204
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:29,744
we need to evacuate
the building immediately.

205
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:31,813
We're in the middle
of an important tournament.

206
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,048
Are you sure?

207
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:34,625
Maybe I was wrong.

208
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,649
Maybe this isn't the place.

209
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,682
Oh, how interesting.

210
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:42,257
Checkmate!

211
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:46,828
GCPD! Everybody out!

212
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,889
Don't move! Freeze!

213
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:52,246
Forget what I just said. Freeze.

214
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,308
Do not move.

215
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:58,171
Why am I here, Uncle Frank?

216
00:11:58,196 --> 00:11:59,496
Maybe you want to tell me

217
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:01,622
where the hell you've been
since I was a kid?

218
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:03,679
Or what happened between you and my dad?

219
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:05,512
Yes. Yes, I do.

220
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:09,101
But I need to know that you trust me.

221
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,954
You're family. Course I trust you.

222
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:16,324
Did you ever do something
you thought was right at the time,

223
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,747
but would now give your life to do over?

224
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,302
Yes.

225
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:25,183
Looking back, I've done too many
terrible things like that.

226
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:28,957
But the worst
was break from your father.

227
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,006
Keep talking.

228
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,907
I loved my brother Peter dearly.

229
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,343
And you're my brother's son.

230
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:38,494
I came back to Gotham
because of you, Jim.

231
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:41,816
I want to make things right between us.

232
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:46,354
So you shift your weight
to your front foot

233
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:47,555
as you swing your arm forward.

234
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:49,090
Just like chopping down a branch.

235
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:51,426
Like, so. Easy as pie.

236
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,762
Right, so, weight on the back foot.

237
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,328
Blade comes back evenly.

238
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:57,599
- Shh.
- And... What?

239
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,876
Precision under pressure
is everything, Master Bruce.

240
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:06,052
And a clear conscience.

241
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:09,878
Were you aiming for the window,
Master Bruce?

242
00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:10,979
You keep distracting me.

243
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:13,181
Well, you should be able to hit the
target regardless, shouldn't you?

244
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:15,853
I mean, you had rules about training,

245
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:18,053
rules which would be
impossible to stand by

246
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,826
if you remain unfocused.

247
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,373
Now, I sense there's something weighing

248
00:13:22,992 --> 00:13:24,553
on your mind.

249
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:26,596
Miss Kyle, perhaps?

250
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,363
I'm not unfocused because of Selina.

251
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:29,892
Oh, right. I see. Right.

252
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,804
So it wouldn't trouble you to
know that she dropped a note off

253
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:34,413
for you in the mailbox, then.

254
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,202
She asked to see you.

255
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:37,554
Tomorrow.

256
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,456
No.

257
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:46,286
Selina's been avoiding me for weeks.

258
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:49,068
It's gonna take more than a note
to have me running.

259
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,465
I got Alvarez and Campos looking

260
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,809
into the other egghead deaths.

261
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,167
Hopefully, something will kick up.

262
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:07,825
Or else we can sit around
and wait for him

263
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,270
to send us more singing fruit.

264
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,740
Maybe he has sent us a clue.

265
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:13,361
Oh.

266
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,619
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,182
You're late.

268
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,785
I expected this call seven minutes ago.

269
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:26,409
This is Lucius Fox of the GCPD.

270
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:28,587
I know who you are, Mr. Fox.

271
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:31,666
And by the way, it's bad manners
to intercept other people's mail.

272
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:33,895
You mean the telegram you sent Gordon.

273
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:35,835
He's not here. Who is this?

274
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:38,131
You don't actually expect me
to answer that, do you?

275
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:40,168
Then tell me why you killed
Professor Dyson and the others.

276
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:42,203
- I know it was you.
- I had no choice.

277
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:43,805
They failed my test.

278
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,664
Now it's your turn to try.

279
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:48,610
And if I don't accept the invitation?

280
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:51,446
There are lives at stake, Mr. Fox.

281
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:53,963
Not just your own. Now, listen closely.

282
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,190
Tomorrow, when the pawn's on queen,

283
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:58,623
you'll find my next target
in the belly of the beast.

284
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:01,865
Solve my clue, Mr. Fox,

285
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:05,979
and you'll be one step closer
to passing my test.

286
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,955
- When the pawn's on queen?
- Belly of the beast.

287
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:14,461
And I'll be one step closer

288
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,773
to introducing myself to Gotham.

289
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,636
Once and for all.

290
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,343
Close.

291
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:37,078
Better luck next time.

292
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,033
I missed on purpose.

293
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,715
Oh?

294
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,017
Wanted to make sure my gun works.

295
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,385
Oh, come on, Jim.

296
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:47,468
- What do you take me for?
- I have no idea.

297
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:50,023
You say you've done terrible
things, you bring me out here,

298
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:52,247
you promise me the truth,
and I'm still waiting.

299
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:55,795
If this is a trust-building
exercise, it's not working.

300
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:59,275
What happened between you and my father?

301
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,820
Have you ever heard the old Gotham
tales about the Court of Owls?

302
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:11,459
Pretend I haven't.

303
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,963
The Court is a secret society

304
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:17,593
that's controlled Gotham for centuries.

305
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:21,687
Started by its oldest, wealthiest,
most influential families.

306
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:23,204
The Court was once a mechanism

307
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:25,773
devoted to maintaining
balance in Gotham.

308
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,977
But time and power have corrupted them.

309
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,691
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

310
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,902
Your father and I were both members.

311
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:37,152
I still am a member.

312
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,025
Is that so?

313
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:45,927
The Court doesn't mean you any harm.

314
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:48,187
They have the highest regard for you.

315
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:50,732
In fact, they want you
to become a member.

316
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,672
Peters, we got a tip from a guy

317
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,109
who electrocuted a bunch of players
at a fancy chess tournament,

318
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:03,011
pointing us to a pawn on queens.

319
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,079
Now, here, you work at a
pawn shop on Queens Avenue.

320
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:07,389
Coincidence? No.

321
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,818
So? I don't know nothing about that.

322
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:11,676
Why are you so close to me?

323
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,855
Many interrogators employ the tactic

324
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:17,051
of invading someone's personal
space to destabilize them.

325
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:19,227
Do you feel destabilized, Mr. Peters?

326
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,473
Is this guy even a cop?

327
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:23,765
Hey! We can do this the
hard way or the easy way,

328
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,288
and I'm wearing my nicest suit.

329
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:27,502
- So I prefer the easy way.
- Hey, screw you.

330
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,471
All right. Lucius, hit him.

331
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:30,705
- What?
- What?

332
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:32,073
I'm wearing my nice suit.

333
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,373
We're disregarding
the latter half of the clue.

334
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,289
It said we'd find the target
in the belly of the beast.

335
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:38,913
Oh. If you want to do a cavity search

336
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:40,789
on this slob, go ahead, be my guest.

337
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,684
- Hey, you could just hit me.
- No one's hitting anyone.

338
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,095
I wasn't even supposed to work today.

339
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,128
I was covering for Teddy Thirio,
the owner's cousin.

340
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,623
Thirio?

341
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,625
That's the Greek word for beast.

342
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:53,990
You know, sometimes I think you
just make that stuff up. Come on.

343
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:01,232
What are you making?

344
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,459
- Shepherd's pie.
- Again?

345
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:07,131
Well, you're more than welcome
to take over the menu, Master Bruce.

346
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:08,307
Did I ever tell you

347
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:11,055
how I copped this recipe
from an old lady friend of mine?

348
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,247
Sylvia.

349
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:14,682
A memorable fling.

350
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,651
Ended badly, though.

351
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,987
Can't remember what we rowed
about, something idiotic.

352
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:21,189
It left me reeling, Master Bruce.

353
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:23,958
- I couldn't concentrate on my studies.
- Really?

354
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:25,893
You think telling me
a transparent anecdote

355
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:27,562
- will make me run to Selina?
- No, I don't.

356
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,697
You see, Sylvia and I, we got closure.

357
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,622
Now, it seems that
Miss Kyle has offered you

358
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:33,998
the same opportunity,
and I suggest that you...

359
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:35,605
you take it.

360
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,810
Fine.

361
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:46,334
If it'll get you to stop, I'll go.

362
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:49,538
I'll keep the pie warm
for you, Master Bruce.

363
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,710
Thirio's not in his apartment.

364
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:55,311
Have Campos put out a citywide BOLO.

365
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:58,828
I'm going to the academy
graduation. I have to, uh...

366
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:01,296
impart my wisdom on the new cadets.

367
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:02,430
How do I look?

368
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,166
Is this what Gordon deals with?

369
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:06,813
Thank you.

370
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:08,937
Have you seen my badge?

371
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:13,775
The Chess Killer. How terrifying.

372
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:16,578
How will anyone sleep knowing
the Chess Killer's on the loose?

373
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:18,479
It's just a name
dreamed up by some hack.

374
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:19,814
Today will change everything.

375
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:21,216
This is a mistake, what you're doing.

376
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:22,584
I don't recall asking you.

377
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,419
I showed you how to be Ed Nygma,

378
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:26,087
a man who could run the underworld

379
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:28,135
and operate in plain sight.

380
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:30,190
What you are planning is madness.

381
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,694
No. It's a way forward.

382
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:34,829
And the fact that it scares you

383
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:36,855
gives me all the confirmation I need.

384
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,499
Ed, you are not sleeping.

385
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:39,701
You are taking drugs.

386
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:42,136
You are having a conversation
with your dead friend.

387
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:44,220
Just admit that you are lost without me

388
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:46,165
or you will destroy everything!

389
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:47,978
I have to go.

390
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:53,481
What are you doing?

391
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:56,451
♪ He's fierce in my dreams ♪

392
00:19:56,518 --> 00:19:57,971
♪ Seizing my guts ♪

393
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,535
♪ He floats me with dread ♪

394
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:03,340
♪ Soaked in soul ♪

395
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:08,062
♪ He swims in my eyes by the bed ♪

396
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,106
♪ Pour myself over him ♪

397
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,996
♪ Moon spilling in ♪

398
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,739
♪ And I wake up ♪

399
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:20,368
♪ Alone ♪

400
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:21,976
Enough!

401
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:24,679
I admit that killing you
killed a part of me!

402
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:28,929
But I will find a way
forward no matter the cost.

403
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:31,719
I will be born anew!

404
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:33,788
And I will leave you behind.

405
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,223
Penguin saw you, Ed.

406
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,825
He was the only one. He made you!

407
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:41,829
There is no Ed Nygma
without the Penguin!

408
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:45,589
Meet Ted Thirio...
came in about an hour ago.

409
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:48,036
Cause of death seems to be
blunt force trauma to the head.

410
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:49,785
However, Mr. Thirio also has

411
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:51,886
a long incision along
the right side of his abdomen

412
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:53,808
that's been crudely stapled shut.

413
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:57,371
The Chess Killer promised a clue
inside the belly of the beast.

414
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,380
Think there might be
something in his stomach?

415
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:01,371
Okay.

416
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,318
You worked at Arkham Asylum.

417
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:07,755
Why would a killer engage
in this kind of cat and mouse?

418
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:10,814
Crazy or sane, at the core,
most people just want answers

419
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,193
to life's big questions.

420
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:13,853
"Will I ever be loved?"

421
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,063
"Who am I?"

422
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,829
Although most people try
to answer the question

423
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,532
in a logical fashion, while...

424
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,415
others...

425
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:24,626
Hmm.

426
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:27,826
Stuff Harvey Bullock's badge
inside a dead body.

427
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:29,097
What does that mean?

428
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:30,818
Means I know who the next target is.

429
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,287
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Uh...

430
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:35,049
Thank you, Doctor. Sorry.
I know. Thank you.

431
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:43,465
"As you take the badge today,
approach Gotham as you would...

432
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:46,561
"a cut of prime rib.

433
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:49,664
"Have a plan, don't be afraid,

434
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:53,134
and have plenty of antacids
on hand in case of indigestion."

435
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,774
What the hell are you doing here?

436
00:21:58,874 --> 00:22:01,680
Well, seeing as how your department

437
00:22:01,774 --> 00:22:03,844
is unable to locate our missing mayor,

438
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:06,547
I'm here to give the graduating class
a few remarks in his stead.

439
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:10,735
There's no way I'm letting a cop-killer
address those cadets.

440
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,016
I see.

441
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,609
How is the view from
the moral high ground, Harvey?

442
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:16,086
View's perfect.

443
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:17,453
Now get lost.

444
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:21,496
Oh, Lucius Fox.

445
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,786
Must be about me.

446
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:29,832
_

447
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:34,303
Want to play?

448
00:22:34,328 --> 00:22:36,263
Come on, you guys want to play?
You want to play?

449
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,222
Come on.

450
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,715
I'm looking for Selina Kyle!

451
00:22:45,856 --> 00:22:47,957
Oh, I remember you. Bruce Wayne.

452
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,262
- Listen, I don't want any trouble.
- You sure?

453
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:52,555
- How much cash you got?
- Get him, Sonny.

454
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,422
Stop!

455
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:57,313
Sonny, I said back off!

456
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:03,382
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

457
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:06,186
- Can we go somewhere?
- No.

458
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:08,994
I got to talk to Sonny.

459
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:10,580
We got business.

460
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:12,929
Oh.

461
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,598
Does that shock
your tender sensibilities?

462
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,094
- He's a thief.
- I'm a thief.

463
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,002
- You can't trust him.
- But I can trust you?

464
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,436
Look, I'm sorry.

465
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:22,995
I should've told you I suspected
your mother of lying.

466
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,942
- I was trying to protect you, Selina.
- I can protect myself.

467
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,876
Just go home, Bruce.

468
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:32,402
You don't belong here.

469
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,909
Why'd you ask me here
if were going to be this way?

470
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,282
What are you talking about?

471
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:42,859
The note you left in my mailbox.

472
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:46,124
I didn't leave any note.

473
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:50,402
Don't come looking for me again.

474
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,398
We'll talk later, Sonny.

475
00:23:57,315 --> 00:23:59,753
Too bad your girlfriend split.

476
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,846
I don't think she's my girlfriend.

477
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,807
Me neither.

478
00:24:08,854 --> 00:24:10,940
So about that money.

479
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,203
My turn.

480
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:21,086
Oh, poor Brucey.

481
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:24,367
Staying down there, boy, big boy?

482
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:25,635
Oh.

483
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:27,570
Oh, he's up. Big boy.

484
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,994
Hello, cadets.

485
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:51,096
My name is Edward Nygma.

486
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:54,041
Captain Bullock's... tied up.

487
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,034
What a day.

488
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,901
Eh?

489
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,862
You all look just dandy
in your uniforms.

490
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,024
How do I look?

491
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,645
I have one question for all of you:

492
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:13,281
Light as a feather,
yet no man can hold it long.

493
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:15,516
What am I?

494
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,027
Well, no future commissioners here.

495
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,162
The answer is...

496
00:25:35,723 --> 00:25:37,176
...your breath.

497
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:54,456
- Think that's for me.
- You Foxy?

498
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,913
Nygma.

499
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,430
Hello.

500
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:03,515
Only one person refers to me as Foxy.

501
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,735
I have gassed a room full of
folks with a deadly toxin.

502
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:09,484
I cordially invite you to come upstairs

503
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:11,578
and play a game with me
for the antidote.

504
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:13,859
This is game between me and you.

505
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:18,787
Come upstairs alone,
or the cadets and Bullock die.

506
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,617
I'm on my way.

507
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:28,662
Well, look who it is.

508
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:31,583
I'm so glad you decided to play.

509
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:32,866
Are you okay, Harvey?

510
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:35,138
Look at him.

511
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,230
He's fine.

512
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,529
I want to hear Harvey say he's okay.

513
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,410
Don't try and outsmart
this lunatic, Lucius!

514
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,712
Cadets' lives are at stake.

515
00:26:46,653 --> 00:26:48,457
Let's begin.

516
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:49,980
Wonderful.

517
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:52,118
I will give you three riddles.

518
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:56,100
For every riddle you get wrong,
I cut a rope.

519
00:26:56,162 --> 00:26:57,772
You get three wrong,

520
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,817
and this excuse for a higher primate

521
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:01,806
and the antidote

522
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,610
around his neck...

523
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:07,534
...fall over the ledge.

524
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:11,786
Wow.

525
00:27:12,356 --> 00:27:13,890
Am I clear?

526
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:15,442
And if I get them right?

527
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:17,467
Everyone lives!

528
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:20,522
Even if you get just one.

529
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,630
Can't say fairer than that.

530
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:25,919
Okay.

531
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:29,115
Wonderful.

532
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:30,708
First riddle.

533
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:33,967
I can fill a room or just one heart.

534
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:36,834
Others can have me, but I can't be shared.

535
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:38,771
What am I?

536
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,070
The answer's love.

537
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:43,503
What?

538
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:45,103
No.

539
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:47,255
No!

540
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:51,211
The... the answer is loneliness!

541
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,346
How do you not know that?!

542
00:27:53,414 --> 00:27:54,548
No, no, no.

543
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:57,597
No, Nygma. No, no! Oh, God!

544
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:06,198
Ask me another.

545
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,358
Okay. Second riddle.

546
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:11,615
I can be a member of a group,
but can never blend in.

547
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:13,505
What am I?

548
00:28:16,143 --> 00:28:17,392
A snowflake.

549
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:19,345
A sn...

550
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:20,827
No!

551
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:22,822
No! No!

552
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:25,642
The answer is an individual!

553
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:27,103
Wait!

554
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,900
Snowflake is also a suitable answer.

555
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:32,274
No two are alike,
making them by definition

556
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:34,943
individuals... therefore an answer

557
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:36,278
befitting your riddle.

558
00:28:36,353 --> 00:28:40,293
Okay. I don't think you grasp
how this works.

559
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,613
You have to give my answer.

560
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:50,811
Oh, Mama! I'm sorry! Oh, God!

561
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,500
Oswald was right.

562
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:56,708
He's the only one...

563
00:28:58,157 --> 00:28:59,729
No!

564
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,541
It's just you.

565
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:05,044
You aren't a good enough enemy!

566
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:09,893
No. No.

567
00:29:11,572 --> 00:29:14,158
No. Three riddles.

568
00:29:14,228 --> 00:29:16,556
Three answers. Those are the rules, Ed.

569
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,932
Okay. Final riddle.

570
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:21,831
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

571
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:24,967
I'm with you from birth,
and I'll see you rot.

572
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:26,193
What am I?

573
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,850
What did you do, Ed?

574
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:30,248
What did you...

575
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:32,264
What happened to Penguin?

576
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:37,213
Something happened, didn't it?

577
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,384
Did you kill him?

578
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:46,222
This is not gonna be good.
This is not gonna be good.

579
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:48,950
- You did, didn't you?
- I feel your every thought...

580
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,217
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

581
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:55,826
I'm with you from birth,
and I'll see you rot.

582
00:29:55,951 --> 00:29:57,404
What am I?!

583
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,369
A reflection.

584
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:03,667
Why does it always
have to be three answers?!

585
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:05,941
Why can't he get four?! Come on!

586
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,416
Correct.

587
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:13,642
Oops.

588
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:24,660
Thanks, buddy.

589
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:26,462
I never doubted you.

590
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:53,689
You.

591
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:56,237
What are you doing here?

592
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:59,328
It's good to see you, too.

593
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:01,747
How'd things go with Selina?

594
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,426
How did you...?

595
00:31:06,474 --> 00:31:07,859
You sent that note.

596
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:14,532
And you're dressed like me.

597
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:16,678
- Even your hair.
- Yes.

598
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:19,328
Like looking into a mirror.

599
00:31:21,728 --> 00:31:23,863
Powerful knockout drug.

600
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:31,927
Why?

601
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:35,464
This... is what I was made for.

602
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:46,102
To be Bruce Wayne.

603
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:54,360
How could you, how could my father

604
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:56,446
have been a part of this?

605
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:58,341
We were proud to join.

606
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:00,901
We thought we were gonna do good.

607
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,604
The Court lied to us.

608
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,772
Or we lied to ourselves. I don't know.

609
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:08,208
And now?

610
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:09,976
You're still a loyal member?

611
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:11,411
They think so.

612
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:14,739
I was a true believer. God help me.

613
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:18,568
I despise them with
every bone in my body.

614
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:20,854
What changed your mind?

615
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:22,022
Your father

616
00:32:22,264 --> 00:32:23,824
saw through their lies.

617
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,607
I didn't listen to him
until it was too late.

618
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:28,740
When was too late?

619
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,216
When they killed him.

620
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:32,332
No.

621
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:34,507
No, I was there.

622
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:37,137
It was an accident, a drunk driver.

623
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,172
Just looked that way.

624
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,875
I was there! I was in the wreck.

625
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:43,210
I watched him die.

626
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:45,579
Car wrecks like that are
simple business for the Court.

627
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:49,216
My brother was making trouble,
and they killed him.

628
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:50,984
As sure as I'm standing here now.

629
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,099
Now?!

630
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:56,690
Some 20 odd years later,
and you come and you tell me

631
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:58,859
this crazy story.
Where the hell have you been?!

632
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:00,994
Where were you when
my mom and I needed you?

633
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,499
I'm truly sorry I wasn't
there for you, Jim.

634
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,585
I had no choice.

635
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:08,702
The Court sent me overseas.
I had to prove my loyalty.

636
00:33:09,202 --> 00:33:11,238
Why would you prove
your loyalty to a group

637
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:12,706
that murdered your own brother?

638
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,108
I knew they'd kill me if I didn't obey.

639
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:16,955
I chose to live.

640
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,012
Until now.

641
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,280
Why now?

642
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:22,676
Because now you've been
asked to join the Court.

643
00:33:22,762 --> 00:33:24,567
Now I'm not alone.

644
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:27,333
Now...

645
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:30,524
you can help me destroy
them from within.

646
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:33,160
Others have tried and failed,

647
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:36,939
but with you and I working
together inside the Court,

648
00:33:37,072 --> 00:33:38,884
we could bring the rule
of democracy and law

649
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,934
- back to Gotham.
- Why should I trust you?

650
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:42,235
Why should I believe you?

651
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,577
Because we're family?

652
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,975
You have to believe in something.

653
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:53,513
And while all
the cadets survived the attack,

654
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:54,948
police say the culprit,

655
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:58,306
former mayoral chief of staff
Edward Nygma, remains at large.

656
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,986
Be on the lookout for a green suit.

657
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:02,355
- That's right...
- Good evening, Alfred.

658
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:04,624
And to you, Master Bruce.

659
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:06,674
Well, you seem remarkably chipper.

660
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:08,524
Things went well with
Ms. Kyle, I take it?

661
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,470
Selina's Selina.

662
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:11,720
Ah, say no more.

663
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:14,252
You spoke. That's all
that matters. Isn't it?

664
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:17,137
You up for some shepherd's pie, then?

665
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,647
Sounds delicious.

666
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:22,029
Right. Jolly good.

667
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:23,756
I'll be a mo.

668
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:33,386
Team, spread out.

669
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:35,480
Lock down egress.

670
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,471
- We're all clear.
- Clear.

671
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,899
Now upstairs.

672
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:43,284
We're clear.

673
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,337
Captain, all clear.

674
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:49,993
I know.

675
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:52,133
He's not here.

676
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,854
Hello, Foxy.

677
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:28,858
So, the antidote around Bullock's neck,

678
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:31,117
that turned out to be grape juice.

679
00:35:31,211 --> 00:35:35,914
And the deadly toxin:
plain old knockout gas.

680
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:37,532
Why the charade?

681
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:40,319
Well, the point wasn't
to kill a bunch of cops.

682
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:43,835
The point was to have you play my game.

683
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:45,407
But you killed Penguin,

684
00:35:45,474 --> 00:35:47,852
and you killed Professor Dyson
and the others.

685
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:49,602
Why?

686
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:53,672
Have you always been Foxy, Foxy?

687
00:35:54,517 --> 00:35:56,455
I'm not sure what you mean.

688
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:00,448
All my life...

689
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:05,424
I felt like there was
someone inside of me,

690
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:08,396
someone stronger and...

691
00:36:08,562 --> 00:36:10,562
and smarter.

692
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,034
Someone that people would fear.

693
00:36:13,102 --> 00:36:14,436
No one else saw that.

694
00:36:14,503 --> 00:36:15,937
Except Penguin?

695
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:21,509
- Except Oswald.
- So, why did you kill him?

696
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:24,392
Because Oswald killed the woman I loved.

697
00:36:25,415 --> 00:36:28,983
And with Oswald gone, is that
the role I'm meant to fill?

698
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:31,961
- To be your reflection?
- No.

699
00:36:32,254 --> 00:36:34,656
Because I know who I am.

700
00:36:35,203 --> 00:36:38,460
I know how to be him.

701
00:36:41,912 --> 00:36:43,904
And you helped that.

702
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:45,233
So thank you.

703
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,089
Ed.

704
00:36:51,173 --> 00:36:53,107
You killed six people.

705
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,945
- Mm-hmm.
- Seven, including Penguin.

706
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,072
You just announced to the entire city
that you are a villain and a murderer.

707
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:01,883
Mm-hmm.

708
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:03,309
Ed,

709
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:07,062
if there is any part of
your mind that is not insane,

710
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:08,957
listen to me.

711
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,327
You need help.

712
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:14,734
Turn yourself in.

713
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,154
My actions seem...

714
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:23,061
mad to you?

715
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,529
To anyone.

716
00:37:29,178 --> 00:37:30,434
I...

717
00:37:34,149 --> 00:37:36,044
I just...

718
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,621
killed the best friend
that I have ever had.

719
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:45,827
My search for a teacher or an enemy...

720
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:51,165
...that was just me trying to hold
onto him for a little bit longer.

721
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:54,572
But now I know who I am...

722
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:58,039
without him.

723
00:37:58,213 --> 00:37:59,641
So, who are you now?

724
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:02,733
Oh, come on, Foxy.

725
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:08,147
I'm the Riddler.

726
00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:36,565
I've always loved the view from here.

727
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:39,914
Not really a fan. You understand why.

728
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:47,233
I want you to know that our friendship
meant something to me.

729
00:38:49,522 --> 00:38:52,927
I cared about you, and I miss you.

730
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:57,789
Gee, almost makes up for being dead.

731
00:38:57,922 --> 00:39:01,583
You do know the entire
GCPD is hunting you?

732
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,208
Yes.

733
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,196
Well, not to burst your bubble,

734
00:39:06,267 --> 00:39:09,946
but wanted or not,
no one is going to be afraid of

735
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,845
the Riddler.

736
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,850
Maybe not yet, but they will be.

737
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:54,642
Good-bye, Oswald.

738
00:40:16,245 --> 00:40:17,745
Well...

739
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,610
look who's alive.

740
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:24,725
Who are you?

741
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:26,654
Ivy Pepper. Are you stupid?

742
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:30,892
Do we know each other?

743
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,729
I pulled you out of the river.

744
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,237
Been nursing you for weeks.

745
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:36,864
So boring.

746
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:38,366
You sleep a lot.

747
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:44,839
You look strange,
like you're gonna puke.

748
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:46,572
Are you okay?

749
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:55,293
I just remembered...

750
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:58,326
there's someone I need to kill.

751
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:10,164
Uncle Frank?

752
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:31,014
_

753
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:38,139
- How did he take it?
- His interest is piqued,

754
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:40,520
but convincing him will take some time.

755
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,614
We don't have time.

756
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:45,528
I won't let you down, Kathryn.

757
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:47,942
I assume things went
smoothly on your end?

758
00:41:48,169 --> 00:41:50,271
The clone is in place.

759
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:53,304
What about Bruce Wayne?

760
00:41:55,361 --> 00:41:58,046
He should be waking up as we speak.

761
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,440
