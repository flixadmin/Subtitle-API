1
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,651
Longing.

2
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:14,575
Rusted.

3
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,323
Seventeen.

4
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:17,699
Daybreak.

5
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,194
Furnace.

6
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,325
Nine.

7
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,497
Benign.

8
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,327
Homecoming.

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,373
One.

10
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,382
Freight car.

11
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,008
Good morning, Soldier.

12
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,811
Ready to comply.

13
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,563
I have a mission for you.

14
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,063
Sanction and extract.

15
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,270
No witnesses.

16
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,655
Well done, Soldier.

17
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,649
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,

18
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,272
you're getting quite good at it.

19
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,446
I'm happy, Father.

20
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,204
Thank you.

21
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,073
Thank you.

22
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,310

00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:34,963
I have your breakfast.

27
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,798
I could smell it before I opened the door.

28
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,850
Side of bacon and black coffee.

29
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,509
Again.

30
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:47,061
I can make you something different, if you like.

31
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,941
This is wonderful.

32
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,355
I will just put this on your...

33
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:51,099
It's okay, I can manage.

34
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,626
Suspect has broken containment.

35
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:52,052
He's headed down the east stairwell.

36
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,737
Longing.

37
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:36,619
Rusted.

38
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,448
Seventeen.

39
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:45,711
Daybreak.

40
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:52,885

41
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:56,841
Nine.

42
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,227
Benign.

43
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,267
Homecoming.

44
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:07,893
One.

45
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,445
Freight car.

46
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,163
Soldier?

47
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,376
Ready to comply.

48
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:39,517
James Barnes the suspect 
in the UN Vienna bombing...

49
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,154
...escaped custody today.

50
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,362
...also missing Avenger 
Captain Steve Rogers...

51

52
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,383
It hurts!

53
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,175
Good work.

54
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,225
Get me out of here.

55
01:45:45,715 --> 01:45:47,422
This is room 201.

56
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:50,420
Bacon and black coffee again today?

57
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:53,298
You know me so well.

58
01:45:54,932 --> 01:45:56,764
Hello? Your breakfast is here.

59
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:58,758
May I let myself in?
