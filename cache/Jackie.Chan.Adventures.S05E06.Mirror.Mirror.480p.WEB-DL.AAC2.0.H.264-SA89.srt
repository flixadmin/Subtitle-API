1
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,040
Uncle:
Ah, the city of fengdu,

2
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:10,376
uncle's hometown.

3
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,344
Uncle cannot believe

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,547
this is last time
he will ever see it.

5
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,116
Jackie:
Oh, that must mark

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,118
how high the flood waters
will rise

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,619
when the new dam
is finished.

8
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,055
Tohru:
- Everything will be submerged?

9
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,494
Uncle: The original birthplace
of the chan family,

10
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,863
gone forever.

11
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,298
That is why
uncle needed to come,

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,435
and that is why the two of you
needed to join me.

13
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:39,304
(Music playing)

14
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,472
Jade: Hey!

15
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,408
Uncle: Turn off racket
and listen to uncle!

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,843
This is your history.

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,112
Jade: Yeah, ancient history.
Give it back!

18
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,782
Uncle:
You are stubborn as mule!

19
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:52,885
Jade: I am not stubborn!
I'm independent!

20
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,086
Uncle: Oh!

21
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,588
Jade: Now what am I
supposed to listen to?

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,957
Uncle: How about uncle?

23
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,326
Tohru:
<i>Sensei,</i> what is that?

24
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,396
Uncle: Ai-yah!

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,231
Mingshan temple.

26
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,599
Dark magic.

27
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,436
Legendary home
to ancient mirror spirits--

28
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:11,770
evil tricksters

29
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:16,108
who make your worst fears
about yourself come true.

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,445
Jade: Big deal.
I'm spending my vacation here.

31
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,647
My worst fear
has <i> already</i> come true.

32
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:23,816
Spirits: Help!

33
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:26,185
Help!

34
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:28,053
Help!

35
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,456
Spirit #1:
Help! Somebody!

36
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,192
Spirit #2:
We're starving! We need light!

37
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,593
Spirit #3: Release us now!

38
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,528
Lead spirit: Quiet, fools!

39
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,098
Spirit #3: How else
are we supposed to get
a human's attention?

40
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,301
We need physical hosts to
escape this mirror, remember?

41
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,736
Spirit #2: Yeah,
- and we'll be underwater soon.

42
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,271
Spirit #1: And I can't swim.

43
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,606
Lead spirit: Patience.

44
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,008
I sense that
- the means of our freedom

45
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,611
are drawing very near.

46
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,680
(Spirits laugh)

47
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,186
Uncle: House was here.
School was here.

48
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:37,322
Best place for noodle
in city was here.

49
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:42,227
So, what do you think
of uncle's old
stomping grounds?

50
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,264
Jade: Tch. Looks more
like it was stomped
<i>into</i> the ground.

51
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,837
Jackie: Uncle, I read
that most of fengdu's
sacred buildings

52
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,805
were moved
to higher ground.

53
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,941
Why did they leave
the mingshan temple here?

54
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,377
Uncle: Nothing sacred
about mingshan.

55
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,814
Even small children were
taught never to go inside.

56
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,351
Imprisoned mirror spirits
are very crafty--

57
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,187
will take over your body

58
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,024
and make your worst fears
a reality.

59
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,726
Jade: Sounds like one of
those urban legend things

60
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,995
they tell kids
to make them behave.

61
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:21,033
Uncle: In uncle's day,
children behave regardless...

62
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,835
Unlike now.

63
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,037
Jade: Hrmph.

64
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,405
Jackie: Uh...

65
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,473
Perhaps we should
visit the temple anyway.

66
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,910
There may be artifacts
inside worth preserving.

67
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:35,314
Uncle: Thank you,
big-headed know-it-all,
for your input,

68
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,349
but I think uncle knows more

69
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,886
about mingshan temple
than you.

70
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:45,224
Some things are better left
at the bottom of the river.

71
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,359
Now, as I was saying,

72
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,695
third cousin once-removed
house was there.

73
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:53,932
He still owes uncle money.

74
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,904
Spirits: Help!

75
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,939
Help!

76
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,477
Jackie: Tohru, do you think
uncle is right?

77
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,512
Am I a big-headed know-it-all?

78
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,147
Jade?

79
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,349
Jade: Hello?

80
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,683
Spirits: Help!

81
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,118
Jade: Who's there?

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,253
Spirits: Help!

83
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,122
Help!

84
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,257
Tohru: Jade!

85
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,392
Jackie: Where are you?

86
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,264
Uncle: Touch nothing!

87
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,933
Were uncle's lips not moving?

88
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:31,870
Did words about temple
not come out of uncle's mouth?

89
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,474
Why no one ever listen
to uncle?

90
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,343
Jackie:
- Uhh. We weren't ignoring you,

91
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,078
but we have to find Jade.

92
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,747
Perhaps we should split up--

93
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,916
unless you think
I'm being a know-it-all again.

94
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,820
Uncle:
- Touch nothing else, big head.

95
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,824
Spirits: Help!

96
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,826
Help!

97
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,596
Jade: Uh, someone in here?

98
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,431
Spirit #1: This way!

99
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,533
Spirit #2: That's right!

100
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,834
Lead spirit: You!

101
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,837
Yes, you, young lady.

102
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,373
Over here.

103
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,210
Jade:
Whoa! Uncle wasn't kidding.

104
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,579
You guys are
- the evil mirror spirits.

105
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,049
Spirit #3:
- Evil? We're not evil.

106
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,417
(Jade gasps)

107
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,986
Lead spirit:
- No, don't! Wait! Please!

108
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,522
We are not evil, little one.
We're good--

109
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:27,526
good spirits
unjustly trapped
for centuries,

110
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,762
waiting for someone
brave and kind enough

111
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:34,399
to smash this prison
and set us free.

112
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,201
Jade:
That's not what I heard.

113
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,269
Spirit #3: Lies!

114
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,570
Spirit #2: You heard wrong!

115
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,771
Spirit #1: I couldn't hear.
What'd she hear?

116
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:43,408
Lead spirit:
I assure you, we mean no harm.

117
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,412
Our only purpose
is to Grant wishes.

118
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,814
Jade: Yeah, right.

119
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,549
Lead spirit:
Well, if you're going to be

120
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,584
a stubborn mule
about it...

121
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,254
Spirits: Stubborn mule!
Stubborn mule! Stubborn mule!

122
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,556
Jade: Stop it!

123
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,757
Tohru: Jade!

124
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,360
Jade: What?

125
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,562
Tohru: Uncle warned you
not to come inside the temple.

126
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,896
It's too dangerous.

127
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,698
Jade: Like I haven't seen
danger before.

128
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,767
Stop being so over-protective.

129
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,702
You're starting to act
like your mom.

130
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,704
Tohru:
I am not like my mother.

131
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,207
Spirit #1:
Just like your mother!

132
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,508
Spirit #2: Who's your mommy?

133
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,043
Spirit #3: Mother, may I?

134
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,478
(Tohru shudders)

135
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,146
Spirits: Light!

136
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,051
Jade:
We can't let the mirror break!

137
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,487
The spirits will get out!

138
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,524
(Jade gasps)

139
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:33,725
Tohru: Look out!

140
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,137
Uncle: Aah!

141
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,645
Uncle: Dark magic!

142
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,348
Why does uncle bother
speaking?

143
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,588
Lead spirit: No!

144
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,999
Jade: Tohru! Behind you!

145
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,901
(Both grunt)

146
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,502
Uncle: Ai-yaah!

147
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,938
Protect the mirror!

148
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,842
Lead spirit: Ignorant
creatures!

149
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,711
We will not be denied!

150
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,013
(Tohru grunts)

151
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,049
Uncle:
Does no one have ears?

152
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,851
Mirror must not shatter!

153
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,791
Jackie: Ohh! Bad day!

154
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,860
(Jackie panting)

155
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,965
(Spirits laughing)

156
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,267
(Jackie screams)

157
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,472
(Spirit #1 laughs)

158
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,540
(Jade shudders)

159
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,743
(Spirit #3 laughs)

160
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,946
(Tohru shudders)

161
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,114
(Spirit #2 laughs)

162
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,549
Jackie: Ohh...

163
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,618
(Lead spirit laughs)

164
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,988
(Uncle mute)

165
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,823
(All scream)

166
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,958
All: What?

167
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,361
Jade: Oh, no! I'm a mule!
A stubborn mule!

168
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,498
Jackie:
My head--it's huge!

169
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,734
Tohru, mother's voice:
I'm turning into my mother.

170
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:26,004
(Uncle claps)

171
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,007
Jade: It's like somebody hit
uncle's mute button.

172
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,144
Tohru: Ah.
Sometimes wishes do come true.

173
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,514
Jackie: (Gasps)
The mirror spirits--

174
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:39,651
they're making our worst fears
about ourselves come true!

175
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,056
Everybody out! Go, go, go!

176
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,263
(Jackie strains)

177
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,332
(Tohru grunts)

178
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,145
Jackie: Something tells me
I'm fortunate

179
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,947
I did not hear that.

180
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,184
Aw, uncle, please
stop staring and tell us

181
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,187
how to remove the mirror
spirits from inside us.

182
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,226
Jade: Hey, I kind of
like uncle this way.

183
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,596
Hee-haw!

184
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:25,964
At least I'm not a mime.

185
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,366
Why don't you walk against
the wind or something?

186
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,569
Jackie: Aw!
All right, both of you!

187
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,139
You're giving me a headache--
a big one!

188
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,007
don't even think about it.

189
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,276
Here, uncle.

190
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,679
Whatever you know,
write it down.

191
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,685
Tohru: This is nonsense!

192
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:50,088
Just like everything
that used to come
out of your mouth!

193
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,491
Jackie: Wait! This is
the scroll I picked up
inside the temple.

194
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,427
Maybe it will tell us
something.

195
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,729
Tohru: It says that
the mirror spirits

196
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,131
not only mutate
their human hosts,

197
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,269
but that the hosts can
then spread the fear and
chaos simply by touch,

198
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,772
moving from one person
to the next and so on.

199
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,641
Throughout the world!

200
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,977
Jackie: (Gasps)
So how do we stop them?

201
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:16,047
Tohru: Patience!
Unless spirits are
expelled from hosts

202
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,050
and recaptured in the mirror
with a binding spell,

203
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,152
the mutations
will become permanent!

204
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,387
Jade: Permanent?!

205
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,855
Jackie: We have a piece
of the mirror.

206
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,191
That's a good start.
What about the spell?

207
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,326
Tohru:
It is not on the scroll.

208
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,933
Jade: Either uncle knows
the spell or he has
to use the bathroom.

209
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,903
Uh, I know! Act it out,
uncle, like in charades!

210
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,440
Jackie:
Oh, the mountain temple!

211
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,445
Jade: We need
to go to a bullfight?

212
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,915
Jackie: Antennae!
We need some kind of bug?

213
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,256
Tohru: The junk man
dances like sick chicken.

214
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,228
Jackie: Unh, uncle,
please, stay focused!

215
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,331
Jade: A cricket?

216
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,833
It's got to be a cricket from
the mountain temple, right?

217
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,036
Jade: Yes!

218
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,739
Jackie: Is that all, uncle?

219
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:21,246
Yes, I know my head is
as big as that statue!

220
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:24,783
Very kind of you
to point that out.

221
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:28,787
Jade:
- You want us to get something
from the top of the statue?

222
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,822
Jackie:
Oh, ok, sounds like...

223
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,090
Jade: Throw!

224
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,092
Jackie:
Hurl! Fling! Toss!

225
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,393
Jade: Sounds like toss?

226
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,861
Tohru:
- You toss like a little girl!

227
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,498
Jackie: Yaah! Stop it!

228
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,401
We do not have time
for your bickering, tohru!

229
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,638
Uh, tohru's mom!
Oh, forget it!

230
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,508
Boss? Cross? Floss?

231
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,044
Aaah! Oh!

232
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,215
Uggh! Moss?

233
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,152
We need moss from the top
of the ghost king's statue!

234
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,665
Jackie: Ooh!
Bad day, bad day, bad day!

235
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,533
Spirit #2: Hee hee hee!

236
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,406
Yeow! Unh!

237
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,713
Jade: Hey, Jackie!

238
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,282
Jackie: Jade?
How did you get up here?

239
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,484
Jade: Duh!

240
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,486
Took the tram.

241
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,388
I'm stubborn, not stupid.

242
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,161
Tohru: Why you overpay for
rusty old cricket cage?

243
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,562
I did much better job

244
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:47,165
negotiating
- new headphones for Jade.

245
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,835
(Cricket chirping)

246
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,047
(Tohru laughs)

247
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,953
Tohru: You call that
cricket catching?

248
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,389
You couldn't catch a cold!

249
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,028
Boy: You're so greedy!

250
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,063
Brother: Stop being
so jealous all the time!

251
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,431
Boy: Am not!

252
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,866
Brother: Are, too! Aah!

253
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,954
Man: Ohh,
- I was afraid of this.

254
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,925
I knew I shouldn't have had
szechuan chicken for lunch.

255
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,960
Ohh, bad heartburn!

256
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,855
Man: Hey,
get away from my cart!

257
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,592
Ohh, feels like
my stomach's on fire!

258
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,405
Jade:
Hee-haw! Jackie, look!

259
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,774
There's the moss
uncle needs for the spell!

260
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,714
Jackie: Ohhh!

261
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,115
Jade: Whoa there,
humpty dumpty.

262
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,984
Here, I better do it.
Give me a boost.

263
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:49,554
Jackie: Ooh!
Watch where you're stepping!

264
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,623
Jade: I would,
but I can't see anything

265
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,425
with your overstuffed
<i>cabesa</i> in the way.

266
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,628
Almost got it!

267
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,365
Uh-oh!

268
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,766
(Braying)

269
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:05,570
Jackie: Aah, Jade!
Watch where you're kicking!

270
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,239
Jade:
Please, Jackie, hold still!

271
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,607
Got it!

272
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,211
Both: Whoa!

273
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,048
Aah!

274
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,419
Both: Aaaaaah!

275
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,821
Unh!

276
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,157
Both: Whew!

277
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,827
Both: Aah!

278
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,829
Unh!

279
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,500
Ohhhh!

280
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,402
Unh!

281
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,571
Jackie: Unh!
- Jade, are you all right?

282
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:48,212
Jade: I think I swallowed
the moss. Ptoo!

283
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:51,316
Oh, no, wait!
There it is! Hee-haw!

284
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,422
Tohru: Ha! In your face,
junk seller!

285
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,962
Tohru: Now you're going
to throw a tantrum?

286
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,365
What?!

287
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,302
Tohru: Aah!

288
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,343
Jackie: Uncle!

289
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,549
Jackie: The mirror spirits
are spreading their fear!

290
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,418
You weren't supposed
to touch anyone!

291
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,488
Jade:
If they reach the mainland,
they'll infect the whole city!

292
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,791
And then who knows?
Like, all of China?

293
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,138
Jade: Nothing's happening.

294
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,508
Tohru: That's because
the old windbag
is nothing but wind!

295
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,609
(Mumbling)

296
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,215
Jackie: Uncle, please,
this is no time to fight!

297
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,783
Jade: No, listen!

298
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,252
Uncle's moving tohru's lips
to chant the binding spell!

299
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,257
(Tohru chanting)

300
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,802
Spirit #2: Ohhh!

301
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,305
Spirit #1: Yaiii!

302
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,008
Lead spirit: Roarrr!

303
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,443
Spirit #3: Baaah!

304
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:28,579
Tohru: Uh, <i> sensei,</i>
àwhile I was my mother,

305
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,049
uh, well, I'm sorry.

306
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:35,453
Uncle: Not now, tohru!
Jackie, the mirror!

307
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,864
(All screaming)

308
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,100
(All grunt)

309
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,370
Spirit #2:
What are we going to do?

310
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,072
Lead spirit: Do not fear!

311
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,208
Below us lies
our passage to freedom!

312
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,177
The world will be ours

313
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,547
and chaos will reign
for all eternity!

314
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,182
(All laughing)

315
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:08,553
Uncle: Jackie, mirror spirits
must not reach ship!

316
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,055
Jackie: But the mirror shard,
it's gone!

317
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:14,459
Jade: Uncle, will
the binding spell work with
anything that reflects?

318
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,327
Uncle: It is possible. Why?

319
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,763
Jade: Jackie!

320
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:23,134
(Uncle chanting)

321
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,011
Jackie:
The disk must be full.

322
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,180
We need more
reflective objects!

323
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:42,353
Tohru: What? My mom left it
behind during her last trip.

324
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,123
(Uncle chanting)

325
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,760
Spirit #2: Owww!

326
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,696
Spirit #3: Aaah!

327
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,098
Jade: 3 down, 1 to go!

328
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,734
Go, Jackie! Go, Jackie!

329
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,538
All: Aaaah!

330
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,108
Jackie: Ohh!

331
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,677
(Gasping)

332
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,116
Lead spirit:
You're too late!

333
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,652
Jade: Oh, yeah?
Well, in your face,
mirror boy!

334
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,187
Lead spirit: Aah!

335
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,224
Jade: But, hey, I guess
I'm just stubborn that way.

336
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,373
Jackie: These will be safe
back at section 13.

337
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,975
Jade: Too bad we can't
come back to fengdo.

338
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,778
This place turned out
to be a lot more exiting
than I thought it'd be.

339
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,515
Sorry, uncle, I guess
I should have been listening.

340
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,117
Jackie: Me, too.

341
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,519
Uncle: Apologies accepted.

342
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,190
But tohru is another story!

343
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,193
Mirror spirits turn you
into mother

344
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,496
is no excuse for the way
you talk to uncle,

345
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:03,601
especially when nobody
can hear uncle's snappy
comebacks!

346
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,843
Jade: Hey, Jackie,
did you have any imaginary
friends as a child?

347
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,245
Jackie: Actually, I don't.

348
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,913
Especially
when I was in the school.

349
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,548
We had, like,
a hundred students.

350
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,052
We sleep together,
we eat together,

351
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,954
we play,
- we're training together,

352
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,089
so I actually don't,

353
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:30,494
because of so many
martial artist
sisters and brothers.
