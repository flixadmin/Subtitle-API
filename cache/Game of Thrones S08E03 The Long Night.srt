1
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,326
Oi!

2
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,245
Mind out.

3
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,499
Move!

4
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,391
Look, on the west wall!

5
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,022
Get down to the crypt!

6
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,235
Just hold.

7
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,525
We'll take him.

8
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,513
Come on, help the lads!

9
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,537
Yes, my lady.

10
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,615
Quickly, now! Quickly!
Get those in position.

11
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,916
- Come on.
- Close the gate!

12
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:50,831
That's it.

13
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,164
Oh, for fuck's sake.
You took your time.

14
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,368
Do you speak their tongue?

15
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,375
Tell them to lift their swords.

16
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,018
Valar Morghulis.

17
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,569
Valar Dohaeris.

18
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,037
Open the gate!

19
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,371
Open the gate!

20
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,546
Open the gate!

21
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,356
Come. Come on.

22
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,646
Easy.

23
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,092
There's no need to execute me,
Ser Davos.

24
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,048
I'll be dead before the dawn.

25
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,844
Cease fire!

26
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,482
The Night King is coming.

27
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,236
The dead are already here.

28
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,623
Stand your ground!

29
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,566
Get down to the crypt.

30
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,149
I'm not abandoning my people.

31
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,275
Take this and go.

32
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,947
I don't know how to use it.

33
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,537
Stick them with the pointy end.

34
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,746
Edd!

35
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,461
Edd!

36
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,807
Sam, get up!

37
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,068
Oh, God. Sam.

38
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,765
Fall back! Fall back!

39
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,095
Fall back!

40
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,305
Come on!

41
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,023
Open the gate!

42
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,975
Open the gate!

43
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,151
Let us in!

44
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,864
Open the gate!

45
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,441
Open the gate!

46
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,365
Keep moving!

47
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,453
Come on!

48
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,460
- Keep moving, fast.
- To your posts.

49
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,416
- Go!
- Keep moving!

50
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,086
Come on, run!

51
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Keep moving!

52
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,847
Protect the retreat!

53
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,564
Stand your ground!

54
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,936
Dany!

55
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,756
Grab your weapon now!

56
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,432
Guard the barricades!

57
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,726
Through that pass!

58
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,428
Hey! Hey! Hey!

59
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,763
Close up the gaps!

60
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,770
Go! Hey! Go! Go!

61
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,772
Get in! Get in!

62
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,569
Get in! Come on!

63
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,393
Move!

64
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,927
Retreat!

65
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,886
Retreat!

66
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,468
- Come on!
- Come on!

67
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,973
- Come on!
- Come on!

68
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,473
Protect the gate!

69
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,559
Protect the gate!

70
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,065
They're coming! Come on!

71
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,771
Fall back!

72
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,885
Light the trench!

73
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,149
- Wait!
- Light the trench!

74
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,245
She can't see us.

75
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:32,998
Light the trenches!

76
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,726
With a torch,
light the trenches!

77
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,104
- Right there.
- Torch it!

78
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,779
Light the trenches!

79
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,731
Clegane.

80
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,618
You must try not to worry yourself.

81
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,088
At least we're already in a crypt.

82
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,007
If we were up there,

83
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,019
we might see something
everyone else is missing.

84
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,459
Something that makes a difference.

85
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,438
What?

86
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,507
Remember the Battle of Blackwater?
I brought us through the Mud Gate.

87
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,615
- And got your face cut in half.
- And it made a difference.

88
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,569
If I was out there right now...

89
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,741
You'd die.

90
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,915
There's nothing you can do.

91
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,460
You might be surprised
at the lengths I'd go

92
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,042
to avoid joining
the Army of the Dead.

93
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,174
I could think of no organization
less suited to my talents.

94
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,968
Witty remarks
won't make a difference.

95
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,428
That's why we're down here,
none of us can do anything.

96
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,056
It's the truth.

97
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,647
It's the most heroic thing
we can do now...

98
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,150
look the truth in the face.

99
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,366
Maybe we should have stayed married.

100
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,739
You were the best of them.

101
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,160
What a terrifying thought.

102
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,592
It wouldn't work between us.

103
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,049
Why not?

104
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,048
The Dragon Queen.

105
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,220
Your divided loyalties
would become a problem.

106
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,061
Yes.

107
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,100
Without the Dragon Queen,
there'd be no problem at all.

108
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,811
We'd all be dead already.

109
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,338
They lit the trench.

110
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,145
Bran...

111
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,569
I just want you to know...

112
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,616
I wish...

113
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,414
The things I did...

114
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,288
Everything you did
brought you where you are now.

115
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,754
Where you belong.

116
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,045
Home.

117
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,557
I'm going to go now.

118
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,728
Go where?

119
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,842
Man the walls!

120
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,674
Man the walls!

121
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,142
Man the wall!

122
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,565
Man the walls!

123
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,519
Come on!

124
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,355
Get out there! Get moving!

125
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,233
Come on. Come on! Come on!

126
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,321
Go, go, go!

127
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,035
Come on!

128
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,199
They're against the wall!

129
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,329
Get more men up here!

130
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,718
- Fill the gaps, quickly!
- Get in there!

131
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,115
They're climbing the walls!

132
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,722
- Relieve the archers!
- Relieve the archers!

133
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,184
Archers on top!

134
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,933
- Move up!
- Go, go! Come here!

135
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,639
- Come on!
- Move back!

136
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,461
- Stand away!
- Go on, go on. Go! Go.

137
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,818
- Step back.
- All the way, archers!

138
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,203
Hold the wall!

139
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,732
The wall,
they're coming up!

140
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,999
- Hold the wall!
- Hold the wall!

141
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,254
Draw!

142
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,109
Come on!

143
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,578
They're coming up!

144
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,725
Look out!

145
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,991
Clegane!

146
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,368
Clegane!

147
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,812
Clegane!

148
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,609
Clegane, we need you!

149
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,645
You can't give up on us.

150
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,901
Fuck off! We can't beat them.

151
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,279
Don't you see that, you stupid whore?

152
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,110
We're fighting Death!

153
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,536
They can't beat Death.

154
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,746
Tell her that.

155
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,988
Ahhh!

156
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,539
Open the door!

157
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:25,703
Open the door!

158
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,232
- Come on!
- Open the door!

159
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,838
Open the door!

160
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:34,632
Please!

161
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:36,884
Open it!

162
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,818
Come on! Go!

163
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,064
- Come on!
- Run!

164
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,511
We've gotta go!

165
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,492
The Lord brought him back
for a purpose.

166
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,670
Now that purpose has been served.

167
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,089
I know you.

168
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:08,804
And I know you.

169
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,313
You said we'd meet again.

170
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,354
And here we are.

171
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,651
At the end of the world.

172
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,742
You said I'd shut many eyes forever.

173
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,991
You were right about that too.

174
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,206
Brown eyes...

175
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,292
green eyes...

176
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,871
and blue eyes.

177
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,977
What do we say to the God of Death?

178
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,315
Not today.

179
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:31,845
Here they come!

180
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,770
Steady, lads.

181
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,102
Steady now.

182
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,319
Make every shot count.

183
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,867
Over there!

184
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,163
There!

185
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,913
Get off.

186
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,095
Dracarys.

187
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,675
Come on! Come on!

188
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,047
No! No, no, no!

189
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,350
- Bran!
- Go!

190
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,468
Jorah!

191
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,133
Theon.

192
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,356
You're a good man.

193
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:26,442
Thank you.

194
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,854
I'm hurt.
