1
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,983
Good morning.

2
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:26,854
Good morning, Mom.

3
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,162
- Your cat bit me again.
- You stole my pencils.

4
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,791
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he stole my pencils!

5
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,335
- She's making it up.
- Stop fighting.

6
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:39,168
- Let's see.
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,038
- 6:40 a.m.
- God, I'm late again.

8
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,975
Remember to ask your brother
what we talked about.

9
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,140
- Tell him school starts next week.
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

10
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,083
I still have to buy the books,
everything.

11
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,517
I told you I'll ask him, my love,
all right?

12
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:59,355
And you still haven't tied your shoes.
So, like I taught you, right?

13
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,862
We have the rabbit ear,
we go around the tree, and...?

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,261
And it goes in the hole.

15
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,500
That was a loud one.

16
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,606
<i>You threaten a man's family,
and you find out what he's made of.</i>

17
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,745
<i>Pablo Escobar was made of rage,
revenge and terror.</i>

18
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:30,451
<i>Unable to lash out directly
at his enemies in Cali,</i>

19
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,356
<i>he went after their prized
legitimate business,</i>

20
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,864
<i>one they couldn't hide,
their beloved chain of drugstores.</i>

21
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:43,403
<i>And he blew them to shit along with anyone
unlucky enough to be standing nearby.</i>

22
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,064
<i>We're talking dozens of bombs.</i>

23
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:51,443
<i>He put the city of Bogotá on edge
and the Colombian government on notice.</i>

24
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:56,574
<i>Continue to ignore Los Pepes, refuse to
acknowledge their crimes, and you're next.</i>

25
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,152
LUIS LONDOÑO WHITE, KIDNAPPER OF THOSE
SERVING PABLO ESCOBAR

26
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,913
<i>But terror brings more terror,</i>

27
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:04,618
<i>and Los Pepes responded
with their own special brand.</i>

28
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,921
<i>We came up with a name
for their displays.</i>

29
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,793
- Sit him there.
- <i>Colombian folk art.</i>

30
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,125
Over here.

31
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,132
<i>Like I said,
you can't make this shit up.</i>

32
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:19,671
<i>The point of all this?
Psychopaths sending a message...</i>

33
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,909
<i>No matter how far you go...</i>

34
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,443
Look at that ugly son of a bitch.

35
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,640
<i>We'll take it one step further.</i>

36
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,750
<i>The gates of hell were
officially opened.</i>

37
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,844
One... two... and three.

38
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,516
<i>And everyone was scrambling
to get out of the fire.</i>

39
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,684
<i>Or climb into it.</i>

40
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,945
This family
is the only thing I care about.

41
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,217
- You're the one that...
- Me? Me, ma'am? Me?

42
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,885
- We shouldn't leave, Tata.
- All of this is your fault.

43
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,862
If you'd listened to Pablo,
my brother would still be alive.

44
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,725
Because you do that so well?
Do you listen to him?

45
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:35,765
When you're always criticizing him,
doubting him, worrying.

46
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,941
Tata.

47
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,384
I would never put this family
in danger.

48
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,049
Tell her, Pablo.

49
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,253
Tell her it's not my fault, Pablo.

50
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,822
- I know, Mom.
- This isn't my fault. Tell her, Pablo.

51
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:03,460
It's not your fault. I know.
It's not your fault.

52
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,431
Everything's all right, Mom.

53
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,335
It wasn't your fault.

54
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,679
Look at these smiling faces.

55
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,012
We didn't want to make you
uncomfortable, Judy.

56
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:29,079
How considerate of you.
So that's why no one called me?

57
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,357
Because this lab belongs
to the Moncadas?

58
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,726
So I was supposed to be notified
when it was taken back.

59
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,927
- That wasn't made clear to us.
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.

60
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,863
- What are we going to do with that?
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.

61
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,102
That is my cocaine.

62
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:54,714
Look, Judy, we decided that not a single
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellín

63
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,580
until Pablo Escobar is dead.

64
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,052
That's our strategy
to asphyxiate him.

65
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:05,024
That's the Cali cartel's strategy?

66
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,617
To keep making money
while the rest of us go hungry?

67
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:12,460
- You know we can't trust them.
- No. Not them or any of you.

68
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,359
We don't trust any drug trafficker.

69
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,739
Well, let's not get personal, Carlos.
All right?

70
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,141
We all need friends.

71
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,892
Sir, would you like some?

72
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,845
Go, go, go, go, go!

73
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,947
Sir?

74
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,756
Are you all right?

75
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,850
Are you all right?

76
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,317
- We're done working together.
- What's bothering you?

77
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,222
The killing of innocent civilians,
for starters.

78
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,362
Whether they're innocent or guilty,
I don't decide.

79
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,194
That's what priests are for, no?

80
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:36,169
The Castaños are crazier than ever,
and that wasn't part of the plan.

81
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,238
But it's working.

82
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,614
Not if I stop providing you intel.

83
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,385
For what it's worth, I am on your side.

84
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,355
I don't like what's happening.

85
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,892
Medellín is my home
and I love it very much.

86
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,090
As far as the methods
of the Castaños go...

87
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:03,764
well, those are the methods
that have Pablo's people hiding like rats.

88
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,568
Including that gonorrhea of a lawyer,
Fernando Duque.

89
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,202
Our guys fired a whole fucking clip
at him, point blank.

90
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,476
Can you believe that these sons of bitches
didn't hit him once?

91
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,108
I need you to help me find him.

92
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,656
He's Pablo's mouthpiece
and his connection to the government.

93
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,660
What we want is to exterminate this rat.

94
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:34,495
That way, we'll get to Pablo
and we can end this madness, Peña.

95
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,414
I've told you! You have to...

96
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,819
What are you doing?
You have to bring the passports.

97
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,984
Juliana, they're trying to kill me.
We have to get out of here.

98
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,028
I think you're the one
who needs to leave.

99
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,861
Can I see Simon, at least?

100
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,697
- Where... Simon!
- Stop, Fernando!

101
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,702
Simon is at school.

102
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,209
Besides, this isn't even your week.
So, please leave.

103
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,849
- Oh, what's going on?
- How are you?

104
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,384
- Bye, Anda!
- Bye!

105
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,351
Where's Mom?
Why do you have her car?

106
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,316
Get in.

107
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,024
Hey, I need you
to run a trace on this name.

108
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,692
- Okay.
- Find this guy.

109
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,567
All right? You look tired.

110
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,000
Come in.

111
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,745
Go on, son. Sit down.

112
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,280
So, you're being reassigned...

113
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:39,223
and you will be moved into the intel unit
that was formed a couple of months ago.

114
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,855
You'll be all right there.

115
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,265
You're sending me to an office
because I made a mistake?

116
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,595
Anything else?

117
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,070
Yes, sir, Colonel.

118
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,129
How are you, Papa?

119
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,309
And you?

120
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,438
- How long will we be there?
- Not long.

121
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,680
Just long enough for me
to get some things figured out here.

122
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,522
Do you remember when
we went to the United States?

123
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,921
It's going to be an adventure,
just like that.

124
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,625
Do they have Disney World there?

125
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,199
I don't think so.

126
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:19,187
Listen to your mother
and your grandmother. All right?

127
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,789
I made more than one reservation so
no one would know what flight you're on.

128
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,636
I spoke to Fernando
and he said it's perfectly legal.

129
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,661
You have every right to leave the country.

130
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,233
- It's like a normal trip.
- A normal trip?

131
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:48,981
Confess. Do you regret it?

132
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,353
Marrying me, or what?

133
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,682
Not for a second.

134
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,929
They may separate us...

135
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,510
but they'll never be able
to destroy us.

136
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,885
Go.

137
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,896
The little bunny.
The little bunny.

138
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,132
I'll take care of him, all right?

139
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,441
Give me a kiss.

140
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:40,027
<i>Pablo was right. The government
couldn't stop his family from leaving.</i>

141
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,933
<i>But if you remember, he had
some bad history with Avianca Airlines.</i>

142
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,108
<i>And they made sure as shit
that everybody knew</i>

143
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,645
<i>the Escobars were trying
to fly the coop.</i>

144
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,776
What we know is that Escobar
bought tickets for his family

145
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,288
on eight different outgoing flights
from Bogotá.

146
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,951
Destinations ranging
from Barcelona to Toronto.

147
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,518
Mr. President,
we need to prevent that from happening.

148
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:13,224
We need to keep the family in play.
If they're allowed to leave Colombia,

149
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,232
we're gonna lose leverage
in the hunt for Escobar.

150
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,736
Legally, there's no way we can stop them
from flying out of the country.

151
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,237
By applying pressure behind the scenes,

152
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,467
we can prevent the family
from being accepted upon arrival.

153
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:27,070
And if they're kept in Colombia,
he's gonna be worried about their safety.

154
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:33,312
He'll be more likely to make phone
contact, more likely to make mistakes.

155
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,687
Because they're more likely
to become victims of Los Pepes.

156
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:47,698
Mr. President, if the family gets safe
haven, there's no telling what comes next.

157
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,897
Maybe Escobar surrenders,
maybe he goes to war.

158
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,771
The family is leverage.
We have to use it.

159
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:07,685
I agree.

160
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:14,926
I want one of your people with them
giving us updates, running interference,

161
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,053
and have them find out
where they're going. And stick with them.

162
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,471
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's Messina.

163
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,606
I need you to grab your passport
and head to Bogotá international.

164
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:38,548
Where?

165
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,952
The Escobars are trying to flee the
country. Wherever they go, follow them.

166
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,319
- Yeah. When?
- Now. Once you spot them, check in.

167
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,325
- And Murphy, keep this under wraps.
- Yes, ma'am.

168
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,820
Who was that?

169
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,227
Messina.

170
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,328
- Where you going?
- Going out.

171
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,471
- With your passport?
- Yep.

172
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,735
- Oh, that's all I get?
- Yep.

173
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,580
- I'd like to get some tickets, please.
- For which flight, sir?

174
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,647
Let's see. Madrid, London...

175
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,474
It's Murphy. Get me Messina.

176
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,102
- Messina.
- Hey, it's me. It's the Frankfurt flight.

177
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,873
Germany. Shit.

178
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,950
Yes, Mr. Foreign Minister, but I'm not
talking about some Turkish date farmer

179
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,715
looking to drive a taxi in Berlin.
I'm talking about Pablo Escobar's family.

180
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,649
No. No, they haven't committed any crimes.

181
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,958
<i>Due to events in their fairly
recent past,</i>

182
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,660
<i>Germany had some of the softest
immigration standards in Europe.</i>

183
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,070
<i>If you had a pulse,
they tended to let you in.</i>

184
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:09,039
<i>Now maybe that was good for mankind,</i>

185
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,304
<i>and it was certainly good
for the Escobars.</i>

186
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,403
<i>It was very bad for us.</i>

187
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,181
Sergeant. Private Hugo Martinez Jr.
at your service, sir.

188
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,830
The colonel's son.

189
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,929
He said you have some
technical background.

190
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,535
I took a couple
of engineering classes, sir.

191
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,206
And I built a ham in my parents' house.

192
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,344
Great. What do you know about RDF?

193
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,288
The basic concept, sir.

194
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,124
The basic concept.

195
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,090
All right.

196
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,968
Get acquainted.
We go out tomorrow afternoon.

197
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,595
And don't worry.

198
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:16,733
Unlike Carlos Castaño,
this won't hit back.

199
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,890
What's going on?
I'm going to freeze to death out here.

200
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,428
That's Bogotá. What do you expect?

201
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,830
Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why are you not working?

202
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,163
Get to work.
I'm not paying you with candy.

203
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,931
- Okay, okay.
- Pass me the phone, boy.

204
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,635
Make some fucking bombs.
You need an invitation to start working?

205
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:54,612
Hurry, boy! You get to work too!

206
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,648
And don't smoke near the gunpowder.

207
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,087
Hey, boss.
I just came back from the airport.

208
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,958
Ms. Tata, the kids and your mother
are on the plane, boss.

209
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,622
Thank the Virgin Mary.

210
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,700
That's the most important thing.
They're flying now.

211
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,292
One more thing.

212
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,305
We hit those fucking drugstores
pretty hard.

213
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,001
You tell us.
Should we come home or...

214
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,977
No. Stay put. We're not done yet.

215
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,248
I may need you again.

216
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,211
Copy that, boss.

217
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,547
Thank you, Blackie.

218
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:51,201
Figure out what...
what time it is in Germany.

219
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,206
On it, boss.

220
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,219
Boss! Boss!

221
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,356
Boss!

222
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,559
We got a bump on your guy.
Came in about an hour ago.

223
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:52,621
Credit card belonging to Fernando Duque.
Used twice, restaurants.

224
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,428
Here, here, a couple streets over.

225
00:23:56,402 --> 00:24:00,100
Check this out.
Ran him through the CNP database.

226
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,038
A complaint got filed this morning.
Your boy's wanted.

227
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,043
- For what?
- Kidnapping and car theft.

228
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,637
Filed by his ex-wife.
It's a blue Volvo.

229
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:14,045
He's running. And he's taking his kid.

230
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,883
He's 14 years old. Fuck.

231
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,653
Peña.

232
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,733
Any word on our friend?

233
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,394
Did you find him?

234
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,404
- Peña?
- Not yet.

235
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,628
- Messina.
- Hey, boss.

236
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:03,657
I think Fernando Duque's on the run.
He's got his kid with him.

237
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,670
If he's that scared, maybe he's willing
to drop privilege and cooperate.

238
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,536
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I...

239
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,136
I might have an idea where he's holed up.

240
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,306
If he comes through for us, you think
we can get him out of the country?

241
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:18,715
- If he'll cooperate, yes. Look into it.
- You got it.

242
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,444
- And Peña.
- Yeah.

243
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,044
How did all this come up?

244
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:27,450
My CI knows a girl he sees.
Kind of fell into my lap.

245
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,121
- Get on it.
- Yeah, boss.

246
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,532
What's up, Peña?

247
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:39,030
Are we getting a beer or what?

248
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,796
Another day, brother.

249
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,741
See you tomorrow.

250
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:46,902
Okay.

251
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,549
No, no, no. What are you doing, Simon?

252
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,062
Leave it where it is.
I'm listening to the news.

253
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,393
What are we doing here?

254
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,935
I told you. We're going on a trip.

255
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,496
And what's happening? Where's my mom?

256
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,005
Simon, calm down.
I already spoke to your mother.

257
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,409
You got yourself into trouble,
didn't you?

258
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,011
It's because you work for Pablo Escobar.

259
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,111
That's why this is happening.

260
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,423
You're his lawyer.

261
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,128
What are we going to do now?

262
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,534
I have a plan. Calm down.

263
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:48,738
You don't have a plan, Dad.
You're a son of a bitch. A fucking thief.

264
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,143
Did you say son of a bitch?
Thief?

265
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:57,979
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer.

266
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:03,378
All of the money this family has,
we have because I've been a good lawyer.

267
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,550
- I do my job.
- I want to call my mom.

268
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,719
You want to call your mom?

269
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,230
Do you want to call your mom,
or do you want to behave like a man?

270
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,063
Are you going to be a pussy
and call your mom? That's a great idea.

271
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,628
Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

272
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,436
Your room full of toys.
Where do you think it came from?

273
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:27,644
Hmm? You didn't complain
during the Christmases or the birthdays

274
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,976
or when I bought you a motorcycle.

275
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:33,643
But now you're complaining.
Very well. Very well. It's over.

276
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:38,484
It's over! Now that they're
going to kill me, it's over.

277
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,270
I'm sorry, Simon.

278
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,274
I didn't mean to say that.

279
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,536
Forgive me.

280
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,814
Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

281
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,165
Was it a heart attack or what?

282
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,700
You fainted, Pablo.

283
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,733
How many of those are you taking?

284
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,539
I've had a terrible headache.

285
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,409
Those aren't any good, Pablo.

286
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,040
You shouldn't put so much shit
in your body.

287
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:45,585
You're better off taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

288
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,991
Three drops under your tongue
in the morning and two at night.

289
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,695
Have you ever been to Disney World?

290
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,237
I haven't.

291
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,173
It's beautiful.

292
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,210
It's very organized. Very clean.

293
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,346
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

294
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,253
Stress.

295
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,520
Stress is dangerous.

296
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,097
How's the weed working out?

297
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,061
I haven't been smoking a lot.

298
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:37,633
The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

299
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:41,873
He burned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

300
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,542
But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

301
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:52,420
And the bird told him
to conquer his neighboring empires.

302
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,084
And that's what he did.

303
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,555
All right.

304
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,832
With you until death, Don Pablo.

305
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,301
Thank you.

306
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,607
I'd like to stay and stand guard.

307
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,981
All right. Thank you.

308
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,864
Let's see, darling.
Color inside the lines.

309
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,870
There it is.

310
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,394
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

311
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,834
We will be passing around
immigration cards.

312
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,644
This is our stop.

313
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,546
Foreign ministry isn't cooperating.
We need more time.

314
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,680
Don't let them leave the airport.

315
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,717
- They do, it's over.
- Right, right, right. Talk to you soon.

316
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,898
Sir, I'm with the United States DEA.

317
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,568
There's passengers on this flight
who can't be allowed into this country.

318
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:56,739
Heard of Pablo Escobar? Cocaine? That's
his family. You can't allow them in.

319
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,682
Unless there is a problem with
their passports or any type of contraband,

320
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,878
they may enter Germany.

321
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:08,455
What about if they're transporting
a large amount of foreign currency?

322
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,962
- You would be certain of this how?
- I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes.

323
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,055
I work with the DEA, been with
this family, I've been tracking Escobar

324
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,068
for a long goddamn fucking time.
It is in that bag.

325
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,468
- In which item of luggage?
- The maroon bag.

326
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,563
Perdón?

327
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,110
- Do you speak English?
- No.

328
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,236
I'm a hundred percent certain.
That burgundy bag.

329
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,137
Fucking hell.

330
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,717
- Hello. Pablo Escobar? Familia Escobar?
- Si.

331
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:41,486
- You speak English? German?
- No.

332
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,453
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

333
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,826
Come with us.

334
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:48,229
- What's going on?
- Can you give me back my passport?

335
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,464
<i>To be honest, I'd never actually
seen any cash in the bag.</i>

336
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,399
That money is ours.

337
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,342
<i>But I knew Pablo
would never let his wife go anywhere</i>

338
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,845
<i>without some serious
walking around money.</i>

339
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:05,508
- Pablo, they're not letting us in.
- No, no! They can't do that.

340
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,279
- That's what they're doing.
- They can't...

341
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,517
Listen, Tata, that's illegal.
That's illegal. Don't worry.

342
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:13,853
Don't worry, because...

343
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:17,953
Do what you need to do to get us
into Germany. I have to hang up.

344
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,691
Don't touch me!

345
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,995
- Please come now.
- Let go!

346
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,171
No, no, no! No!

347
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,848
Fernando Duque.

348
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,359
Javier Peña.

349
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,260
It took me one day to find you.

350
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:29,095
If you don't want them to kill you,
you need to start doing things better.

351
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,839
Please, get me out of here.

352
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,843
Please get me out of Colombia. Do you know
who I work for? Who I worked for?

353
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,573
Well, our help isn't free.

354
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,352
We need full cooperation.

355
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,883
Dad!

356
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,247
Hey, Simon, it's all right.

357
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,192
It's all right. Go back inside.
I'll come up soon.

358
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:04,930
It's my son. He's... He's scared.

359
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,870
First, we'll get you to Holguín.
You'll be safe...

360
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,604
No, no, no! No. No, no.
No, we're staying here.

361
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:16,875
There are cops working
for Los Pepes everywhere.

362
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,444
It would be better if you get us
to the United States at once.

363
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,322
I'll cooperate with you.
Anything you want.

364
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,053
I'll cooperate with you.
Please get us out of Colombia.

365
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,427
Is that a deal?

366
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:39,666
Do as I say.

367
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:44,239
Start by hiding your fucking wife's car.

368
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:54,412
<i>While the authorities were using
all the political pressure they could</i>

369
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,853
<i>to keep Escobar's family in play,</i>

370
00:35:56,955 --> 00:36:00,755
<i>Pablo was practicing
his own special form of diplomacy.</i>

371
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,361
<i>First, he called the German embassy</i>

372
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,588
<i>in Bogotá.</i>

373
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,291
Hello, German embassy.

374
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:14,806
First of all, I'll kill every last German
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.

375
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:19,003
Then I will bomb Frankfurt, Munich...

376
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,102
<i>Then he threatened to bomb
a couple of Lufthansa planes.</i>

377
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,016
I'm going to shove bombs up your asses,
you bastard motherfuckers.

378
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:31,885
Nazi, racist gonorrheas.
I'm going to kill all of you. You hear?

379
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,856
I'm going to kill all of you!

380
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,453
<i>Then he dialed up President Gaviria.</i>

381
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,497
<i>Who couldn't take the call.</i>

382
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:43,000
<i>Because he was already on the phone
with the German ambassador.</i>

383
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:51,843
<i>And then, Pablo did something
he'd never done before in his life.</i>

384
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:55,674
<i>He called a cop and he asked for help.</i>

385
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:59,809
<i>Not just any cop,
but the top cop in the country.</i>

386
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,909
<i>Attorney General De Greiff.</i>

387
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:08,050
I once heard you say that I had the same
rights as any other Colombian citizen.

388
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,753
I imagine that also applies to my family,
correct?

389
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:17,230
The government hasn't done anything
to stop Los Pepes,

390
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:22,000
those terrorists who have attacked
my family and murdered my associates.

391
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:27,273
Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

392
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,872
The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany

393
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,509
and yet you do nothing about it.

394
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:38,955
That man wants to dangle my family before
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,

395
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:42,755
and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it.

396
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,645
There's a lot of interference.

397
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,379
Yes. Medellín has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

398
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,443
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

399
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,881
To be honest,
we haven't located a signal yet.

400
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,721
Not one?

401
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,789
Not one.

402
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,002
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

403
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:31,770
Let's both start here, L9.329.

404
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,506
There it is.

405
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,587
I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

406
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,593
None other than that son of a bitch, Peña.
What do you think about that?

407
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,833
Who's your contact?

408
00:38:56,935 --> 00:39:01,668
Who he is isn't important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

409
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,866
And you know what
the worst part of this is?

410
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,035
We can no longer trust Peña.

411
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,009
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

412
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,275
No.

413
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:17,019
We can't kill DEA agents.

414
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,055
Oh, no? Why not?

415
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,720
If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

416
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,692
Berna, look...

417
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,540
Schedule a meeting with Peña,
just as you have been.

418
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,379
We'll take care of the rest.

419
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,467
Agent Peña.

420
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,947
I don't think Don Berna's
gonna make it tonight.

421
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,989
What is this?

422
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,725
Just a friendly chat.

423
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:15,168
You're making some very scary people
pretty nervous, Javier.

424
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,409
Which puts me in a spot because...

425
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,447
I'm the one who suggested
they approach you in the first place.

426
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:28,310
Now, I don't know what you know
about what it is I do,

427
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,319
but understand this.

428
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,857
I have our nation's
long-term interests in mind.

429
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,949
That's the beat I walk.

430
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:39,463
And sitting here tonight,
that means making sure the right folks

431
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,864
are left standing when Escobar
gets his bullet.

432
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,631
So do Uncle Sam a solid.

433
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,373
Don't complicate that.

434
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,015
These folks are prone
to emotional decision-making.

435
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:10,158
Which can lead to bush league nonsense
like killing a federal agent.

436
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,826
By the way, they found the lawyer.

437
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,464
Even without your help, so...

438
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,473
COURTESY OF LOS PEPES

439
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,479
Córdoba recovers,
we'll have a goalie in place.

440
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:49,891
Leonel Alvarez can do his thing
and move the ball along...

441
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,760
Trujillo!
You follow me to the fucking hotel?

442
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:58,392
Did you follow me to the hotel?
You told Berna?

443
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,899
Let go.

444
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,770
Tell me, asshole.

445
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,340
- Let go! It's all right.
- What's the problem?

446
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:08,140
I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

447
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,248
What's going on, Peña?

448
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,312
Playing the fucking American?

449
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,182
Did you see what they did to his son?

450
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:24,924
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Peña? Do you know?

451
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:30,101
You don't decide who lives and who dies.

452
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:34,298
Don't be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

453
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:06,897
I understand that you're trying
to prevent Escobar's family

454
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,130
from entering Germany.

455
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,970
Let's make something clear.

456
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:14,638
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only...

457
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,476
No, Mr. President.

458
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:24,344
I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

459
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,654
For me? How so?

460
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,890
I know that you want Escobar dead.

461
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:37,366
And while I don't agree with that,
I understand it.

462
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:42,602
But this... this I can't understand.

463
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,704
This isn't just wrong.

464
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:53,581
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

465
00:45:55,019 --> 00:46:01,220
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

466
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:24,540
I'm sorry to inform you,
your entry into Germany has been denied.

467
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,446
I know my rights, sir.
But you don't understand.

468
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,784
My children are in danger.
Send me any place other than Colombia.

469
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:40,128
Tell him the children are under age.
We just want to live in peace.

470
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:41,494
We just want to live in...

471
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,299
No, no, no.
Tell him that's all we want to do.

472
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:49,567
To live in peace.

473
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,001
Get the children and your belongings.

474
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,169
Please.

475
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,478
They kick us out of the country,
and they keep the money too.

476
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,488
I know. I'm going.

477
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,651
What is this?
Why are we being treated this way?

478
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,854
You can't treat us like criminals.

479
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:13,191
Let's go.

480
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,566
Pardon me.

481
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,799
I hope you enjoyed Germany.

482
00:49:21,926 --> 00:49:24,395
- How much for this?
- Two thousand pesos.

483
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:28,061
Thank you.

484
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,363
Ladies.

485
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,806
Stop! National police!

486
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,368
- DEA!
- Get on the ground!

487
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,980
It's all right, ma'am, we're with
the national police. Come with us.

488
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,712
The attorney general asked us
to put you under protective custody.

489
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,654
Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Come with us. You'll be safe. Let's go.

490
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:30,683
- Come with us.
- Let's go. Quickly. Let's go!

491
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,247
How can I help you, boss?

492
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:03,424
I want this faggot of a president
to know what happens

493
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:07,327
when you're on the side
of those bastards, Los Pepes.

494
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:13,597
I want to see blood.

495
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,671
I want the sky to burn with gunpowder.

496
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,713
I want you to put the biggest bomb
you can get your hands on

497
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:27,217
as close as you can to the
Presidential Palace. Are we clean?

498
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,711
As you wish, boss.

499
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,472
My love, let's go. Let's go.

500
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:11,145
Do you want one? Yes?
How much?

501
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,484
One hundred pesos.

502
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,282
- Here.
- Thank you.

503
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:21,223
- Are we going that way?
- That way, darling.

504
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,033
You better be a doctor when you grow up.
This is very expensive.

505
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,628
Elena! Elena, let's go!

506
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,217
<i>220 pounds of C-4.</i>

507
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:49,726
<i>Same as a bomb on an F-16.</i>

508
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,357
<i>Dozens were killed.</i>

509
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:58,226
<i>Scores were injured,
many of them children.</i>

510
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:01,904
<i>Pablo never took credit
for the bomb.</i>

511
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,364
<i>He didn't have to.</i>

512
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,188
Elena?

513
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,190
Elena!

514
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:31,932
Elena!

515
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,734
Lift him up carefully!
