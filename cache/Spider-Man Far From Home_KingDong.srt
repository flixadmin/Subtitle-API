1
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,468
Nick, this was a tragedy,
but it's not why we're here.

2
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:18,788
What, are we fighting the weather now?

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,748
Locals say the cyclone had a face.

4
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:23,976
People see things
when they're under stress.

5
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:27,843
That does not mean that this is
the start to some other big world-ending-

6
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,345
Who are you?

7
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,269
You don't want any part of this.

8
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,601
Gone, but not forgotten.

9
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,771
Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy

10
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:04,849
for their help
with that touching video tribute.

11
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:07,024
This year has been nothing short of-

12
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,677
[BLEEP] is crazy. It's, like, insane.

13
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:10,695
- Jason.
- What?

14
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,802
No swearing.

15
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:13,912
It's the last day of school. We're good.

16
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,031
Historic.

17
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:19,310
Over five years ago,
half of all life in the universe,

18
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:23,349
including our own Midtown High
was wiped from existence.

19
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:27,138
Then eight months ago, a band
of brave heroes brought us back.

20
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:31,532
They called it "the Blip".

21
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:34,258
Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...

22
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:38,485
But our classmates that didn't Blip
had grown five years older.

23
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,111
Yeah, my little brother
is now older than me.

24
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:42,750
Yeah, it's math.

25
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:46,163
Even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year

26
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:48,381
and had already taken midterms,

27
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:51,084
the school made us
start the year over from the beginning.

28
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,743
It's totally unfair. It's not right.

29
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:59,353
Tigers... it's been a long, dramatic,
somewhat confusing road.

30
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:03,876
As we draw this year to a close,
it's time to move on...

31
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:06,832
...to a new phase of our lives.

32
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:10,313
Pray nothing crazy happens again
because are the Avengers a thing anymore?

33
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:12,002
Does anyone even have a plan?

34
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:13,539
I have a plan.

35
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,997
Okay. First,
I'm gonna sit next to MJ on the flight.

36
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,376
Second, I'm gonna buy
a dual headphone adapter

37
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,401
and watch movies with her
the whole time.

38
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:21,610
- Okay.
- Three,

39
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:24,529
when we go to Venice, Venice is
famous for making stuff out of glass.

40
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:25,203
True.

41
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:27,052
I'm gonna buy her a black dahlia necklace

42
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:29,872
because her favorite flower is
the black dahlia because of, well...

43
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:31,294
- The murder.
- The murder.

44
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:32,680
Four, when we go to Paris,

45
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:35,630
I'm gonna take her to the top of
the Eiffel Tower, give her the necklace.

46
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:36,446
Oh.

47
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:38,469
Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

48
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:42,984
Then, six, hopefully she tells me
she feels the same way.

49
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:45,294
- Oh, don't forget step seven.
- Step seven?

50
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,476
Don't do any of that.

51
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:48,717
Why?

52
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:50,804
Because we're gonna be
bachelors in Europe, Peter.

53
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:51,827
- Ned.
- Look,

54
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:54,123
I may not know much,
but I do know this:

55
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,585
Europeans love Americans.

56
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,741
- Really?
- And more than half of them are women.

57
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:04,256
Okay. Sure.
But... I really like MJ, man, okay?

58
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:07,015
She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

59
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:10,100
And sometimes I catch her looking at me,
and I feel like I've stood up...

60
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,037
- She's coming. Just don't say anything.
- What up, dorks?

61
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,504
Excited about the science trip?

62
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,741
Hey, yeah.
We're just talking about the trip.

63
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,013
Yeah, and Peter's plan.

64
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:18,217
You have a plan?

65
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:21,538
I don't... I don't have a plan.

66
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,553
He's... He's just gonna collect tiny spoons
when we're traveling to other countries.

67
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:27,835
Like a... Like a grandmother?

68
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,858
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.
He's collecting tiny spoons.

69
00:05:30,883 --> 00:05:32,541
Oh, okay, well...

70
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:35,665
...that was a real roller coaster.

71
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:37,623
By the way, travel tip:

72
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:39,737
You should download a VPN on your phone

73
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:42,084
just so the government
can't track you while abroad.

74
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:44,725
Smart... Will do.

75
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,905
Dude, I think that went really great.

76
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,319
When I Blipped back to my apartment,

77
00:05:57,344 --> 00:06:00,078
the family that was living there
was very confused.

78
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:02,928
The wife thought that I was a mistress.

79
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,139
The grandma thought that I was a ghost.
It was... It was really a mess.

80
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:11,592
Thank you all for coming out to support
those who have been displaced by the Blip.

81
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:15,562
And, of course, thanks to
our very own Spider-Man!

82
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:28,483
Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me.

83
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:31,900
And thank you, you guys,
for having me.

84
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:38,584
And thank you, Spider-Man. He'll be
right back out to take photos and videos.

85
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:39,871
Thank you!

86
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,545
- That was amazing.
- That was great.

87
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:49,280
That was so cool. I was so nervous.

88
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:51,339
I was a little stiff.
I wasn't in the pocket.

89
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:54,074
- No, I thought you did great.
- I actually think you were a little stiff.

90
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,785
Uh, yeah, I felt that too.
I felt that too.

91
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,224
- It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
- Okay.

92
00:06:58,226 --> 00:06:59,825
- Did you get your passport?
- Yeah.

93
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,112
- Mini toothpaste?
- Yeah, I did.

94
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,292
Hey, sorry I'm late.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,441
Happy. Hey.

96
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,613
- Oh, you look lovely.
- Thanks. You too.

97
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:09,724
Thank you.

98
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:11,785
- New dress?
- Yeah, yes, it is.

99
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:13,816
It's a new beard.

100
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,208
It's my... My Blip beard.

101
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,684
'Cause I grew it in the Blip.

102
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:18,829
It's a Blip beard.

103
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,214
I see. Yeah.

104
00:07:20,496 --> 00:07:23,460
Anyway, the reason I'm late is
because this was misplaced.

105
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,129
Can you believe it? Because it's enormous.

106
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:29,132
I mean not the amount, the size.
The amount's nice too. They're generous.

107
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,059
Pepper Potts said,
sorry she couldn't be here.

108
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:36,170
I think I'm gonna go change the Sterno
under the vegan lasagna.

109
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:39,221
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

110
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:40,714
Will do.

111
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:47,004
What just happened?

112
00:07:47,386 --> 00:07:49,853
Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.

113
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,087
- Nick Fury's gonna call me? Why?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:54,987
Why? He probably has hero stuff
for you to do.

115
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:57,104
You're a superhero. He calls superheroes.

116
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,550
If it was that important,
he'd probably call someone else, not me.

117
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,848
Apparently not.

118
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,402
No caller ID. That's him.

119
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:09,759
I don't wanna talk to Fury.

120
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:10,826
- Answer the phone.
- Why?

121
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,879
Because if you don't talk to him,
I have to and I don't want to.

122
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,994
Why don't you want to talk to him?

123
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,427
Because I'm scared. Just answer the phone.

124
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:18,602
- You sent Fury to voicemail?
- Yeah.

125
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,412
- You don't send Fury to voicemail.
- You hear that? They're calling me.

126
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:23,238
- I gotta go.
- You gotta talk to him.

127
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:26,143
I'm gonna call him.
I promise, I'm gonna call him. I will.

128
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:27,990
You do not ghost Nick Fury.

129
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,814
I promise you, I'll call him.

130
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,724
After my trip.

131
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,017
Hey!

132
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,145
Yeah, hi.

133
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:37,902
No, no, he's not ghosting you.

134
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,235
Okay, one question at a time.

135
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,070
Are you the head Avenger?

136
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:45,527
Are you the head Avenger now?

137
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:46,994
Uh, no, I'm not.

138
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:49,132
If aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

139
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:50,917
If aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

140
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,920
Does anyone have neighborhood questions?

141
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,707
Sean Winford, Queens Tribune.

142
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:57,598
What's it like to take over
from Tony Stark?

143
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:59,169
Those are big shoes to fill.

144
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,699
I'mma...

145
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,347
I'm gonna go.
Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.

146
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,277
Okay.

147
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:55,230
Hungry?

148
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,488
So sorry.

149
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:02,442
I thought you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.

150
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,918
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

151
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:08,077
So, what's up? You can dodge bullets
but not bananas?

152
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:11,402
No, I just really need this vacation.
I need a break.

153
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:13,895
You deserve it.

154
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,084
Yeah.

155
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:19,231
You know what?

156
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,998
You should pack your suit, just in case.

157
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:23,191
I have a tingle about it.

158
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,622
Please stop saying "tingle", May.

159
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:29,934
No.

160
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,934
No. No, I'm not.

161
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,555
Vacation, yeah!

162
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,478
Can you help me get my stuff up?

163
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:48,207
- Oh, sorry, that's mine.
- No worries.

164
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,965
Give me a tablet.

165
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:54,801
Do you want first shift or second?
I could take either.

166
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:57,257
Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.

167
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,864
I can't chaperone kids alone.

168
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,036
Yo, Parker.

169
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,627
This is called an airplane.

170
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:05,164
It's like buses you're used to,
except it flies over the poor neighborhoods

171
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,764
instead of driving through them.

172
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:08,114
- Ma'am?
- Hmm?

173
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:11,526
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

174
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:12,989
I'll take that.

175
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,419
She's lying. I don't even know this girl.

176
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:20,013
Classic MJ, right?

177
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:23,778
Did you know Brad was coming?

178
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:26,395
It... It's so weird.

179
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,817
Like, one day, he's that kid who cried
and got nosebleeds all the time,

180
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:33,558
and suddenly, we Blip back, and
he's totally ripped and super nice

181
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,988
and all these girls are after him.

182
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,457
Not all the girls are after him.

183
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:38,356
No, man, they're all after him.

184
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,489
- Yeah.
- Here.

185
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:42,414
Anyway, on to more important things.

186
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,353
It's a nine-hour flight.
We can play Beast Slayers the whole time.

187
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,368
Are you excited?

188
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,078
I need help to sit next to MJ.

189
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:54,012
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

190
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:56,898
What about our plan?
American bachelors in Europe.

191
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,757
That's your plan. That's a solo plan.

192
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:00,176
Come on, this is my plan.

193
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,302
Please.

194
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,354
Uh, hey, guys.

195
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:14,263
Uh, there's an old lady sitting in front of
us wearing a crazy amount of perfume,

196
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:17,668
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

197
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,763
Um, you know, Betty, if you could just
switch seats with him, that would be-

198
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,076
He's allergic to perfume?

199
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,391
Yeah, yeah, because, um, it... it makes
his eyes water, and he can't really-

200
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,349
Peter has a perfume allergy?

201
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,340
Oh, uh...

202
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,719
I tell you from experience,
perfume allergies are no joke.

203
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,787
I can feel hives breaking out already.

204
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:36,973
MJ, stand up.

205
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,852
Ned, take MJ's spot.

206
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:40,606
MJ, you take my spot.

207
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:42,570
Peter, come with me.
Let's get you out of there.

208
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,270
- Sorry.
- Zach and Sebastian,

209
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,004
you take Ned and Peter's seats.

210
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,214
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

211
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,856
Your safety is my responsibility.

212
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:52,754
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

213
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,532
I got it for now.

214
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:55,756
Let's go, Peter!

215
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:57,052
Let's go!

216
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:07,311
Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

217
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,042
So did you wanna play Beast Slayer?

218
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:14,219
Nope.

219
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,434
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or...

220
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,426
No.

221
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,543
Did I tell you
how my wife pretended to Blip out?

222
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,352
Turns out, she ran off with
a guy in her hiking group.

223
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:28,102
We had a fake funeral for her...

224
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:31,344
Well, the funeral was real
because I thought she was dead.

225
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:32,593
Do you wanna see the video?

226
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:35,231
Oh, I got a dual headphone adapter
if you wanna watch a movie.

227
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,062
Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious.

228
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:41,247
Oh, you have a dual headphone adapter.
We can watch together.

229
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:44,262
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

230
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:48,477
Our flight time today will be
eight hours, 49 minutes to Venice, Italy.

231
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,981
Hey man, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

232
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,387
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

233
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,286
Dude, don't worry, okay?
I'm sure that's nothing.

234
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,576
Hey, babe. Can you hold this for me?

235
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,076
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

236
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,251
What was that?

237
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:23,221
Uh, well, we got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out, we have a lot in common.

238
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:25,530
So, uh, we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.

239
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:28,783
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

240
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,313
Peter, those were the words of a boy.

241
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:36,864
And that boy met a woman.
A very strong and powerful woman.

242
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:39,365
And now, that boy's a man.

243
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,466
- Babe?
- Coming, babe.

244
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,193
There's nothing in there. I swear.

245
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,842
These, no.

246
00:16:16,214 --> 00:16:18,414
Sorry. Sorry.

247
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,611
- I'm here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

248
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:22,728
- I'm here.
- Thank goodness.

249
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:58,337
Looks like we're here.

250
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:01,193
They're doing renovations to the place.
Getting some upgrades.

251
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:02,759
Oh, this is trash.

252
00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:04,658
- That must be the concierge.
- Okay.

253
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:06,111
Come on, man.

254
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:08,454
Everyone, here we are.

255
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:09,994
Whoa!

256
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:12,486
- Wow!
- Come on in.

257
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,123
This place is sinking.

258
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:16,030
- I think you mean, "charming".
- It stinks.

259
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:18,718
Okay, everybody, drop your bags off.

260
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:21,809
We're gonna meet at
the da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

261
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,814
- !Vámanos!
- It's "andiamo".

262
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,915
Andiamo!

263
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,759
When in Rome, do as Romans do.
When you're in Venice, your socks get wet.

264
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,822
What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?

265
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,270
I'm here in St. Marco Polo's-

266
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:42,223
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah?

267
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,835
Three, two, one... say pizza!

268
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,532
Pizza! Pizza time!

269
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:31,274
- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.

270
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:34,729
Hi. Uh... I'm looking for a, uh...

271
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:47,161
It's perfect.

272
00:18:54,913 --> 00:18:55,832
Boh!

273
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:58,582
- What?
- Boh.

274
00:18:58,607 --> 00:18:59,899
It's the most perfect word in the world.

275
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,847
Italians created it,
and I just discovered it.

276
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:04,072
- What does it mean?
- It means a million things.

277
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:05,864
It can mean I don't know,
get out of my face.

278
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,632
I don't know and get out of my face.

279
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:10,085
It's the best thing Italy created,
except for maybe espresso.

280
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:12,864
Oh, so you've been drinking espresso?

281
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,809
Hey. German? American.

282
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:17,664
- A rose for you.
- Boh.

283
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,609
Whoa.

284
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:22,344
"Boh" is my new superpower.

285
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,898
It's like the anti-"aloha".
I was born to say this word.

286
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,461
So, what's in the bag?

287
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:30,328
Oh, uh... Boh.

288
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,197
Nice.

289
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,559
Whoa, cool.

290
00:19:58,362 --> 00:19:59,330
What was that?

291
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,296
- Betty! You okay?
- Yeah.

292
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,772
- Oh, my God!
- Come on.

293
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:28,484
Guys, we gotta go!

294
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,831
- What is that?
- I don't know.

295
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,718
- What'll you do?
- I left my suit in the hotel room.

296
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:37,277
- Why?
- Because I'm on vacation, Ned!

297
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,301
Everyone's gonna see my face.
Just get them out of here.

298
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:40,491
Just go!

299
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:51,807
Get out of here. Go!

300
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,618
Oh, my God.

301
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:04,750
Come on.

302
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:18,885
Oh, no, you don't.

303
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,807
You okay? Get out of here. Go!

304
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,306
Excuse me, sir!

305
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:25,955
I... I can help. Let me help.

306
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:27,754
I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.

307
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,767
I need to lead it away from the canals.

308
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:59,062
The da Vinci Museum.
This is why we're here in Venice.

309
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,410
Oh, this is it.

310
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:01,785
It's closed.

311
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,586
- What do you mean it's closed? Till when?
- November.

312
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:06,480
You didn't check the website?

313
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:07,697
Oh, that's a good idea.

314
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,090
Oh, come on.

315
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:30,196
Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.

316
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,194
Who is that guy?

317
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,498
I don't know,
but he's kicking that water's ass.

318
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:05,992
Yeah! Yeah!

319
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:23,197
It's aliens. It has to be.

320
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,596
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor
named Morris Bench,

321
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:29,350
who was exposed to an experimental
underwater generator and got hydro powers.

322
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,287
Yeah, you should definitely believe
everything you read on the Internet.

323
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,931
Spider-Man could take him.

324
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:35,116
What do you think it is?

325
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,334
You know, being a man of science...

326
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,396
...witches.

327
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:43,600
No, no, no. We wanna stay.

328
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,462
It's a good thing I packed your suit, huh?

329
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:46,992
I can't believe you forgot it.

330
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,072
Yeah.

331
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:51,162
So who was that guy you were with?
Was that Mr. Strange?

332
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:53,802
Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.

333
00:25:54,145 --> 00:25:55,879
And, no, I don't know who that was.

334
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:57,009
It was a new guy.

335
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,298
- I was trying to help him-
- Happy.

336
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,420
That's my lunch. Don't eat that one.

337
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:01,546
Happy's there?

338
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:03,154
Yeah, it's Happy.

339
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:05,988
He's here. He came by to volunteer.

340
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:08,087
And he's hanging around the office.

341
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,626
- And he wants to say hi.
- I don't want...

342
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,806
Hi, Peter.

343
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,165
Hey, Happy.

344
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,925
Sorry, I'm working real hard here.
I gotta do a... a leaflet drop.

345
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:20,169
- What are you doing...
- Glad you're having a good time.

346
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:22,196
Don't worry, I'm taking care of your aunt.

347
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:26,659
So how's the plan going?

348
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,749
There's been some setbacks, for sure.

349
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:34,274
Don't overthink it.
Just trust your instincts, you'll be fine.

350
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:36,178
I know. Love you. Bye.

351
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:39,881
Who is that guy?

352
00:26:39,906 --> 00:26:41,866
He's Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.

353
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:44,830
He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.

354
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:46,690
What is it with you and Spider-Man?

355
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,832
What? He's just awesome, okay?

356
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:53,077
He protects the neighborhood
and, you know, he's inspiring.

357
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:54,914
He inspires me to be a better man.

358
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,491
What's up, dickwad?

359
00:26:56,516 --> 00:26:57,722
Thought you drowned.

360
00:27:00,877 --> 00:27:02,741
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

361
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:06,405
"L'uomo del misterio" is Italian
for "man of mystery".

362
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,194
They don't actually know who he is.

363
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,713
Mysterio.

364
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:12,087
Cool name.

365
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:14,890
Babe.

366
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:16,948
So how much of that did you actually see?

367
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,017
Not much. I was running.

368
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,327
Right. Me too. I was also running...

369
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:23,085
...away.

370
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,620
So Paris tomorrow.

371
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,974
Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.

372
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,577
I read it was secretly built
as a mind control antenna

373
00:27:32,602 --> 00:27:34,491
to create an army of the insane.

374
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,923
Oh.

375
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:38,150
Which is why
it's my favorite destination on the trip.

376
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,664
What are you gonna do
about the water monster?

377
00:27:44,136 --> 00:27:45,888
Nothing. It's dead.

378
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:48,073
Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

379
00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:50,046
Look, I just wanna spend some time with MJ.

380
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:53,264
We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.

381
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:54,347
That's nice.

382
00:27:54,562 --> 00:27:56,561
Reminds me of when
Betty and I fell in love.

383
00:27:56,586 --> 00:27:58,147
I had just finished my fruit cobbler, and-

384
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:07,444
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

385
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,139
You're Nick Fury.

386
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:14,365
And you just shot Ned.

387
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:16,819
It's just a mild tranquilizer.
He'll be all right.

388
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,766
So good to finally meet you.

389
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:21,821
I saw you at the funeral,

390
00:28:21,846 --> 00:28:24,408
but I didn't think that was a good time
to exchange numbers.

391
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:26,468
No, that would've been inappropriate.

392
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:28,490
- That's what I just said.
- Right.

393
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:31,207
The important thing is, you're here.

394
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:32,631
I tried to bring you here.

395
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:35,444
You avoided me, and now you're here.

396
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:37,072
What a coincidence.

397
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:39,540
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

398
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:42,428
I used to know everything.

399
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:46,311
Then I come back five years later,
and now I know nothing.

400
00:28:46,632 --> 00:28:49,056
No intel, no team.

401
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,444
And a high school kid is dodging my calls.

402
00:28:54,937 --> 00:28:56,384
Here's what I do know...

403
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:04,095
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

404
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:07,835
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

405
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,673
Three days later,
a similar event in Morocco.

406
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:16,928
A village was-

407
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:20,471
Just making the rounds.

408
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:23,907
See if anyone needs any counseling
after today's traumatic events.

409
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:26,460
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

410
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:29,843
Great because I'm...
I'm not qualified to actually...

411
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:31,522
Oh, he's passed out.

412
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:34,618
I'm not qualified to do it anyway,
so good night.

413
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,282
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.

414
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:39,732
You were saying?

415
00:29:39,757 --> 00:29:43,139
A village was destroyed by what
may well be another world-threatening-

416
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:46,207
Babe, you still awake?
You're not answering any of my texts.

417
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:48,053
Um, he's asleep, Betty.

418
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,543
Oh, already?

419
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:51,402
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Okay.

420
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:52,811
That's why it's imperative-

421
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:57,718
Hey, boys. So that canal water today
was filled with dangerous bacteria...

422
00:29:57,743 --> 00:30:01,305
Another person touches that door, you
and I are going to attend another funeral.

423
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:02,182
Suit up.

424
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:04,460
Let me know
if either of you develop vomiting.

425
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:10,529
Stark left these for you.

426
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:11,639
Really?

427
00:30:22,846 --> 00:30:26,405
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

428
00:30:27,603 --> 00:30:31,217
Stark said you wouldn't get that
because it's not a Star Wars reference.

429
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:38,811
You can lose the mask.
Everyone here has seen you without it.

430
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:40,303
You'd only be feigning anonymity

431
00:30:40,328 --> 00:30:42,975
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

432
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:49,416
Come on.

433
00:30:50,344 --> 00:30:51,345
Yeah.

434
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:57,088
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

435
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:00,444
That is Dimitri.

436
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:04,838
And this is Mr. Beck.

437
00:31:07,455 --> 00:31:08,521
Mysterio?

438
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:09,808
What?

439
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:13,799
Doesn't matter.
It's what my friends have been calling you.

440
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:16,775
Well, you can call me Quentin.

441
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:23,303
You handled yourself well out there today.
I saw what you did with the tower.

442
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:25,294
We could use someone like you
on my world.

443
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,576
Thanks.

444
00:31:26,964 --> 00:31:28,464
I'm sorry. Your world?

445
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:32,981
Mr. Beck is from Earth. Just not yours.

446
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:34,788
There are multiple realities, Peter.

447
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:38,014
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

448
00:31:38,658 --> 00:31:41,049
I'm sorry,
you're saying there's a multiverse?

449
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,991
'Cause I thought that was theoretical.

450
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:45,276
That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

451
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,691
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

452
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,826
And how does that even work
with all the quantum...

453
00:31:49,848 --> 00:31:51,020
It's insane.

454
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:55,255
S-Sorry. It's really cool.

455
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,858
Don't ever apologize
for being the smartest one in the room.

456
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,247
Anyway...

457
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,861
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

458
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:12,755
Creatures formed from the primary
elements: Air, water, fire, earth.

459
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,474
The Science Division had a technical name.
We just called them Elementals.

460
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,177
Versions of them exist across
our mythologies.

461
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:22,024
Turns out, the myths are real.

462
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:23,200
Like Thor.

463
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:26,874
Thor was a myth, now I study him
in my physics class.

464
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:29,403
These myths are threats.

465
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:32,334
They first materialized on my Earth
many years ago.

466
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:36,223
We mobilized and fought them, but
with each battle, they grew, got stronger.

467
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:39,435
I was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them.

468
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,601
All we did was delay the inevitable.

469
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,806
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

470
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:46,299
Our satellites confirm it.

471
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:51,040
So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the
other three. There's only one left: fire.

472
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,863
The strongest of them all.
The one that destroyed my Earth.

473
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:58,792
It's the one that took my family.

474
00:33:02,254 --> 00:33:03,520
I'm sorry.

475
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,401
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

476
00:33:06,426 --> 00:33:10,563
We have one mission: kill it.
And you're coming with us.

477
00:33:12,431 --> 00:33:14,025
I'm sorry, did you say Prague?

478
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:19,824
Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime,
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

479
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:23,718
And, I mean, I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

480
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:25,541
Bitch, please. You've been to space.

481
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,757
I know, but that was an accident.

482
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,273
Sir, come on.
There's gotta be someone else you can use.

483
00:33:30,204 --> 00:33:32,072
- What about Thor?
- Off-world.

484
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,780
- Okay, um, Doctor Strange.
- Unavailable.

485
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,929
- Captain Marvel.
- Don't invoke her name.

486
00:33:36,954 --> 00:33:39,041
Sir, look, I really wanna help. I do.

487
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:41,822
If my aunt finds out I left my class trip,
she's gonna kill me.

488
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:44,266
If I'm seen like this in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

489
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,360
my whole class will figure out
who I am, and then...

490
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:49,361
Then the whole world will figure out
who I am, then I'm done.

491
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:53,449
Okay. I understand.

492
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:56,088
I'm sorry, what?

493
00:33:56,113 --> 00:34:00,369
Why don't you get back before your
teachers miss you and become suspicious.

494
00:34:01,448 --> 00:34:04,864
Dimitri.
Take him back to the hotel, please.

495
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:06,308
Yes.

496
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,636
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

497
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,380
And, uh, good luck.

498
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,449
See you, kid.

499
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,231
Yeah, see you.

500
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:18,879
- Bye, ma'am.
- Yeah.

501
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:27,479
Okay, drink lots of water.
I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.

502
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:30,184
- You cannot get sick, okay?
- Okay. Thanks, baby.

503
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:32,144
Hey, man, are you sure you're good?

504
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:33,701
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

505
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:35,226
- Okay. Nice.
- Don't worry.

506
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,161
Seriously, getting tranq'd
in the neck by Nick Fury,

507
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:40,137
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me anyway.

508
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,684
- It is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

509
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:43,678
- I'm happy I don't have to go to Prague.
- Seriously.

510
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:46,238
Good news. We're going to Prague.

511
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,885
- What?
- Prague?

512
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:51,379
Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

513
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,027
You should've heard me on the phone
with them. I really gave them hell.

514
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,464
All I heard was crying.

515
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:59,239
Look at our upgraded ride. Huh?

516
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,238
Wow. I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington.

517
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,562
Oh, come on.

518
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,764
Peter, what... What's going on?

519
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:10,882
I think Nick Fury just hijacked
our summer vacation.

520
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:14,198
I'm, uh, Mr. Harrington to the kids...

521
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,383
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.

522
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:17,453
Awesome.

523
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,406
Yeah. Awesome.

524
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:46,067
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

525
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:48,814
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

526
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:12,744
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

527
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:14,705
Say EDITH."

528
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:19,514
Stand by for retinal and biometric scan.

529
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:22,235
Retinal and biometric scan accepted.

530
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,254
- Hello?
- Hello, Peter.

531
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:29,440
I am EDITH, Tony Stark's augmented-reality
security and defense system.

532
00:36:29,702 --> 00:36:30,983
So he made you for me?

533
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:34,065
No. But you have access to
all of Tony's protocols.

534
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:34,906
Cool.

535
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,909
Would you like to see what I can do?

536
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:46,241
EDITH stands for "Even dead, I'm the hero."

537
00:36:46,266 --> 00:36:47,979
Tony loved his acronyms.

538
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:49,417
Yeah, he did.

539
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:52,845
I have access to the entire
Stark Global Security network,

540
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:54,914
including multiple defense satellites,

541
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:58,353
as well as back doors to
all major telecommunication networks.

542
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:00,269
Whoa.

543
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:06,478
Is MJ texting?

544
00:37:09,378 --> 00:37:12,796
No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it.
That's wrong. That's wrong.

545
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:32,988
Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!

546
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:35,430
Flash Mob,
this is what we doing out here...

547
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:37,304
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

548
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:39,118
Ten minutes, everyone.

549
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:42,528
Dimitri, where exactly are we?

550
00:37:44,726 --> 00:37:47,246
- Okay. I'll figure it out.
- Oh, my gosh, it's so sick.

551
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:48,571
It's beautiful.

552
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:50,507
What?

553
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:04,492
Hello.

554
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:05,937
Close the door.

555
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:11,187
Um...

556
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,207
I'm Peter Parker.

557
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:14,699
Take off your clothes.

558
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,477
Excuse me-

559
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:20,078
You told Fury Spider-Man
cannot be seen in Europe.

560
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,301
So I made you this, another suit.

561
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,554
Oh, uh, thank you.

562
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,242
I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try-

563
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,602
Take off your clothes.

564
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:30,715
Okay.

565
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,898
Sure.

566
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:37,981
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Now. Hurry up.

567
00:38:38,006 --> 00:38:40,007
This is weird.

568
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:44,530
No, no, no. Don't...

569
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,445
Whoa.

570
00:38:47,086 --> 00:38:48,057
Uh...

571
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,467
Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom.

572
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:51,695
This is not what it looks like.

573
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:52,785
- Just...
- Yeah.

574
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,076
- What are you doing?
- I'll leave you two alone.

575
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:56,660
Oh, my God. Don't shoot anybody.

576
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:58,784
Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy.

577
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:01,163
- Hey, man, look, that's...
- Look, Peter,

578
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:03,238
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

579
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,940
If you want to hook up with some random
European chick on our school trip,

580
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:07,911
- that's on you.
- That's not what that was, honestly.

581
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,877
I can't pretend
I didn't see what I just saw.

582
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,270
I know you're trying to get with MJ.
It's obvious.

583
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:13,266
But I like her too.

584
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,192
Wait a minute. Hey, hey. You cannot
show her that photo, dude. Come on.

585
00:39:16,217 --> 00:39:17,780
I'm sorry, man. I have to.

586
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,844
She deserves the truth.

587
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:25,176
Okay, put your one foot in front of the
other, and, everybody, back on the bus.

588
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:26,911
It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!

589
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,412
What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...

590
00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:35,281
EDITH?

591
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,102
Hello, Peter. How can I help you?

592
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,875
Hey. There's this guy in my class
who's gonna ruin everything...

593
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,425
Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you.
Can you please speak up?

594
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,289
Um, Brad Davis. He has a photo of me.

595
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:48,352
Brad Davis. Is he a target?

596
00:39:48,377 --> 00:39:49,820
Is Brad a target? Um...

597
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:57,325
Yeah. He's a target. He's a target.

598
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,387
Copy that.

599
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:01,484
Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.

600
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:02,959
Initiating what, now?

601
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,412
Intercept point determined.
Releasing kill vehicle.

602
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,267
EDITH.

603
00:40:29,825 --> 00:40:31,559
- Oh, my God.
- Dope glasses, Parker.

604
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:32,620
How'd you pay for these?

605
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:33,926
- Flash, give them back.
- No, no, no.

606
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:35,945
- I'm paying you a compliment.
- Please give me...

607
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:38,538
I'm so sorry.

608
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:42,040
EDITH, don't kill Brad.

609
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,379
Peter, do you want me to cancel
the drone strike on Brad Davis?

610
00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:45,688
Did you just punch Flash?

611
00:40:45,712 --> 00:40:46,996
- No.
- Firing.

612
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:51,793
Oh, look out!

613
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,294
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

614
00:40:57,319 --> 00:40:58,497
- EDITH.
- Harrington!

615
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,388
- Is this the autobahn?
- Appears to be.

616
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,060
Commencing second strike.

617
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:06,370
Peter. Plant your fanny in that seat
and buckle up right now.

618
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:07,764
Look at the baby mountain goats!

619
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:10,077
- Baby mountain goats?
- Ooh, I see them.

620
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:26,095
I don't see any mountain goats.

621
00:41:26,493 --> 00:41:28,023
You missed them.

622
00:41:28,048 --> 00:41:30,549
I know you think
none of us have noticed, Peter...

623
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:31,626
What?

624
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,530
...but your new look, I love it.

625
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:36,221
- Right, babe?
- Thanks.

626
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:39,095
Yeah. Sophisticated, classy, very European.

627
00:41:39,317 --> 00:41:40,447
Oh, man.

628
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:43,478
Let's try that again.

629
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,767
Uh, this is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.

630
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:49,571
- I-I...
- Yeah. Weird.

631
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:56,923
Ow.

632
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:21,732
- Whoa, freaking beautiful.
- This is amazing.

633
00:42:22,187 --> 00:42:24,489
Wow, this place is so classy.

634
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:26,166
Yeah, so why are we here?

635
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:29,150
Speak for yourself. I'm home.

636
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:30,935
What can I say?

637
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,607
The squeaky wheel gets the upgrade grease.

638
00:42:33,632 --> 00:42:37,335
Everyone get settled in, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

639
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,865
is Prague's annual Carnival of Lights.

640
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:41,652
Yeah!

641
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:43,255
- Hello?
- Parker, it's Hill.

642
00:42:43,257 --> 00:42:44,556
There's an earpiece with your suit.

643
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:47,081
Put it on and await further instructions.
Understood?

644
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,912
- Uh, yes, ma'am.
- Yeah.

645
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:49,912
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

646
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:54,632
Look, I am so sorry if I seem like
I'm preoccupied with my relationship.

647
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:56,130
I'm still your guy in the chair.

648
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,005
No, it's all good. Don't worry about it.

649
00:42:58,204 --> 00:43:00,208
- Okay. Great, great.
- It's fine.

650
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:03,127
So, what's the status on
the Elemental thing?

651
00:43:03,152 --> 00:43:05,685
- Where's it gonna happen?
- Uh, here in the city.

652
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,089
- Peter, we're here.
- I know, I know. It's not good.

653
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,590
It's... I'm figuring it out.

654
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:13,049
You have to do something, Peter,
please. We're all counting on you.

655
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,853
- Ned.
- Yeah. Yeah, babe.

656
00:43:14,878 --> 00:43:17,262
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

657
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,197
- It's about time.
- Serious?

658
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:20,106
Parker?

659
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,974
- Parker!
- Yes, sir.

660
00:43:22,137 --> 00:43:24,504
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

661
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:26,013
Are we boring you?

662
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,652
He's not bored. He's thinking about
how you kidnapped him.

663
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:30,142
He had obstacles.

664
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,923
I removed them.

665
00:43:31,948 --> 00:43:33,846
They still won't evacuate the city.

666
00:43:34,997 --> 00:43:36,044
Idiots.

667
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,571
So, what's the plan, Parker?

668
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,486
I will be in the cathedral tower,
keeping watch for the fire monster.

669
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:46,441
When that shows up, I will radio you guys,
and then Mr. Beck and I will-

670
00:43:46,466 --> 00:43:48,235
My name is Mysterio.

671
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,093
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

672
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,205
Peter, listen to me.
The best hope you have, the only hope,

673
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,111
is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.

674
00:44:01,743 --> 00:44:03,877
Maneuver it away from civilians
if you can,

675
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:06,846
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

676
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:10,384
If it gets too big, it'll be able to
draw power from the Earth's core.

677
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:12,955
After that, there's no way to stop it.

678
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,129
Hey, my friends are here.

679
00:44:19,454 --> 00:44:21,541
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

680
00:44:21,566 --> 00:44:24,525
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

681
00:44:24,903 --> 00:44:29,244
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

682
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:35,816
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar
A.R. tactical intelligence system,

683
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,923
and the first thing you do with it
is try and blow up your friends.

684
00:44:38,948 --> 00:44:43,838
It's clear to me
that you were not ready for this.

685
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:53,091
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

686
00:44:53,116 --> 00:44:55,403
He just...
He felt bad about snapping at you.

687
00:44:55,428 --> 00:44:56,327
Really?

688
00:44:56,517 --> 00:44:59,121
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

689
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,169
How you feeling?

690
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,607
Uh...

691
00:45:06,711 --> 00:45:09,747
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

692
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,692
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

693
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:17,132
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

694
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:20,341
...and now it's all ruined.

695
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:30,075
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

696
00:45:32,103 --> 00:45:33,450
It's a hard path.

697
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:37,229
You see things. You do things.
You make choices.

698
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:40,177
People look up to you...

699
00:45:41,832 --> 00:45:44,202
...and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

700
00:45:45,337 --> 00:45:47,388
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

701
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,122
There's a part of me
that wants me to tell you, just...

702
00:45:52,537 --> 00:45:54,751
...turn around, run away from all this.

703
00:45:54,776 --> 00:45:58,646
Then there's another part of me
that knows what we're about to fight,

704
00:45:58,648 --> 00:46:01,638
what's at stake, and I'm glad you're here.

705
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,481
Me too.

706
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:06,791
But you're worried about your friends.

707
00:46:06,816 --> 00:46:07,927
Yeah.

708
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:11,481
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

709
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:16,818
Look, just get them inside and keep them
in a safe place for just a few hours.

710
00:46:16,828 --> 00:46:18,163
They'll be all right.

711
00:46:19,615 --> 00:46:24,377
It's really nice to have somebody to
talk to about superhero stuff, you know?

712
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:27,153
Anytime.

713
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:31,913
And, hey, we survive this,
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

714
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:37,044
See you out there.

715
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,152
All right.

716
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:43,489
Scusi.

717
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:45,210
Sorry, that's Italian.

718
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,413
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

719
00:46:51,438 --> 00:46:52,464
Hello, Peter.

720
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:56,177
Hey, uh... I need a way to keep
my friends inside the next few hours.

721
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,802
Let's see what we can do.

722
00:46:57,959 --> 00:46:59,193
Good news.

723
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:01,315
We're going to the opera!

724
00:47:01,442 --> 00:47:02,943
- You're kidding me.
- The opera?

725
00:47:03,178 --> 00:47:04,253
Don't look at me.

726
00:47:04,278 --> 00:47:05,778
What happened to the carnival?

727
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:07,388
This is upgrade living, guys.

728
00:47:07,468 --> 00:47:10,975
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

729
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,943
For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?

730
00:47:13,968 --> 00:47:18,460
No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.

731
00:47:18,694 --> 00:47:21,728
Uh, I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

732
00:47:21,753 --> 00:47:22,927
Thank you, Ned.

733
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:29,311
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,
the best four hours of our whole trip.

734
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:30,836
Four hours?

735
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:33,288
Guys, I think this is gonna be fun.
Seriously.

736
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:39,033
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

737
00:47:39,046 --> 00:47:41,343
Yeah, because we'd much rather
go to a four-hour opera

738
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:43,609
instead of the biggest party in the world.

739
00:47:43,634 --> 00:47:45,781
Again, don't look at me.

740
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:48,035
Parker, do you copy?

741
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,341
Comm check, one, two.

742
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:53,646
Okay, here we are.

743
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:55,598
Beat the rush.

744
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:56,998
Yeah, the rush out.

745
00:47:57,282 --> 00:48:00,485
Lucky for us,
we got the best seats in the house.

746
00:48:01,466 --> 00:48:02,373
Let's go.

747
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:06,112
Hey. I'll save you a seat.

748
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,823
You look really pretty.

749
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:16,679
And therefore, I have value?

750
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:19,491
No. No, that's not what I meant at all.
I was just-

751
00:48:19,516 --> 00:48:20,981
I'm messing with you.

752
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,131
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

753
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:25,855
You look pretty too.

754
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,171
Thank you.

755
00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:29,620
- Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
- So cute.

756
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:31,016
- Can I...
- Yeah.

757
00:48:31,497 --> 00:48:33,604
Want to go in on a pair?

758
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,584
You mean, sit next to each other?

759
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:36,609
Yeah.

760
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:39,089
- Are you in position?
- No.

761
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:40,293
Okay. No...

762
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:41,852
Why the hell not? Parker?

763
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,147
You don't want to sit next to me, or,
no, you just don't want the glasses?

764
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,764
I didn't mean that. Uh, uh...

765
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:49,319
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

766
00:48:50,725 --> 00:48:52,658
I'll save you a seat next to me.

767
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:54,999
- Awesome.
- A lot of seats, so I'll be up there.

768
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:56,960
Okay.

769
00:48:56,985 --> 00:48:59,452
- Parker.
- No, I'm coming. I'm...

770
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:04,371
Hey, I gotta go. Could you tell MJ
that I'm sick or something?

771
00:49:04,396 --> 00:49:06,330
Okay. Be careful.

772
00:49:06,332 --> 00:49:10,304
And Peter, whatever you do, please steer
the monster away from the opera house.

773
00:49:10,765 --> 00:49:12,278
Yeah, Ned, I know.

774
00:49:12,303 --> 00:49:13,336
- Okay.
- Okay?

775
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:14,896
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

776
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:32,431
Parker! You better be on your way.

777
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:34,014
Coming.

778
00:49:40,274 --> 00:49:42,641
Where do you think she's going?
Do you think she's going to the carnival?

779
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:44,864
- Oh, I... I don't...
- We should go. Yes, we should go.

780
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:46,270
Come on, let's go.

781
00:49:46,295 --> 00:49:47,598
Come on.

782
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,531
All right. I'm in position.

783
00:50:05,556 --> 00:50:09,233
Uh, as soon as I see something,
Beck, I'll, uh... I'll let you know.

784
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:10,436
Roger that.

785
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,467
- How's the suit?
- Ah, the suit's great. It's awesome.

786
00:50:14,186 --> 00:50:16,240
It's a little tight around
the old web-shooter.

787
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:18,217
- Parker!
- Okay, I'll shut up.

788
00:50:18,242 --> 00:50:20,799
Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful?

789
00:50:20,824 --> 00:50:23,064
Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.

790
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:26,358
- What's wrong?
- You know, honestly, I just...

791
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:29,151
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should...

792
00:50:29,176 --> 00:50:31,951
I have the perfect thing. Come on.

793
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:44,596
Don't worry, babe. We'll get away
from the crowds, get some fresh air.

794
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:46,324
You'll feel a thousand times better.

795
00:50:51,694 --> 00:50:52,744
Energy spiking.

796
00:50:52,769 --> 00:50:54,060
We have seismic activity.

797
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:08,559
Okay, he's here! Beck, are you ready?
You know what to do.

798
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,279
On your lead, Spider-Man.

799
00:51:16,118 --> 00:51:17,452
No, come back!

800
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:18,935
Come back and help us!

801
00:51:25,714 --> 00:51:26,917
You're up, kid.

802
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:42,198
Wait, wait. Is that...
Do you think that's Spider-Man?

803
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:45,937
Uh-uh. No, no, no.
It's a European rip-off version of him.

804
00:51:45,962 --> 00:51:47,812
I actually read about him the other day.
It's not him.

805
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:04,786
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!
He's getting bigger!

806
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,060
What's his name? What's his name?

807
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:08,908
Uh, it's Night... Night Monkey.

808
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:10,410
- Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

809
00:52:10,435 --> 00:52:12,067
- Yeah.
- Night Monkey!

810
00:52:12,092 --> 00:52:14,007
- Yeah. Night Monkey.
- Night Monkey, help!

811
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:14,880
- Save us!
- What?

812
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:16,536
Night Monkey, we're stuck!

813
00:52:16,561 --> 00:52:18,224
- Oh, no, no.
- Help us! Help!

814
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:34,134
Are you okay?

815
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:39,433
On to Plan B?

816
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:41,919
Yeah! We gotta hit him with something
he can't absorb!

817
00:52:41,944 --> 00:52:43,663
I go left, you go right! Now!

818
00:53:00,461 --> 00:53:01,636
Okay, shoot him!

819
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,871
Yeah!

820
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,479
That hurt him. Keep it coming.

821
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:17,368
Spider-Man, keep your distance.

822
00:53:17,507 --> 00:53:18,743
I'm trying!

823
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:21,517
Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.

824
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:22,986
Okay. I'm on it!

825
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,674
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

826
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,538
Whoa, what is that?

827
00:53:55,554 --> 00:53:56,632
Betty! Betty!

828
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,226
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

829
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:28,369
No, no, no.

830
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:36,247
It's too late.

831
00:54:37,632 --> 00:54:38,867
Whatever happens,

832
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,134
I'm glad we met.

833
00:54:41,566 --> 00:54:43,334
Beck, what are you doing?

834
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:46,887
What I should have done last time.

835
00:54:51,695 --> 00:54:52,925
Beck, don't do it!

836
00:54:57,675 --> 00:54:58,656
Beck!

837
00:55:19,017 --> 00:55:20,305
Mr. Beck?

838
00:55:23,366 --> 00:55:24,695
Oh, thank God.

839
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:36,985
I would totally kiss you, but I think
I just threw up in my mouth a little.

840
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:42,072
I-I might have a mint.

841
00:55:44,098 --> 00:55:45,229
So it's over?

842
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:46,775
That was the last of them.

843
00:55:47,003 --> 00:55:49,564
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

844
00:55:50,149 --> 00:55:53,236
We need to stay vigilant.

845
00:55:53,905 --> 00:55:56,507
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

846
00:55:56,532 --> 00:56:00,041
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

847
00:56:00,284 --> 00:56:01,775
You should join us.

848
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:06,341
Thank you.
I just might take you up on that.

849
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:20,036
You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

850
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:21,091
Mr. Fury, I-

851
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:23,287
I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

852
00:56:24,526 --> 00:56:28,075
But you got to decide
whether you're going to step up or not.

853
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:33,049
Stark chose you. He made you an Avenger.

854
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,877
I need that.

855
00:56:35,623 --> 00:56:37,990
The world needs that.

856
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:40,575
Maybe Stark was wrong.

857
00:56:43,595 --> 00:56:44,731
Was he?

858
00:56:47,014 --> 00:56:48,635
The choice is yours.

859
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,795
Let's get a drink.

860
00:57:07,914 --> 00:57:09,334
I'm not 21.

861
00:57:16,578 --> 00:57:17,515
Hey.

862
00:57:20,172 --> 00:57:22,640
You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

863
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:23,843
Yeah.

864
00:57:25,152 --> 00:57:26,539
Fury was right.

865
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:31,734
Tony did a lot for me,
so I owe it to him, to everybody.

866
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:33,789
Do you?

867
00:57:33,961 --> 00:57:35,687
Yeah. I mean...

868
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,476
Mr. Stark gave me the chance to be more.

869
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:44,070
He wanted me to be better than him.
And Fury just wants me to live up to that.

870
00:57:44,095 --> 00:57:45,648
What do you want, Peter?

871
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,717
What do you mean?

872
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,151
What do you want?

873
00:57:49,945 --> 00:57:51,078
I don't know.

874
00:57:51,195 --> 00:57:52,787
What do you want? Peter Parker. Now.

875
00:57:52,812 --> 00:57:55,507
- I know you're thinking about it.
- I wanna go on my trip, right?

876
00:57:55,532 --> 00:57:57,733
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

877
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:01,104
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

878
00:58:01,129 --> 00:58:04,401
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel and...

879
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:08,116
- ...and give her a kiss.
- Whoa.

880
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:09,585
Shut up, man.

881
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:11,807
You're not gonna do that, are you?

882
00:58:11,832 --> 00:58:13,343
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

883
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,570
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

884
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,289
- Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
- What are those?

885
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:22,147
- Are those the...
- EDITH glasses, yeah.

886
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:23,406
It was on the floor?

887
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,719
Try them on. Let's see how they look.

888
00:58:25,744 --> 00:58:26,712
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

889
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:32,359
I actually really like them.

890
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,883
Can I be completely honest with you?

891
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:34,895
Please.

892
00:58:35,156 --> 00:58:36,675
They look really stupid.

893
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:37,945
Oh.

894
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,521
But maybe they have a contact-lens version.

895
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:42,036
You try them on.

896
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:43,928
- No, come on.
- Try them on.

897
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:45,973
- I don't wanna try them on.
- Just put them on.

898
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:55,207
What do you think, kid?

899
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:02,203
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

900
00:59:03,317 --> 00:59:05,580
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

901
00:59:05,693 --> 00:59:06,746
What?

902
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:11,035
Stark left me a message with those glasses:
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

903
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:13,723
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

904
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:15,624
He knew every mistake I ever made.

905
00:59:15,649 --> 00:59:18,382
He must've known
I wasn't ready for something like this.

906
00:59:18,407 --> 00:59:19,808
Why would he give it to you?

907
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:23,175
Maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,
he just trusted me to pick who should.

908
00:59:23,595 --> 00:59:25,996
It makes so much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

909
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,749
And he's not gonna give them to Fury
because Fury would give himself EDITH.

910
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,255
You're probably right about that.

911
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,938
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

912
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,557
And it's not gonna be me.
I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

913
00:59:37,582 --> 00:59:40,333
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

914
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:42,701
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

915
00:59:43,389 --> 00:59:46,469
No. Peter, come on. No.

916
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:50,326
- EDITH?
- Hello, Peter.

917
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:52,289
Hi. Yeah, um...

918
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,074
I'd like to transfer your control
over to Quentin Beck.

919
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:57,419
Peter, what are you doing?

920
00:59:57,443 --> 00:59:58,834
Doing the right thing.

921
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,059
Any transfer will require confirmation.

922
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,972
Stark gave you the glasses.

923
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,168
Stark gave me a choice.
It's my choice to make. I'm gonna make it.

924
01:00:06,193 --> 01:00:08,894
Look, you're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

925
01:00:08,919 --> 01:00:11,956
You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?

926
01:00:11,981 --> 01:00:13,457
He'd want you to have them.

927
01:00:13,661 --> 01:00:15,293
Waiting for confirmation.

928
01:00:15,318 --> 01:00:16,223
Confirm.

929
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:21,701
Welcome to the Avengers.

930
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:31,202
They look good on you.

931
01:00:32,888 --> 01:00:33,905
Thank you.

932
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:35,800
It's an honor.

933
01:00:36,193 --> 01:00:37,099
Yeah.

934
01:00:38,555 --> 01:00:40,561
Mr. Stark would've really liked you.

935
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,060
Where you headed?

936
01:00:43,065 --> 01:00:44,459
I'm gonna go find MJ.

937
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:48,369
Good luck, kid. I'll give you a
fifty-fifty chance. You're pretty awkward.

938
01:00:49,335 --> 01:00:50,498
Yeah.

939
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,077
- See you later, man.
- See you.

940
01:01:25,422 --> 01:01:27,078
See? That wasn't so hard.

941
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:28,443
Yes!

942
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:32,250
Somebody get this stupid costume off me!

943
01:01:39,735 --> 01:01:42,297
Okay, we got EDITH.
Get these connected to our system.

944
01:01:42,626 --> 01:01:45,026
Toast! Toast! Toast!

945
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:47,548
This is a big win,
but we still got a lot of work to do.

946
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,662
Toast! Toast! Toast!

947
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:50,953
Yeah!

948
01:01:51,393 --> 01:01:53,133
Okay, toasts!

949
01:01:53,926 --> 01:01:55,224
Give me that, Doug.

950
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:59,128
To the man who brought us all together,
our former boss, Tony Stark.

951
01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:00,553
Boo!

952
01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:01,862
The jester king.

953
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:08,871
Literally wrapped in wealth and
technology that he was unfit to wield.

954
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:11,144
Like the holographic system I designed.

955
01:02:11,169 --> 01:02:14,007
A revolutionary breakthrough
with limitless applications

956
01:02:14,031 --> 01:02:17,277
that Tony turned into
a self-therapy machine and renamed

957
01:02:17,302 --> 01:02:20,777
 Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF.

958
01:02:24,024 --> 01:02:27,993
Oh, $611 million
for my little therapeutic experiment.

959
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,597
He renamed my life's work... "BARF".

960
01:02:32,622 --> 01:02:36,189
I told him it was a mistake,
that my technology could change the world.

961
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:39,108
And then...

962
01:02:39,983 --> 01:02:41,272
...he fired me.

963
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:44,058
Said I was...

964
01:02:45,383 --> 01:02:46,686
...unstable.

965
01:02:48,412 --> 01:02:49,477
To Tony.

966
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:51,180
To Tony!

967
01:02:51,782 --> 01:02:52,935
Next, to William.

968
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,873
William!

969
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:58,695
Tony Stark was able to
build this in a cave!

970
01:02:58,712 --> 01:03:00,812
With a box of scraps!

971
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:05,466
The integration of my illusion tech
with your weaponized drones was brilliant.

972
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:08,216
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

973
01:03:08,241 --> 01:03:10,343
- And it's just the beginning.
- Thank you, brother.

974
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:11,588
To Guterman.

975
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,923
- Guterman!
- To Guterman!

976
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:15,714
The story you created of a soldier
from another Earth named Quentin

977
01:03:15,739 --> 01:03:19,072
fighting space monsters in Europe
is totally ridiculous

978
01:03:19,097 --> 01:03:21,991
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

979
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,577
I mean, everybody bought it.

980
01:03:23,602 --> 01:03:25,336
- Gutes!
- Guterman!

981
01:03:25,338 --> 01:03:27,249
- To Victoria.
- To Victoria!

982
01:03:27,274 --> 01:03:29,703
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

983
01:03:29,727 --> 01:03:32,109
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

984
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:33,544
Inspired idea.

985
01:03:33,742 --> 01:03:35,824
- To Janice.
- Janice!

986
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,027
After Tony died,
she was the one who discovered

987
01:03:38,052 --> 01:03:42,385
that EDITH was being handed over
not to us, not to the Defense Department,

988
01:03:42,387 --> 01:03:43,555
but to a child.

989
01:03:43,557 --> 01:03:45,222
- Thank you.
- To Janice!

990
01:03:45,247 --> 01:03:47,780
And to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone.

991
01:03:48,137 --> 01:03:51,138
There's a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

992
01:03:51,163 --> 01:03:53,581
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

993
01:03:53,606 --> 01:03:56,210
the most qualified, and no one cares.

994
01:03:56,235 --> 01:03:59,785
Unless you're flying around with a cape
or shooting lasers from your hands,

995
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:02,558
no one will even listen.

996
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:07,790
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

997
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:10,929
With our technology and with EDITH,

998
01:04:10,954 --> 01:04:15,746
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

999
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,117
Yeah!

1000
01:04:17,142 --> 01:04:19,842
Then everyone will listen!

1001
01:04:21,642 --> 01:04:24,515
Not to a boozy man-child.

1002
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,929
No!

1003
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:28,812
Not to a hormonal teenager.

1004
01:04:28,837 --> 01:04:30,366
No!

1005
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,062
To me...

1006
01:04:32,293 --> 01:04:35,327
...and to my very wealthy crew.

1007
01:04:35,796 --> 01:04:36,815
To us.

1008
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,907
To us.

1009
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:39,274
To Mysterio!

1010
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:40,998
To Mysterio!

1011
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,188
To Peter Parker.

1012
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:43,915
To Peter Parker!

1013
01:04:45,145 --> 01:04:46,390
Poor kid.

1014
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:49,737
Let's get to work.

1015
01:04:53,601 --> 01:04:55,467
- Peter, oh, my God.
- Hey. Hey.

1016
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:57,825
- We almost died.
- It's fine. It's fine.

1017
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:59,662
Hey, guess what. I'm done with the mission.

1018
01:04:59,664 --> 01:05:01,974
- Dude, the trip's over.
- What?

1019
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:03,980
There's monsters coming out
of the ground everywhere we go.

1020
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:05,663
Of course our parents will want us home.

1021
01:05:05,688 --> 01:05:07,168
Please don't put me on hold.

1022
01:05:07,192 --> 01:05:08,812
Oh, Peter, you're not dead.

1023
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:10,804
Oh, my God. Yes, good. Stay here.

1024
01:05:10,829 --> 01:05:13,577
Don't... Put some clothes on.
We're booking flights.

1025
01:05:13,804 --> 01:05:16,257
We came for science,
we're leaving because of witches.

1026
01:05:16,282 --> 01:05:17,894
Welcome to the new Dark Ages.

1027
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,324
What is going on, dude?

1028
01:05:21,356 --> 01:05:22,595
We're going home in the morning.

1029
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,765
No, no, no. All the Elementals are gone.

1030
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,756
- Ned.
- Coming, sweetie.

1031
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,093
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm live-streaming.

1032
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:32,572
Yeah.

1033
01:05:32,707 --> 01:05:33,632
Hey.

1034
01:05:34,812 --> 01:05:35,597
Hey.

1035
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:36,866
Where were you?

1036
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,901
Um, I got lost.

1037
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,482
We were worried about you.

1038
01:05:40,576 --> 01:05:41,631
Oh.

1039
01:05:41,656 --> 01:05:43,323
Good thing you're back. Hm.

1040
01:05:43,348 --> 01:05:44,333
Yeah.

1041
01:05:44,676 --> 01:05:46,176
So much for Paris, right?

1042
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:47,652
It would've been fun.

1043
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,421
Yeah. Night.

1044
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:50,197
Night.

1045
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:52,718
You look ni-

1046
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:01,657
Okay.

1047
01:06:03,007 --> 01:06:03,628
Oh.

1048
01:06:03,652 --> 01:06:05,015
- Hey.
- Hey.

1049
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:07,253
Uh, look, um...

1050
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:10,474
I'm not ready for this trip
to be over yet, and

1051
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,934
I kind of want to do something fun

1052
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:16,816
that's not on the itinerary or planned
or with Mr. Harrington.

1053
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:17,929
Yes.

1054
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,769
"Yes", like you wanna go?

1055
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,077
Yes.

1056
01:06:23,419 --> 01:06:25,945
Okay. Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

1057
01:06:25,989 --> 01:06:27,757
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1058
01:06:28,984 --> 01:06:30,464
- Five is good.
- Okay.

1059
01:06:30,618 --> 01:06:31,999
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1060
01:06:47,912 --> 01:06:48,979
- Hey.
- Hey.

1061
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:51,589
- So where do you wanna go?
- Who cares?

1062
01:06:51,613 --> 01:06:53,288
- Awesome. Let's go.
- Okay.

1063
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:02,493
- I'm glad we're doing this.
- Yeah, me too.

1064
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,393
To see the city a bit.

1065
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:07,931
They used to execute people on this bridge.

1066
01:07:07,956 --> 01:07:11,710
They would put them in a basket,
and they would drown in the water.

1067
01:07:13,883 --> 01:07:16,038
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1068
01:07:17,364 --> 01:07:18,452
Uh...

1069
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:24,694
There's this thing I've been wanting to
talk to you about for a while.

1070
01:07:26,532 --> 01:07:27,700
Yeah?

1071
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:34,374
It's our last night in Europe, and
I had this plan that I wanted to tell you.

1072
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:36,491
I'm just gonna tell you.

1073
01:07:36,516 --> 01:07:37,609
Uh...

1074
01:07:38,563 --> 01:07:39,468
MJ, I-

1075
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:40,654
"I'm Spider-Man."

1076
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:43,219
What?

1077
01:07:43,244 --> 01:07:45,148
That's what you were gonna say.
That you're Spider-Man.

1078
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:49,544
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1079
01:07:50,023 --> 01:07:53,288
I mean, I've been watching you
for a while now.

1080
01:07:53,546 --> 01:07:55,210
Kind of obvious.

1081
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,914
I'm not Spider-Man. What would
make you think that I was Spider-Man?

1082
01:07:59,939 --> 01:08:01,859
- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?

1083
01:08:01,975 --> 01:08:05,727
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1084
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:08,810
No, I was sick. Remember?
I had my... The tummy?

1085
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,765
You know, Susan Yang thinks
you're a male escort.

1086
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,603
What? No, of course I'm not a male escort.

1087
01:08:12,628 --> 01:08:13,946
Then you're Spider-Man.

1088
01:08:13,971 --> 01:08:16,019
No, I'm not Spider-Man at all.

1089
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:17,157
What about tonight?

1090
01:08:17,182 --> 01:08:19,470
You snuck off and you fought that thing.
I saw you.

1091
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,876
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1092
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:24,618
And also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1093
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:27,820
- The Night Monkey?
- Yeah. That's what it said on the news,

1094
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,595
and the news never lies.

1095
01:08:31,563 --> 01:08:33,063
Night Monkey. Okay.

1096
01:08:33,753 --> 01:08:34,844
What are you doing?

1097
01:08:36,642 --> 01:08:39,658
Well, do the Night Monkey and
Spider-Man use the same webs?

1098
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:42,424
I mean, maybe.

1099
01:08:42,699 --> 01:08:44,962
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey. Who knows?

1100
01:08:49,387 --> 01:08:52,437
Were you only watching me
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1101
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:56,523
Yeah.

1102
01:08:57,596 --> 01:08:59,437
Why else would I be watching you?

1103
01:09:01,652 --> 01:09:04,531
Doesn't matter. Just thought that maybe-

1104
01:09:10,595 --> 01:09:11,964
What the hell was that?

1105
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:15,098
I don't know.

1106
01:09:26,124 --> 01:09:28,725
What is it, some kind of projector
or something?

1107
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:32,343
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1108
01:09:32,673 --> 01:09:34,778
I-It looked so real.

1109
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,226
Yeah, really real.

1110
01:09:37,878 --> 01:09:39,493
Wait, does that mean that...

1111
01:09:39,517 --> 01:09:41,079
The Elementals are fake?

1112
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:44,520
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1113
01:09:44,545 --> 01:09:47,547
There was fire and destruction, and...

1114
01:09:49,255 --> 01:09:51,070
Who would do something like that?

1115
01:10:00,544 --> 01:10:01,929
Mysterio.

1116
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:10,382
I am Spider-Man. And I've really messed up.

1117
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:12,938
Wait. You're b-being serious right now?

1118
01:10:12,963 --> 01:10:13,548
Mm-hm.

1119
01:10:13,572 --> 01:10:16,001
You're not joking with me. You're 100
percent serious? Because it's not funny.

1120
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:17,118
No, I'm not joking.

1121
01:10:17,143 --> 01:10:19,306
Because I was...
I was only like 67 percent sure.

1122
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:20,064
MJ...

1123
01:10:20,088 --> 01:10:22,559
So why are you here?
Why are you on this school trip?

1124
01:10:22,584 --> 01:10:24,345
MJ, look,
I know you have a lot of questions,

1125
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,143
but look,
we really have to get out of here, okay?

1126
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,396
Okay. Okay.
I can't believe I figured it out!

1127
01:10:31,566 --> 01:10:33,462
You took everything from me!

1128
01:10:34,499 --> 01:10:36,142
This is for my family!

1129
01:10:42,817 --> 01:10:43,951
Pause.

1130
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:46,681
Pause.

1131
01:10:46,706 --> 01:10:48,782
Uh... Sorry.

1132
01:10:49,485 --> 01:10:52,189
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1133
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:53,611
Yep. Stand by.

1134
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,314
All right, fly, fly, fly,
zap, zap, zap.

1135
01:11:00,864 --> 01:11:01,691
Pause.

1136
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,322
I'm not in love with this choreography,
but it'll do.

1137
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:05,415
Kill image.

1138
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:07,306
De-cloak drones.

1139
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:10,414
All right, weapons.

1140
01:11:10,579 --> 01:11:12,384
- You want to weaponize?
- Yep.

1141
01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:14,282
Weapons only. Stand by.

1142
01:11:23,441 --> 01:11:24,478
Nice.

1143
01:11:24,776 --> 01:11:25,758
Stop.

1144
01:11:26,762 --> 01:11:29,337
Something. I don't know what it is.
It's something...

1145
01:11:29,362 --> 01:11:31,189
Just dou... You know what?

1146
01:11:31,886 --> 01:11:33,952
Double the damage
and then run it again.

1147
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:35,689
You want me to double it up?

1148
01:11:35,714 --> 01:11:37,056
- Yeah.
- All right.

1149
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:38,212
Cover your ears.

1150
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:49,215
Whoo! That is good! That's good.

1151
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:52,254
- We on schedule?
- Oh, yeah.

1152
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:54,780
Uploading software hack to EDITH network.

1153
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:58,332
With her drones, we'll create an event
big enough to cover an entire city.

1154
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:01,947
Well done. Make sure every drone is
weapons-hot. We need maximum damage.

1155
01:12:01,966 --> 01:12:04,441
- Gonna cause a lot of casualties.
- Oh, yeah.

1156
01:12:04,466 --> 01:12:07,387
More casualties, more coverage.
I gotta cut through the static.

1157
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:10,229
London's a beautiful city,
it'll suffer, but they can rebuild.

1158
01:12:10,254 --> 01:12:15,332
If I'm the next Iron Man, I need to save
the world from an Avengers-level threat.

1159
01:12:16,304 --> 01:12:22,496
But when its new savior descends,
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1160
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:25,855
Janice, you'll be in position with my
quick-change armor for the victory lap?

1161
01:12:26,182 --> 01:12:27,539
Of course. You wanna try-

1162
01:12:27,564 --> 01:12:28,633
No, that's...

1163
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:30,957
What's going on with my hand?
Why is that happening?

1164
01:12:31,099 --> 01:12:34,633
Oh, one of the drones that came back from
the plaza was missing a projector.

1165
01:12:34,658 --> 01:12:35,492
It's fine.

1166
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:39,428
Wait, and you're...
You're telling me this now?

1167
01:12:39,453 --> 01:12:42,874
It's... It's one drone.
The image will be perfect, I promise.

1168
01:12:42,912 --> 01:12:44,312
That projector is evidence.

1169
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:46,855
It's gonna tell people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.

1170
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:51,000
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,
including Nick Fury,

1171
01:12:51,025 --> 01:12:54,676
who happens to be the most paranoid
and most dangerous person on the planet.

1172
01:12:54,701 --> 01:12:57,906
And if he catches on before I've killed
him, he will put a bullet in my head.

1173
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:00,328
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1174
01:13:02,513 --> 01:13:03,918
Right?

1175
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:07,905
William, can you look at me?

1176
01:13:10,126 --> 01:13:11,293
Pull up EDITH.

1177
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:14,347
Hello, Quentin.

1178
01:13:14,372 --> 01:13:18,086
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,
full-resource protocol for this device.

1179
01:13:18,255 --> 01:13:19,256
Magnifying.

1180
01:13:20,557 --> 01:13:23,511
There. Search everything
going in and out of that building.

1181
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,254
Located.

1182
01:13:26,624 --> 01:13:27,793
Shit.

1183
01:13:30,929 --> 01:13:35,871
You know, William, one day, after I've
had to kill Peter Parker because of this,

1184
01:13:35,896 --> 01:13:39,837
I hope you remember that
his blood is on your hands!

1185
01:13:43,023 --> 01:13:46,446
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.
How could I be that stupid?

1186
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:50,095
He's probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1187
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,876
You had access to killer drones?

1188
01:13:52,901 --> 01:13:55,943
Yeah, I didn't really want them,
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1189
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,148
You almost killed Brad?

1190
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,961
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury
and tell him that Beck's a fraud,

1191
01:14:00,986 --> 01:14:03,228
but I think he tapped my phone.

1192
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:04,783
Okay, so what are you gonna do?

1193
01:14:05,243 --> 01:14:10,282
I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin
and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1194
01:14:14,192 --> 01:14:15,883
Uh... Just...

1195
01:14:35,307 --> 01:14:36,722
Oh, Ned, perfect.

1196
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:38,777
The costume looks great...

1197
01:14:40,068 --> 01:14:42,066
...for the costume party at the...

1198
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:43,855
...prince's castle.

1199
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,316
She knows. I told her.

1200
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:47,910
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1201
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:51,371
Oh. That's cool.

1202
01:14:51,396 --> 01:14:52,667
Like, a long time ago.

1203
01:14:53,664 --> 01:14:54,331
Oh.

1204
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,122
Look, Mysterio is a fraud.

1205
01:14:56,503 --> 01:14:58,417
But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1206
01:14:58,442 --> 01:15:00,542
No, he's been faking the thing
with illusion tech.

1207
01:15:00,567 --> 01:15:03,067
Yeah, he's using these,
like, hologram projectors.

1208
01:15:03,092 --> 01:15:05,792
Whoa. That's... crazy.

1209
01:15:05,985 --> 01:15:07,020
Yeah.

1210
01:15:09,032 --> 01:15:12,217
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1211
01:15:12,242 --> 01:15:13,568
It's been mostly me.

1212
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,207
Look, Ned, I need you to call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1213
01:15:16,232 --> 01:15:19,410
say she wanted me to stay with family
in Berlin until this blows over, okay?

1214
01:15:19,435 --> 01:15:20,746
Got it. Easy.

1215
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:23,029
Wow, you guys lie with such ease.

1216
01:15:23,722 --> 01:15:24,955
I gotta go.

1217
01:15:25,027 --> 01:15:27,167
Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1218
01:15:27,192 --> 01:15:28,730
You're gonna need this.

1219
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,727
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1220
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,476
So you know too.

1221
01:15:43,069 --> 01:15:47,516
It's cool. I've known first, and I've known
longer, but it's not a competition.

1222
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:10,628
Excuse me. Do you know where...

1223
01:16:10,653 --> 01:16:12,511
- Nacht Monkey!
- No, wait, I didn't...

1224
01:16:12,531 --> 01:16:13,577
Oh, man.

1225
01:16:16,687 --> 01:16:17,655
Get in.

1226
01:16:24,139 --> 01:16:25,036
Mr. Fury...

1227
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:27,354
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1228
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:29,646
- No, no, no, listen.
- Wait until we're secure.

1229
01:16:30,216 --> 01:16:31,239
Okay.

1230
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:37,684
Right.

1231
01:17:03,226 --> 01:17:07,497
So is there anything you want
to tell us about your girlfriend?

1232
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:09,136
He's talking about EDITH.

1233
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:12,257
Look, I know I made a mistake and I'm
sorry, but he is not who you think he is.

1234
01:17:12,282 --> 01:17:15,007
Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals,
it's all fake.

1235
01:17:15,032 --> 01:17:16,718
He has some sort of illusion tech.

1236
01:17:16,743 --> 01:17:19,585
And that's how he tricked you guys,
and me into giving him EDITH.

1237
01:17:20,021 --> 01:17:23,785
It's a projector. I pulled it off
the fire monster in Prague.

1238
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:28,747
So all that death and destruction
we witnessed was created by this?

1239
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:31,206
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1240
01:17:31,616 --> 01:17:36,285
Well, if this is true, then Beck's very
dangerous and we need to be smart.

1241
01:17:36,393 --> 01:17:38,030
Who else did you tell about this?

1242
01:17:38,855 --> 01:17:39,913
Parker?

1243
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:41,250
Parker!

1244
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:42,284
What's wrong?

1245
01:17:42,308 --> 01:17:43,858
It's Beck. He's here.

1246
01:17:43,914 --> 01:17:44,968
What?

1247
01:17:45,249 --> 01:17:46,397
Hill?

1248
01:17:51,636 --> 01:17:52,731
No, it's just an illu-

1249
01:17:54,227 --> 01:17:55,229
Fury!

1250
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:02,317
Wow, Peter, wow.

1251
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:04,927
I thought we were close.

1252
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:08,645
Fury always had to die, but not you.

1253
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,111
Stop hiding, Beck!

1254
01:18:12,633 --> 01:18:16,302
I tried to help you walk away.
Now you're making me do this.

1255
01:18:21,586 --> 01:18:24,333
You told me, you were just a kid.

1256
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:28,709
You told me,
you wanted to run after that girl.

1257
01:18:28,716 --> 01:18:29,747
- Help me!
- MJ!

1258
01:18:31,884 --> 01:18:32,849
Oh, God!

1259
01:18:34,934 --> 01:18:36,755
Peter, what's going on?

1260
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,113
I know this isn't real.

1261
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:39,343
Do you, though?

1262
01:18:40,904 --> 01:18:41,755
MJ!

1263
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,341
MJ!

1264
01:18:46,676 --> 01:18:48,802
I don't think you know what's real, Peter.

1265
01:19:02,585 --> 01:19:03,841
You need to wake up!

1266
01:19:27,154 --> 01:19:29,219
I mean, look at yourself.

1267
01:19:39,023 --> 01:19:43,686
You are just a scared little kid
in a sweat suit.

1268
01:19:44,937 --> 01:19:49,777
I created Mysterio to give the world
someone to believe in.

1269
01:19:49,967 --> 01:19:54,176
I control the truth. Mysterio is the truth.

1270
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:22,089
If you were good enough,
maybe Tony would still be alive.

1271
01:20:34,315 --> 01:20:37,738
Deep down, you know I'm right.

1272
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:51,048
You made your choice.

1273
01:20:51,432 --> 01:20:53,593
And all you had to do was step aside.

1274
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,695
And now you have...

1275
01:21:09,426 --> 01:21:10,454
Fury.

1276
01:21:10,915 --> 01:21:15,757
Beck's people are trying to find everyone
who could expose him.

1277
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:17,890
Who'd you tell?

1278
01:21:18,322 --> 01:21:20,742
I know you told someone,
so just tell me.

1279
01:21:20,767 --> 01:21:22,508
- Okay.
- Who did you tell?

1280
01:21:22,725 --> 01:21:24,056
Who else did you tell?

1281
01:21:24,081 --> 01:21:25,806
Just Ned and MJ from my class.

1282
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:28,204
Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,
but that's it.

1283
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:30,641
What?

1284
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:33,298
You are so gullible.

1285
01:21:33,783 --> 01:21:35,822
- What?
- You're smart as a whip.

1286
01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:37,115
Just a...

1287
01:21:37,982 --> 01:21:39,125
...sucker.

1288
01:21:39,805 --> 01:21:41,578
And now all your friends have to die.

1289
01:21:41,603 --> 01:21:42,656
Oh, my God.

1290
01:21:47,037 --> 01:21:50,204
It's easy to fool people
when they're already fooling themselves.

1291
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:57,122
But for what it's worth, Peter,

1292
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:59,942
I really am sorry.

1293
01:22:09,774 --> 01:22:10,983
- EDITH.
- Yes, Quentin.

1294
01:22:11,008 --> 01:22:13,366
Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.

1295
01:22:14,661 --> 01:22:16,881
I need them to fly home from London.

1296
01:22:56,462 --> 01:22:57,363
Hi.

1297
01:22:58,479 --> 01:22:59,644
Where am I?

1298
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:01,707
Municipal holding facility.

1299
01:23:02,006 --> 01:23:04,706
They said they found you unconscious
at the train yard.

1300
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:05,963
Very dangerous.

1301
01:23:05,988 --> 01:23:09,160
And we gave you the shirt
because you seemed a bit cold.

1302
01:23:09,523 --> 01:23:10,567
Thanks.

1303
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,197
You guys are nice.

1304
01:23:15,403 --> 01:23:17,105
You speak really good English.

1305
01:23:17,217 --> 01:23:19,301
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1306
01:23:19,983 --> 01:23:22,402
- I'm in the Netherlands right now?
- Yep.

1307
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:24,793
Bye.

1308
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:27,160
Guard!

1309
01:23:27,185 --> 01:23:29,707
The guard is on a break.
Probably talking to his wife.

1310
01:23:29,731 --> 01:23:30,973
Yeah, she's pregnant.

1311
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:32,473
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1312
01:23:40,676 --> 01:23:41,707
Yeah.

1313
01:23:42,257 --> 01:23:43,332
Yeah.

1314
01:23:43,962 --> 01:23:46,106
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1315
01:23:50,845 --> 01:23:52,082
You guys okay?

1316
01:24:04,553 --> 01:24:05,986
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

1317
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:07,482
Could I borrow your phone?

1318
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:08,525
Yeah.

1319
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:11,525
Everyone is so nice here.

1320
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:14,072
Okay.

1321
01:24:18,731 --> 01:24:19,939
Okay.

1322
01:24:21,516 --> 01:24:22,928
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

1323
01:24:22,952 --> 01:24:24,590
Hey, hey, uh...

1324
01:24:25,592 --> 01:24:28,278
I messed up. I need a... I need a ride.

1325
01:24:29,218 --> 01:24:30,247
Where am I?

1326
01:24:30,271 --> 01:24:31,676
Where am I, sir?

1327
01:24:31,701 --> 01:24:33,418
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1328
01:24:35,845 --> 01:24:37,895
Hang on. Could you say that into there?

1329
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,072
Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1330
01:24:41,832 --> 01:24:43,158
Yeah, no problem.

1331
01:24:44,018 --> 01:24:45,145
Thanks.

1332
01:24:45,697 --> 01:24:46,632
Did you get that?

1333
01:25:08,067 --> 01:25:10,611
Peter? Are you okay?

1334
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:11,963
Happy, is that you?

1335
01:25:11,987 --> 01:25:13,533
Is it me... Yeah, of course it's me.

1336
01:25:13,572 --> 01:25:14,556
Stop!

1337
01:25:15,345 --> 01:25:17,140
Tell me something only you would know.

1338
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:19,923
Only I would know. Uh...

1339
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:23,916
Remember we went to Germany?
You pay-per-viewed a video in your room?

1340
01:25:23,941 --> 01:25:25,017
They didn't list titles,

1341
01:25:25,042 --> 01:25:27,666
but I could tell by the price
it was an adult film at the front desk.

1342
01:25:27,691 --> 01:25:30,269
- And you didn't know how I knew...
- Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.

1343
01:25:33,391 --> 01:25:35,158
It's so good to see you.

1344
01:25:36,455 --> 01:25:38,697
Peter, you'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1345
01:25:40,014 --> 01:25:41,556
Okay, hold still.

1346
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:42,978
There we go.

1347
01:25:49,171 --> 01:25:50,371
Ouch.

1348
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:52,082
I thought you had super strength.

1349
01:25:52,107 --> 01:25:53,313
It still hurts.

1350
01:25:55,939 --> 01:25:57,814
- Happy, come on.
- All right, relax.

1351
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:01,232
Just a few more. There we go.

1352
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:02,215
Oh, my God.

1353
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,041
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1354
01:26:04,066 --> 01:26:06,435
How can I relax when I messed up so bad?

1355
01:26:07,231 --> 01:26:09,525
I trusted Beck. Right?

1356
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:13,485
I thought he was my friend, so I gave him
the only thing Mr. Stark left for me,

1357
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:15,564
and now he's gonna kill my friends
and half of Europe,

1358
01:26:15,589 --> 01:26:17,932
so please do not tell me to relax.

1359
01:26:20,469 --> 01:26:22,791
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1360
01:26:26,393 --> 01:26:27,939
I just really miss him.

1361
01:26:28,832 --> 01:26:30,334
Yeah, I miss him too.

1362
01:26:33,316 --> 01:26:34,947
Everywhere I go...

1363
01:26:35,939 --> 01:26:37,189
...I see his face.

1364
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:42,072
And the whole world is asking
who's gonna be the next Iron Man...

1365
01:26:44,784 --> 01:26:47,595
And I don't know if that's me, Happy.
I'm not Iron Man.

1366
01:26:50,025 --> 01:26:51,619
You're not Iron Man.

1367
01:26:52,413 --> 01:26:54,313
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1368
01:26:56,229 --> 01:27:00,052
Nobody could live up to Tony.
Not even Tony.

1369
01:27:01,536 --> 01:27:04,627
Tony was my best friend. And he was a mess.

1370
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:08,408
He second-guessed everything he did.
He was all over the place.

1371
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:12,502
The one thing that he did that
he didn't second-guess was picking you.

1372
01:27:14,443 --> 01:27:17,909
I don't think Tony would have done
what he did

1373
01:27:17,934 --> 01:27:20,600
if he didn't know that
you were gonna be here after he was gone.

1374
01:27:22,884 --> 01:27:27,377
Now, your friends are in trouble,
you're all alone, your tech is missing.

1375
01:27:29,188 --> 01:27:30,963
What are you gonna do about it?

1376
01:27:36,368 --> 01:27:38,000
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1377
01:27:38,025 --> 01:27:41,049
I mean, right now.
Specifically, what are we gonna do?

1378
01:27:41,074 --> 01:27:43,923
We've been hovering over a tulip field
for the last 15 minutes.

1379
01:27:43,948 --> 01:27:46,900
Right. I can't call my friends
because he's tracking their phones.

1380
01:27:47,406 --> 01:27:48,637
Give me your phone.

1381
01:27:48,662 --> 01:27:49,963
- My cell phone?
- Yeah.

1382
01:27:49,988 --> 01:27:51,588
Okay. Here.

1383
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:53,255
What's your password?

1384
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,278
"Password".

1385
01:27:54,303 --> 01:27:55,659
No, what is your password?

1386
01:27:55,684 --> 01:27:57,409
"Password", the word spelled out.

1387
01:27:57,434 --> 01:27:59,479
You're the head of security,
and your password is "password"?

1388
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,885
I don't feel good about it, either.

1389
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:04,237
Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you?
I'm gonna be in London soon.

1390
01:28:04,262 --> 01:28:05,987
- They're in London.
- London, okay.

1391
01:28:06,012 --> 01:28:07,253
Yeah, I need a suit.

1392
01:28:07,278 --> 01:28:08,487
Suit?

1393
01:28:29,777 --> 01:28:31,095
Okay, um...

1394
01:28:31,728 --> 01:28:34,127
bring up everything you have on Spider-Man.

1395
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:43,923
Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no.

1396
01:28:51,671 --> 01:28:52,658
What?

1397
01:28:52,683 --> 01:28:53,892
Nothing.

1398
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:56,782
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1399
01:29:00,839 --> 01:29:02,674
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.

1400
01:29:08,256 --> 01:29:10,743
Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?

1401
01:29:12,102 --> 01:29:16,069
Isolate the Taser webs, and
reconfigure and boost the voltage

1402
01:29:16,096 --> 01:29:22,040
to a factor of 25 percent, and give me
complete manual control over detonation.

1403
01:29:25,043 --> 01:29:28,298
I thought Kree having sleeper cells
was top secret information.

1404
01:29:28,323 --> 01:29:31,189
Nick, satellites are picking up
an EM pulse.

1405
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,623
I thought that was over.

1406
01:29:32,651 --> 01:29:33,829
It's the biggest one yet.

1407
01:29:33,854 --> 01:29:35,506
- Where?
- London.

1408
01:29:35,643 --> 01:29:38,144
Okay, the company set up a city tour,

1409
01:29:38,169 --> 01:29:40,736
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1410
01:29:43,527 --> 01:29:46,128
Is no one else gonna
acknowledge how crazy this is?

1411
01:29:46,153 --> 01:29:50,204
Oh, yeah, I get it. There's been nothing
scientific about this science tour at all.

1412
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:53,946
No, no, I'm talking about Peter.
Has no one noticed how shady he is?

1413
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:57,584
I saw him in the back room of a rest stop
with some woman in his underwear,

1414
01:29:57,609 --> 01:30:01,142
and he's always sneaking away,
like back at the opera, huh?

1415
01:30:01,167 --> 01:30:04,618
Now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?

1416
01:30:04,643 --> 01:30:07,259
Is no one else here
interested in the truth?

1417
01:30:08,492 --> 01:30:12,168
"The very concept of objective truth
is fading out of the world."

1418
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:14,349
George Orwell. Thank you, MJ.

1419
01:30:14,374 --> 01:30:19,607
Yeah. Well, since Peter's not really here
to tell his truth, what about you, Brad?

1420
01:30:19,632 --> 01:30:21,965
Why do you think it's cool to take pictures
of people in the bathroom?

1421
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:23,756
Yeah, dude, what's that about?

1422
01:30:23,781 --> 01:30:25,746
No, no, no,
it wasn't like that. It was...

1423
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,638
I was trying to take a-

1424
01:30:27,663 --> 01:30:32,664
Let's put all this craziness behind us
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1425
01:30:32,815 --> 01:30:36,313
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"
said the class. Okay.

1426
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:39,638
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1427
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:42,264
You gotta stop doing that, okay?
'Cos that's weird.

1428
01:30:42,509 --> 01:30:46,750
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls. Okay?

1429
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:49,384
- Look at this.
- Mr. Harrington, this is your bus.

1430
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:52,454
- We got a bus all to ourselves.
- Nice to see you all. Come along.

1431
01:30:52,889 --> 01:30:55,189
- I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
- Thank you.

1432
01:30:55,214 --> 01:30:56,673
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1433
01:30:57,114 --> 01:30:58,376
All right.

1434
01:30:58,842 --> 01:31:00,360
I have the kids.

1435
01:31:04,602 --> 01:31:07,240
I got here as fast as I could.
I did a full perimeter sweep.

1436
01:31:07,716 --> 01:31:08,720
Nothing.

1437
01:31:09,677 --> 01:31:10,579
Damn it.

1438
01:31:13,087 --> 01:31:14,286
Pulse is spiking.

1439
01:31:14,311 --> 01:31:15,501
I'll take another look.

1440
01:31:15,526 --> 01:31:17,359
Soon as you see something, report.

1441
01:31:17,771 --> 01:31:19,423
You're all we've got, Beck.

1442
01:31:20,032 --> 01:31:22,702
If this is what I fear,
then God help us, Fury.

1443
01:31:23,837 --> 01:31:25,415
God help us all.

1444
01:31:26,604 --> 01:31:28,637
Okay people, no Avengers coming.
We're good to go.

1445
01:31:28,662 --> 01:31:31,321
- William, launch the drones.
- Copy that, brother.

1446
01:31:31,488 --> 01:31:34,314
Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.

1447
01:31:40,682 --> 01:31:42,892
- Excellent. Janice?
- Still working on the cape.

1448
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:46,094
Get those wrinkles out. In a few hours,
I could be shaking hands with the queen.

1449
01:31:46,119 --> 01:31:47,687
- Guterman?
- Almost in position.

1450
01:31:47,712 --> 01:31:49,727
- Okay. Hit it, Victoria.
- Increasing pulse.

1451
01:31:52,267 --> 01:31:55,373
Whatever this is, it's 100 times bigger
than the previous ones.

1452
01:31:55,398 --> 01:31:56,321
EDITH?

1453
01:31:56,714 --> 01:31:58,048
Yes, Quentin.

1454
01:31:58,411 --> 01:32:00,103
Show me my loose ends.

1455
01:32:00,763 --> 01:32:03,821
Once the show's going,
execute the kill order on my command.

1456
01:32:03,846 --> 01:32:05,048
- Copy.
- All right.

1457
01:32:05,073 --> 01:32:06,376
Start the show.

1458
01:32:08,136 --> 01:32:10,172
Let's save the world, people.

1459
01:32:12,447 --> 01:32:14,430
I don't like this.
Something's definitely up.

1460
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,173
You're an FOS now.

1461
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:21,250
"Friend of Spider-Man".
And you have to remember, just stay calm.

1462
01:32:25,016 --> 01:32:26,537
That doesn't look good.

1463
01:32:26,759 --> 01:32:28,826
But it's fake,
so there's nothing to worry about.

1464
01:32:29,087 --> 01:32:32,423
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1465
01:32:33,019 --> 01:32:34,650
Great work, Guterman.

1466
01:32:37,173 --> 01:32:37,806
What?

1467
01:32:37,831 --> 01:32:39,338
Happy here. Happy Hogan here...

1468
01:32:39,362 --> 01:32:40,432
I know. What do you want?

1469
01:32:40,457 --> 01:32:42,509
...over at Mr. Stark's,
going through his belongings.

1470
01:32:42,534 --> 01:32:44,782
Apparently, there was a surfboard
you left behind.

1471
01:32:44,807 --> 01:32:46,640
- What?
- People said they didn't think

1472
01:32:46,665 --> 01:32:48,860
Nick Fury was a surfer, I said,
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1473
01:32:48,885 --> 01:32:51,689
It's not mine.
And don't ever call this number again.

1474
01:33:00,393 --> 01:33:02,521
Okay, Fury's got the coded message.

1475
01:33:03,073 --> 01:33:04,906
- Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.
- Okay.

1476
01:33:04,931 --> 01:33:06,966
Your boy called it London Bridge,
but I figured it out.

1477
01:33:06,991 --> 01:33:08,990
- I'm gonna go scoop them up, okay?
- Yeah.

1478
01:33:09,015 --> 01:33:10,341
- We're close.
- We're close.

1479
01:33:10,366 --> 01:33:11,826
- How's the suit?
- Almost done.

1480
01:33:11,851 --> 01:33:13,154
- Good.
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

1481
01:33:13,179 --> 01:33:17,583
Before you go, if something happens to me,
could you please give this to MJ?

1482
01:33:17,665 --> 01:33:19,932
You'll gonna make it back.
Give it to her yourself.

1483
01:33:19,957 --> 01:33:21,451
- You got this.
- I got this.

1484
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:22,638
Walk me through it.

1485
01:33:22,728 --> 01:33:23,982
I know it's illusion tech.

1486
01:33:24,007 --> 01:33:27,287
All I have to do is get inside
the illusion, then I can take it down,

1487
01:33:27,312 --> 01:33:30,303
find him, and he's just a guy,
so I can take EDITH right back.

1488
01:33:30,328 --> 01:33:32,693
Right, but last time,
you got hit by a train.

1489
01:33:33,072 --> 01:33:35,519
True, but this time...

1490
01:33:35,821 --> 01:33:38,987
How do I explain this? Uh...
I have a sixth sense.

1491
01:33:39,161 --> 01:33:40,287
The Peter-tingle.

1492
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,677
That's what you're talking about, right?

1493
01:33:42,702 --> 01:33:43,856
It's not working, though.

1494
01:33:43,881 --> 01:33:45,848
I heard it wasn't working now.
Is it?

1495
01:33:45,873 --> 01:33:47,935
It is working.
Well, I don't know if it's working...

1496
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,072
Okay, so you've got the Peter-tingle.
That's the plan.

1497
01:33:50,097 --> 01:33:53,271
I'm gonna go get your friends.
You get that Peter-tingle back online.

1498
01:33:54,069 --> 01:33:55,236
I got this. I got this.

1499
01:34:09,562 --> 01:34:10,595
Cue the lightning.

1500
01:34:10,824 --> 01:34:12,095
Cuing lightning.

1501
01:34:17,546 --> 01:34:21,569
Sir, is it still safe on the top,
or should we all come down?

1502
01:34:21,758 --> 01:34:22,692
Oh, my.

1503
01:34:24,706 --> 01:34:25,882
What did the bus driver say?

1504
01:34:25,907 --> 01:34:27,358
The bus driver's gone.

1505
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:28,952
- What?
- Where?

1506
01:34:28,977 --> 01:34:31,593
It's okay.
Mr. Dell and I have it under control!

1507
01:34:31,618 --> 01:34:33,611
No, no, no. Don't drag me into this, Roger.

1508
01:34:33,636 --> 01:34:35,655
I'm doing my best, Julius!

1509
01:34:36,222 --> 01:34:38,233
- Look...
- Oh, the witches are back.

1510
01:34:38,578 --> 01:34:40,687
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1511
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:48,021
Okay, follow me, kids.

1512
01:35:05,474 --> 01:35:08,342
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1513
01:35:25,014 --> 01:35:26,750
This way. This way!

1514
01:35:26,849 --> 01:35:28,281
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1515
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:30,109
- Flash!
- Follow that hand.

1516
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,881
This way, kids. Follow me.

1517
01:35:31,906 --> 01:35:35,075
- It's not real, it's not real!
- It looks real to me!

1518
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:36,297
Follow me, kids!

1519
01:35:37,446 --> 01:35:38,903
Earth, wind, fire, water.

1520
01:35:38,928 --> 01:35:41,759
Oh, no. They joined forces 
like the Power Rangers.

1521
01:35:41,784 --> 01:35:43,727
- You're thinking of Voltron.
- Who?

1522
01:35:43,752 --> 01:35:45,609
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1523
01:35:45,634 --> 01:35:48,425
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!
He's gonna save us!

1524
01:35:52,088 --> 01:35:53,914
Wait, if Mysterio knows we know...

1525
01:35:53,939 --> 01:35:55,969
- Then we're in danger.
- Yeah, and so are they.

1526
01:35:55,994 --> 01:35:57,195
We should go.

1527
01:35:58,812 --> 01:36:00,181
Kill that witch! Ba-bow!

1528
01:36:01,701 --> 01:36:03,914
This is for my family!

1529
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:07,853
You should get somewhere safe, Fury.

1530
01:36:07,878 --> 01:36:09,544
I don't see this ending well.

1531
01:36:09,569 --> 01:36:13,617
I appreciate your concern, 
but I never leave my men behind.

1532
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:17,159
All right, comms check.
Can you hear me, kid?

1533
01:36:17,192 --> 01:36:19,041
Yeah, I can. It's a little loud out here.

1534
01:36:19,066 --> 01:36:20,765
- I like the new suit.
- Thanks.

1535
01:36:20,932 --> 01:36:23,188
Whoa, Peter, you sure that's not real?

1536
01:36:23,213 --> 01:36:25,742
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1537
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:26,811
Still the play?

1538
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:29,805
Uh-huh. We need to get high enough
so Beck doesn't see me coming.

1539
01:36:29,831 --> 01:36:31,245
Copy. Stay sticky.

1540
01:36:34,952 --> 01:36:36,798
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah, kid. What is it?

1541
01:36:36,823 --> 01:36:39,230
We need to have a conversation
about you and my aunt!

1542
01:36:54,523 --> 01:36:56,230
Beck, report!

1543
01:36:56,605 --> 01:36:58,945
Hey, Guterman. I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1544
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:02,391
"It's all the Elementals.
They've somehow merged into something..."

1545
01:37:02,416 --> 01:37:04,594
...into something else.
Something more powerful.

1546
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:06,922
It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.

1547
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,563
See, now, that's some bullshit.

1548
01:37:17,063 --> 01:37:18,104
Is that...

1549
01:37:22,641 --> 01:37:24,180
Be ready for anything.

1550
01:37:24,309 --> 01:37:25,305
Yeah.

1551
01:37:31,593 --> 01:37:33,134
It's not real, it's not real, 
it's not real!

1552
01:37:37,988 --> 01:37:39,541
Whoa.

1553
01:37:40,185 --> 01:37:41,619
That's awesome.

1554
01:38:07,422 --> 01:38:09,475
William, 
I've got drones breaking formation.

1555
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,819
Maybe they hit a flock of birds 
or something. You're fine.

1556
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:13,912
I wanna see what's happening now.
Taking manual control.

1557
01:38:20,609 --> 01:38:22,058
Do you see anything?

1558
01:38:22,701 --> 01:38:25,534
Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.

1559
01:38:30,694 --> 01:38:31,592
I hope this works.

1560
01:38:48,592 --> 01:38:49,619
You got me?

1561
01:38:54,529 --> 01:38:55,752
I got you.

1562
01:38:56,101 --> 01:38:57,970
Boss, the illusion is coming apart.

1563
01:39:01,462 --> 01:39:02,470
I see you.

1564
01:39:06,681 --> 01:39:08,497
- EDITH, give me protection.
- Copy.

1565
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:24,857
Kill it. Just kill the illusion. Kill it.

1566
01:39:24,882 --> 01:39:26,411
I'm not gonna. They'll see.

1567
01:39:26,436 --> 01:39:28,872
They'll see what I want them to see!

1568
01:39:28,904 --> 01:39:30,081
Do you still need the cape?

1569
01:39:30,105 --> 01:39:31,051
Yes, Janice.

1570
01:39:32,035 --> 01:39:33,393
I still need the cape.

1571
01:39:33,417 --> 01:39:34,178
Done.

1572
01:39:36,912 --> 01:39:39,591
- Now render my illusion suit.
- All right, hang on.

1573
01:39:39,616 --> 01:39:41,755
The monster was full of drones! It's crazy!

1574
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:42,983
There you are.

1575
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:47,997
Easy.

1576
01:39:51,891 --> 01:39:53,325
Who the hell is that?

1577
01:39:54,866 --> 01:39:56,036
- Ned!
- Happy!

1578
01:39:56,725 --> 01:39:58,759
I gotta get you out of here!
Get on the jet!

1579
01:39:58,784 --> 01:39:59,607
Who are you?

1580
01:39:59,632 --> 01:40:01,693
I work with Spider-Man, okay?
You gotta get on that jet.

1581
01:40:01,718 --> 01:40:02,880
You work for Spider-Man?

1582
01:40:02,905 --> 01:40:04,911
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1583
01:40:08,337 --> 01:40:10,437
- New plan. Into the Tower.
- What?

1584
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:11,725
Happy, are you okay?

1585
01:40:11,762 --> 01:40:13,462
Yeah, we're okay. Just go get Beck.

1586
01:40:13,487 --> 01:40:15,611
- EDITH, target Spider-Man.
- Copy.

1587
01:40:20,612 --> 01:40:22,567
I'll just kill the kids myself.

1588
01:40:27,577 --> 01:40:28,521
Whoa!

1589
01:40:37,189 --> 01:40:38,524
There you are.

1590
01:40:41,008 --> 01:40:42,742
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1591
01:40:42,767 --> 01:40:44,635
- Yeah, go, go, go!
- Come on.

1592
01:40:48,715 --> 01:40:50,313
- Go!
- Into the vault!

1593
01:40:50,338 --> 01:40:52,286
The walls are 8 feet thick.
Go into the vault!

1594
01:40:52,311 --> 01:40:53,609
- What?
- Into the vault. Go!

1595
01:40:56,429 --> 01:40:57,827
Take cover!

1596
01:41:29,466 --> 01:41:30,701
I see you.

1597
01:41:33,158 --> 01:41:34,094
Get that thing out...

1598
01:41:39,314 --> 01:41:40,008
Go!

1599
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:48,693
How does Cap do that?

1600
01:41:58,978 --> 01:42:02,145
Happy, say something please,
to let me know you're alive!

1601
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:04,746
- I'm here. I'm here.
- Happy, thank God.

1602
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,372
I bought us some time,

1603
01:42:07,595 --> 01:42:08,629
but not much.

1604
01:42:08,654 --> 01:42:11,114
I'm trying to get to Beck,
but I can't shake these drones!

1605
01:42:26,007 --> 01:42:27,318
Gotcha.

1606
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:49,880
Going up!

1607
01:43:27,741 --> 01:43:28,741
Finally.

1608
01:43:28,977 --> 01:43:30,422
Hey, William, how we doing?

1609
01:43:30,447 --> 01:43:32,390
Illusion almost back up.

1610
01:43:33,241 --> 01:43:35,093
I don't know how you're gonna spin this.

1611
01:43:49,961 --> 01:43:51,230
Oh, great. No webs.

1612
01:44:05,075 --> 01:44:07,278
- Are we gonna die?
- Nobody dies on my watch.

1613
01:44:09,902 --> 01:44:12,958
I wasted my life playing video games,
and we're gonna die.

1614
01:44:13,499 --> 01:44:16,684
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1615
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:20,083
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1616
01:44:20,108 --> 01:44:24,614
Hey, if it wasn't for those stupid videos,
Spider-Man would've never found you.

1617
01:44:25,424 --> 01:44:28,993
Spider-Man... Spider-Man follows me?
I saved us, guys.

1618
01:44:29,018 --> 01:44:30,724
If you saved us, 
then why are we about to die?

1619
01:44:30,749 --> 01:44:32,215
- MJ!
- Stop it!

1620
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,645
I'm sorry, okay?

1621
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:36,882
I'm obsessed with telling the truth
even if it hurts other people's feelings.

1622
01:44:38,104 --> 01:44:40,137
I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.

1623
01:44:44,264 --> 01:44:45,475
We're sharing, right?

1624
01:45:24,533 --> 01:45:26,133
Your lies are over, Beck.

1625
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:30,672
This certainly isn't ideal,
but I have contingencies.

1626
01:45:30,856 --> 01:45:31,672
EDITH?

1627
01:45:40,174 --> 01:45:41,997
Just give me the glasses.

1628
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:43,973
You want these?

1629
01:45:46,138 --> 01:45:47,144
Come and get them.

1630
01:45:57,186 --> 01:45:58,577
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1631
01:46:23,361 --> 01:46:24,921
Why aren't these drones firing?

1632
01:46:24,946 --> 01:46:26,813
You're in the strike zone.
The chance of getting hit is-

1633
01:46:26,838 --> 01:46:30,710
No, fire all the drones now!

1634
01:46:49,189 --> 01:46:50,181
Beck!

1635
01:46:54,615 --> 01:46:55,321
Beck.

1636
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:57,603
You lied to me.

1637
01:46:58,404 --> 01:46:59,892
And I trusted you.

1638
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:00,899
I know.

1639
01:47:01,266 --> 01:47:04,985
That's the most... disappointing part.

1640
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,518
You're a good person, Peter.

1641
01:47:10,744 --> 01:47:12,462
Such a weakness.

1642
01:47:14,579 --> 01:47:16,165
Stark was right.

1643
01:47:16,891 --> 01:47:18,231
You do deserve them.

1644
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:32,114
You can't trick me anymore.

1645
01:47:35,648 --> 01:47:37,396
EDITH, turn off the drones.

1646
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:41,654
Biometric scan complete.
Welcome back, Peter.

1647
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:43,849
Shall I execute all cancellation protocols?

1648
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:45,966
Do it. Execute them all.

1649
01:47:45,991 --> 01:47:46,952
Confirmed.

1650
01:47:55,831 --> 01:47:57,147
Give me the spear.

1651
01:47:58,144 --> 01:47:59,333
That's a halberd.

1652
01:48:04,469 --> 01:48:05,647
Thank you.

1653
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:11,436
How could you do all of this?

1654
01:48:12,089 --> 01:48:13,225
You'll see, Peter.

1655
01:48:14,607 --> 01:48:17,804
People, they need to believe.

1656
01:48:19,365 --> 01:48:20,843
And nowadays...

1657
01:48:23,113 --> 01:48:24,999
...they'll believe anything.

1658
01:48:35,784 --> 01:48:37,185
Is he...

1659
01:48:38,404 --> 01:48:39,806
Is this real?

1660
01:48:41,043 --> 01:48:42,999
All illusions are down, Peter.

1661
01:48:58,090 --> 01:48:59,499
Whoo! Yeah!

1662
01:48:59,715 --> 01:49:01,382
Hey, where you going?

1663
01:49:09,070 --> 01:49:10,306
- MJ.
- Hey.

1664
01:49:11,253 --> 01:49:12,424
- Hey.
- Hey.

1665
01:49:12,449 --> 01:49:14,022
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

1666
01:49:14,047 --> 01:49:15,600
- Yeah. 
- Yeah.

1667
01:49:15,624 --> 01:49:18,210
- Is everybody else okay?
- Yeah, everyone's okay.

1668
01:49:19,419 --> 01:49:21,835
- What happened?
- There was just the drones,

1669
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:24,721
and they were following us,
and then they just stopped.

1670
01:49:26,717 --> 01:49:28,241
- Was that you?
- Yeah.

1671
01:49:29,561 --> 01:49:31,097
Did you get him?

1672
01:49:33,927 --> 01:49:35,780
- Yeah.
- Well, I, um...

1673
01:49:36,975 --> 01:49:38,374
...brought that.

1674
01:49:39,366 --> 01:49:41,194
In case you needed some help.

1675
01:49:41,287 --> 01:49:42,624
Thanks.

1676
01:49:44,537 --> 01:49:49,428
Anyway, uh, there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.

1677
01:49:49,453 --> 01:49:51,487
I think he works for you or something.

1678
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:52,740
He, um...

1679
01:49:53,005 --> 01:49:54,318
He gave me this.

1680
01:49:55,759 --> 01:49:56,849
No.

1681
01:49:58,329 --> 01:49:59,622
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.

1682
01:49:59,641 --> 01:50:01,495
- I had this stupid plan.
- Peter.

1683
01:50:01,838 --> 01:50:02,877
I wrote it all down,

1684
01:50:02,902 --> 01:50:04,752
I was gonna buy you this 
and give it to you in Paris at the top-

1685
01:50:09,274 --> 01:50:10,709
And you kissed me.

1686
01:50:10,734 --> 01:50:12,747
- What? What?
- Yeah.

1687
01:50:13,559 --> 01:50:17,956
I don't really have much luck 
when it comes to getting close to people.

1688
01:50:19,704 --> 01:50:21,380
Um... So I lied.

1689
01:50:23,066 --> 01:50:27,096
I wasn't just watching you 
because I thought you were Spider-Man.

1690
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:32,896
That's great.

1691
01:50:34,482 --> 01:50:37,016
- Black dahlia, like the murder.
- The murder.

1692
01:50:37,041 --> 01:50:38,513
- Good.
- Yeah. Heh.

1693
01:50:39,279 --> 01:50:40,927
Sorry it's broken.

1694
01:50:41,106 --> 01:50:43,213
I actually like it better broken.

1695
01:50:44,826 --> 01:50:46,299
I really like you.

1696
01:50:47,764 --> 01:50:49,233
I really like you too.

1697
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:51,410
Uh...

1698
01:51:03,391 --> 01:51:05,332
Uh. Okay. I should...

1699
01:51:05,438 --> 01:51:08,534
I should probably get back to the class.

1700
01:51:08,559 --> 01:51:09,648
I'll go and...

1701
01:51:11,485 --> 01:51:13,207
- Yeah. Heh. I don't know.
- Heh. Okay.

1702
01:51:14,978 --> 01:51:16,046
Just in case.

1703
01:51:23,993 --> 01:51:25,172
Yeah, no.

1704
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:28,647
No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1705
01:51:28,672 --> 01:51:30,839
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.

1706
01:51:31,028 --> 01:51:32,274
I gotta go.

1707
01:51:33,861 --> 01:51:36,875
I'm glad you're alive.
I guess the coded message worked.

1708
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:39,172
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1709
01:51:39,631 --> 01:51:42,065
I'm surprised
you didn't just wink in the camera.

1710
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:43,118
It worked.

1711
01:51:43,143 --> 01:51:45,844
Only because I had serious doubts
about Beck from the beginning.

1712
01:51:45,869 --> 01:51:47,633
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1713
01:51:51,173 --> 01:51:52,273
Where's Parker?

1714
01:51:52,587 --> 01:51:53,657
He's with a girl.

1715
01:51:53,682 --> 01:51:55,891
I need to speak with him.

1716
01:51:56,828 --> 01:51:58,110
He'll call you.

1717
01:51:58,135 --> 01:51:59,016
He'll...

1718
01:52:03,142 --> 01:52:05,275
Okay. Great.

1719
01:52:05,581 --> 01:52:06,751
Well, he better.

1720
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:08,300
Or it's your ass.

1721
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:12,532
And don't even think about ghosting me.

1722
01:52:29,871 --> 01:52:31,925
Are you sure
no one else has figured it out?

1723
01:52:31,950 --> 01:52:35,128
Yeah, it's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.

1724
01:52:36,089 --> 01:52:36,925
Ouch.

1725
01:52:37,244 --> 01:52:38,659
Except for me.

1726
01:52:39,032 --> 01:52:40,135
Aw. Thanks.

1727
01:52:40,304 --> 01:52:41,831
- Don't be late.
- I won't.

1728
01:52:41,856 --> 01:52:42,933
See you later.

1729
01:52:42,958 --> 01:52:45,417
- You guys are so cute.
- Thanks.

1730
01:52:45,442 --> 01:52:46,406
Uh...

1731
01:52:46,949 --> 01:52:50,870
I was thinking we should all go on
a double date or something.

1732
01:52:50,895 --> 01:52:53,362
Oh, we broke up.

1733
01:52:53,387 --> 01:52:55,019
No. What? Why?

1734
01:52:55,044 --> 01:52:57,503
Men and women grow apart,

1735
01:52:57,521 --> 01:53:00,703
but the journey they share together
will always be a part of them.

1736
01:53:02,027 --> 01:53:04,456
- You are so wise.
- Thank you.

1737
01:53:07,378 --> 01:53:08,816
Hello, Gerald.

1738
01:53:09,769 --> 01:53:11,605
Could Mother not make it?

1739
01:53:13,405 --> 01:53:14,253
Hmm.

1740
01:53:17,817 --> 01:53:19,198
- May!
- I promise you... Ah!

1741
01:53:19,223 --> 01:53:21,394
Oh, he's here. Don't give me a ticket.

1742
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:25,582
- Heh. Ah.
- Ooh. I'm so glad you're okay.

1743
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:29,027
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.

1744
01:53:29,052 --> 01:53:30,851
Let's go. Where are your bags?

1745
01:53:30,876 --> 01:53:33,035
- Oh, right. They got blown up. 
- Yeah.

1746
01:53:34,372 --> 01:53:36,543
- I got you hot buttered bagels.
- Thank you so much.

1747
01:53:36,567 --> 01:53:37,722
I know my boy.

1748
01:53:37,747 --> 01:53:41,113
I kept my identity pretty guarded
this past couple years.

1749
01:53:41,138 --> 01:53:45,605
I faced a lot of deception.
And I'm tired of the lies.

1750
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:48,035
So it's time for the truth to be out there.

1751
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:52,253
Are you dating?

1752
01:53:53,317 --> 01:53:54,714
- Yes.
- Not really.

1753
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:57,355
- What?
- Well...

1754
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:59,070
- I think...
- Summer fling.

1755
01:53:59,245 --> 01:54:01,483
Yes, that evolves and grows like any other.

1756
01:54:01,508 --> 01:54:03,274
I still don't know where it's going.

1757
01:54:03,299 --> 01:54:04,668
Open to wherever it might lead.

1758
01:54:04,693 --> 01:54:06,863
- Anywhere. On or off.
- To share it with people...

1759
01:54:06,888 --> 01:54:08,800
We'll always be friends, no matter what.

1760
01:54:08,825 --> 01:54:10,855
I'm gonna go because I've got a date.

1761
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,441
...because we all are interconnected.

1762
01:54:13,466 --> 01:54:14,665
- Bye.
- We are.

1763
01:54:27,779 --> 01:54:28,710
Whoo!

1764
01:54:33,408 --> 01:54:34,452
Sorry!

1765
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:40,616
Whoa!

1766
01:54:41,798 --> 01:54:42,761
Whoa.

1767
01:54:45,964 --> 01:54:46,788
Whoo!

1768
01:54:54,235 --> 01:54:56,312
Whoo-hoo!

1769
01:55:11,314 --> 01:55:12,964
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

1770
01:55:13,238 --> 01:55:14,421
It's fine.

1771
01:55:14,445 --> 01:55:15,788
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1772
01:55:15,812 --> 01:55:17,001
You're gonna love this.

1773
01:55:17,026 --> 01:55:18,992
Okay! Okay!

1774
01:55:19,072 --> 01:55:20,922
- Okay. Okay.
- You ready?

1775
01:55:20,947 --> 01:55:24,214
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch.

1776
01:55:26,071 --> 01:55:29,157
I should stop looking. 
I'm gonna stop looking!

1777
01:55:29,772 --> 01:55:30,860
Whoo!

1778
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:47,736
Okay. You can put me down now!
You can put me down now!

1779
01:57:50,058 --> 01:57:51,126
You okay?

1780
01:57:53,062 --> 01:57:53,947
Uh...

1781
01:57:54,469 --> 01:57:57,037
Whoo! Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1782
01:57:57,249 --> 01:57:59,775
Let's just...
Never, never doing that again.

1783
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,744
- I'm never doing that again.
- Okay.

1784
01:58:01,769 --> 01:58:03,570
I should probably get out of here.

1785
01:58:03,595 --> 01:58:05,197
- Be safe. 
- See you later.

1786
01:58:08,272 --> 01:58:10,294
This is breaking news.

1787
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:13,483
We come with revelations about
last week's attack in London.

1788
01:58:13,508 --> 01:58:15,630
An anonymous source
provided this video.

1789
01:58:15,655 --> 01:58:20,426
It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio,
moments before his death.

1790
01:58:20,642 --> 01:58:22,911
A warning, you may find
this video disturbing.

1791
01:58:22,936 --> 01:58:26,735
I managed to send the Elemental through the
rift, but I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1792
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:28,723
Spider-Man attacked me for some reason.

1793
01:58:28,748 --> 01:58:31,313
He has an army of weaponized drones,
Stark technology,

1794
01:58:31,338 --> 01:58:34,251
saying he's the only one who's gonna be
the new Iron Man. No one else.

1795
01:58:34,888 --> 01:58:37,418
Are you sure you want to commence
the drone attack?

1796
01:58:37,443 --> 01:58:39,137
There will be significant casualties.

1797
01:58:39,162 --> 01:58:41,262
Do it. Execute them all.

1798
01:58:45,584 --> 01:58:48,624
This shocking video 
was released earlier today

1799
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:51,440
on the controversial news website 
TheDailyBugle.net.

1800
01:58:51,465 --> 01:58:52,519
There you have it, folks,

1801
01:58:52,544 --> 01:58:58,118
conclusive proof that Spider-Man was
responsible for the murder of Mysterio,

1802
01:58:58,131 --> 01:59:01,806
an interdimensional warrior who
gave his life to protect our planet

1803
01:59:01,838 --> 01:59:07,164
and who will no doubt go down in history
as the greatest superhero of all time.

1804
01:59:07,923 --> 01:59:09,407
But that's not all, folks.

1805
01:59:09,691 --> 01:59:12,782
Here's the real blockbuster.
Brace yourselves. You might wanna sit down.

1806
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:14,980
Spider-Man's real...
Spider-Man's real name is-

1807
01:59:18,075 --> 01:59:21,105
Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.

1808
01:59:21,962 --> 01:59:23,149
What the f-

1809
02:07:31,269 --> 02:07:32,778
You gotta tell him.

1810
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:36,893
It was fine.

1811
02:07:36,918 --> 02:07:40,731
The little boy handled it. We helped.

1812
02:07:40,807 --> 02:07:41,570
Talos.

1813
02:07:41,571 --> 02:07:44,461
Come off it. How was I supposed to know
that the whole thing was fake?

1814
02:07:44,686 --> 02:07:47,226
I mean, that was all very, very convincing.

1815
02:07:47,251 --> 02:07:50,951
The performances, the illusion,
that costume, the craftsmanship in that.

1816
02:07:50,976 --> 02:07:54,000
I mean, this is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

1817
02:07:56,716 --> 02:07:59,312
Hey there.
I hope your mission is going well.

1818
02:07:59,337 --> 02:08:02,961
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

1819
02:08:02,986 --> 02:08:08,343
And it was very touching, you know?
Really, really quite touching.

1820
02:08:08,368 --> 02:08:09,468
Talos.

1821
02:08:09,765 --> 02:08:13,767
Um... And, you know, shortly after that,

1822
02:08:14,278 --> 02:08:17,277
everything really kind of went off 
the rails, so we need you to come back.

1823
02:08:17,302 --> 02:08:19,314
'Cause everyone kept asking 
where the Avengers are,

1824
02:08:19,317 --> 02:08:22,009
and I don't know what to say to that,
so you're lucky that Spider-Man won-

1825
02:08:45,331 --> 02:08:46,897
Everybody back to work!

1826
02:08:54,492 --> 02:08:56,361
Who's got my shoes?
