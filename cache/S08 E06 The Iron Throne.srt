1
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,031
I'll find you later.

2
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,744
It's not safe.

3
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,832
Let me send some men with you.

4
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,254
I'm going alone.

5
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,595
In the name of the one true queen,
Daenerys Targaryen,

6
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,306
I sentence you to die.

7
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,683
Jon: Grey worm!

8
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,025
It's over.

9
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,361
These men are prisoners.

10
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,738
It is not over until
the queen's enemies are defeated.

11
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,949
How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

12
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,992
- They're on their knees.
- They are breathing.

13
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,204
Look around you, friend. We won.

14
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,706
I obey my queen's commands,
not yours.

15
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,125
Jon: And what
are the queen's commands?

16
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,088
"Kill all who follow
Cersei Lannister."

17
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,674
These are free men.

18
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,134
They chose to fight for her.

19
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,849
Davos: Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

20
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,818
Jon.

21
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,656
We should speak with the queen.

22
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,824
Blood of my blood.

23
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,418
You kept all your promises to me.

24
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,965
You killed my enemies
in their iron suits.

25
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,517
You tore down their stone houses.

26
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,818
You gave me the seven kingdoms!

27
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,001
Torgo nudho.

28
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,924
You have walked beside me
since the Plaza of pride.

29
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:47,011
You are the bravest of men,
the most loyal of soldiers.

30
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:51,265
I name you commander
of all my forces,

31
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,311
the queen's master of war.

32
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,868
Unsumed.

33
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:17,375
All of you were torn from your
mothers' arms and raised as slaves.

34
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,377
Now...

35
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,838
You are liberators!

36
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:27,009
You have freed the people of king's
landing from the grip of a tyrant!

37
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,514
But the war is not over.

38
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,687
We will not lay down our Spears
until we have liberated

39
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,856
all the people of the world!

40
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,694
From winterfell to dorne,

41
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,365
from lannisport to qarth,

42
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,453
from the summer isles to the Jade sea!

43
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,041
Women, men and children

44
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,087
have suffered too long
beneath the wheel.

45
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,885
Will you break the wheel with me?

46
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,937
You freed your brother.

47
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,876
You committed treason.

48
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,129
I freed my brother.

49
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,510
And you slaughtered a city.

50
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,803
Take him.

51
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,793
What are you doing here?

52
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,632
Hey, what happened?

53
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,467
I came to kill Cersei.

54
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,553
Your queen got there first.

55
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,060
Jon: She's everyone's queen now.

56
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,895
Try telling sansa.

57
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,905
Wait for me outside the city gates.
I'll come find you.

58
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,073
Jon.

59
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,618
She knows who you are.

60
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,955
Who you really are.

61
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,748
You'll always be a threat to her.

62
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,253
And I know a killer when I see one.

63
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,954
Did you bring any wine?

64
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,461
Well...

65
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,590
Thank you for coming to see me.

66
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,969
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

67
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,515
I suppose there's
a crude kind of justice.

68
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,437
I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

69
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,357
Now varys's ashes can tell my ashes:

70
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,735
"See, I told you."

71
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,158
It just occurred to me.

72
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,370
I'm talking to the only man alive
who knows where I'm going.

73
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,166
So is there life after death?

74
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,962
Not that I've seen.

75
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,799
I should be thankful.

76
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,511
Oblivion is the best
I could hope for.

77
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,180
I strangled my lover.

78
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,434
I shot my own father with a crossbow.
I betrayed my queen.

79
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,019
- You didn't.
- I did.

80
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:57,149
And I'd do it again,
now that I've seen what I've seen.

81
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,611
I chose my fate.

82
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,405
The people of king's landing did not.

83
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,910
I can'tjustify what happened.

84
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,704
I won't try.

85
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,669
- But the war is over now.
- Is it?

86
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,216
When you heard her
talking to her soldiers,

87
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,261
did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

88
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,480
She liberated the people
of slaver's bay.

89
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,608
She liberated the people
of king's landing.

90
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,527
And she'll go on liberating

91
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,613
until the people of the world
are free...

92
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,156
And she rules them all.

93
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,451
And you've been by her side,
counseling her.

94
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,744
Until today.

95
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,664
Until today.

96
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,295
Varys was right.

97
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,380
I was wrong.

98
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,258
It was vanity
to think I could guide her.

99
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,927
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

100
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,096
You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

101
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,348
when we're born
and that's who we are?

102
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,767
Ah, then I'd be fire and blood too.

103
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,272
She's not her father,
no more than you're tywin Lannister.

104
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:23,569
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

105
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:27,114
Pile up all the bodies
of all the people they ever killed,

106
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,200
there still won't be half as many
as our beautiful queen slaughtered

107
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,452
in a single day.

108
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,661
Cersei left her no choice.

109
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,997
The moment the gates fell,
the battle was over.

110
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,458
She saw her friend beheaded.

111
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,376
She saw her dragon
shot out of the sky.

112
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,837
And she burned down a city for it.

113
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,049
Ah, it's easy to judge when you're
standing far from the battlefield.

114
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,717
Would you have done it?

115
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,637
What?

116
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,766
You've been up there,
on a dragon's back.

117
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,019
You've had that power.
Would you have burned the city down?

118
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,108
I don't know.

119
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,526
Yes, you do.

120
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,615
You won't say because
you don't want to betray her...

121
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,868
But you know.

122
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,462
What's it matter what I'd do?

123
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,423
It matters more than anything.

124
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,639
When she murdered
the slavers of astapor,

125
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,309
I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

126
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,187
After all, they were evil men.

127
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,818
When she crucified hundreds of
meereenese nobles, who could argue?

128
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,569
They were evil men.

129
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,282
The Dothraki khals she burned alive?

130
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,910
They would have done worse to her.

131
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:00,541
Everywhere she goes, evil men die

132
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,793
and we cheer her for it.

133
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,629
And she grows more powerful

134
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:09,008
and more sure
that she is good and right.

135
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:19,184
She believes her destiny is
to build a better world for everyone.

136
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,686
If you believed that...

137
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,605
If you truly believed it,

138
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,609
wouldn't you kill whoever stood
between you and paradise?

139
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,768
I know you love her.

140
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,775
I love her too.

141
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,574
Not as successfully as you.

142
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,956
But I believed in her
with all my heart.

143
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,134
Love is more powerful than reason.

144
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,806
We all know that.

145
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,307
Look at my brother.

146
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,648
"Love is the death of duty."

147
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,697
You just came up with that?

148
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,248
Maesteraemon said it
a long time ago.

149
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:14,258
Sometimes duty is the death of love.

150
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,892
You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

151
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,228
You've always tried
to do the right thing.

152
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,980
No matter the cost,

153
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,358
you've tried to protect people.

154
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,655
Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

155
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,874
It's a terrible thing I'm asking.

156
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,169
It's also the right thing.

157
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,049
Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

158
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:02,681
Who is more dangerous than
the rightful heir to the iron throne?

159
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,530
That's her decision.
She is the queen.

160
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,291
I'm sorry it came to this.

161
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,429
And your sisters?

162
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,768
Do you see them bending the knee?

163
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,357
My sisters will be loyal
to the throne.

164
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,152
Why do you think sansa
told me the truth about you?

165
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,238
Because she doesn't want dany
to be queen.

166
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,115
- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.

167
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,659
But you do.

168
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,079
And you have to choose now.

169
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,946
When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

170
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,492
with 1,000 swords
from aegon's fallen enemies.

171
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,246
What do 1,000 swords look like

172
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,208
in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

173
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:26,296
I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

174
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,964
So many fallen enemies,

175
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,133
you could only see
the soles of aegon's feet.

176
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,345
Jon: I saw them executing
Lannister prisoners in the street.

177
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,556
They said they were acting
on your orders.

178
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,268
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

179
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,103
Have you been down there?

180
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,522
Have you seen?

181
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,274
Children, little children, burned!

182
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,696
I tried to make peace with Cersei.

183
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:57,244
She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

184
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,621
- She thought it would cripple me.
- And Tyrion?

185
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,461
He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

186
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,048
How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

187
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,259
even when it broke your heart?

188
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,263
Forgive him.

189
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,809
- I can't.
- You can.

190
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,481
You can forgive all of them,
make them see they made a mistake.

191
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,358
Make them understand.

192
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,406
Please, dany.

193
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,954
We can't hide behind small mercies.

194
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,457
The world we need

195
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,294
won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

196
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,214
The world we need
is a world of mercy. It has to be.

197
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,632
And it will be.

198
00:34:55,885 --> 00:35:00,682
It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

199
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,894
A good world.

200
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,147
How do you know?

201
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,776
How do you know it'll be good?

202
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,570
Because I know what is good.

203
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,156
And so do you.

204
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,575
- I don't.
- You do.

205
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,869
You do. You've always known.

206
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,957
What about everyone else?

207
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,587
All the other people
who think they know what's good.

208
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,300
They don't get to choose.

209
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,432
Be with me.

210
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,144
Build the new world with me.

211
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,772
This is our reason.

212
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,231
It has been from the beginning,

213
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,777
since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name

214
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,988
and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

215
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,658
We do it together.

216
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,537
We break the wheel together.

217
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,209
You are my queen.

218
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,588
Now, and always.

219
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,323
Where's Jon?

220
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,534
He is our prisoner.

221
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,785
Sansa: So is lord Tyrion.

222
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,829
They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

223
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,790
We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

224
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,333
This is our city now.

225
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,836
If you look outside the walls
of your city,

226
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,380
you'll find thousands of northmen
who will explain to you

227
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:56,259
why harming Jon snow
is not in your interest.

228
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,262
And you will find thousands
of unsullied who believe that it is.

229
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,931
Some of you may be quick to forgive.

230
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,183
The ironborn are not.

231
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,144
I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

232
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,937
You swore to follow a tyrant.

233
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,856
She freed us from a tyrant.

234
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,357
Cersei is gone because of her,

235
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,901
and Jon snow put a knife
in her heart.

236
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,154
Let the unsullied give him
what he deserves.

237
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,490
Say another word about killing
my brother and I'll cut your throat.

238
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,033
Friends, please.

239
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,038
We've been cutting
each other's throats long enough.

240
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,083
Torgo nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

241
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,338
If it weren't for you and your men,

242
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,924
we would've lost the war
with the dead.

243
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,385
This country owes you
a debt it can never repay,

244
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,137
but let us try.

245
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,682
There is land in the reach.
Good land.

246
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,310
The people that used to live there
are gone.

247
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,436
Make it your own.

248
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,189
Start your own house
with the unsullied as your bannermen.

249
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,900
We've had enough war.

250
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,152
Thousands of you, thousands of them.

251
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,154
You know how it ends.

252
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,906
We need to find a better way.

253
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,450
We do not need payment.

254
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,035
We need justice.

255
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,079
Jon snow cannot go free.

256
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,959
It's not for you to decide.

257
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,502
You are not here to speak!

258
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,964
Everyone has heard enough words
from you.

259
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,093
You're right.

260
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,596
And no one's any better for it.

261
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,225
But it's not for you to decide.

262
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,270
Jon committed his crime here.

263
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,732
His fate is for our king to decide.

264
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,150
Or our queen.

265
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,402
We don't have a king or queen.

266
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,782
You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

267
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,202
Choose one.

268
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,880
Make your choice, then.

269
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:23,239
My lords and ladies...

270
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:30,329
I suppose this is the most important
moment of our lives.

271
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:34,333
What we decide today will reverberate
through the annals of history.

272
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:39,005
I stand before you as one
of the senior lords in the country.

273
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,174
A veteran of two wars.

274
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:48,764
And I like to think my experience has
led to some small skill in statecraft

275
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,057
- and under...
- Sansa: Uncle?

276
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,186
Please sit.

277
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,554
Well, we have to choose someone.

278
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,349
Um... Why just us?

279
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:42,568
We represent all the great houses,
but whomever we choose,

280
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,988
they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

281
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,283
Maybe the decision about
what's best for everyone

282
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,576
should be left to...

283
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,704
Well, everyone.

284
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,846
Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

285
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,348
I'll ask my horse.

286
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,110
I suppose you want the crown.

287
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,279
The imp?

288
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,784
Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

289
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,953
the other half hate me
for betraying her.

290
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,375
- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then?

291
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:50,177
I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

292
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,764
About our bloody history.

293
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,852
About the mistakes we've made.

294
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,656
What unites people?

295
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,452
Armies?

296
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,455
Gold?

297
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,500
Flags?

298
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,925
Stories.

299
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,639
There's nothing in the world
more powerful than a good story.

300
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,602
Nothing can stop it.

301
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,897
No enemy can defeat it.

302
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,275
And who has a better story...

303
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,236
Than bran the broken?

304
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,368
The boy who fell
from a high tower and lived.

305
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:01,957
He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

306
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:07,129
He crossed beyond the wall,
a crippled boy,

307
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,381
and became the three-eyed raven.

308
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,345
He is our memory,

309
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,472
the keeper of all our stories.

310
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:21,519
The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

311
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,521
Our triumphs,

312
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:26,148
our defeats,

313
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,399
our past.

314
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,071
Who better to lead us
into the future?

315
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,786
Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

316
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,246
Good.

317
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,665
Sons of kings
can be cruel and stupid,

318
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,166
as you well know.

319
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,211
His will never torment us.

320
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,593
That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

321
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,937
From now on, rulers will not be born.

322
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:10,943
They will be chosen on this spot by
the lords and ladies of Westeros...

323
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,528
To serve the realm.

324
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,205
I know you don't want it.

325
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,793
I know you don't care about power.

326
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,882
But I ask you now,
if we choose you...

327
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,969
Will you wear the crown?

328
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,765
Will you lead the seven kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

329
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,476
from this day until your last day?

330
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,068
Why do you think I came all this way?

331
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,952
To Brandon of house stark...

332
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,580
I say aye.

333
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,301
Samwell: Aye.

334
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,398
Lord 1: Aye.

335
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,202
Dornish prince: Aye.

336
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,662
Yara: Aye.

337
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,664
Lord 2: Aye. Lord 3: Aye.

338
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,294
I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

339
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,894
I love you, little brother.
I always will.

340
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,646
You'll be a good king.

341
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,234
But tens of thousands of northmen
fell in the great war

342
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,319
defending all of Westeros.

343
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,279
And those who survived
have seen too much

344
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:22,199
and fought too hard
ever to kneel again.

345
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,663
The north will remain
an independent kingdom,

346
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,541
as it was for thousands of years.

347
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,444
All hail bran the broken,

348
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:02,197
first of his name, king of the andals
and the first men,

349
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:07,828
lord of the six kingdoms
and protector of the realm.

350
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,667
All: All hail bran the broken!

351
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,638
Bran: Lord Tyrion...

352
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,350
You will be my hand.

353
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,606
No, your grace, I don't want it.

354
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,608
Bran: And I don't want to be king.

355
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,278
I don't deserve it.

356
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:45,073
I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.

357
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:49,244
I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

358
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,081
Choose ser davos.

359
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,583
Choose anyone else.

360
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,877
- I choose you.
- You cannot.

361
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,796
Yes, I can.

362
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,298
- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.

363
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,718
- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.

364
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,262
He's made many terrible mistakes.

365
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:10,265
He's going to spend
the rest of his life fixing them.

366
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,814
It is not enough.

367
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,866
Tyrion: Giving you to the unsullied
would start a war.

368
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,537
Letting you walk free
would start a war.

369
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,958
So our new king has chosen
to send you to the night's watch.

370
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,628
There's still a night's watch?

371
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,925
The world will always need a home
for bastards and broken men.

372
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,099
You shall take no wife,

373
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,309
hold no lands,

374
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,936
father no children.

375
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,067
The unsullied wanted your head
of course,

376
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,320
but grey worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

377
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,449
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

378
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:14,246
but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

379
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,873
No one is very happy.

380
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,668
Which means it's a good compromise,
isuppose.

381
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:22,921
Was it right?

382
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,551
What I did?

383
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,055
What we did.

384
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,811
It doesn't feel right.

385
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,945
Ask me again in 10 years.

386
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,638
I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

387
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,810
I wouldn't be so sure.

388
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,480
A few years as hand of the king

389
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:24,399
would make anyone want to
piss off the edge of the world.

390
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,418
All the men have boarded.

391
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,003
Good.

392
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,549
We sail for the isle of naath.

393
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,582
Sansa: I wish
there 'd been another way.

394
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,127
Can you forgive me?

395
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,850
The north is free, thanks to you.

396
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,771
But they lost their king.

397
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,608
Ned stark's daughter
will speak for them.

398
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,987
She's the best they could ask for.

399
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,636
You can come see me, you know,
at castle black.

400
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,597
I can't.

401
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:46,059
You think anyone will dare tell you
women aren't allowed?

402
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,233
I'm not going back north.

403
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,403
Where are you going?

404
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,657
What's west of Westeros?

405
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,953
I don't know.

406
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,329
No one knows.

407
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,791
It's where all the maps stop.

408
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,587
That's where I'm going.

409
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,638
You have your needle?

410
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,016
Right here.

411
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,331
Your grace.

412
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,134
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

413
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,931
You were exactly where
you were supposed to be.

414
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,644
That's not... uh...

415
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,276
What's this?

416
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,153
A song of ice and fire.

417
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,947
Archmaester ebrose's history
of the wars

418
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,325
following the death of king Robert.

419
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,577
I helped him with the title.

420
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,999
I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

421
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,543
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

422
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:48,254
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

423
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,968
He's not kind?

424
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,387
- He...
- Tyrion: He what?

425
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:58,932
What does he say about me?

426
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,441
I don't believe you're mentioned.

427
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,339
- Your grace.
- Your grace.

428
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,632
- Your grace.
- Your grace.

429
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,445
We appear to be missing
a master of whisperers.

430
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:55,655
And a master of laws.

431
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,783
- And a master of war.
- Yes, your grace.

432
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,535
Suitable prospects
will be brought to you

433
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,620
for an audience in the coming weeks.

434
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:06,583
And drogon? Any word?

435
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,543
He was last spotted flying east,
toward...

436
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,836
The farther away, the better.

437
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,339
Perhaps I can find him.

438
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,925
Do carry on with the rest.

439
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,970
As you wish, your grace.

440
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,640
Ser podrick.

441
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,110
We serve at your pleasure,
king bran the broken,

442
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,863
ruler of the six kingdoms
and protector of the realm.

443
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,866
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

444
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,826
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

445
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,286
Long may he reign.

446
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,997
That will improve.

447
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,458
I'm sure it will.

448
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,176
Ser bronn of the Blackwater,

449
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,427
lord of highgarden,

450
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,680
lord Paramount of the reach
and master of coin,

451
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,225
would you say the crown's debt to you
has been paid?

452
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,061
In full, my lord hand.

453
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,354
Good.

454
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,689
Time to start incurring a new one.

455
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,066
We have hungry people to feed.

456
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,942
Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

457
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,694
Bronn: Indeed we can.

458
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:20,323
Lord davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

459
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,575
We have.
These projects will begin as soon as

460
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:26,537
the master of coin and lord
of lofty titles provides funding.

461
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,207
The master of coin looks foward
to helping the master of ships,

462
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,001
but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

463
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,795
or soon there won't be no more coin.

464
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,088
"Any more."

465
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,631
You master of grammar now too?

466
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,132
Grandmaester...

467
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:42,261
It is my theory, based on my years
of work on the casterly rock sewers,

468
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,347
that clean water
leads to a healthier population.

469
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,974
The archmaester has done
some research on this subject

470
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:49,477
- and it turns out...
- The strong live and the weak don't.

471
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,730
Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

472
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:56,234
Bronn: Oh, speaking of builders,
all the best brothels burned down.

473
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,112
The master of coin
is willing to fund reconstruction.

474
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,073
Samwell: Uh, the archmaester
is less than enthusiastic

475
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,492
about the salutary effects
of brothels.

476
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,786
Bronn: Well, I imagine
he isn't using them properly.

477
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,873
Brienne: I think we can all agree that
ships take precedence over brothels.

478
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,292
Bronn: I think that's
a very presumptuous statement.

479
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:18,798
Tyrion: I once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel.

480
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,351
Man: The queen in the north!

481
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,311
All: The queen in the north!

482
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,021
The queen in the north!

483
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:45,773
The queen in the north!

484
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,149
The queen in the north!

485
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,943
The queen in the north!
