1460
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:54,335
THIEF: Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

1461
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:56,421
I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

1462
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:58,302
Yeah, he has it all in storage
in Croydon.

1463
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:00,213
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1464
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:03,509
LOIS: <i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i>

1465
01:48:03,686 --> 01:48:07,304
<i>coming out of the shadows
to tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

1466
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:14,110
<i>Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

1467
01:48:14,822 --> 01:48:17,655
<i>But these heroes
were here the whole time</i>

1468
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:23,578
<i>to remind us that hope is real,
that you can see it.</i>

1469
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:30,500
<i>All you have to do is look,</i>

1470
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:34,330
<i>up in the sky.</i>

1471
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:36,882
(SONIC BOOM)

1472
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:35,141
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1473
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:37,275
Not at all, Barry.

1474
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:39,020
Curious myself.

1475
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:41,064
Yeah, and it's not
like a competition, you know?

1476
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,362
Well, it is a competition.

1477
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:46,368
But, you know, it's not like
a macho, uh, measuring thing.

1478
01:49:46,538 --> 01:49:47,949
But if I win, you're off the team.

1479
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:52,917
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1480
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:55,289
- No...
- Oof.

1481
01:49:57,049 --> 01:49:58,539
If I Win...

1482
01:49:58,926 --> 01:50:01,668
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch.

1483
01:50:01,887 --> 01:50:04,219
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1484
01:50:04,848 --> 01:50:06,338
I feel stung by that.

1485
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:09,508
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1486
01:50:09,686 --> 01:50:10,676
Deal.

1487
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:12,595
Which coast?

1488
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,272
Uh, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1489
01:50:16,735 --> 01:50:17,850
Which is that way.

1490
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:20,983
Because the sun, and it's...

1491
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:03,690
(DOOR BUZZES)

1492
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:05,696
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

1493
01:58:07,122 --> 01:58:08,283
GUARD 1: All right,
let's keep it moving.

1494
01:58:08,456 --> 01:58:10,493
<i>GUARD 2: (ON RADIO)
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1495
01:58:11,793 --> 01:58:12,783
<i>Luthor!</i>

1496
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:25,425
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1497
01:58:30,979 --> 01:58:32,970
(LAUGHING)

1498
01:58:58,256 --> 01:59:00,463
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1499
01:59:00,634 --> 01:59:02,375
Care for a glass of Gout de Diamante?

1500
01:59:02,927 --> 01:59:06,795
I was just celebrating God's return out
of the ground and back up into the sky.

1501
01:59:07,515 --> 01:59:10,724
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1502
01:59:10,852 --> 01:59:12,138
DEATHSTROKE: You better not
be wasting my time.

1503
01:59:12,354 --> 01:59:16,143
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1504
01:59:16,274 --> 01:59:18,936
<i>We have to level the playing field,
Mr. Wilson.</i>

1505
01:59:19,903 --> 01:59:21,268
To put it plainly,

1506
01:59:23,156 --> 01:59:26,365
shouldn't we have a league of our own?

1507
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:56,470
