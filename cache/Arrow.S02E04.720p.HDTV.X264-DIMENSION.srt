1
00:00:00,355 --> 00:00:02,106
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:05,547
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:09,467
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:12,136
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:17,058
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,010
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:21,979
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:26,017
I must be something else.

9
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:28,306
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:30,057
Who's blood?
An alderman from the Glades

11
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:31,642
trying to save the city.

12
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:33,310
I'm surprised that
you wanted to meet.

13
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:34,478
I'm not your enemy.
You're not a friend.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,147
I'm hoping
to prove otherwise.

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,731
You told me
to stay out of the Glades.

16
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,733
You told me
to get out of CNRI.

17
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:41,585
Tommy was only there
because I was too stubborn.

18
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:44,155
You were right.
I was blaming the Arrow because

19
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:46,607
it's all my fault, dad!
It's all my fault

20
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:49,827
that Tommy died.

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,495
What's going on
with this woman?

22
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:53,114
She keeps following you
around, helping you out.

23
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:54,648
We've got to find her.

24
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,816
To stop her, or to send her
a thank you note?

25
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:57,134
That depends.
On what?

26
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,653
What side she's on.

27
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:09,513
Mr. Queen's going to be late.
He's extremely sorry.

28
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:11,682
It couldn't be helped.
Where is he?

29
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:13,134
Um...

30
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:20,641
Over there!
Where, man?!

31
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:22,342
There, man!

32
00:01:22,344 --> 00:01:23,079
Just got a little held up.

33
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:25,621
You know, tying up
some loose ends.

34
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:35,072
I'm actually in direct contact
with him now. Let me--let me check.

35
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:44,381
Where are you getting the guns?

36
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:45,833
Are you going
to kill me?

37
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:48,552
Get it over with.

38
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,372
Dig.

39
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:54,975
Took down two more
gangbangers.

40
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,344
They were armed with fully
automatic M4A1 assault rifles.

41
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:00,397
M4A1s
are military grade weapons.

42
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,017
Stolen, most likely.
Stolen from where?

43
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,768
Well, we can look into that
after your party.

44
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,437
What party?

45
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,522
He's here.

46
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:10,390
Sorry I'm late.

47
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:13,227
This party is to
attract investors

48
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:14,762
for your failing
company.

49
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:17,064
Being fashionably
late might do well

50
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,066
for the club circuit,
but it does not inspire

51
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:20,784
confidence
in Wall Street.

52
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,903
Is that blood on your face?
Hmm?

53
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:24,705
Don't worry,
it's not his blood.

54
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:26,674
I mean, of course
it's his blood.

55
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:29,343
Why would he have somebody
else's blood on his face?

56
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:32,229
Who taught you
to shave? Mister.

57
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:33,881
What kept you?

58
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:36,083
Was it our masked blonde
that carries that giant staff

59
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:37,551
to beat the sauce
out of attackers?

60
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:38,836
This time it was guns.
Guns?

61
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:40,971
We were just talking
about guns.

62
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:42,606
Hey. Oliver.

63
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:44,558
Hi.

64
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,443
What's your interest
in guns, Mr. Queen?

65
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:49,196
Never touched them myself.
The gun epidemic in the Glades

66
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:50,898
has gotten increasingly
out of control.

67
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,566
Which is why the DEA's
office has committed

68
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:54,379
to ending gun violence.
Well, I'm sure the police

69
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,497
are doing whatever they can

70
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:57,522
to catch whoever's bring
the weapons into the city.

71
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:02,743
Did I say
something funny?

72
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:06,630
They know who's been
arming the gangs, Oliver.

73
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:08,448
The Mayor.

74
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,034
The...

75
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:13,170
I thought the hood copycats
killed the mayor.

76
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:14,972
Well, not the actual mayor.

77
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:18,092
A local gang lord
calls himself the Mayor.

78
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,877
Think he's the man
to save our city.

79
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,462
But that position has
already been filled, hasn't it?

80
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:26,267
Now this mayor
has only one goal--

81
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:27,801
to create chaos

82
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:29,820
so he can rule the Glades
with the barrel of a gun.

83
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:44,818
You are noticeably unarmed, son.

84
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,837
Sorry, Mr. Mayor.

85
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,689
Um, we ran into
the Vigilante,

86
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:51,325
and, um, he ganked
our weapons.

87
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:54,178
Do you know who I was
before the quake?

88
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,630
I was no one.
I had no name.

89
00:03:56,632 --> 00:04:00,134
None that mattered, anyway.
I was just another weak man

90
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:03,637
waiting to get fired
or evicted or killed.

91
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,940
But then the ground shook,
and now I matter,

92
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,643
because I know the guy
with the biggest gun wins,

93
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,845
and that's why I will
rule the Glades.

94
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:15,515
But there's no room at my table
for weak ass punks like you.

95
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:17,851
Mr. Mayor. I want
to ask for leniency.

96
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:20,871
The kid's my cousin.
I brought him in.

97
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:23,073
Oh, you did?

98
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:34,034
Now let's hope you do
your family prouder than he did.

99
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,209
Hey.

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,314
Please do not ask me
if I'm ok,

101
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:49,733
because I am sick to death
of everyone asking me that!

102
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,435
I would never do that.
Good.

103
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:53,570
You ok?

104
00:04:57,243 --> 00:05:01,195
The Doll Maker was just
your garden variety

105
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:03,063
traumatic experience.

106
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:06,250
After the quake and Tommy,

107
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,584
I should be used
to that by now.

108
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:09,703
I've had
a few of those.

109
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:12,239
You never
get used to them.

110
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:16,343
Ahem. Excuse me, Oliver,
may I talk to you for a second?

111
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:18,412
It's urgent.
Yeah.

112
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,747
You can have him back
in a minute.

113
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:24,551
Excuse us.

114
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,855
I just realized
something.

115
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:29,223
What if our
masked friend

116
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,257
that keeps showing up
everywhere you go,

117
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:31,859
you know her?
What about her?

118
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:34,111
What if we've been going
about this the wrong way?

119
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:35,321
We thought she was
obsessed with you.

120
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:36,591
I mean, she showed up
in the D.A.'s office

121
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:37,557
when you were there...

122
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:42,236
And in the chemical plant where
the Doll Maker was holed up.

123
00:05:43,938 --> 00:05:46,323
But who else was at
both those places?

124
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:50,944
What if our masked
friend isn't following you?

125
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:53,163
She's following Laurel.

126
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:43,163
Can it get any louder?

127
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:45,966
Why are you following
Laurel Lance?

128
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:47,851
I could ask
the same thing of you.

129
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,137
I guess some things
never change.

130
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,057
You and her,
always and forever.

131
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:56,343
Who are you?

132
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:59,146
Once you know, your life
will never be the same.

133
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:00,481
I could take it.

134
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:01,899
Not this time.

135
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,650
Ollie.

136
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,668
Oh, Laurel's
going to kill me.

137
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:31,378
Sarah?

138
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,215
I'll give you some time
to let it sink in.

139
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,791

Sarah Lance?

142
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:03,036
Laurel's sister?
The detective's other daughter,

143
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,006
the one that you took
on "The Gambit" with you

144
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:06,176
even though you were
dating Laurel at the time,

145
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,158
which we never talked about--

146
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,408
Felicity, please.

147
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,193
I'm sorry, it's just...

148
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:12,913
Isn't she--isn't she dead?

149
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:15,048
You told everyone that she died
when "The Gambit" went down,

150
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,833
that she drowned.

151
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:20,170
You lied.

152
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:24,841
When "The Gambit"
capsized, uh...

153
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:28,545
Sarah was pulled under.

154
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:31,164
It was so dark and cold.

155
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,900
And I thought she drowned.

156
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,355
About year later,
I saw her.

157
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:39,523
You saw where,
on the island?

158
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,391
She drifted
to the island, too?

159
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:43,860
Not exactly.
Why didn't you tell the Lances

160
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:45,395
that she didn't die
in that boat?

161
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:47,897
Laurel and Mr. Lance,
they blame you.

162
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,234
Yeah, well,
it was my fault.

163
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:53,370
What happened was my fault.

164
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:54,904
Well, where has she been
all these years, Oliver?

165
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:57,040
I don't know!

166
00:08:58,593 --> 00:09:02,262
Diggle,
I swear to God.

167
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:05,582
I was sure she was dead.

168
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:08,468
Do you have
any happy stories?

169
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,104
All right, so just to make sure
I understand this correctly,

170
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:14,357
after not drowning
when "The Gambit" went down,

171
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,943
Sarah didn't exactly
make it to the island

172
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:20,430
with you, where you would
see her die yet again.

173
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:22,599
Feel free to fill in the blanks.
Not right now.

174
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:24,434
You mean not ever,
don't you, Oliver?

175
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:26,286
Don't you think her family
had a right to know

176
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:27,621
that she made it
to the island, too?

177
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:29,656
These were five years!

178
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:32,459
Five years...

179
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:35,278
Where nothing
good happened.

180
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:41,835
And they were better off
not knowing.

181
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:43,770
Do they deserve to know now?

182
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:51,928
I need to take care of some
business at the office.

183
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,930
Where are we
with the Mayor?

184
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:57,451
I'm in contact with some
of my military sources.

185
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:00,520
Trying to get a line on how he's
getting his illegal army weaponry.

186
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:03,773
I'll keep you updated.

187
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:07,027
You know, Oliver,
somebody once told me that...

188
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:09,746
secrets have weight.

189
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:12,549
The more you keep,
the harder it is to keep moving.

190
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:18,154
You see how hard
I work out.

191
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:34,721
You kill two of my crew.

192
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:38,275
How many others
are with you on the island?

193
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:41,728
What are your weapon
capabilities?

194
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:45,565
Did you find the graves?

195
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:49,686
Two things will happen--

196
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:52,522
you will tell me
everything I want to know,

197
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:54,574
then I will kill you.

198
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:57,077
Or I will torture you until you
tell me everything I want to know.

199
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,713
And then I will kill you.

200
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,596
Go to hell.

201
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:17,880
Can't.

202
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:20,717
We're already there.

203
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:42,839
Told you.

204
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:44,741
The Patty Shack
on 5th and Brewer,

205
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:46,543
best burgers in town.

206
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:48,211
Well, Patty Shack's in
the Mayor's territory,

207
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:53,383
so I'll take a sub par
breakfast over a bullet.

208
00:11:57,421 --> 00:12:00,056
What's wrong?

209
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:02,925
Look, I know I'm skinny, but I
can eat two of these, and I will.

210
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:06,379
Just ran into an old boyfriend.

211
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:13,286
I'm just...

212
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:15,956
worried that he might
tell my family I'm back.

213
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,324
You have family
in Starling?

214
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:18,742
Yeah.

215
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:22,462
My father, he's a--
he's a policeman.

216
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:24,714
And my sister,
she's a lawyer.

217
00:12:24,716 --> 00:12:28,451
Well, they must be real proud
of their masked delinquent.

218
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:34,474
Yeah, they think I'm dead.

219
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:35,976
Oh, cool.

220
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:38,261
My folks think
I'm dead, too.

221
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:40,430
That, or they wish
I'd never been born.

222
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:42,131
One of those.

223
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:45,301
Why...don't you
want them

224
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:47,320
to know that
you're still alive?

225
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:52,075
'Cause I'm not
what they remember.

226
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:54,811
Good little
daddy's girl?

227
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:57,047
Actually far from it.

228
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,784
I was a lot like you.

229
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:03,036
Is that...

230
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:05,455
why you saved me
from those guys that night?

231
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:11,544
No woman should ever suffer
at the hands of men.

232
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:17,634
We've got to stop
meeting like this.

233
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:19,168
What would your girlfriend
think, Johnny?

234
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,021
Lyla,
I am checking the box

235
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,672
marked "single" these days.

236
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:25,158
Sorry to hear it.
What happened?

237
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,360
Well, another man
came between us.

238
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:29,029
Deadshot.

239
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:31,681
You're getting
in the bad habit

240
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:32,816
of letting him ruin your life.

241
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:34,217
So I've been
repeatedly told.

242
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,286
Anything on those
stolen army weapons?

243
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:39,689
A crate of 12 M4A1s went missing
from Camp Kirby two months ago.

244
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:41,007
Yeah, I think I know
where they went.

245
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,625
Every crate was fitted
with a GPS system

246
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:44,694
so they could be
remote tracked.

247
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,863
I tried pulling it up but it's not
receiving. Must have been deactivated.

248
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,832
Thanks, Lyla.

249
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,517
And your interest
in this is what?

250
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,370
Lyla, you and I went
to Afghanistan to try

251
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,872
to bring law and order
to a country overrun

252
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:57,891
by war lords
with weapons, right?

253
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:00,844
Should we do any less
for our own cities?

254
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:03,680
Thanks again.

255
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:06,349
Hey, Johnny.
Yeah?

256
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:09,602
These days, I check the box
marked single, too.

257
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:19,028
Mr. Blood. I see you've met
Miss Rochev.

258
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,997
She's my--
superior.

259
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,532
Partner.
On paper.

260
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:24,701
Is that why you asked me
to come down here, Mr. Queen,

261
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:26,336
to mediate your job title?

262
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:28,104
You and I have gotten
off on the wrong foot repeatedly.

263
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:30,540
Seems to be
your super power.

264
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:33,126
I was inspired
by what you said

265
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:36,012
the other night about
gun violence in the Glades.

266
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:37,847
And I had an idea
that might help.

267
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:39,872
Really? Another party
at your stately manor?

268
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:41,218
No.

269
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:43,219
I wanted to sponsor
a cash for guns event.

270
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:45,405
I give you the money
and you get your constituents

271
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:48,141
to lay down their arms.
Everybody wins.

272
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:51,694
Especially you.

273
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:54,114
Trying to repair
your family's tainted name

274
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,399
by ridding the Glades of guns.

275
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:57,867
You just get the money,
Mr. Blood.

276
00:14:57,869 --> 00:15:00,537
I don't want
my family's name involved.

277
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:03,156
Mr. Queen, may I have
a word with you?

278
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:05,608
Let me think it over.

279
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:14,283
We are not
sponsoring that event.

280
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:16,786
Yes, I know. I am.

281
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,304
With what money?

282
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,974
Your investment party
cost QC 50 grand,

283
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:22,475
and no one
invested a dime.

284
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:25,094
I will not continue to
authorize corporate funds

285
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:28,465
just so you can keep pretending
that you are the CEO.

286
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:31,017
Fine.

287
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,652
I'll pay for it myself.

288
00:15:32,654 --> 00:15:34,604
Maybe you
haven't noticed,

289
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,773
but your personal trust isn't exactly
what it used to be,

290
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:38,658
and this company
isn't, either.

291
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,945
As much as I would love
to make this city safer,

292
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:45,715
my first obligation is
to Queen Consolidated.

293
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,867
And yours is, too.

294
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:02,832
♪ Shadows settle
on the place that you left ♪

295
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:07,487
I was going to order
some takeout, you want in?

296
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,138
I appreciate
the offer, Adam, but--

297
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,191
I've eaten takeout
every night this week,

298
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:12,959
I need a meal served
on an actual plate.

299
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,445
So do you.

300
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:18,681
I get it. It's easy to let
the job become your life.

301
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:21,367
I keep having to remind myself
to go to the gym,

302
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:23,870
see a movie, eat a good meal.

303
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:28,374
That sounds dangerously
like having a life.

304
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:32,361
What about you?
You can't be all about work.

305
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:35,531
I'm the best me
when I am working.

306
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,500
And when you're not?

307
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:41,721
You don't want to meet her.
She's not good company.

308
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:45,207
I'd be willing to risk it.

309
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,096
Excuse me.

310
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:52,181
I have to go.

311
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,236
No, it's ok.

313
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:59,188
It's fine.
I just have to go.

314

320
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:25,765
Crap.

321
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,419
License
and registration?

322
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:32,722
Is there a problem, Officer?

323
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:34,641
Have you had anything
to drink tonight, ma'am?

324
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:39,445
I'm Laurel Lance.

325
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:41,764
I'm an assistant
district attorney.

326
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,066
I'm sorry, Miss Lance,
but I'm going to have

327
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:45,068
to ask you to step out
of the car, please.

328
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,272
I need some good news.

329
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:52,542
The bad news first.

330
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:54,276
Somehow the Mayor
did get his hands

331
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:56,278
on a crate of
military-grade weapons

332
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
from Camp Kirby.

333
00:17:58,282 --> 00:17:59,415
The good news?

334
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,000
If he kept the crate,

335
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:02,552
might be able to find
where he's hiding.

336
00:18:02,554 --> 00:18:05,138
This is the same make and model
of a tracking system

337
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,789
the army installs
on all of its weapons crates.

338
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,425
If they lose a crate,
they send out a remote signal

339
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:12,011
that activates the beacon.
The Mayor's clever.

340
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:14,764
He deactivated his beacon. Send
a signal, nothing comes back.

341
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:17,934
You both need to work
on your definition of good news.

342
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:19,686
Ok. How's this--

343
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:22,605
guess which company designed
the tracking system the army uses?

344
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:26,142
I'll give you a hint--
your CEO? Always late.

345
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,444
Nice.

346
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,930
I pulled up the original plans
from the QC mainframe.

347
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:32,398
Turns out
there's a design flaw.

348
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,151
The beacon is still susceptible
to a subform wave

349
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:36,419
even if it's been deactivated.

350
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,704
The Mayor
turned it off, Oliver.

351
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:39,172
We can turn it back on.

352
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,881
I believe you ordered the crate
of stolen military weapons, Mr. Queen.

353
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,310
I thought you deactivated
the tracker!

354
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:16,492
Go, go!

355
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,927
Weapons are secure.

356
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:37,346
And the Mayor?

357
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:40,282
Still in office.

358
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,107
Thanks for the heads up,
Officer Daily.

359
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:50,576
Just fyi--

360
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:53,896
she blew .6 past
the legal limit.

361
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:57,165
Thank you.

362
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:00,785
He didn't need to call you.

363
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:02,254
No.

364
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:04,806
But you're lucky he did.

365
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,675
You could have
lost your job.

366
00:20:06,677 --> 00:20:08,977
You could have lost your life, and
you could have killed somebody!

367
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:11,463
I had a few too many glasses
of wine at dinner.

368
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:13,565
It was an accident!

369
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:16,084
An accident.
Well, I guess those happen.

370
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:18,203
Was I not supposed
to notice that tone?

371
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:20,305
The two of us...

372
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:22,724
You got a lot
from me, Laurel.

373
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:24,526
Maybe you got
this, too.

374
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:28,096
You can hardly compare my one
mistake to your drinking problem.

375
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:30,983
So long as it is
only one mistake.

376
00:20:30,985 --> 00:20:33,669
I don't know
if you've noticed...

377
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:36,655
But I've had a little bit
of a hard time lately.

378
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:40,375
I was kidnapped, nearly murdered
by a psychopath,

379
00:20:40,377 --> 00:20:42,160
and my boyfriend died.

380
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:45,497
So, I don't know,
maybe...cut me some slack.

381
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:47,332
You know, when I started
having a hard time,

382
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:50,168
I wish people
had not cut me slack.

383
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,188
Leave your car here,
I'm driving you home.

384
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,006
I'll take a cab.
Laurel...

385
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,643
Laurel!

386
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,900
Did you tell my family
that I'm alive?

387
00:21:38,902 --> 00:21:41,436
No.

388
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:47,726
Sara.

389
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:50,078
I saw you die.

390
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,364
Not the first time
that's happened, right?

391
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,900
And I thought
you were dead, too.

392
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:57,419
What happened to Slade?

393
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,738
Where have you been?

394
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,858
Everywhere.
That's not an answer.

395
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,593
Well, it's the one
you're getting.

396
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:11,683
About a year ago,

397
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:14,085
I started
hearing tales

398
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:16,221
of the Starling City
vigilante.

399
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:19,791
The man
in the green hood.

400
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:21,226
I knew it was you.

401
00:22:21,228 --> 00:22:23,428
I had never known you
as much of a fighter.

402
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,398
Where did you pick that up?
I met some rough people.

403
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,899
Thought I should get
rougher, too.

404
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,985
Sara.

405
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:33,071
Why did you come back?

406
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,442
The earthquake.

407
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:40,395
Because you wanted
to make sure your family was safe.

408
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:43,215
But now you're still here,

409
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:46,117
watching over them.

410
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:48,286
Protecting them.

411
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:53,892
So, did you come here
to make sure I didn't tell them?

412
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:56,762
Or because you were
hoping I had?

413
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:03,351
I'll get rid of them.

414
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:14,312
Mr. Lance?
Hi.

415
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:19,618
Something I can help you with?

416
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,839
I'm here about
my daughter.

417
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:27,492
Laurel.

418
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:29,010
Is she ok?

419
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:30,962
Yeah. Well, no,
she's not.

420
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:33,849
She got pulled over
for a DUI last night.

421
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:36,601
I tried talking to
her about it, but...

422
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:38,220
She wasn't
hearing me.

423
00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:40,672
I--I saw her the other night.

424
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:42,190
She...

425
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:44,276
Didn't seem like herself.

426
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:46,978
No, I know.
She seems like me.

427
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:54,820
I don't know if you know, but
when you and Sara disappeared,

428
00:23:54,822 --> 00:23:57,823
I hit the bottle
pretty hard.

429
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:01,660
I know the two
of you are friends.

430
00:24:01,662 --> 00:24:03,829
And she needs
a friend.

431
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:07,198
Maybe talk to her.

432
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,050
Sure.

433
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:14,172
Anyhow.

434
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:16,374
Mr. Lance.
Yeah?

435
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:23,265
Um...

436
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:26,217
I'd be happy to talk to Laurel.

437
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,221
Thanks.

438
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:56,247
Why'd they do this?
Aahh.

439
00:24:56,249 --> 00:24:58,633
They make all of us do this.

440
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,139
Supposed to show prochnost.

441
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:08,226
It's Russian.

442
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:09,811
For strength.

443
00:25:12,264 --> 00:25:15,700
They--they did it
to see if I'm strong?!

444
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:19,287
They're doing this
to see if you survive.

445
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:21,740
Living...

446
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:24,442
is not for the weak.

447
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,301
Aahh.

448
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,785
Oliver. Hi.

449
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:20,119
What are you doing here?
Is everything ok?

450
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,488
I don't know.
Is everything ok?

451
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,992
You've got
to be kidding me.

452
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:27,593
My dad went to you?

453
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:29,762
He spent the last
six years cursing your name,

454
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:31,881
and now you're what, gossip buddies?
Laurel.

455
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,499
He's worried about you.

456
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,852
Perfect.

457
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:38,805
A recovering alcoholic
and recovering party boy

458
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,940
trying to tell me
how to live my life.

459
00:26:40,942 --> 00:26:42,525
Don't you see
the hypocrisy there?

460
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:46,312
What I see is somebody
that both of us care for

461
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:48,281
having a rough go of it.

462
00:26:48,283 --> 00:26:49,614
Do you know how many

463
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,783
times I've had to pull
my dad out of a bar?

464
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:54,821
Or how many nights
I've had to drive him home

465
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,823
where he's passed out
in my backseat?

466
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,375
He's the one
with the problem.

467
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:01,494
Not me.

468
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,997
Just because he can't
cope with losing Sara

469
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,198
doesn't mean I can't
handle my life.

470
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,003
Feel free to tell him that
during the next chit chat.

471
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,740
Sewing is not
your strong suit.

472
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:39,065
Now we can talk.

473
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,085
For two years...

474
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:46,055
my crew and I have
been looking for grave site.

475
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,911
Did you find the graves?

476
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,615
Were the bodies...

477
00:27:55,617 --> 00:27:57,967
Odd?

478
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:01,437
The bones misshapen?

479
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:13,983
This is
the right island.

480
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,925
Looks like we got
a Colt 1911,

481
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:25,111
Jennings .32,

482
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:28,414
and a K-frame revolver.

483
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,666
Um...

484
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:33,252
We'll give you 250 for the lot.

485
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,787
Keep it.

486
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:37,289
Do I even want to know where
you got those guns?

487
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,759
They're from the old days.
I told you.

488
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,627
Look, no more
being a criminal.

489
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:44,313
No more being a hero.
Just Roy Harper.

490
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:45,965
Bus boy and boyfriend.

491
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,967
Yo, Abercrombie.

492
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:54,657
Where's your manners?
Sin.

493
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,110
This is Thea.
Thea, this is Sin.

494
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:58,578
Thea Queen?

495
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,280
Look at you,
rolling with royalty.

496
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,315
By the way, the salad fork's
the small one.

497
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:05,317
It was good to see you again.

498
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:11,124
She doesn't know you're the
Vigilante's delivery boy, does she?

499
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:15,294
Nice to meet you,
your highness.

500
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,380
You, too.

501
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,465
So how do you know her?

502
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,167
From around.

503
00:29:23,604 --> 00:29:26,973
You don't show up
when you say you will,

504
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,692
and when you promise
not to, here you are.

505
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:32,111
It's going well?

506
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:36,449
Last check, we've taken in
over 200 guns in only 3 hours.

507
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:39,869
Try not to look
so happy about it.

508
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:41,988
A lot on my mind, alderman.

509
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:46,025
My job is to help
the people in this city

510
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:47,710
with their problems.

511
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:55,668
Two people that
are very important to me are...

512
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,568
having a tough time.

513
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:59,415
Sisters, actually.

514
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,225
And neither one of them

515
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,425
is making it very easy
for me to help them.

516
00:30:03,878 --> 00:30:07,180
Sooner or later,
we all go through a crucible.

517
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:10,850
I'm guessing yours
was that island.

518
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,520
Most people there are
two types of people

519
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,155
who go into a crucible--

520
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:18,858
the ones who grow stronger
from the experience

521
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,776
and survive it,

522
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,895
and the ones who die.

523
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:26,482
But there's a third type.

524
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:28,734
The ones who learn
to love the fire.

525
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:30,236
They choose to stay
in their crucible

526
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:31,704
because it's easier
to embrace the pain

527
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,923
when it's all
you know anymore.

528
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:37,176
That's why I'm on the clock
to help this city.

529
00:30:37,178 --> 00:30:39,845
Before it becomes used
to living like this.

530
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:41,847
Living is not
for the weak.

531
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:46,085
Old friend of mine
once told me that.

532
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:48,221
That's a wise friend.

533
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:59,565
Listen up, people.
This is your mayor speaking.

534
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:03,769
Now I don't recall
this here event being sanctioned.

535
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:06,322
What happens in the Glades

536
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:09,408
only happens if I allow it.

537
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,876
You're not the leader
of this community!

538
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:14,213
You don't speak
for these people!

539
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:17,149
And neither do you.
Not anymore.

540
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:42,308
Hey! Are you ok? Are you hit?
No.

541
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,144
Sin, you all right?

542
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:47,363
All's good.

543
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:53,869
Go get help!

544
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,838
Go!

545
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,657
The shooting
was committed by the gang leader

546
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:05,353
known only as "The Mayor,"
who, until now,

547
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:07,001
has never been seen in public.

548
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:08,735
We do want to warn
our audience

549
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:11,121
that some of these images
are graphic.

550
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,709
The coward finally
decided to show his face.

551
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:18,178
Vanity is going
to cost him.

552
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,882
I borrowed the FBI's
facial recognition software.

553
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,484
Got a match.

554
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:25,936
Xavier Reed.

555
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:27,838
Did Mr. Reed
serve in the military?

556
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,808
No military history.
Family members?

557
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,310
Reed was in and out
of foster care his whole life.

558
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:35,112
Wait, hold on.

559
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:37,648
In 1996, Reed spent
three years with

560
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,600
a foster family
and their son, Ezra Barnes.

561
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:43,103
He served three tours in
Iraq. He's stateside now.

562
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:45,739
20 bucks says he was stationed
at Camp Kirby.

563
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:48,108
Pay the man.
The Mayor's foster brother

564
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,960
is assigned
to a weapons convoy

565
00:32:49,962 --> 00:32:51,829
that carries
SCAR 16s by truck.

566
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:54,581
The convoy's scheduled to come
through Starling City tonight.

567
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:57,751
FN SCAR 16s are military assault
weapons with grenade launchers.

568
00:32:57,753 --> 00:33:00,254
The man gets a hold
of these, Oliver,

569
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:02,622
it's game over.

570
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:06,126
He won't.

571
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:12,232
Bullet penetrated
her anterior abdomen.

572
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:14,234
We were able to remove
most of the fragments.

573
00:33:14,236 --> 00:33:15,853
We'll know more
in a few hours.

574
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:29,983
Hey.

575
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:32,152
I'm going to stick around,
in case she wakes up.

576
00:33:32,154 --> 00:33:35,789
Is it ok if I stick
around with you?

577
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,978
I mean, you saved
her life, Roy.

578
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:45,132
I guess you can't stop
being a hero, can you?

579
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:03,567
I want to see how you do
in a real fight.

580
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:05,002
Good.

581
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:07,687
I was looking for a fight.

582
00:34:29,043 --> 00:34:31,595
They're with me.

583
00:34:33,714 --> 00:34:35,933
He wasn't.

584
00:34:39,388 --> 00:34:42,189
You're done being
all you can be.

585
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:46,726
Ahh.

586
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:48,895
You and I are going
to own this town.

587
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:52,950
Now let's see
what this bad boy can do.

588
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,456
Drop the weapon, now!

589
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,310
Behind you.

590
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:23,263
Old school weapon. Respect.

591
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:25,399
But can your arrows do this?

592
00:35:44,585 --> 00:35:46,503
Come on, where are you?

593
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:54,811
You hurt a friend of mine.
Let him go.

594
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:57,597
You can't save a city
with forgiveness.

595
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,434
You don't have
to forgive him.

596
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:02,802
But you do have
to let him live.

597
00:36:05,307 --> 00:36:07,607
Bitch. I knew you didn't
have it in you.

598
00:36:11,446 --> 00:36:13,964
I really don't like that word.

599
00:36:20,683 --> 00:36:22,812
Demonstrations
opposing the construction

600
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,846
of the new Star Lab's
particle accelerator

601
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:27,649
have reached a fever pitch with
five more protestors being arrested.

602
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:32,432
In other news the recent cash for
guns event held in the Glades

603
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:36,002
is credited for getting
over 800 weapons off the streets.

604
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:38,605
Still a mystery--
the anonymous donor

605
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:42,275
whose generous donation
funded the event.

606
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:44,528
I guess it's true
what they say--

607
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,146
one man can change the world.

608
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:48,181
I'll leave changing
the world to you, alderman.

609
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:50,484
I'm only in the world
because of you.

610
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:52,369
Thank you.

611
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:54,621
I was just acting
on instinct.

612
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:58,658
It wasn't instinct.
It was strength.

613
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,193
I see the signs

614
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:01,745
and the graffiti;

615
00:37:01,747 --> 00:37:03,530
"Blood for mayor."

616
00:37:03,532 --> 00:37:05,882
Now that the "mayor"
is in jail,

617
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:07,217
maybe
you should run.

618
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:11,421
There is more than one way
to save a city.

619
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:19,513
Mr. Harper?

620
00:37:19,515 --> 00:37:21,898
What's wrong, is she ok?

621
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:29,389
Hey.

622
00:37:31,576 --> 00:37:33,610
You saved my life.

623
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:38,398
I guess I have to keep
your secret now, huh?

624
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,668
You know you're dating
a moron, right?

625
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,222
It's my first
and last thought of every day.

626
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:46,790
Crap.

627
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:48,625
I like her.

628
00:38:05,893 --> 00:38:08,945
Your friend.

629
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:11,481
I took care
of her medical expenses.

630
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:13,233
Thank you.

631
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:16,269
Look, I don't want
Thea to see me--

632
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:18,905
What's your plan, Sarah?

633
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:22,125
Because right now,
you just...

634
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:23,960
Well, you're whipping
across rooftops

635
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:25,912
and keeping watch
over your family

636
00:38:25,914 --> 00:38:27,614
like some sort of ghost.

637
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:29,216
We're both ghosts.

638
00:38:29,218 --> 00:38:31,334
We died
on that island.

639
00:38:31,336 --> 00:38:32,752
But we didn't.

640
00:38:32,754 --> 00:38:36,139
We both lived.

641
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:39,759
And...

642
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:43,096
I get that you have
been in pain so long

643
00:38:43,098 --> 00:38:46,266
that it probably
just feels normal now.

644
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:50,020
But you can let it go
and come home.

645
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:52,906
I mean, I know that the
earthquake brought you here,

646
00:38:52,908 --> 00:38:55,108
but your family
kept you here.

647
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,044
You have to tell them, Sarah.

648
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:04,084
They need you.

649
00:39:04,086 --> 00:39:07,921
You told them
that I died on "The Gambit."

650
00:39:07,923 --> 00:39:09,656
If they know
the truth...

651
00:39:09,658 --> 00:39:11,525
They would never--

652
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:14,861
they would never
talk to me again.

653
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:17,964
Not one of them.

654
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,452
But it'd be worth it.

655
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:28,275
My daughter's
in trouble.

656
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:32,229
She's, uh, she's been through
some really terrible things.

657
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:34,147
And...

658
00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:38,568
Instead of facing up to them,
she's running away from them.

659
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,872
She's losing herself
in her work,

660
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:45,175
and maybe even worse.

661
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:50,330
She's my daughter, I just want
her safe, I want to protect her.

662
00:39:56,337 --> 00:39:59,172
But I guess like we say in our
meetings, more will be revealed.

663
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:23,613
Your days of screaming
are just beginning.

664
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:56,446
Sarah?

665
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:02,435
What the hell is this?

666
00:41:02,437 --> 00:41:05,238
This ain't the police station.

667
00:41:10,944 --> 00:41:13,380
Why are you wearing that mask?

668
00:41:13,382 --> 00:41:15,948
This city
is in chains,

669
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,084
and I'm going
to free it.

670
00:41:18,086 --> 00:41:21,454
But to do that,
I need an army.

671
00:41:21,456 --> 00:41:24,474
Whoa, what's in that thing?!

672
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:26,142
Get that off me!

673
00:41:26,144 --> 00:41:28,011
Get that crap away from me!

674
00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:31,681
Are you ready to serve?

675
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,988
Bring me another.

676
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,943
Yes, brother Blood.

677
00:41:57,944 --> 00:42:02,944
