1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,509
Last season on The Flash...

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,763
What's happening to me?

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,559
I wasn't the only one affected, was I?

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,138
We've been searching for
other meta-humans, like yourself.

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,936
Don't be afraid, Cisco,
you were affected, too.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,859
- Once upon a time, you agreed to marry me.
- Yes, I did.

7
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,319
What do you say we do that?

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,114
Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,858
You killed my mother. Why?

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,952
We're enemies, rivals, opposites,
reverses of one another.

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,997
Just tell the police what you did.
Get my dad out of prison.

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,242
You can go back and save your mother.

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,455
A Wormhole?

14
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,962
Opening the gateway
into time itself.

15
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,458
I always win, Flash.

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,505
Eddie!

17
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,760
Eddie's his ancestor.

18
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,636
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born and
he's being erased from existence.

19
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,969
The Singularity won't stop,
not even after the earth is gone.

20
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,930
- We have to disrupt the motion!
- It cannot be stopped!

21
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,640
I have to try.

22
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,422
- Coming back around!
- Yeah, to die.

23
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,472
I swear, one of these days,
I will kill you!

24
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,064
I was late again, wasn't I?

25
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,482
Right on time.

26
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,113
Whoo!

27
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,879
Two down at the same time.
Superhero double play, baby.

28
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,548
- Didn't do it alone.
- You're never alone, Barry.

29
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,501
Neither are you, Mrs. Raymond.

30
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,506
Thank you for not doing that
when I was inside you.

31
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,466
It happened one time, let it go.

32
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:17,020
Snart and Rory. You're gonna put
a cop like me out of a job.

33
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,647
Just trying to help.

34
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,398
You do more than help, Barry.
You give the people of this city hope.

35
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,188
You're the hero, Barry.

36
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,992
Congratulations, everyone.
A spectacular victory.

37
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,870
A milestone, if you will.

38
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,826
Mr. Allen,

39
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,875
I believe there's nothing left
I can teach you.

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,745
I believe

41
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,087
you're ready to do all of this
on your own.

42
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,571
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

43
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,530
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

44
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,736
My father went to prison for her murder.

45
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,118
Then an accident made me the impossible.

46
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,824
And I became the Flash.

47
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,703
I used my powers to find the man
responsible for my mother's death.

48
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,332
I thought I would finally get justice
for my family.

49
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,795
But I failed.

50
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,427
It's been six months
since the Singularity.

51
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,297
I'm on my own now.
Decided it's better that way.

52
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,341
Keeps the people I care about safe.

53
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,893
There's only one thing I can do now.

54
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,557
I run.

55
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,984
How's it going?

56
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,407
Hey. Uh, good.

57
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,701
- How you doing?
- Good.

58
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,534
So, the victim, his name's Al Rothstein.

59
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,251
He's a welder here at the nuclear plant.
Co-worker found him this morning.

60
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,460
So what do you got?

61
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,958
Uh...

62
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,128
Petechia on his face,
in the whites of his eyes

63
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,838
and this bruising around his neck.

64
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,840
- Oh, so he was strangled?
- Mmm-hmm.

65
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,719
- By someone very strong and very large.
- Or something.

66
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,726
- Well, this wasn't Grodd.
- Oh, thank God.

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,687
Look, I'll let you know when I find more.

68
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,393
So, this Flash Day thing?

69
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,396
I'm hoping you're planning on
making an appearance.

70
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,902
Uh... No, I haven't decided.

71
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,197
Barr, I heard the mayor's
trying to give you the key to the city.

72
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,741
- Yeah, I don't need an award.
- You love getting awards.

73
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,910
Like all those science trophies
you got in high school?

74
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,791
Those I deserved.

75
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,914
I'll let you know what I find, all right?

76
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,291
All right.

77
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,011
Flash Day is almost here,

78
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,231
a special downtown rally
to honor the man who saved Central City.

79
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,560
It's been six months
since the Flash saved Central City

80
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,487
from the freak black hole
that erupted in the sky.

81
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,448
Joe, where are we at
with the murder at the nuclear plant?

82
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,443
Barry's still analyzing the evidence,
but there was definitely something weird.

83
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,075
Yeah, which is why I let you have that
anti-meta-human task force.

84
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,202
Speaking of which,
where is your scientific advisor?

85
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,578
Ho, ho, ho!

86
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:25,955
Fear the beard.

87
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,632
It's a very distinguished look, sir.

88
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,341
What is all this, Mr. Ramon?

89
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,799
Oh, this right here?
This is a little something I'm working on.

90
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,303
I'm cooking it up for Joe and
the task force to take down meta-humans.

91
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,641
I think I'm gonna call it the Boot.
Oh, here are the receipts.

92
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,145
- Oh, um, Captain, one more thing...
- You are not getting a badge, Mr. Ramon.

93
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,108
He's really stingy with those badges,
isn't he?

94
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,909
Yeah, cops are funny that way.

95
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,866
So, you really think
you can get this to work?

96
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,072
Don't have me caught out on the street
with my pants down.

97
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,790
Yes, once I finish the Boot,

98
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,835
C.C.P.D. will totally have
what it needs to take down a meta-human.

99
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,123
Especially now that Barry's decided to go
all Lone Wolf McQuade,

100
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,209
- and fight crime by himself.
- I know, right? Have you spoken to him?

101
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,801
Not really,
haven't even heard from Caitlin

102
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,345
since she started work at Mercury Labs.

103
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,339
- Hey, Cisco. Hi, Dad.
- Hey, baby.

104
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,758
Hey, I was wondering if
you talked to Barry about the rally.

105
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,100
We were just saying.

106
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,894
I'm sorry, but I can't believe

107
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,979
they're gonna give the Flash
the key to the city.

108
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,935
Although, technically,
as members of Team Flash,

109
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,309
- we should all be getting keys.
- Uh, you know Barry.

110
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,277
The more we try to convince him
to do something,

111
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,193
- the less he's gonna wanna do it.
- Yeah, but he should go.

112
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,115
Someone should try and get through to him.

113
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,658
Maybe his best friend.

114
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,660
Joe, believe me, I've tried.

115
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,829
I meant her.

116
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,453
Bye, babe.

117
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,000
- Yeah.
- Okay.

118
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,035
You know, if you ever decided that
you didn't wanna be the Flash,

119
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,045
you have a good future
at being a contractor.

120
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,668
Thanks.

121
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,717
Yeah, I'm just trying to put it all back
exactly how it was before the...

122
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,346
You know.

123
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,309
Seems like a lot of local businesses
are being rebuilt at night.

124
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,186
In secret.

125
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,899
I was thinking about writing an article
about it for the paper.

126
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,063
Don't. Please.

127
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,366
Look, people have heard the stories,
they've read the articles,

128
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,570
they've maybe even seen
the red streak racing past them.

129
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,577
But they have never seen the Flash, Barry.

130
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,161
So that's why you're here?

131
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,581
You came to talk me into
going to the rally?

132
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,041
'Cause I'm not gonna go.

133
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,248
People just wanna thank the man
who saved Central City.

134
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,042
Well, they can't, 'cause that's not me.

135
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,007
You should know that better than anyone.

136
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,434
Central City believes in the Flash.

137
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,102
So do I.

138
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:43,126
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

139
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:31,822
Brilliant! He's contained the Singularity
by adding to its angular momentum.

140
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,164
Barry, it's stabilizing!
Keep doing what you're doing!

141
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,161
I'm not sure how much longer I can.

142
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,755
- Cisco?
- Now what?

143
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,841
We have to merge
the inner and outer event horizons.

144
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,176
How do we do that?

145
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,341
By separating in the eye of it.

146
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,803
The amount of energy from the fissure
should do the trick.

147
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,979
It's our only hope, Ronald.

148
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,644
Ronnie, no. It's too dangerous.
What if you can't escape the inrush?

149
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,689
Cait, we have to try.

150
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,562
Ronnie.

151
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,983
Professor.

152
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,355
No!

153
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,933
Ronald? Ronald...

154
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,739
I'm so sorry.

155
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,650
Are you expecting trouble?

156
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,824
Cops always expect trouble.

157
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,403
In this city,
I expect super-evil flying monsters.

158
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,655
That's a solid expectation.

159
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,665
Well, I'll be...

160
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,468
Good morning, Central City.

161
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,926
A year ago, our world changed.

162
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,938
Our city became ground zero

163
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,692
for some pretty weird stuff.

164
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,020
We got a new breed of criminal.

165
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,698
Men and women
who defied not only our laws,

166
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,692
but physics and reason.

167
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,162
But we got something else, too.

168
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,706
We got the Flash.

169
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,040
Our wounds run deep,

170
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,586
and I know many of you are afraid
of what threats tomorrow may bring.

171
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:20,225
But the Flash doesn't just protect us,
he restores hope where it was lost.

172
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:26,349
That's why I'm honored to present the key
to the man who saved Central City.

173
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,396
The Flash!

174
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,760
Flash! Flash! Flash! Flash! Flash!

175
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,755
Flash. Flash.

176
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,988
The doors to Central City
will forever be open for you, Flash.

177
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,621
Look out!

178
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,750
You all right?

179
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,302
I got this, all right?

180
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,810
The man who saved Central City.

181
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,356
Hate to rain on your parade.

182
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,877
Cisco?

183
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,717
Cisco! The Boot!

184
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,006
Right.

185
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,891
Locked and loaded. Go.

186
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,351
Booted.

187
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,532
Cisco, you said this thing would
take him down. He's not going down.

188
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,330
He went up.

189
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,830
Run. Run!

190
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,381
- What are you doing?
- I'm throwing, you're shooting.

191
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,733
That's Al Rothstein.

192
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,401
The body we found at the nuclear plant.
He's alive.

193
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,415
According to the coroner's office,

194
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,424
Al Rothstein's body
was in the morgue all night,

195
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,298
so we can scratch off zombie attack.

196
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,881
- Rothstein have a twin brother?
- Nope, only child.

197
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,261
And get this,
the night the accelerator exploded,

198
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,802
Rothstein was on his honeymoon in Hawaii.

199
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,060
Huh.

200
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,973
So we're looking for a guy who's
really strong, can grow twice his size,

201
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,767
and just happens to look exactly like
the guy he murdered?

202
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,110
I would think this meta was really cool

203
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,488
if everything about him
didn'tjust terrify me to my core.

204
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,781
Is that what happened to you?

205
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,659
You looked really spooked there
for a minute.

206
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,490
Uh...

207
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,455
I actually see the guy
that I can ask about it, right now.

208
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,742
Call you back, okay? Hey.

209
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,752
So, the hospital
next to the Flash Day rally?

210
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,622
The X-ray and CT machines
all failed at once.

211
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,583
Was that because of you?

212
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,840
I did not do anything
that would cause that.

213
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,805
I'm 92% sure.

214
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,310
I'm gonna go make that 100. Excuse me.

215
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,600
You okay?

216
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,138
We need to talk.

217
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,432
Okay.

218
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,024
Barry can't do this alone anymore.

219
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,949
That's his plan, and I don't know
how to talk him out of it.

220
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,151
At this point, I'm just trying not to
push him further away.

221
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,365
Well, maybe Barry has been so successful
at pushing you, me and everyone else away

222
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,493
because we keep letting him.
Let's not let him.

223
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,327
What do you suggest?

224
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:04,964
Well, if you keep getting no
for an answer, stop asking questions.

225
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,806
- I say that. You quoting me to me?
- What can I say, you are a very smart man.

226
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,692
So, this is what it looks like
inside Mercury Labs.

227
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,691
Security here is way better
than it was at S.T.A.R. Labs,

228
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,698
what, with people walking in and out
of the Cortex all the time.

229
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,316
Hi, Cisco.

230
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,244
Sweet Sarek, is that a 6K proton splicer?

231
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,374
Yes, it is. Dr. McGee insists on having
all the latest technology.

232
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,658
Wow.

233
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,544
You deserve it.

234
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:47,381
I spotted you at the rally today,
and I'm guessing you saw what happened.

235
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,216
Cisco, I can't come back.

236
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,220
Okay, check this out, we found this
on a victim at the nuclear power plant.

237
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,429
But the badge shows absolutely nothing
at all, which is so weird.

238
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,564
And what's also weird is that
at the same time that meta-human grew,

239
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,439
all the X-ray machines
within a mile radiusjust went belly up.

240
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,986
- Cisco...
- Just...

241
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,572
If you could just see if the badge
was tampered with or something?

242
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:12,994
I mean, if it's broken or whatever.
It would really help.

243
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,073
Yes.

244
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,255
Mr. Allen? Barry Allen?

245
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,837
- Yeah.
- I'm Greg Turk.

246
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,964
I'm an attorney at Weathersby and Stone.

247
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,975
I don't usually make house calls, but
I've been trying to get in touch with you

248
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,103
- for several months.
- Yes, yeah, I'm sorry about that.

249
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,311
I've just, um...
I've been really busy with police work.

250
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,018
We need to talk about S.T.A.R. Labs.

251
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,312
As you know, Harrison Wells

252
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,697
left the property to you
as part of his living trust.

253
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:55,324
Yeah, which I did not ask him to do,
but I've been keeping the place up.

254
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,664
Well, it's gonna take more than cleaning
the floors to retain it, I'm afraid.

255
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,160
The facility and the real estate
are scheduled to go into receivership

256
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,460
at the end of this week.

257
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,796
Unless

258
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,213
you watch this.

259
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,679
- What is this?
- A video message drafted by Dr. Wells.

260
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,141
- What's on it? Have you seen it?
- No.

261
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,183
He was very specific.
It was only to be watched by you.

262
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,307
The device will send me a notification
after you've viewed it,

263
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,688
and at that point,
I'll have everything ready to execute.

264
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,317
- I'm not gonna watch that.
- Well, that's up to you, Mr. Allen.

265
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:35,151
I'm only here to represent
Harrison Wells's final request. Good day.

266
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,020
- What are you guys doing here?
- LRIS: Working.

267
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,026
So, Caitlin was right.

268
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,699
Yes, all humans contain
small amounts of radiation

269
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,530
due to contact with cell phones,
microwaves, televisions, et cetera.

270
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,705
Our bodies are natural conductors.

271
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,083
I think our meta's been sucking up
all the radiation around him

272
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,535
and using it to power himself.

273
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,545
Which is why the X-ray machines at the
hospital failed the day of the rally.

274
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,715
So if we wanna find him, we got to look
for places without radiation.

275
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,801
All right, guys,
I don't want any of you here right now.

276
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,805
Tough. You need your partners.
You need your friends.

277
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,266
Barry, everyone in this room
cares about you.

278
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,222
But we also care about this city.

279
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,895
We all wanna make a difference,
and that means fighting meta-humans,

280
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,647
and that means working with the Flash.

281
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,562
You can't deny us that. Not anymore.

282
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,112
Got him. There's a three-block dead zone
near a hazardous waste reclamation plant.

283
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,440
It should be blooming with rads,
and right now it's at zero.

284
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,575
That's where you'll find
your Atom Smasher.

285
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,490
Huh.

286
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,668
Because he absorbs atomic power and he,
well, smashes.

287
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,248
Come here.

288
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,832
- That's a great name. Welcome to the team.
- Thank you.

289
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,302
Great. Guys, thank you.
You can go now, all right?

290
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:20,803
Barry, you need to let Cisco and Stein
figure out a way to stop this guy.

291
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,682
No, I don't.

292
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:35,488
Barry left his comm system behind.
We can't talk to him. He's on his own.

293
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,957
Ah!

294
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,387
Well, this is a curveball.

295
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,643
I thought I was going to have to come
looking for you.

296
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,475
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.

297
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,811
- I'm only here to hurt you, buddy.
- Yeah?

298
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,402
Then why did you kill Albert Rothstein?
And why do you look like him?

299
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:22,486
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Try me.

300
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,653
I'm about to.

301
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,572
Is there really no way of knowing
what's going on in there?

302
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,199
I'm looking for the security cameras.

303
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,206
Booya!

304
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,562
My turn.

305
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,184
Dad.

306
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,194
- Maybe I can make it there.
- No, you won't.

307
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,441
And what are you gonna do
when you get there?

308
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,197
- The Boot didn't work on him.
- Alarm.

309
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,525
- Believe me, we're all alarmed.
- No, the alarm system.

310
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,693
You've tapped into
the surveillance cameras, correct?

311
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:05,949
Correct.

312
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,365
Come on, feel the noise.

313
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,875
He said you were some kind of big hero.

314
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,050
But you don't seem worthy of him
or this city.

315
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,429
Professor Stein, you are a genius.

316
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,973
I believe
that's already been well established.

317
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,787
No, thank you.

318
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,619
Iris says mac and cheese is your favorite.

319
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,579
I'm not hungry.

320
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,459
It's been six months, Barry.
You got to eat, son.

321
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,134
It's a good move,
being angry all the time.

322
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,585
I get it.

323
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,138
You miss your mom and dad, and you wanna
show them that you're strong.

324
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,635
Being mad makes it easier.

325
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,311
Tougher thing to do
would be to let yourself feel.

326
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,940
It's okay to be sad.
You can be sad, Barry.

327
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:21,320
Your parents will understand
if you're not strong all the time.

328
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,861
That is why I'm here.

329
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,947
It's okay, son. I got you.

330
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,388
You're good, I got you.

331
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,818
Where is everyone?

332
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,405
I figured you wouldn't want an audience
when you came to.

333
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,908
Yeah, thanks.

334
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,657
Iris is right.

335
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,661
We're not gonna do this anymore.

336
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,833
For the last six months,
I've given you your space

337
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,999
to work all this out, come back to us.

338
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:25,051
But today proved that
you'd rather just get yourself killed.

339
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,679
It's better than
getting my friends killed.

340
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,391
You want me to tell you
that it wasn't your fault?

341
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,269
I can't. It was. Guess what?

342
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,016
You weren't the only person
making decisions that day.

343
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,858
All of the rest of us were there, too.

344
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,566
Eddie and Ronnie...

345
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,575
They chose to help you stop Wells,
and stop that...

346
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,782
- Singularity.
- Singularity thing.

347
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,531
It's on all of us, Barry.

348
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,744
So stop with this
hogging all the blame and regret.

349
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,413
We got to live with it.

350
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,460
Move on.

351
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,043
What do I do now?

352
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,590
Well, I know that you've been

353
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,596
rebuilding Central City at night.

354
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,763
That's just bricks and paint.

355
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,433
Maybe you should start trying to rebuild

356
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,398
things that really matter.

357
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,078
What are you doing here?

358
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,422
Sorry, I should've called or something.

359
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,250
I just... I wanted to see you.

360
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,676
It's been a while.

361
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:56,263
Yeah, Cisco said that he saw you
at the Flash Day celebration.

362
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,593
I was surprised.

363
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:03,308
You better than anyone know that
I wasn't the hero that day.

364
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,314
- Of course you were.
- No.

365
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,820
Cait, Ronnie died saving me and I...

366
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,492
I should've saved him and I'm so sorry.

367
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,490
Barry, I know that you did
everything you could.

368
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,117
It wasn't your fault.

369
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,835
I don't blame you for Ronnie's death.
I blame myself.

370
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,212
You...

371
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,301
Why?

372
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,679
When Ronnie first became Firestorm,
he asked me to leave Central City

373
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,640
and go somewhere
that we could have a normal life.

374
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,227
And I said no.

375
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:51,652
I couldn't leave S.T.A.R. Labs,
Dr. Wells, you.

376
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,034
If I had gone with him,
Ronnie would still be alive.

377
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,582
Being at S.T.A.R. Labs
just made think of that every single day.

378
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,039
Here.

379
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,833
Oh, you carry a handkerchief now?

380
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,547
What are you, 80?

381
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,679
- What's that?
- Uh, it's uh...

382
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:23,559
Apparently, in the case of his death,
Wells had some kind of, um, living will.

383
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,434
- And you haven't watched it yet?
- No.

384
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,693
No, I've been too afraid.

385
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,403
What if we watched it together?

386
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,746
All right.

387
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,924
Hello, Barry. If you're watching this,

388
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,093
that means
something has gone horribly wrong.

389
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,265
I'm dead, and the last 15 years
have been for nothing.

390
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,598
Bummer, 15 years.

391
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,561
You know what I realized?
In all those years helping raise you,

392
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,105
we were never truly enemies, Barry.

393
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,319
I'm not the thing you hate.

394
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,774
And so I'm gonna give you the thing
that you want most.

395
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,321
It won't matter.

396
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,111
You'll never be truly happy. Barry Allen.

397
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,489
Trust me, I know you.

398
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,914
Now, erase everything
I said up to this point.

399
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,333
Give the following message to the police.

400
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,340
My name is Harrison Wells.

401
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,759
Being of sound mind and body,

402
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,678
I freely confess to the murder
of Nora Allen in her home

403
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,465
on the night of March 18th,
in the year 2000.

404
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,092
- I attacked Nora Allen...
- Oh, my God.

405
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,433
He confessed.

406
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,482
This is it.

407
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,648
This is what I need to free my dad.

408
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:05,206
Hey, Joe. Yeah. Hey, can you have
everybody meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs?

409
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,164
Yeah. All right, thanks.
Yeah, all right, bye.

410
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,123
- I'll drive.
- Okay.

411
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,629
Do you think the video's enough?

412
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,131
Mmm-hmm.

413
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,175
Well, sure.

414
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,391
- What's she saying?
- Hold on.

415
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,807
Wells gave all the right details.
It's not a done deal yet,

416
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,309
but the D.A. says it looks good.

417
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,188
Yeah, I'm here.

418
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,529
Is it good news?

419
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,240
- I think so.
- Henry's coming home?

420
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:54,706
Okay. Well, that still leaves
Atom Smasher to deal with.

421
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,213
Last time you faced him,
it did not go well.

422
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,047
No, it did not.

423
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:04,507
I clearly can't stop him by myself.
So how are we gonna beat him?

424
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,515
Well, ever since
I was shown a drained radiation tag,

425
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,182
which I haven't been able
to stop thinking about, thank you, Cisco.

426
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,732
You're welcome, Caitlin.

427
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,854
If this guy likes radiation so much,
I say we give it to him.

428
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,913
Showtime.

429
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,546
What's up? I see you got my message.

430
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,923
That light was perfect bait.
What made you think of that?

431
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,642
I don't know, I think I saw it
in a comic book somewhere.

432
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,763
You want me,
you're gonna have to catch me.

433
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,478
It's working, dude.
Rothstein's following you.

434
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,318
I must say,
he's quite agile for a man his size.

435
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,443
- Run, Barry, run.
- Come on.

436
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,763
Didn't think I could catch you, huh?

437
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,479
No, I knew you could.

438
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,936
Now, Cisco!

439
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,200
The amount of radiation
about to flood that room...

440
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,444
Atom Smasher
won't be able to absorb it all.

441
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,978
The radiation's been cleared.
It's safe for you to go in.

442
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,672
I'm sorry.
I couldn't let you hurt anyone else.

443
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,332
Why?

444
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,385
Why did you wanna kill me?

445
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,513
He promised he'd take me home...

446
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,354
If I killed you.

447
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,935
Who? Who promised you that?

448
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,195
Zoom.

449
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,618
Let's get out of here.

450
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,244
I'll race you.

451
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,748
You will lose.

452
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,672
Welcome home!

453
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,189
Gather around, everyone, please.

454
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:12,648
Looking at all of you,
thinking how far we've all come,

455
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,909
and remembering those
who are no longer with us,

456
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:22,165
I'm reminded of a Hebrew word
used during times of graduation.

457
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,580
Kadima.

458
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,328
It means...

459
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,500
Forward.

460
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:30,923
Forward.

461
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,550
Forward.

462
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,380
- Forward.
- Forward.

463
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,719
- Forward.
- Forward.

464
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,679
Forward.

465
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,693
- Well said.
- Thank you.

466
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,524
- You good?
- Yeah.

467
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,911
That stuff goes to your head
after being away from it

468
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,534
- for 14 years.
- I bet.

469
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,914
All right, well, look.

470
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,910
I was thinking, what, uh,
if in the morning,

471
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,212
the two of us started looking
for an apartment for both of us?

472
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,549
And Iris actually has been doing
some research on

473
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,425
how to get your medical license back

474
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,720
so you, uh, could start
your practice up again?

475
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,055
Or if you wanted,
come work with us at S.T.A.R. Labs?

476
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,223
I don't know. I mean...

477
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,763
What's wrong? You okay?

478
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,437
Um, yeah, it's a party, come on,
we can talk about all this tomorrow.

479
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,640
- Talk about what?
- Barry.

480
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,981
Are you not planning on sticking around?

481
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,824
Okay.

482
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,829
Okay, do you think...

483
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,244
Can you be all that you are becoming

484
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,750
with me here?

485
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,129
You're the only family that I have left.

486
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,644
Well, that's not really true, is it?

487
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,146
Don't you have another family
in this room?

488
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,933
They need your help too, Barry.

489
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:17,151
When you need me, I will be here.

490
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,700
But right now, Central City
doesn't need you to be Henry Allen's son,

491
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,036
it needs you to be

492
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,946
the Flash.

493
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,292
My kid...

494
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,962
The superhero.

495
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,675
I have to go.

496
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,309
I need you to tell me that it's okay.

497
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,017
Yeah, all right.

498
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,552
- Hey.
- Hey.

499
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:29,015
- Your dad get off okay?
- Yeah, I just dropped him at the station.

500
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,353
You good?

501
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,398
I don't know.

502
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,439
It just feels like every time I win,
I still lose.

503
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,444
Well...

504
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,780
It's not bad.

505
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,365
No, it's not bad.

506
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,747
- This is pretty cool.
- Lt's really cool! Come on.

507
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,129
- Hey.
- Hey.

508
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,626
Oh!

509
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,255
Hey, guess what?
I added a little upgrade to your suit.

510
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,758
It's just like the one from the
future newspaper Gideon showed us.

511
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,437
I was thinking, you know, we shouldn't
fear the future anymore, right?

512
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,436
No, and it'll be here
faster than we think.

513
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,398
I must say, I like it, the lightning
definitely pops more against the white.

514
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:24,570
And S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever.
Increased security and surveillance.

515
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,285
Re-coded, double fire-walled
electronic locksets.

516
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,578
Nothing is getting through here
without us knowing.

517
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,910
So people can'tjust waltz
in and out of here.

518
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,458
Exactly.

519
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,119
- For real?
- Stay where you are.

520
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,419
Who are you?

521
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,295
You don't know me, but I know you,
Barry Allen.

522
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,593
Take one more step,
it'll be the last step you take.

523
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,137
The man asked you a question.
Who the hell are you?

524
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:52,435
My name is Jay Garrick.
And your world is in danger.

525
00:41:52,459 --> 00:42:00,459
