1
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,844
<i>So call us here, our lines are open.</i>
<i>Now for a quick update...</i>

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,038
<i>... here's Stan, the weatherman.</i>

3
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,742
<i>And get out your handkerchiefs.</i>
<i>We're in for another scorcher tomorrow.</i>

4
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,785
<i>Hot and humid, with the mercury</i>
<i>climbing into the 90s...</i>

5
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,446
<i>... and there's no relief in sight.</i>

6
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,980
Man! It must be over 100 degrees
in here!

7
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,742
Can't you do something about it?

8
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:55,285
Hey, the air conditioning's busted.
The repairman's on his way.

9
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,322
Heat's not the problem.
Jimmy Swain is the problem.

10
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:02,291
Not for me, Vega. It's your territory
he's making a run at.

11
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,895
Listen.

12
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,464
Swain's got his torpedoes working
the west side. Once he soaks that up...

13
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,695
...he'll move in on Little Hong Kong.
- In another month, we'll be squeezed out.

14
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,534
Swain'll have this whole city
in his tight, dirty pocket.

15
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,869
I say we take him out now.

16
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,172
Send the message that no out-of-town punk
is gonna move us out.

17
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,818
- I agree.
- The last thing we need is somebody...

18
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:30,353
...screwing up the balance of power.

19
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,154
Somebody call for a repairman?

20
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,259
Hello?

21
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,297
- Who is it?
- I'm here from Central City Air...

22
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,731
...to repair the air conditioning.

23
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,799
Hi. How you doing, sir?

24
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,604
Air conditioner's on the fritz.
Make it cool in here.

25
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,010
Oh, don't you worry about a thing.
Cool is my specialty.

26
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,650
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, Bar, sorry to wake you.</i>

27
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,591
- Julio.
- <i>I'm down in Helltown...</i>

28
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,594
<i>... at the St. Diogenes Social Club.</i>

29
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,996
<i>I think you should get over here.</i>
<i>We got a weird one.</i>

30
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,504
Move back here.

31
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,011
Come on. Over here.

32
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,582
Hey man, what's up?
Can you believe this heat?

33
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,586
I got something else
you won't believe.

34
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,691
- What's that?
- You'll see.

35
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,885
These guys are frozen solid.

36
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,324
It's gotta be about 90 degrees
out there.

37
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,986
How could this happen?

38
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,462
From the positions of the bodies,
they were...

39
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,000
...killed trying to get away.

40
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,003
A sudden subzero drop
in body temperature.

41
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,971
It could be liquid oxygen.
Or nitrogen maybe.

42
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,910
You'd have to drop the bodies
in a vat of the stuff to get this effect.

43
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:46,279
These guys were frozen on the spot.
I don't know how.

44
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,818
Well, let me spur
your conjecturing, Allen.

45
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,047
Meet the late Nikolai Brown...

46
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,859
...Ray McGill, Luis Vega...

47
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,965
...and attempting to dial 911,
Johnny Choi.

48
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,327
- What?
- That's right.

49
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,163
Central City's criminal board of directors.

50
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:09,468
Combined, they control virtually
all the crime in this town. Or they did.

51
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,440
It must been serious for all them
to sit down together.

52
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,307
I need some answers. Fast.

53
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,779
I don't know if I got a quadruple homicide
or a freak of nature.

54
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,096
You have no right!
Ever hear of freedom of speech?

55
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,236
- This is closed to reporters.
- It's a violation of my rights!

56
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,530
Nobody crosses this line
without authorization.

57
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,833
All right! I get the message.

58
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,102
But your name's on my list,
Officer Bellows!

59
00:05:55,388 --> 00:06:00,018
Oh, nice! Do you have any idea
how much a manicure costs these days?

60
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,821
- What were you doing?
- Trying to get past Dirty Harry...

61
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,487
...not that it's any of your business.
Hey, you guys work for the crime lab?

62
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,829
- Yeah, not that it's any of your business.
- Right. This is great.

63
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,334
I hear you got couple of human
snow cones in there.

64
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,201
You give me exclusive,
I'll put your name in the paper.

65
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,240
- What do you say?
- Bellows!

66
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,412
Escort Lois Lane here back across police
barricade and make sure she stays there.

67
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,642
Yeah? How's this for a headline:
"Police rough up reporter."

68
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,581
Don't tempt me, lady. Let's go.

69
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,823
Your name is on my list too.
You got that? Watch yourself, ace!

70
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,821
I love it!

71
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,001
No more infighting over turf.

72
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,699
No more slicing the pie so thin you can't
even see the wedge on your plate.

73
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,573
From now on, this city is gonna be run
by a single entrepreneur: Me.

74
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,779
No, thank you.

75
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,651
You know, I like the way
you clean house.

76
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,592
I'm offering you a permanent position
in my organization. I'll pay you well.

77
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,593
Oh, that's very flattering of you,
Mr. Swain, but you see...

78
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,790
...one of the great pleasures
of my job is the travel.

79
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,199
Have it your way.

80
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,451
The rest of your payment, as we agreed...

81
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,618
...and I thank you.

82
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,656
Hey, listen.

83
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:52,562
There is one more little job I'd like
for you to do before you leave town.

84
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,070
Oh, I'd really like to,
but I have reservations in St. Tropez.

85
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,803
Yeah. Work on that tan.

86
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:07,084
You're probably not the right guy
for this job anyway.

87
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,981
It's a tough number.

88
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,984
A real challenge.

89
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,256
Oh, really?

90
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,365
- I'm listening.
- Well, there's this guy in town...

91
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,592
...l'm worried about. He's put lot
of my peers out of business...

92
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,000
...and I'd be very grateful if you'd...

93
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,606
...put him on ice.

94
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,840
And who is this?

95
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,040
He calls himself...

96
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,543
...the Flash.

97
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,142
The Flash.

98
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,216
- Anything new on those frozen bodies?
- No. The coroner hasn't got a clue.

99
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,792
I'll have Tina run a tissue sample
through Star Labs.

100
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,021
- Any suspects?
- They could be aliens from the Earth's core.

101
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,063
- What?
- Like the Flash.

102
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,758
Julio, come on,
you don't really read this rag, do you?

103
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,063
You gotta wrap the fish
in something, right?

104
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,229
Mendez! Allen!

105
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,238
Almost got away.

106
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:14,249
Gentlemen, this is Terri Kronenberg,
a reporter for <i>The Daily Clarion.</i>

107
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,322
Ms. Kronenberg, Julio Mendez,
Barry Allen, our forensic scientists.

108
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,190
Yes, Mr. Allen and I have already met.
How's your foot?

109
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,727
Just fine. How's your hand?

110
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,257
Ms. Kronenberg
is on special assignment...

111
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,030
...to do a series of articles about
the police. The mayor's office asked us...

112
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,536
...to extend every courtesy.

113
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,837
I'd like you to show her the crime lab
and tell her what you do.

114
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,844
Lieutenant, we're very busy up
in the crime lab at the moment.

115
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,914
We are all very busy, Allen...

116
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:48,281
...but the chief's office thinks
the publicity could be good for us.

117
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,719
- Need I say more?
- No, sir.

118
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,426
Look, why don't we just...

119
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,395
...let bygones be bygones
and forget our little disagreement?

120
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,692
What do you say?

121
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,392
I'd better run those tissue samples
to Star Labs...

122
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,404
...but I'm sure Mr. Mendez
will be happy to show you to the lab.

123
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,235
Sure, Barry.

124
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,176
- Is he married?
- Excuse me.

125
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:17,677
I understand you're a reporter and you're
doing a story on Central City's finest.

126
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,250
- That's right.
- Great. Allow me to introduce myself.

127
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,855
I'm Officer Murphy, somewhat
of a legend here in the police department.

128
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:28,016
- I'll make myself available for interviews.
- Thanks, that's very considerate of you.

129
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,958
I was thinking perhaps
over dinner maybe...

130
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,066
...I could tell you cop stories that would
make Jack the Ripper look like a musical.

131
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,929
A musical comedy.

132
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,072
Yes, no doubt. Why don't you just write
your adventures down...

133
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,230
...and I'll read them
when you're done.

134
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,937
Why not?

135
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,810
Why not?

136
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,884
"Michael Francis Murphy:

137
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,820
Dedicated cop, hard-hitting novelist."

138
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:03,986
No. "Hard-hitting cop, unsparing author."

139
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,529
Murphy, this is great.

140
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,929
- I thought you had theory to run past me.
- Yeah.

141
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,232
- You know spontaneous combustion?
- When thing seem to burst...

142
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,706
...into flames on their own.
- Exactly. Well...

143
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,711
...I was thinking this might be that,
only opposite.

144
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,908
No one knows that spontaneous
combustion really happens.

145
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,551
It's just a theory.

146
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,620
And I've never heard
of spontaneous freezing.

147
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,087
But there must be
some rational explanation.

148
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,427
Let me run that tissue sample
through my analysis equipment.

149
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,061
If I come up with anything...

150
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,163
...l'll let you know.
- Thanks, Tina.

151
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:44,030
Well, I better get back to the crime lab.
Hopefully Ms. Kronenberg will be gone.

152
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,108
Dinner, anyone?

153
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,906
- Hello.
- I heard you might be working late...

154
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,577
...I thought you might be hungry.
So I've got Chinese, Italian and Mexican.

155
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,484
I have trouble making decisions.

156
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,787
Well, this is very nice,
but really, it's not necessary.

157
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,191
All right, look, about the other night...

158
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,955
...I acted like a jerk.

159
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,863
Well, I mean, not so much a jerk
as much as I was just sort of pushy.

160
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,732
All right, actually, to tell you the truth,
I was a jerk.

161
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,739
But it's my job. I take it very seriously,
and it makes me a little aggressive.

162
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,070
It's a problem,
and I've been working on it.

163
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,679
I'm a lot better.
You should've seen me before.

164
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:34,150
It's a trait, it runs in my family. So, what
I'm trying to say here is I'm sorry, okay?

165
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,086
Do you ever breathe?

166
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:42,084
- Yeah, that's another thing, I talk a lot.
- Oh, really? I hadn't noticed.

167
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,856
I guess I figure that if I let someone
else get a word in edgewise, well...

168
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,831
...they're just gonna tell me I'm wrong.
My therapist says I'm insecure.

169
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,335
- I don't know, what do you think?
- I think it's okay to listen.

170
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,031
You know, you're smart.

171
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,609
I like brains in a man,
I think that's sexy.

172
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,581
I think maybe we should eat
before the food gets cold.

173
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,255
So.

174
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,290
What...?
What do you know about the Flash?

175
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,861
The Flash? Not much, why?

176
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,590
Well, I have this theory. I think that
he's a member of the police department.

177
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,828
Really? What makes you say that?

178
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,769
Well, come on, think about it.
Why can't they catch him?

179
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,536
Because he knows every move they're
gonna make. It's because he's a cop.

180
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,977
Interesting theory.
I'm not sure I buy it.

181
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:41,083
I asked some of your fellow officers
who they all thought the Flash was.

182
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,483
Everyone had a different answer.

183
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:48,426
You friend Julio even thought once
that you were the Flash.

184
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,260
What's so funny?

185
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:56,997
Well, you don't really strike me
as the type. You're not physical enough.

186
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,835
Well, I stay in shape.

187
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:04,135
Oh, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong.
You look terrific for a scientist.

188
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,039
Well, thank you.

189
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,806
Listen, why are you so interested
in the Flash anyway?

190
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:14,215
Well, he's news, you know. I would love
to get an interview with him.

191
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,183
Any reporter would.

192
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,279
Barry.

193
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:22,291
Tina. This is Terri Kronenberg,
she's a reporter.

194
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,429
Oh, yes. I've heard about you.

195
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:28,089
This is Tina McGee,
she's a scientist too. Star Labs.

196
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:33,000
Sorry to interrupt. I've just analyzed
the tissue and found something interesting.

197
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,140
- Would you excuse us a moment?
- Sure.

198
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:39,403
There was a low level of residual radiation.
Not too dangerous, but higher than normal.

199
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:40,670
What does it mean?

200
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:44,282
They were frozen by something that
uses nuclear energy as a power source.

201
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,975
- Sounds like some kind of weapon.
- It does, doesn't it?

202
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,086
All right, let's move.

203
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,552
Come on.

204
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,627
Move it, people!

205
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,253
- Let's go.
- Bellows, what's going on?

206
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,866
Some creep phoned in. He left three
packages with bombs in the city.

207
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,696
- They're about to set off in five minutes.
- Where?

208
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,395
There's one at Central Books, one at...

209
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,039
So you're a reporter.
That must be interesting.

210
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:18,377
And you're a scientist.
That must be dull. Excuse me.

211
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,530
Don't touch that!

212
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,379
Where is it?

213
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,965
Yeah, I knew if I raced you
all over town, you'd run out of steam.

214
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,762
You look pretty hot.

215
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,672
I think I'd better cool you off.

216
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,186
Oh, boy, you've got some
pretty good moves there, red.

217
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,882
But you know what?

218
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,619
Even you can't outrun
the cold hand of death.

219
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,001
Looks like we're gonna have
to call this one a draw, huh?

220
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,661
Until we meet again.

221
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,971
- Still hurting, huh?
- Yeah, but it's better.

222
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,778
I'm telling you, the blast went through
the suit like it wasn't even there.

223
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,715
Barry, I did some research last night.

224
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,550
I think I know where that weapon
came from.

225
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,720
A company in California have been
doing research in biological cryogenics.

226
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,228
The freezing of living organisms.

227
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,964
They developed
a portable freezing unit...

228
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:54,070
...powered by
a lightweight nuclear module.

229
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,065
It can fire a blast that can lower
a temperature to minus 200 degrees F...

230
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,507
...at a range of 100 feet.

231
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,874
Six months ago, burglars broke in
and stole it.

232
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,982
That's the weapon he was carrying.

233
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,778
Barry, I want you to consider something.

234
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,017
Last night was a trap.

235
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,647
Whoever set those bombs knew the Flash
would race around to defuse them...

236
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,817
...and the exertion would exhaust you.

237
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:20,328
- I think you should lay low for a while.
- Hide out till it's safe?

238
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,524
- I can't do that.
- Barry, someone is trying to kill you!

239
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,138
One blast could freeze you in your tracks
before you even got close.

240
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,774
I'll just have to find him first.

241
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,973
Okay, but I want to be able
to keep an eye on you.

242
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:37,243
I've implanted this mini transmitter
in your suit's earpiece.

243
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,974
It'll allow me to track you.

244
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,949
If there's emergency
and your vital signs reach critical...

245
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,885
...it'll trigger an alarm off
here in the lab.

246
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,691
Thanks, Tina.

247
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,555
You know, I really do appreciate
the concern.

248
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,238
- Crime Lab, Allen speaking.
- <i>It's Fosnight.</i>

249
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,397
- What have you got?
- That guy that tried to frost the Flash...

250
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,772
...is the same guy who threw
the igloo pie at the St. Diogenes Club.

251
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,640
Yeah, no kidding. What's his name?

252
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,248
How about a nickname,
Captain Cold.

253
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,179
<i>Ex-mercenary, now he's a hit man.</i>

254
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,480
Captain Cold?
What's this guy look like?

255
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,314
It's pretty hard to miss him.
He's an albino.

256
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,187
Don't let the pink eyes fool you,
the guy's a stone killer.

257
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,062
Hit men have employers, right?

258
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,893
Right. There's a power play
brewing in the underworld.

259
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,865
A punk from back east named
Jimmy Swain is trying to move in.

260
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,928
<i>He hired Cold</i>
<i>to refrigerate the obstacles...</i>

261
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,007
<i>... and that includes the Flash.</i>

262
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,806
All right. Thanks, Fosnight.
Oh, how much is this gonna cost me?

263
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,683
You couldn't afford it, copper.

264
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:50,345
But the Flash is a pretty good egg,
more or less, so this one's a giveaway.

265
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,080
Later, Allen.

266
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,961
The <i>Inquisitor</i>.

267
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,395
"<i>Inquisitor</i> has learned that police
and scientists from Star Labs...

268
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,970
...have joined forces to search
for a killer...

269
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,007
...with a nuclear-powered
freeze weapon."

270
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,573
Here you go.

271
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,047
"<i>Murphy's Law</i>: The true story
of Michael Francis Murphy...

272
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,349
...the cop who saved Central City"?

273
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,789
- My eyes only, Bellows. My eyes only!
- What are you doing?

274
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,623
Writing the first of a long line
of bestselling novels...

275
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,994
...that'll allow me to be the guy
in the hammock with a blue drink...

276
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,068
...on the French Riviera.
- When did you save Central City?

277
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,000
It's called dramatic license.

278
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,834
I had a different word for it, see?

279
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,103
- Where's Terri Kronenberg?
- I last saw her in Garfield's office.

280
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,804
- Something wrong?
- I'll handle it.

281
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,281
I need an address on Jimmy Swain.
He's a criminal from out of town.

282
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,113
All right.

283
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,487
- Did you write this?
- Me?

284
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,689
Whatever gave you that idea?

285
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,092
You're the only one
who could've heard us talking last night.

286
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,456
Well, l...

287
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:11,330
I called the <i>Clarion</i>, they never heard
of you. Neither did the mayor's office.

288
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,995
You're not here to do a story.
That just a scam. What's it really about?

289
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,232
Call the Department of Public Affairs.

290
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,309
- I'm sure that they...
- The Flash!

291
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:23,278
That's it, isn't it? You want to do a story
about the Flash for the <i>Inquisitor.</i>

292
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,315
- No, you don't understand.
- The hell I don't.

293
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,945
You were pumping me
for information last night.

294
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,351
Look, I have tried to get a job
with the <i>Clarion</i> for two years.

295
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,152
I only work for the <i>Inquisitor</i>
because they'd hire me.

296
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,022
The Flash is an alien?

297
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,288
I figured if I could get story
on the Flash...

298
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,295
...the <i>Clarion</i> would give me a chance.

299
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,764
Either you tell Lieutenant Garfield
the truth...

300
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,732
...or I will.

301
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,542
You're supposed to be low profile!

302
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,449
What's next? Your own TV series?

303
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,789
You said the Flash was gonna be dead
in 24 hours. What happened?

304
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,052
Well, he was faster than I thought.

305
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,095
But don't worry about it.
Don't get upset.

306
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,426
It won't happen again.

307
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,030
I've built an electronic scanner...

308
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:23,971
...that allows me to track anything moving
through the city faster than 200 mph.

309
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,632
Next time he won't get away.

310
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,972
There's not gonna be a next time.
You're fired.

311
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,444
- But we have a contract.
- I'm canceling it.

312
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:34,517
- You generate too much publicity.
- What about the rest of my money?

313
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,417
The other half was on delivery.
You didn't deliver.

314
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:42,320
Okay. If that's the way you want it.

315
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,565
By the way...

316
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,637
...I have something for you,
a little gift. It's...

317
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,831
I always give one to my customers
at the end of every job.

318
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,600
It's...

319
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,107
...for good luck.

320
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,709
Just to show there's no hard feelings.

321
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,981
See you around.

322
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,837
You know...

323
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:11,142
...that's the trouble with the world
these days, Mr. Swain.

324
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:16,117
People have forgotten
about honor and commitment.

325
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,617
Nobody cancels a contract with me.

326
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:32,359
Once I take a job, I always finish it.

327
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,300
No matter what.

328
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,548
Hey, Barry, where you been?
We've got work to do.

329
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,242
- The ice man struck again.
- Where?

330
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,150
Remember that guy you asked
Bellows to locate, Jimmy Swain?

331
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,292
He found him in an apartment
at Bradbury Arms, frozen solid.

332
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,017
- Jimmy Swain?
- That's not all.

333
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,254
Garfield got a call on another one.
Somebody found an iced stiff...

334
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,763
...at the metalworks,
it's on Sturgeon Street.

335
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,562
- I'll take Sturgeon Street.
- I'll take the Bradbury Arms then.

336
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,987
Gotcha! Great makeup, huh?
I feel sort of like a Christmas tree.

337
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,617
- Are you out of your mind?
- Hi, I'm Terri Kronenberg, I'm a reporter.

338
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:08,562
I know you're a very busy guy. I only
need five minutes for an interview, okay?

339
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,793
It's important to me, and I'm sure
you won't mind. What's the deal?

340
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,531
- Do you sleep in the suit or wear pajamas?
- Get these cuffs off of me.

341
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,174
Not till I get my interview.

342
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,776
Will you give me the key,
or do I have to search you?

343
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,106
That sounds like fun,
but I don't have it on me.

344
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,147
I hid it somewhere in the city.
Either give me my interview...

345
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,150
...or we can search the city.
- I've got a better option:

346
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,815
Hypothermia.

347
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,226
Hey.

348
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,662
Hey, get up. Get up!

349
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,109
Sorry.

350
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,744
This just isn't your night.

351
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,874
Barry! My God!

352
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:27,602
Where are you?

353
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,816
Sorry. No witnesses.

354
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,495
- Clarion.
- Hi, I need to talk to the news editor.

355
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,967
- <i>Sorry, he's gone home for the day.</i>
- You'd better find him, and fast.

356
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,333
Tell him to dig out his checkbook.

357
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:32,635
Somebody just killed the Flash,
and I got pictures of it.

358
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,675
Come on, let's go!
Get the body to Forensics fast!

359
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,113
Let's go!

360
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,254
Get it in there!

361
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,715
Perfect! Bellows, inside! Come on!

362
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,916
- Give me a hand over here.
- Yeah.

363
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,756
- Over here.
- I got it.

364
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:17,076
- National Inquisitor.
- Yes, this is Hogan Film Labs.

365
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,849
We have a rush delivery
for one of your reporters...

366
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,889
...a Miss Terri Kronenberg.

367
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,790
We seem to have misplaced the address.

368
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,107
You can't die. I won't let you die.

369
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,746
Damn it, Barry! Come on!

370
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,135
Why wouldn't you listen to me, Barry?
Why?

371
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,304
Come on, Barry!

372
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,020
Tina.

373
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,649
Barry?

374
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,697
I thought you were dead.

375
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,031
It's so cold.

376
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,402
Why am I alive?

377
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,409
Your high-speed metabolism
must have saved you.

378
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,172
I could see everything.

379
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,409
He was standing over me, grinning.
And then...

380
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,180
...he went for Terri.

381
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,880
- Terri Kronenberg? She was there?
- He's gonna kill her.

382
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,083
- You're in no shape...
- Just call the station.

383
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,888
Tell them to get to her apartment.

384
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,270
Miss Kronenberg?
It's Jason from Central City Courier.

385
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,036
Here to pick up your pictures.

386
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,044
I told the <i>Clarion</i> not to pick them up
for another hour.

387
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,308
Well, I can't wait. I'm here.

388
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,129
You ordered some ice?

389
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,399
What's the matter?
Don't you wanna come out and play?

390
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,033
I'm here to take you
to the Ice Capades.

391
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,075
I'll huff and I'll puff...

392
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,078
...and I'll freeze all your stuff.

393
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:04,750
I know you're in there,
I can smell your cheap perfume.

394
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,056
Are you hiding in the shower?

395
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,839
The ice man cometh.

396
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,520
Hello there.

397
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,473
- You're alive.
- No thanks to you.

398
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,341
Hey, I'm sorry about what happened.
It's just that l...

399
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,814
Oh, look at what you've done!

400
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,287
You ruined all my photos!

401
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,393
I could've got 10,000 bucks
for those pictures of you...

402
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,324
...and Mr. Ice Cube here.

403
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:22,592
- Thanks a lot. There goes my career.
- Wait a minute.

404
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,225
You had pictures of Captain Cold
and you didn't call the police?

405
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,032
They would've seen them
on the front page of the <i>Clarion</i>.

406
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,107
I don't believe you!

407
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:36,009
All you care about is your money
and your career. You almost got us killed!

408
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,717
- No, I didn't... I didn't mean to...
- You didn't mean to what?

409
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,852
To be an unprincipled,
manipulative brat...

410
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,183
...who thinks truth is something
to be twisted to get what you want?

411
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,221
If you really wanna be
a good reporter...

412
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:51,192
...you have to learn to care
about the truth. And about people.

413
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,661
The police will be here for him.

414
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,700
Hey, Murph, did you hear the news?

415
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,668
- Looks like the Flash isn't dead after all.
- What?

416
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,706
Well, he captured
that Captain Cold character...

417
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,003
...at Terri Kronenberg's apartment.

418
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:11,376
I knew that frozen phony we found
at the metalworks wasn't the real thing.

419
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,645
Murphy!

420
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,016
Would you mind putting
your memoirs away long enough...

421
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,885
...to escort the prisoner to lockup?
- Yes, sir.

422
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,926
- All right, iceberg, let's move it.
- Easy now.

423
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,805
I'm gonna need your glasses.

424
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,338
My eyes are very sensitive
to the light.

425
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,881
Well, then keep them shut.
I need your glasses.

426
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,880
If you wish.

427
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,920
No...

428
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,821
...you keep them.

429
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,071
"There I stood, face to face
with the madman known as the Ghost.

430
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:18,477
He had kidnapped my girl,
killed my partner...

431
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,049
...and shot my dog.

432
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:25,315
Now it was time for him to learn
the real meaning of Murphy's Law."

433
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,152
Hey, hey, hey!
That's private property, huh?

434
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,954
Come on. You'll have to wait
for the hardcover edition...

435
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,858
...like the rest of the world.

436
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,828
Don't you have doughnuts to eat
and coffee to ruin? Come on.

437
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:40,595
I had no idea you were such a hero.
I mean, with a guy like you around...

438
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,671
...who needs the Flash?

439
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:47,638
You'll laugh on the other side of your badge
when I sell those movie rights, pal.

440
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,161
Hey, you.

441
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,168
"Hey, you"?

442
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,879
Hey, what are you doing?
What's going on?

443
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,549
It's a portable heating unit
we've been experimenting with...

444
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,484
...for work in Arctic conditions.

445
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,489
If you're hit with cold air,
it instantaneously stabilizes...

446
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,786
...your body temperature
with a blast of heat.

447
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,728
With the temperatures that Captain Cold
can create, it'll probably only work once.

448
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,833
Let's hope that once is all I'll need.

449
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,128
I've studied the properties
of his freeze gun.

450
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,703
A reflective surface
may bounce the ice beam away.

451
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,931
Thanks. I'll remember.

452
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,739
- Murphy!
- Yes, sir.

453
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,476
Did you search "Winter"
before you put him in lockup?

454
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,450
- Absolutely. Stem to stern...
- Obviously, not good enough!

455
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,681
You're on report!

456
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,208
I always finish it, no matter what.

457
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,477
Come on, you don't have
to prove anything to anybody.

458
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,178
Because of me, he escaped.
I'm the guy that screwed up.

459
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:14,518
Boy, were you right, that Murphy's Law.
More like Murphy's Guffaw.

460
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,525
- I didn't say that.
- The only way I'm gonna redeem myself...

461
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,890
...is to turn Frosty the Snowman
into a puddle.

462
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:54,228
Tina, listen, I'm okay, all right?
I have a little cold, that's all.

463
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,695
<i>Well, you don't sound okay.</i>

464
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,767
<i>Stay in bed and take care of yourself.</i>
<i>No thrashing around...</i>

465
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,767
- <i>... or you'll get pneumonia.</i>
- Yes, mom.

466
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,599
<i>I am not your mother!</i>

467
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:28,526
Listen, I'm not feeling very well.
Could you come back later?

468
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:32,396
Barry, I really need to talk to you.
This is just gonna take a minute.

469
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,832
All right, here goes.

470
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,840
I was a real louse, and I know it.

471
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,876
You were so nice
and you trusted me...

472
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,208
...and I lied to you.
There's really no excuse.

473
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,614
I was only thinking of myself,
I wasn't even thinking of anybody else.

474
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:53,189
It's just that my job is so important to me,
and I really wanted to get a big story.

475
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,685
What?

476
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,850
Friends of yours?

477
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,992
Coming!

478
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:06,427
Where you been? I been looking for you.
I tried calling you, the line was busy.

479
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,128
Okay.

480
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,138
- All right, I get it.
- No. I came home because I'm sick.

481
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,833
- What's up?
- Okay, we got a real crisis on our hands.

482
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:17,572
Captain Cold broke out of lockup and
froze a city bus with passengers inside.

483
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:22,082
He called the station and said if the Flash
didn't meet him, he'd let them freeze.

484
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,221
- No sign of the Flash.
- Where's the bus?

485
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,650
It's on Poplar and Fourth.

486
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:29,350
Garfield thinks, with our knowledge,
we can figure out how to stop this guy.

487
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,553
If that bus is frozen, those passengers
won't last 10 minutes.

488
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,028
- You go ahead. I'll meet you there.
- All right.

489
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,690
- Whoa, this could be a big story.
- You! Goodbye.

490
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,460
- I'm coming with.
- What do you mean?

491
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,502
- I've got work to do.
- I can help!

492
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,105
You could get hurt.

493
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:46,799
You don't understand.
Danger is my business.

494
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,583
Get down!

495
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,396
What's the matter? Didn't you get to play
in the snow when you were a kid?

496
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,425
I like that, that's good.

497
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,502
You know, I knew you wouldn't
turn down my little invitation.

498
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,698
I'm only here long enough to see that
you're put back in jail where you belong.

499
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,672
Oh, really?

500
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,506
Then why don't you just come
and get me.

501
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,073
What's the matter?

502
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,810
Oh, don't tell me,
you're afraid of a little ice.

503
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,096
C'est la vie.

504
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,661
This time, I'm gonna use full power...

505
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,099
...so you don't walk away again.

506
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,910
Maybe I'm warming up to you after all.

507
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:07,682
Those summer colds, they're the worst.

508
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,389
How'd you do it, Murphy?

509
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,723
- Do what, sir?
- You iced the ice man, didn't you?

510
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,023
- You mean, you didn't see...?
- See what, Murph?

511
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,564
Come on, come on, I'm a reporter!
Let me through!

512
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,726
Murphy, when the paper gets
ahold of this, you're gonna be hero.

513
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,937
- Me?
- Yeah. Come on, tell us.

514
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,735
How'd you take down Captain Cold?

515
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,873
Wasn't easy. There he was, the man
who'd brought Central City to its knees...

516
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,244
...and there I was,
Michael Francis Murphy...

517
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,978
...the cop who put the law
back in "law and order."

518
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,282
Only one of us was gonna
walk away from that, so...

519
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,288
Well, suddenly...

520
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,554
Go on, Murph.

521
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,492
Nuts. The truth is, I didn't do anything.

522
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:24,156
All I saw was a streak of red
and a blaze of lightning.

523
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,532
Then it was the Flash.

524
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:30,606
You're just gonna have to read
about that in my book. My new book:

525
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,299
<i>The Scarlet Speedster and Me.</i>

526
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:34,842
Somebody pinch me.

527
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,106
- Murphy saw the Flash for himself.
- I didn't say that.

528
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,681
- But you just...
- Wait a minute.

529
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:45,413
You'll have to read about it in the book.
In your case, the comic-book version, okay?

530
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,289
That's it.

531
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,892
Lousy heat wave.

532
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:59,202
Okay, somebody call the coroner
to pick this guy up before he melts.

533
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,035
On the other hand, maybe you better call
the Good Humor man.

534
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,447
Lunch, anyone?

535
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,782
Hello again.

536
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,620
Thai, Greek, Moroccan.

537
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,262
Sounds great. Let's go.

538
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,394
You know...

539
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,502
...I wanna thank you.

540
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,801
Between you and the Flash, I've had to take
a good hard look at myself and my career.

541
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,110
- I quit my job at the <i>Inquisitor.</i>
- You did?

542
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,844
What are you gonna do?

543
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,580
You're looking at the newest writer for
the Happy Times Greeting Card Company.

544
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,812
"A card for every occasion."

545
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:52,978
Okay.

546
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,489
<i>Roses are red</i>
<i>Violets are blue</i>

547
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,886
<i>If you don't pay our bill</i>
<i>Our company will sue</i>

548
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,526
Congratulations, I think.

549
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,295
Well, at least it's honest.

550
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:11,271
I figure it'll keep me in cornflakes until
I get a better job from a newspaper.

551
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,239
I think you made the right decision.

552
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,143
You know, I finally figured out
who the Flash is.

553
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:20,783
You did?

554
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:25,078
I still think he's a cop. Someone you
wouldn't suspect in a million years.

555
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,584
Really?

556
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:32,892
He's a nice guy. He's friendly,
concerned, works at the crime lab.

557
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,662
The crime lab?

558
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,193
Julio Mendez.

559
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,835
Julio?

560
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,268
Oh, my God, really? Julio?

561
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,137
The way I see it, he puts on a little
makeup, a little padding under his suit.

562
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,302
That way he figures
no one'll even suspect.

563
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:54,140
Oh, man, that is amazing. I mean,
who would have guessed, Julio?

564
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:58,922
Yeah. Well, his secret's safe with me.
After all, he did save my life.

565
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,260
Julio. Want some couscous?

566
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,458
No, thanks.

567
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,165
You know, we were
just talking about you.

568
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:16,363
- Yeah, what about?
- We were wondering where you've been.

569
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,537
You know,
I was just out running around.

570
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,774
Yeah, we thought so.

571
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,839
