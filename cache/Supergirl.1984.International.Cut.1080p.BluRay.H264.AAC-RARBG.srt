1
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,569
- Hello to you.
- Hello to you.

2
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,987
I hope you're fine.

3
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,368
<i>Who knows the
electron</i> wave <i>functions</i>

4
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,954
<i>for Kryptonian
covalent bonding?</i>

5
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,331
Sorry.

6
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,542
Leah.

7
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,419
<i>The cube root
of the wavelength...</i>

8
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,422
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

9
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,384
- Hello, Kara.
- Hello to you.

10
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,062
<i>Oh, it is beautiful.</i>

11
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,523
What's that gonna be, Zaltar?

12
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,526
I think...a tree.

13
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,611
A tree.

14
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,696
What is a tree?

15
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,157
A lovely thing
which grows on Earth.

16
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,701
Earth? You mean
where my cousin went?

17
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,828
Hmm, and to where,
one day soon perhaps

18
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,955
I might venture as well.

19
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,750
I don't believe you. How?

20
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,130
- In that. Through there.
- The binary chute?

21
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,131
But you'd never survive
the pressure. It'll destroy--

22
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,675
In that I can.
Zip-zap and I'm gone.

23
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,678
But you'd never
leave us, Zaltar.

24
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,514
- You'd <i>never</i> leave Argo <i>City.</i>
- Indeed, I might, Kara.

25
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,182
Too much of a good thing here.

26
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:31,020
Perhaps I'll try Saturn instead.
Yes, I think I might.

27
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,523
Saturn is...is that
further away than Earth?

28
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,650
Silly question.

29
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,152
Didn't you study six-dimensional
geometry at school?

30
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,737
Do they not teach
anything anymore?

31
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,199
Well, of course they do.
I know the equations.

32
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,955
I just can't see
them in my head.

33
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,167
Most great artists find
mathematics troublesome, Kara.

34
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,671
- Only use your imagination.
- Mm-hm.

35
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,798
Saturn and Earth
are in outer space

36
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,552
but we, we are in inner space.

37
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,430
Our city has two great
power sources.

38
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,682
This is one of them. Look.

39
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,482
An omegahedron.

40
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,651
The Guardians let you have it?

41
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,070
Not exactly. I borrowed it.

42
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,490
You stole it. Oh, Zaltar,
they're gonna--

43
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,702
No, borrowed it...
for the afternoon.

44
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,999
- For inspiration.
- Inspiration.

45
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,148
But I think that
I shall never see

46
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,275
the branches
of a living tree.

47
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,029
Why? An omegahedron
can create life, can't it?

48
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,866
It can't, child, it can't.
Just the illusion of life.

49
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,285
That's a fancy shadow
of the real thing

50
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,288
which is the most we can hope
for on this lonely old rock.

51
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,873
Kara.

52
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,834
Kara, I've been looking
for you for ages.

53
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,085
Oh, I'm sorry, mother.

54
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,422
- Zaltar.
- Alura, join us.

55
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,090
We're just inventing
miracles.

56
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,303
Put your fingers here,
Kara, and press hard.

57
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,224
Good. Now try it.

58
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,437
Let your imagination explode
and give it a try. Go on.

59
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,982
Zaltar, my-my husband
tells me you talk

60
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,318
of leaving Argo City.
For where?

61
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,654
Parts unknown.
It is, alas, a fact.

62
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,614
You and Zor-EI
have a <i>life</i> here-

63
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,282
<i>You've each other and Kara.</i>

64
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,161
<i>But, Zaltar, you
founded this city. It's yours.</i>

65
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,706
As far as the eye can see,
right to the veil, smack

66
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,543
and then what?
What is beyond?

67
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,254
<i>Alura, I cannot contain
myself to Argo City only.</i>

68
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,590
<i>My head is boiling with ideas.</i>

69
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,509
<i>My imagination is too vast,
it's uncontrollable.</i>

70
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,220
If you want my opinion, Zaltar,
you're starting to repeat

71
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,224
yourself here with
all this airy, glittery stuff.

72
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,020
Exactly. That's why
I'm going to Venus.

73
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,565
Venus? When?

74
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,818
Tomorrow or the next day,
at the latest.

75
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,153
<i>Zaltar, have you
thought about this?</i>

76
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,198
<i>It doesn't make sense to me.</i>

77
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,535
<i>I have thought intensely.
My mind is made up.</i>

78
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,835
Kara! The power source!

79
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,130
Oh, Zaltar!
Save me. Please! Help!

80
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,346
- No!
- Kara!

81
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,392
Zaltar!
Help! No!

82
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,074
You took the omegahedron.

83
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,409
That's not correct,
I lost the omegahedron.

84
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,328
- No, father, I did--
- Shh, Kara.

85
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,746
No matter who.

86
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,374
Without it this city can't
survive more than a few days.

87
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,752
Our lights will grow dim and
the very air we breathe so thin.

88
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,754
I know. So I shall find it.

89
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,924
I shall go right to the end of
inner space and I'll return it.

90
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,011
Impossible. How? No one can
leave Argo City and you know it.

91
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,847
This is our universe and
you've destroyed it with a game.

92
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,602
- A childish game.
- I think it can be done.

93
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,314
Through there, the binary chute,
in the traveler.

94
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,776
<i>Like</i> a <i>coward you
choose instant destruction</i>

95
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,070
<i>while the rest of us
are doomed to stay here...</i>

96
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,221
Kara!

97
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,931
Kara, no!

98
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,158
- You lunatic!
- She'll be killed.

99
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,952
Oh, no, she won't.

100
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,288
She will be safe,
through the binary

101
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,582
through the warp,
into another register.

102
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:25,583
Another what?

103
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,460
<i>Gravitational radiation</i>

104
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,130
a pathway from inner space
to outer space.

105
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,049
Then she'll never
be the same, ever.

106
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,135
At least she'll be alive.

107
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,388
And my fate is sealed.

108
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,183
I've lost the omegahedron

109
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,768
I must be sent
to the Phantom Zone.

110
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,564
<i>Your suffering will be short,</i>

111
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,233
mine...forever.

112
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,466
Some more
champagne, my dear Selena?

113
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,011
What are you thinking about?

114
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,309
It's such a pretty world.

115
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,940
I can't wait until
it's all mine.

116
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,150
The only way you
can rule the world

117
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,736
is to become invisible,
my pumpkin.

118
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,071
Invisible?

119
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,075
You'd almost know
how to make me invisible.

120
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,618
Oh, I do know.

121
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,872
<i>Take five black beans
and the head of a dead man,</i>

122
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,584
place one bean in his mouth,
two beans in his eyes, then--

123
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,627
Nigel, enough.

124
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,422
But it works. Then you can
get anywhere, do anything.

125
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,093
Nigel, how long have
we been together?

126
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,512
Ooh. Months, darling.

127
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,682
Then why does
it seem like years?

128
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,604
Because you're so impatient.
You want everything yesterday.

129
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,106
It's a lifetime
to discover the secrets

130
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,109
of black magic from
the ancient grimoires.

131
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,947
Holy cow.

132
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,558
I wonder.

133
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:41,487
Immortality be upon this one.

134
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,738
She is a sharer
of the sun's everlasting life.

135
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,788
There will now
be no danger of death.

136
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:55,584
This world will
keep her forever.

137
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,254
What is it?

138
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,090
What's going on?
Hey, what's going on?

139
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,926
I've just outgrown you, Nigel.

140
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,719
These things happen.

141
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,389
You can't treat me
like this, Selena.

142
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,891
Without me you'd
still be reading tea leaves

143
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,727
at Lake Tahoe.

144
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,981
<i>Amsterdam and more. That's
TVVA. Never has flying been easier.</i>

145
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,490
You can't run out on me, Selena.

146
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,992
I've got the keys, sweetheart.

147
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,787
<i>The president confirmed
reports that Superman has embarked</i>

148
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,331
<i>on a special peace-seeking
mission to a galaxy</i>

149
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,916
<i>scientists estimate may be</i>

150
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,252
<i>several hundred trillion
light-years from our own...</i>

151
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,527
Whoo-whoo!

152
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,741
Now, here's the weather
from the general Chicago area

153
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,284
<i>increasing cloudiness with
the possibility of showers.</i>

154
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,787
<i>Breezy but warm
with a high of 62.</i>

155
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,341
Bianca!

156
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,259
I'm home.

157
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,474
Bianca!

158
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,184
<i>Wha-at?</i>

159
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,103
Show your face.

160
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,358
I have a surprise for you.

161
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,117
<i>They've turned
off the hot water again.</i>

162
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:06,163
I'm really gonna have to kill
somebody down at the DWP.

163
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,833
The only way we're gonna
pay our bills next month

164
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,586
in this dump, is to just go
ahead and start our own coven.

165
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,588
No longer necessary.

166
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,757
I was reading in this book

167
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,550
"The Witches Guide
to Heaven and Hell"

168
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,303
if you start your
own coven all you've to do

169
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,889
is charge five bucks a head,
minimal admission. That's great.

170
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,266
- Chicken feed.
- That's better than goose egg.

171
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,144
What's in the Coffer of Shadow
there? Where's little Nigel?

172
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,563
Nigel, my dear Bianca,
is history.

173
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,023
Oh, yeah? How so?

174
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,735
The water department is history.
The car payments are history.

175
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,528
The mortgage
payments are history.

176
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,865
- How are the property taxes?
- History.

177
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,576
The world is at last my oyster.

178
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,162
Now, this I like.

179
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,832
- Hello.
- "Hello," she says.

180
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,585
- Well, hello to you, honeybun.
- Hello.

181
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,338
I was wondering if you could
tell me where I am?

182
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,716
What do they call this place,
Eddie? Lovers' Lane, isn't it?

183
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,178
You got it in one,
Billy boy. Lovers' Lane.

184
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,140
Oh, no, you see,
what I meant was is

185
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,516
well, those lights over there.
What are they called?

186
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,520
Check out the view
from back here, Eduardo.

187
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,687
Ah!

188
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,272
Stop that.

189
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,652
You're, uh, Superman's
best friend, huh?

190
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,653
No. His cousin. I've come here
to search for the omegahedron.

191
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,535
It's a power source vital to
Argo City. That's where I live.

192
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,121
No kidding.

193
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,874
Eddie and me here

194
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,417
we're on a secret mission also.

195
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,087
We're out looking
for a good time.

196
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,924
And you just won
the brass ring, baby.

197
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,985
Oh, she works out, huh?

198
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,528
Why are you doing this?

199
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,531
It's just the way we are.

200
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,374
You shouldn't have
done that, baby.

201
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,211
Come on.

202
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,845
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

203
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,057
You really wanna play games,
eh, sweetheart?

204
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,685
Come on. Come...

205
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,853
Cw!

206
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,776
Huh?

207
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:52,028
Eddie, I think
maybe we should

208
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:56,244
kinda keep this to ourselves.
What do you think?

209
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,544
Freddie, you little
devil. How are you?

210
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,423
Fresh ammunition, everybody.

211
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,184
Try telling your wife.
I need another.

212
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,603
Where is it? Where's
the little mystery ball?

213
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,397
Let me have a peek.
Maybe I can shed some light.

214
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,398
I hate light.

215
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,900
Is it electrical?
ls it hot to the touch?

216
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,195
- Where is it?
- Safe and sound.

217
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,156
Go mix.
Leave me to my thoughts.

218
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,617
Go mix? With these people?
You must be mad.

219
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,869
Who are they?
Wrinkly little wretches.

220
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,789
These are my
foot soldiers, Nigel.

221
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,416
My army of the night.

222
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:48,046
I'm considering nothing
less than world...domination.

223
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,839
After you left me in the lurch

224
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,051
I saw something that should
worry you greatly

225
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,719
<i>if you're serious about
taking over this planet.</i>

226
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,558
My secret was blue and red
and it knew how to fly.

227
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,352
I've a secret too, Nigel.

228
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,230
I have the power.

229
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,315
Get that through your head.

230
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,486
Oh, I bet they're
in for it now, eh?

231
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,487
Count on it.

232
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,537
I have in my time seen
a great number of things

233
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,038
even more impressive

234
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,041
than a human cigarette
lighter, dear lady.

235
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,418
To wit.

236
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,217
What is that?

237
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,887
Overreaching ambition.

238
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,056
Take heed.

239
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,976
Touched a little
nerve, didn't I?

240
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,312
Hello.

241
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,023
Hello.

242
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,234
The red toad
that lurks in the briars

243
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,485
and brambles
is full of sorceries.

244
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,487
There's a little bone
on the left side.

245
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,321
A little bone?

246
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,283
A little bone, which
if bound to a man stirs up

247
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,076
the greatest lust.

248
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,497
- I wanna be rich and famous.
- Then stick with me.

249
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,584
I was put on this earth
to thrill millions.

250
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,962
Mmm, this is scrumptious.

251
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,591
<i>Why don't we go somewhere
else and dance cheek to cheek?</i>

252
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,353
Stop it, Selena!
That's not fair.

253
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,063
<i>Pick on me.</i>

254
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,281
- Thanks.
- Hey, no sweat.

255
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,950
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing much.

256
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,870
Get out of my house, Nigel

257
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,457
and don't come slithering back.

258
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,918
I'm warning you, Selena

259
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,087
don't be so shortsighted.

260
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,022
Good morning.

261
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,740
Have you got it, Lucy?
<i>Must</i> be near that oak tree.

262
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,076
- <i>Hurry</i> up.
- Found it, guys.

263
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,955
<i>What are you doing?
You're supposed to find the ball.</i>

264
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,378
<i>Come on, don't take all day.
You're holding up the game.</i>

265
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,881
- Hey, it's your turn to bat.
- Let's go. Let's go.

266
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,967
<i>Okay. Okay.
Let's play ball.</i>

267
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,886
Alright, batter.

268
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,773
I couldn't make it.
I have to finish my...

269
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,587
<i>Hey, toss the
ball back, will you?</i>

270
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,018
Come on,
make <i>it</i> two in a <i>row.</i>

271
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,312
Play ball.

272
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,584
- <i>Where have you been?
- With the principal.</i>

273
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,336
Danvers is doing
his usual number.

274
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,338
Jeez, another
barfy new student.

275
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,258
They're really scraping the
bottom of the barrel these days.

276
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,344
Hang in there, Danvers.

277
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,970
Don't let them get to you.

278
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,684
Thirty days. Semester
just started. You'll be...

279
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,853
- Hello, I--
- Didn't knock.

280
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,356
Don't we teach you
manners around here?

281
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,233
Don't we try to impress
on our young ladies

282
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,152
that animals
in the jungle never knock

283
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,488
but Midvale girls always do.
Where you going? Come back here.

284
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,323
Come in.

285
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,785
I forgot, I'm just not used to--

286
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,453
Wait a minute.

287
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,373
Wait just one second.

288
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,460
I have never before
in my life laid eyes on you

289
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,628
have I, young lady?

290
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,505
- No, sir, I'm new here.
- New here?

291
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,299
Obviously you're new if I've
never laid eyes on you before.

292
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,052
The question remains,
just who on earth are you?

293
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,555
Umm...

294
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,851
On Earth, I'm Lee.

295
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,352
Linda Lee.

296
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,272
Where's your letter
of recommendation?

297
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,315
Letter?

298
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,399
I must talk to you, principal.

299
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,570
- I am busy now.
- So are they, them.

300
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,947
All the little monsters
you admit to the place.

301
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,075
<i>They have nailed
my desk drawers shut.</i>

302
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,078
Never in all my years
as a school teacher...

303
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,246
Come, Danvers.

304
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,706
I will not be provoked.

305
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,292
I will not let him
get to me this semester.

306
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,919
I'll be strong.
Be strong.

307
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,545
Be like a rock.

308
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,518
What did you say
your name was?

309
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,688
Oh, yes.
Linda Lee, huh?

310
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,606
Yes, my cousin
probably wrote you.

311
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,527
Umm, maybe you got
his letter under K for Kent?

312
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,986
In your files.

313
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,196
Kent?

314
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,489
Kent?

315
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,992
It doesn't ring any bells.

316
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,828
Doesn't even ring a...

317
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,082
Oh, here it is.
Big as life.

318
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,084
<i>"My dear Mr. Danvers,
I'm writing on behalf</i>

319
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,003
<i>of a very
special young lady."</i>

320
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,588
An orphan?

321
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,757
Don't expect to be treated
any differently

322
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,050
on that account, Miss Lee.

323
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,635
Oh, no, sir, I won't.

324
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,428
One way or another,
we're all alone

325
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,681
on this...miserable
little planet.

326
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,725
Yes, sir, I know.

327
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,561
<i>Since your school records
were obviously lost in the mail</i>

328
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,605
you'll have to start
at the bottom.

329
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,398
It's only fair
to the other girls.

330
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,277
You'll have English, Latin,
math, biology, computing...

331
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,653
All at once?

332
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:28,989
...and chemistry.

333
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,366
Idle hands are the
devil's playground. This way.

334
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,918
- Man on the floor!
- Man on the floor!

335
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,519
Open up, Lane, I know
you're in there.

336
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,855
I'm not decent,
Mr. Danvers sir.

337
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,608
And you never will be either.
You little liar.

338
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,822
Come on in. Come on in.
I haven't got all year.

339
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,281
No.

340
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,367
I'm supposed to have
a single this term.

341
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,619
We don't always get
what we want, Miss Lane.

342
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,871
Disappointments
thicken our skins.

343
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,998
Who wants thick skin?

344
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,460
I'm Linda Lee.

345
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,090
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

346
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,717
I'm Lucy Lane.

347
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,637
Lucy Lee, this is Linda Lane.

348
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,471
- No, it isn't.
- What?

349
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,848
- She's Linda Lee and I'm--
- Lucy Lane.

350
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,809
You two know each other.

351
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,685
Oh, no. We just met.

352
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,022
- When?
- Just now.

353
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,650
But we've known each other
for years, haven't we, Linda?

354
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,943
- Oh, gee, I don't think I--
- Oh, of course.

355
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,320
The Daily Planet, of course.

356
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,075
Linda's cousin works there. And
your sister, what's her name?

357
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,493
The one that's always
calling me and bothering me?

358
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,204
- Lois.
- Ah, yes, that's the one.

359
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:04,083
Anyway, show our new
Miss Lee around, Miss Lane.

360
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,711
Oh, by the way,
she's an orphan

361
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,298
but don't let her play
on your sympathies, hmm?

362
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,357
So, who's your cousin?

363
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,526
Clark Kent.

364
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,820
You're kidding me.

365
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,740
Clark Kent's your cousin?
You're putting me on.

366
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,117
- You know him?
- Do I know him?

367
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,785
Does my sister know him?

368
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:43,581
- Now, that's the big question.
- Oh, I see.

369
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,333
I guess, if they worked
at the same newspaper

370
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,709
they must know each other.

371
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,545
- Well...
- ls this where I'll sleep?

372
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,256
Well, this is your bed,
but we don't sleep around here.

373
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,051
Nonstop excitement
in this dorm.

374
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,221
All the real dementals
are sent here.

375
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,850
So, when's the rest
of your stuff arriving?

376
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,687
I don't have any other stuff.

377
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,563
What? It's all
in that little bag?

378
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:13,736
Oh, well, you see, I have the
means to buy more, it's just...

379
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,072
Well, I just haven't
had the chance since...

380
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,675
- Do you know him?
- Superman? Sure.

381
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,053
<i>My sister's got something
goin' with the big guy.</i>

382
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,721
Listen, you can borrow
any of my clothes

383
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,099
any time you want.
Just dig in and help yourself.

384
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,602
Thank you.
You're very kind.

385
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,066
He's a real character.
A real hunk.

386
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,527
<i>I'll introduce you
to him someday</i>

387
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,112
<i>if we wind up getting along.</i>

388
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,370
Now, then, focus
your tiny minds

389
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,706
on the kind of problem
that it used to take

390
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,626
weeks of thought
before the computer.

391
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,752
Even now it can take
a long time

392
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,088
without certain algorithms

393
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,717
which...if you behave
for two seconds

394
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,219
I might reveal to you.

395
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,688
Love, hate, love, hate.

396
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,648
Love.

397
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,859
<i>The cards have decided</i>

398
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,029
<i>people will do
anything for love.</i>

399
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,990
They'll jump off
cliffs for love.

400
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,701
<i>They'll drown themselves
like lemmings.</i>

401
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,410
So...l'll make
everybody love me.

402
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,292
Oh, no chance.

403
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,794
You're an awful person,
honey, remember? Forget it.

404
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,423
Use your imagination, pinhead.
That's what magic is all about.

405
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,219
Why are we not moving?

406
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,640
Because I'm in love.

407
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,727
<i>Come here,
you beautiful thing.</i>

408
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,564
He's cute.

409
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,361
Hey, What's going on?

410
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,657
<i>Here's an exercise in big
numbers I want you to try.-.</i>

411
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,369
<i>It's trying
to tell me something.</i>

412
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,788
Well, what?
That we're near danger?

413
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,623
I don't know.
How do I know?

414
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,757
- I know.
- Well, tell me.

415
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,176
My prince has come.

416
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,637
Oh, no.

417
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,138
I saw him first, Selena.

418
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,474
That's not fair.
I copied his number first.

419
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,018
Well done.
Now, let's get out of here.

420
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,190
..-average size
<i>of</i> a Chinese family

421
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,985
<i>average age of death
and marriage and pregnancy.</i>

422
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,572
<i>Use this equation to
compute the population of China</i>

423
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,491
<i>in the year 2040.</i>

424
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,535
Linda...are you with us?

425
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,164
Umm...

426
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,626
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Oh, are you?

427
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,044
Where, might I ask?

428
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,838
W-well, here, sir.
On Earth...sir.

429
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,801
How fortunate
for the rest of us.

430
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,762
May I presume that whilst
you were staring at the wall

431
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,557
and not at your terminal like
your other little friends here

432
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,894
you were in fact,
hard at work

433
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,146
solving this little equation?

434
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,357
Oh, yes, sir, I was.

435
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,234
- I mean, I was--
- Excellent.

436
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,652
The answer, please.

437
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,489
Pay attention, class, Miss Lee
is about to enlighten us.

438
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,534
Five billion, two hundred
and seventy one million

439
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,785
nine thousand and ten.

440
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,877
Come on, let's get outta here
before he makes you stay.

441
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,921
<i>Come on, hurry.</i>

442
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,095
<i>Miss Lee.</i>

443
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,346
- Oh, shit.
- Yes, sir?

444
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,641
Have you been going
through my papers?

445
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,726
Of course not, sir.

446
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,978
Then how do you know
the correct answer?

447
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,189
- How?
- I guess, I just--

448
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,525
It's all this crazy weather
we've been having, sir.

449
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,653
<i>All the storms, shock
waves, electromagnetism.</i>

450
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,905
It makes people smarter
than they are for a second.

451
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,365
We gotta go, sir.

452
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,202
Oh, boy, thanks.
You know I gotta learn--

453
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,955
How did you know the answer?

454
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,125
I don't know.
Six-dimensional geometry.

455
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,251
- I never could do it before.
- Yeah.

456
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,378
Well, you want some
friendly advice?

457
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,424
Don't go showing it off
'cause nobody's gonna like you.

458
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,050
I'll see you later.

459
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,267
Ah!

460
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,479
Nice going.

461
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,357
You know she tripped
you on purpose?

462
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,986
Absolutely.
She's retarded.

463
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,615
<i>There's not much time left.
Come on, let's go.</i>

464
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,619
You take it, Myra.

465
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,749
Hey, Myra, see if you can
put Lane out for good.

466
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,837
<i>Come on, team. Come on.</i>

467
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,681
He)!' YOU guys alright?

468
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,517
- Oh, God. What happened?
- Yes. You alright?

469
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,269
Myra, how'd she do that?

470
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,188
- It hit her shoulder.
- I don't know.

471
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,357
Hey, you guys, did you see that
cute guy in the softball field?

472
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,650
Oh, yes.

473
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,445
With the black
hair and the big muscles?

474
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,571
He was something else.

475
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,365
<i>- Did you talk to him?
- No, but I'm gonna.</i>

476
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,908
<i>Talk? Who'd
waste time talking?</i>

477
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,036
<i>He's working on the trees,
could be around for a while.</i>

478
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,541
- Are they in?
- Yes.

479
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,005
<i>Myra, you sure you
wanna go through with this?</i>

480
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,342
<i>Hey, what's with you?
Chicken?</i>

481
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,469
<i>Oh, boy, I'm really
gonna enjoy this.</i>

482
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,972
<i>I can't wait to hear
them scream.</i>

483
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,350
Why don't you shut off the hot
and give them an ice bath?

484
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,686
<i>Are you kidding me?
That's nowheresville.</i>

485
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,022
If you shut off the cold
you'll scald them.

486
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,608
So they lose a little skin.
Serves them right.

487
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,152
<i>I want to see them suffer.</i>

488
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,322
A-ah!

489
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,037
I am wet!

490
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,289
Cw!

491
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,918
Don't leave me. Don't leave me!

492
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,047
I hate you!

493
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,715
You never looked better!

494
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,675
We'll get you all!

495
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,850
What do you think?

496
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,686
It looks the same to me.
It's kinda dull.

497
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,483
All you need is a couple of
streaks and your ears pierced.

498
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,276
I can do it
free of charge.

499
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,986
My ears what?

500
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,071
Pierced. Like in you know,
I take a needle

501
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,659
I heat it up and then I dab it
with some alcohol and zap.

502
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,286
All the guys go crazy.

503
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,955
Because I've holes in my ears?

504
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,748
What are you, putting me on?

505
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,334
Sometimes I can't
figure you out, Linda.

506
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,255
So, where are you
going this weekend?

507
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,466
<i>Nowhere.</i>

508
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,384
Nowhere? Well, you can't
stay around here.

509
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,052
This place is depressing.

510
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,012
<i>I mean, like the tombs.</i>

511
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,764
<i>- Why'?
- Why?</i>

512
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,849
<i>What, were you born
yesterday?</i>

513
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,102
This is a three-day weekend.

514
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,146
A three-day weekend.

515
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,649
So, listen. Why don't
you come home with me?

516
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,569
<i>I only live about five miles
from here and I got this guy</i>

517
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,154
<i>coming up from Metropolis.</i>

518
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,489
I think he knows
your cousin Clark.

519
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,616
<i>His name's Jimmy Olsen.</i>

520
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,244
<i>I think he's real stuck on me.</i>

521
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,081
Anyways, I could ask him
to bring a friend along.

522
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,960
<i>- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.</i>

523
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,086
<i>Nothing.</i>

524
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,673
No, I think I'm gonna
stay here and study

525
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,633
get things organized.

526
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,054
Don't forget to
call me Saturday.

527
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,888
Just a sec.

528
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:22,767
- Hey, Linda.
- Hi.

529
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,768
I'll see you later
at Popeye's then, okay?

530
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,021
- Alright, I'll try. I promise.
- You better. It's gonna be fun.

531
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,106
<i>'</i> Bye-bye.
- Bye.

532
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,232
Have a good time.

533
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,693
Come along now, Lucy.

534
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,072
- <i>Oh, mom, how are you doing?</i>
- <i>I've had</i> a <i>terrible week.</i>

535
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:48,477
"Take a spider off his web...

536
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,607
"...and shut him up inside...

537
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,778
"...two shells of a nut.

538
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,116
"Now, boil the nut in oil

539
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,411
"into which has been added

540
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,454
"some of the web.

541
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:12,334
"With a silver spoon,
put two drops...

542
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:14,920
"...of the oil

543
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,008
"into some water.

544
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,550
Right.

545
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,720
"He who drinks the water

546
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:28,017
"shall be in love
with the first person he sees.

547
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:32,021
"Uh, so long as the spider
is shut up in the nutshell.

548
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,066
"Or one day goes by...

549
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,734
...whichever comes first."

550
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,779
Big deal, one day.

551
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,863
Why don't you just use,
you know.

552
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,949
I'm saving it
for bigger things.

553
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,786
<i>Hi, folks,
you're missing the big</i> sale.

554
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,788
<i>Country and western boys
from the Chicago area.</i>

555
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,249
<i>Now to start off the hour.</i>

556
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,310
Bianca, get the door.

557
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,938
Bianca!

558
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,779
You rang?

559
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:22,738
Hey, you!

560
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,701
I said...

561
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,869
...you rang?

562
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:29,995
Oh, yeah.

563
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,496
How you doing?

564
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,002
Uh, I'm looking for some person
called Mrs. Selena?

565
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,755
- Madame Selena.
- Oh.

566
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,593
And you found her,
lucky boy.

567
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,053
<i>Entrer.</i>

568
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,851
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

569
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,978
I always see your truck
parked around.

570
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,479
Oh, yeah.

571
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,983
Yeah, I get a lot of repeat
business. People like my work.

572
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,404
Yes, I'm sure they do.

573
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,951
- Wet your whistle?
- Huh?

574
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,663
Oh, yeah, yeah, as a matter
of fact, I don't mind if I do.

575
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,819
So, uh, where's
the one...ha-ha at?

576
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:45,946
It dropped dead.

577
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,573
Where at exactly?
Uh, out back?

578
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,201
We might get to know each other
a little more

579
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:54,909
before we dig in
and talk real turkey.

580
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,877
Well, uh, see, I'm kind of
a private person, you know.

581
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,588
I mean, I do my work,
I go home.

582
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,590
- To your wife?
- No.

583
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,926
At the present moment in time
I'm currently enjoying

584
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,969
a single status in
my personal life.

585
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,220
Cheers.

586
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,389
Bottoms up, huh?

587
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,557
Bottoms up.

588
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,190
I, I noticed you got a pretty
alkaline-looking soil out there.

589
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,109
What I want...

590
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:27,821
...are some houseplants
inside here.

591
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,117
Something that goes well
with the house.

592
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,328
This is a house?

593
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,579
Of course, it's a house.

594
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,750
There's the bedroom
over there.

595
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,089
I think it's getting
dark in here.

596
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:51,053
You know, what kind of plant
is gonna wanna...

597
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,389
...grow in this dump?

598
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,058
I don't know.

599
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,477
Shade plants.

600
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,396
- To us.
- Hm?

601
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,441
And to the seeds
we'll plant together.

602
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,319
Yeah, I'll-I'll drink...

603
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,820
...to that.

604
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,327
Hm, you probably killed him,
you know.

605
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,792
Sleep well.

606
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,585
And when you wake...

607
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,923
...drown in my eyes
and be all mine.

608
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,846
If that's the goddamn
Jehovah's witnesses again.

609
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,597
I'll get it.

610
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,689
Oh, hello, Nigel.
It's you.

611
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,650
<i>Nice suit.</i>

612
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,527
Subtle.

613
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,653
I want to see Selena.

614
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,073
She's indisposed
at the moment.

615
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:56,451
<i>Whoever it is,
we don't want any.</i>

616
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,996
It's Nigel and
he's not going away

617
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,040
until he talks to you.

618
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,793
What the devil do you want?

619
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,129
I want to make
a very serious proposal.

620
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,339
In that outfit?

621
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,092
This is a leisure suit.
I've got three days off

622
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,719
from those little beasts
at Midvale

623
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,930
and I intend to let
my hair down.

624
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,104
Uh-oh.

625
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,066
That ball will not operate
at it's fullest

626
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,487
until you internalize
your power, Selena.

627
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,532
Some mosaic invocations.

628
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,199
- Some what?
- Come again?

629
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,327
<i>Exactly, that's my point.</i>

630
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,581
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

631
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,583
Because we own the matches.

632
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,587
I, of all people,
know a hustle when I hear one.

633
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,838
Now, goodbye, Nigel.

634
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,257
- It was nice talking to you.
- No, it wasn't.

635
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:38,011
I <i>hate to seem pushy,
my fairest of the fair but--</i>

636
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,638
A word of advice, Nigel.

637
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,807
If I had your skin problems,

638
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,518
I'd stop bothering people,
put a bag over my head,

639
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,228
and go live under a bridge!

640
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:47,187
<i>Ouch!</i>

641
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,316
There's nothing wrong
with my skin.

642
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,320
That bitch.

643
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,075
You know, some people.

644
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,078
Where is he?

645
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,747
Where is he?

646
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,633
Where is he?

647
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,761
Whoever he sees first,
he'll love with all his heart.

648
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,554
What?
For a day tops, right?

649
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,640
He was too young
for you anyway, you know.

650
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,893
No, I do not know.
Where is he?

651
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,819
<i>Hey, I know that guy.</i>

652
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,287
- Oh, the cable's out.
- Oh, what cable?

653
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,455
This is a mirror.

654
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,001
So, how come we could...

655
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,669
...ever see him in it?

656
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,171
That was magic, dammit.

657
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,091
The power.

658
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,843
Oh, so make it happen again,
you know?

659
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:03,930
L...can't make it happen again.
I don't know how I did it.

660
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,181
Oh.

661
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,143
Maybe, you should let
that thing out of it's box.

662
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,063
Maybe, it's more powerful
if you let it out of it's box.

663
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,230
- The box.
- The box.

664
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,107
- Where is it?
- The box?

665
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,151
It's underneath the rug,
where you left it.

666
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,778
Go ahead.

667
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,285
It's stuck.

668
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,666
This is not my day.

669
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,751
It's stuck?

670
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,170
How could it be stuck?

671
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,006
It's growing.

672
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,301
<i>How could it be growing?
It's made out of lead.</i>

673
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,522
Oh.

674
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,108
Too bad, there's no sound.

675
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,278
How come there's no sound?

676
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,155
Get off the road, turkey!

677
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,241
Hey, dummy,
you wanna die?

678
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,286
Smoking, stupid?

679
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,245
You wanna kill yourself?

680
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,424
<i>She saw</i> a <i>lawyer,
and now she's gonna file.</i>

681
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,886
<i>I told her to take him for
every cent, clean him out.</i>

682
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,305
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

683
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,772
Here you go, everybody.
Who wants onion rings?

684
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,023
- Yeah, here.
- Thanks.

685
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,317
<i>- Some French fries?
- French fries are mine.</i>

686
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,694
Chicken for myself.
Thank you.

687
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,488
- Thanks.
- Side order tomatoes?

688
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,031
Thanks for inviting me,
Lucy.

689
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,574
I'm glad you could come,
Jimmy.

690
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,036
- <i>You want</i> a <i>root beer?</i>
- <i>Yeah, thanks.</i>

691
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,080
Oh, there's Linda.

692
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,084
Hey, Linda!

693
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,587
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

694
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,130
That's Clark Kent's cousin?

695
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,631
Who's Clark Kent?

696
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,590
<i>Is</i> that Linda?

697
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,470
- Guess what.
- What?

698
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,430
There's this all-night party
tonight at Eddie's.

699
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,058
He's the guy
with the tattoo.

700
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,642
His folks are out of town.

701
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:15,938
And the guy with the bow tie,
that's Jimmy.

702
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,939
So, you wanna come?

703
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,525
I don't know. I'm not
signed out for an overnight.

704
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,361
So what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

705
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,530
Mrs. Murphy's drunk
as a skunk by now.

706
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,240
Totally on another planet.

707
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,576
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

708
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,578
But that's why
it'll be fun.

709
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,038
' Okay?
<i>'</i> Okay,

710
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,916
Get off the road, buddy.

711
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,209
<i>Hey, stupid.</i>

712
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,545
Look at that dingleberry.

713
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,422
What's a dingleberry?

714
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:46,092
Hey, you, space cadet!
Get out of the street!

715
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,805
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

716
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,432
He's probably on drugs.

717
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,976
And he's gonna get creamed
if he's not too careful.

718
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,812
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- Oh, l-l'm Kara.

719
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,188
- Who?
- Who?

720
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,482
Oh, I'm...

721
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,400
...concerned.

722
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,528
Well, that if
we don't do something.

723
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,321
You go out there, try to help
a guy like that and he's

724
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,449
<i>probably got a gun
or a knife.</i>

725
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:10,784
<i>It's not too safe.</i>

726
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,953
Hey, I'm starving.
Let's eat.

727
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,621
Come on, Linda.

728
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,003
Power of shadow.

729
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:28,214
Bring him to me.

730
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:02,794
Whoa.

731
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:09,092
Look at that.

732
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:16,224
Hey, get out.

733
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,397
Look out. Watch out.

734
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:34,867
MY Car!

735
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,979
You've never seen a tattoo
before, Linda?

736
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,855
- Look!
- What's that?

737
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,648
<i>There's somebody hanging
out of it.</i>

738
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,526
<i>Doesn't look like
there's anybody driving.</i>

739
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,280
Oh, my God.
It's a runaway.

740
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,119
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- Hey, what's she doing?

741
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,288
Lucy, be careful.
Lucy!

742
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,375
- Come on.
- Lucy!

743
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,952
God, there's the pump?

744
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,652
She's <i>still in</i> there.

745
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,785
- Oh, excuse me. I'm in a rush.
- I know the feeling.

746
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,834
Are you okay?

747
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,628
It's gasoline!
It's gasoline!

748
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,130
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

749
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,039
A storm dragon?

750
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,085
A Supergirl.

751
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,637
Oh, my God!

752
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,852
Don't. Don't look at her.

753
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,027
You're gonna be alright.

754
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,321
There's no broken bones.

755
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,037
I love you.

756
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,415
What did he say?

757
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,250
What did he say?

758
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,544
Looked like
"I love you", to me.

759
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,589
No! No!

760
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,883
You love me?

761
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,512
With all my heart,
forever.

762
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,889
A bird of free
and careless wing

763
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,058
was I through many
a smiling spring.

764
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:33,810
The cold repulse,
the look askance.

765
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:36,771
The lightning of
love's angry glance, stay.

766
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,857
Let me behold you.

767
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:56,791
L-I have to go.

768
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:02,130
Oh, I-l have to go.

769
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,342
<i>Everything's under control.</i>

770
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,718
Lucy!

771
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,054
<i>Just go on,
back to your homes.</i>

772
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,055
Lucy.

773
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,349
- Oh.
- Thank God.

774
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,145
- You alright?
- I think so.

775
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,605
I hit my head.

776
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,691
Nigel must know her.

777
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:25,153
She must be one of his students.
He must have put her up to it.

778
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,614
No. I don't think that at all.

779
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,990
Oh, she just happened
to be in the wrong place

780
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,951
at the wrong time, right?

781
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,538
Materializing
in a bulldozer, huh?

782
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:36,914
She's a wimpy little thing.

783
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,000
I don't know why you care
what she does, anyway.

784
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,670
Because nobody
gets in my way.

785
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,171
Why don't you just leave
this poor kid alone

786
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,299
and worry about the
other one that flies?

787
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:50,261
I worry about everything.
It's my job. Stand back.

788
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:54,056
Oh, come on now.
She's just a teenager.

789
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:58,765
What good is a sword
if it's not unleashed?

790
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,522
But she's a total zero.
You don't even know her name.

791
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,234
The naming of names
is not necessary.

792
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,529
Let us concentrate
on her face.

793
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,033
And my Shadow
will do the rest.

794
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,617
Your what?

795
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:15,953
Power of Shadow...

796
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,706
...take shape.

797
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,253
Look like a
vicious dark star.

798
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:27,674
Seek out, that
wretched young creature.

799
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,218
And destroy her
wherever she...

800
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:34,931
...are.

801
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,683
Oh, God.
That's awful.

802
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,350
That's never
gonna work.

803
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:59,163
Oh, my God!

804
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:01,999
I'm scared.

805
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,068
Next time...

806
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,613
...remind me to
do this outside.

807
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,363
Leave this place
and do no harm.

808
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,158
There she is again.

809
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,079
What did she say?

810
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,331
No, this is not possible.

811
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,916
This is not right.

812
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,501
Where's the wimp?

813
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,086
Ah!

814
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:36,464
Argh!

815
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,016
Argh!

816
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,603
I think he can
take care of her.

817
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:51,687
Ah!

818
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,398
Argh!

819
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,086
See?
What did I tell you?

820
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,547
She quit, right?

821
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:19,590
Wrong.

822
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,408
Every time!

823
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,493
Every time!

824
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,663
Send a man to do a woman's job
and that's what you get.

825
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:37,084
Damn her eyes.
Who is she?

826
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:40,337
- Are you asking me?
- I'm telling you.

827
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,256
Find out!

828
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:46,302
Well, sure. But, you know,
I think I recognize the costume.

829
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,350
Leave him alone. Let him.

830
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,310
Where have you been?

831
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,188
- Outside--
- Look at you.

832
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,398
Look at those clothes.

833
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:00,941
Oh, I'll go change.
l-l'm sorry.

834
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,444
And you'll put on
your proper school uniform.

835
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:07,156
And get out of that
ridiculous costume.

836
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,324
Yes, ma'am.

837
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,618
- And cover your legs.
- Yes, ma'am.

838
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,662
Don't you
"yes, ma'am" me.

839
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,122
No, ma'am.

840
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,668
I think you're blowing
this thing out of proportion

841
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:20,878
if you want my opinion.

842
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:24,464
Oh, no. This box is
definitely getting bigger...

843
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,884
...and uglier.

844
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,011
All I'm saying is
you can't go nuts

845
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,889
over a landscape guy and a
teenager in a blue suit.

846
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:33,516
She flies.

847
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,268
Can you get that through
your thick skull

848
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,979
and into your
tiny brain, Bianca?

849
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,607
The girl can fly.

850
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,083
Okay-

851
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:01,543
Now.

852
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,505
Let's get serious.

853
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,300
Come to mama.

854
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,720
<i>- Oh.
- Oh.</i>

855
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,016
Oh.

856
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,142
Whoa.

857
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:37,579
- Selena, cut it out.
- I'm not doing it.

858
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,944
I think we're venturing where

859
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,114
you know, fools rush in
and angels fear to tread.

860
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,451
I'm no angel.

861
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,210
It's the wimp again.

862
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,213
And she's trespassing.

863
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,108
Hello.

864
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,651
Oh, no. Not now.

865
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,029
'Tis only but me,
my love.

866
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,989
Please, you'll let
everyone know.

867
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,532
What?
That I love you?

868
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:39,285
I'd shout it from
the highest hill.

869
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,119
Please don't.

870
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:44,080
I know you think me the fool,
at least tell me your name.

871
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:45,665
Linda. Linda Lee.

872
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,084
Linda.

873
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,336
Lovely Linda Lee.

874
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,464
These roses pale
beside thee.

875
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:55,342
Oh.

876
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:57,761
Well, thank you,
but I'm--

877
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,305
And sweet chocolates
for my sweet Linda.

878
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,016
Hm.

879
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:13,485
What are you doing?

880
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,156
Please?

881
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,367
Oh, no, I...

882
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,410
Please.

883
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:23,537
Well, alright.
But just for a minute.

884
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,219
You hate me,
don't you?

885
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,764
Hate you?
I don't even know you.

886
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,265
I don't even know
your name.

887
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,143
Ethan.

888
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:50,606
Say my name aloud but once
and I shall die the happy fool.

889
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,066
- Look, Ethan--
- Huh!

890
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:56,611
Ethan.

891
01:16:58,489 --> 01:16:59,406
Ethan.

892
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,618
Your soft caress
did at once renew

893
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,454
the beating of
this broken heart.

894
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:07,914
Are you crazy?

895
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,378
Marry me?

896
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:24,723
Marry you?

897
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:27,851
- I don't--
- Don't say it. Don't, please.

898
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:28,852
I know.

899
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:30,187
What?

900
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,939
We're from
different worlds.

901
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,443
- You mean, you know where I'm--
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

902
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:39,196
Love makes
everything possible.

903
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:43,450
A poor uneducated gardener can
indeed worship a rich debutante

904
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,452
and make her happy
if she'd just...

905
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,120
Oh, Ethan.

906
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,456
I'm not rich.
I'm just--

907
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,917
Well, then
I'll support us both.

908
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,503
You're nuts,
you know that?

909
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,757
You're so sweet,
but you're out of your mind.

910
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:01,885
Over you.

911
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,896
What a touching scene.

912
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,721
Round and round they go.

913
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,057
Where they stop.

914
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:02,654
Boy, you're really getting
the hang of this.

915
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,616
Oh.

916
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,623
Where is she?

917
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,044
Jesus.

918
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,505
Who are you?

919
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,383
I am Selena.

920
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:26,053
Diadanus of Catania.

921
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:30,182
Priestess of Sechnid.
lam the ultimate Siren of Endor

922
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:34,891
and you, little lady, are
trespassing on private property.

923
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,106
She means him.

924
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,817
I am Kara of Argo City.

925
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,944
Daughter of Alura and Zor-El.

926
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,031
And I don't scare easily.

927
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,199
No?

928
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:48,825
No.

929
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,077
Try. . -

930
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,788
...this.

931
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:14,852
This lady is improving by leaps
and bounds, I gotta tell you.

932
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,519
You Okay?

933
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,396
No.

934
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:46,026
You want a hacksaw
or somethin'?

935
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:02,584
Now I am really upset.

936
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,217
What's going on?

937
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,552
Oh.

938
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,555
Put me down.

939
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:07,440
<i>- Where am I?
- You're safe.</i>

940
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,692
Safe? Where's Linda?

941
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,528
Put me down.

942
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,743
- Where's my Linda?
- Take it easy.

943
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:27,585
Ethan.

944
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:29,754
Ha-ha. Very clever.

945
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,340
That ought to keep her out
of your hair for a few hours.

946
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,301
Clever?
A cheap trick.

947
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,558
Power of Shadow.

948
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:45,353
Bring him to me.

949
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:55,776
Bring him...to me.

950
01:23:58,784 --> 01:23:59,701
Ugh!

951
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:00,952
Didn't work, huh?

952
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,495
Maybe they're too far away.

953
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,540
I can make the sky rain coconuts
with pinpoint accuracy.

954
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:09,544
But I still can't control
men's minds.

955
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,005
Not with her around.

956
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:13,256
So maybe...

957
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,467
Now, don't go
through the roof.

958
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:17,302
But maybe we
ought to back down

959
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:20,305
and give old
you-know-who a call.

960
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:22,307
You-know-who.

961
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,184
- Spit it out.
- Nigel.

962
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:25,977
I shall pretend
you didn't say that.

963
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,353
<i>But I did.</i>

964
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:29,106
All I'm thinking
and forgive me

965
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,274
for thinking
out of turn here...

966
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,693
...is that
he's been around.

967
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,321
He knows things
we don't.

968
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:38,990
<i>Plus, the way you wrap
him around your little finger</i>

969
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,992
<i>I'm always amazed.</i>

970
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,325
What's in it for me?

971
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,452
Me.

972
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:25,912
Ah-ha.

973
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:29,123
My dear Nigel, the way to
a woman's heart is through

974
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,418
the elimination of her rivals.

975
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:33,003
Murder?
Are you proposing that--

976
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:36,464
Oh, certainly not.
Leave that to me.

977
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:39,884
You deliver the goods.
Her.

978
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,636
Her? How?

979
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:43,764
By getting me...

980
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,348
...him.

981
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,184
- She'll follow.
- Well, I don't.

982
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,187
- Follow any of this, I mean--
- Put that down.

983
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,568
Nigel, I want
one thing.

984
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:59,487
Time to master
my new toy.

985
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:02,240
<i>So, we can rule the world?</i>

986
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,576
And you want him here?

987
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,286
Johnny Appleseed
in your living room?

988
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,455
Yes. In the flesh.

989
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:10,040
So, she'll follow?

990
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:13,084
- No other reason?
- None.

991
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,586
You're sure of that?

992
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,842
<i>Whoops, I'm sorry.
The little spider got out.</i>

993
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,719
What?

994
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,222
Where am I?

995
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,685
- Who are you?
- Kara.

996
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,186
Kara?

997
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:35,648
What happened?

998
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,025
You got hit on the head
by a coconut.

999
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,278
- Huh?
- Hm.

1000
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,447
What's with
the Halloween costume?

1001
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,452
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

1002
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:48,745
What do you mean?

1003
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:50,997
Look, I-l have
to go now.

1004
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,458
I'll come back for you later.
I've just gotta get back to

1005
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:54,751
the amusement park.

1006
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,087
Amusement park?
Linda!

1007
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,216
I gotta find Linda,
she was in trouble.

1008
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:05,178
Well, Linda's alright.
She can take care of herself.

1009
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,554
<i>No, no. She can't.
Something's wrong.</i>

1010
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,639
She's in big trouble
and I love her.

1011
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,017
I love her.

1012
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:14,479
Yeah, I do love her.

1013
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,359
I have to go, Ethan.
Goodbye.

1014
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,152
Yes, so do I.

1015
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:23,863
Hey!

1016
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:31,162
I told you Linda can
take care of herself.

1017
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,415
- You just flew over my head.
- I'll take care of everything.

1018
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:37,293
I said you just flew over
my head. True or false?

1019
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:39,421
True.

1020
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:42,257
Like Superman.

1021
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:43,799
He's my cousin.

1022
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,886
- He's your cousin?
- Yes.

1023
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:48,805
I shouldn't be telling you
this though--

1024
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:51,099
Wait one minute. I mean you can
do the whole number, leap tall

1025
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,518
buildings with a single bound?
And look right through things?

1026
01:27:53,727 --> 01:27:56,020
- Yes
- Bend steel bars?

1027
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,690
- Yes.
- Whoa!

1028
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,819
- Oh, Selena. I have to go.
- Wait a minute.

1029
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:04,279
- Selena has the Omegahedron.
- Please take me with you.

1030
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:05,989
I have to find Linda.

1031
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:10,785
What is it?

1032
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,454
The Burundi Wand.

1033
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,790
Pure, unadulterated evil.

1034
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,250
Ready?

1035
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:48,656
But how can you love her?

1036
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:51,158
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

1037
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,452
And she's in trouble,
then I got no business

1038
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,538
standing here,
talking with you.

1039
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:57,790
Even if you are
what you say you are.

1040
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:00,251
Linda is not in trouble.

1041
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:03,546
Look, uh, don't make me
get rough, okay?

1042
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,923
You wouldn't
stand a chance.

1043
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,050
Please trust me.

1044
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,428
Linda is alright.

1045
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,055
How do you know?

1046
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,267
L just...

1047
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:17,810
...know.

1048
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:31,408
Linda.

1049
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,461
Oh, my God.

1050
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:45,421
How did you do that?

1051
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:51,969
Ethan.

1052
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:55,806
Ethan!

1053
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:03,022
Nigel, you are wonderful.

1054
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:06,109
Pure genius.

1055
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:09,111
You deserve...

1056
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:10,989
...me.

1057
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,222
And something else.

1058
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:46,149
Now, let's get out
of this dump.

1059
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,694
<i>Did you see this thing?
Look at this!</i>

1060
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:52,155
Hey, what's the matter?
Catchin' flies?

1061
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:54,074
Lucy, look.

1062
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,536
One minute nothing.
The next minute this.

1063
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,204
<i>What is it?</i>

1064
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:04,209
<i>It's</i> a <i>mountain, Lucy.
Isn't it?</i>

1065
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,043
<i>Tell me
I'm not seeing things.</i>

1066
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:07,336
<i>How did it get there, Jimmy?</i>

1067
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:09,213
<i>I don't know.
It just appeared.</i>

1068
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,382
<i>How can a
mountain just appear?</i>

1069
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:13,927
<i>Hey, there's something
on the top.</i>

1070
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,388
<i>Looks like</i> a <i>castle.</i>

1071
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,264
<i>Looks more like</i> a <i>fortress.</i>

1072
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:08,356
Ethan?

1073
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:16,740
Ethan.

1074
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,189
Ethan!

1075
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:52,150
Ah.

1076
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:20,553
Enjoy your prison,
Supergirl...

1077
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:25,266
...forever and ever.

1078
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,771
No, Ethan!

1079
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,732
Don't do it!

1080
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:34,567
<i>Ethan!</i>

1081
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,993
Where am I?

1082
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:30,034
You can't arrest
me without a <i>warrant.</i>

1083
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,787
I'm calling my lawyer.

1084
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:42,338
Slow down.

1085
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:44,090
We want Selena out.

1086
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,760
Smile, lunkhead.
You're not a gardener anymore.

1087
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,679
You're Prince Ethan, now.

1088
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:51,889
Are we gonna stand up
to her or not?

1089
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:53,015
Yes.

1090
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,350
Selena must go!

1091
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,185
Who's this little twerpette?

1092
01:36:56,394 --> 01:36:58,062
She's someone
who believes in freedom.

1093
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:00,064
Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

1094
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:02,108
<i>I don't know, who you are.</i>

1095
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:03,901
Or what evil force
you represent.

1096
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:07,238
But if you think you can get rid
of anybody who stands up to you.

1097
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:10,283
Just make them disappear.
Like my friend Linda.

1098
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:11,867
Who?

1099
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,118
Linda, my roommate.

1100
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,371
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

1101
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:19,583
The wimp.

1102
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:22,878
Seize them!

1103
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:26,757
Leave her alone!

1104
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:28,133
<i>Drive</i> off.

1105
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:29,885
Leave her alone.

1106
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,054
Nobody messes around
with Jimmy Olsen!

1107
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,890
Now, let go of me.
I'm with the press!

1108
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:51,050
Zaltar.

1109
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:52,260
Squirt.

1110
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:57,890
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

1111
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:02,937
Zaltar, it's me.
It's-it's Kara.

1112
01:39:03,146 --> 01:39:04,355
I know.

1113
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,025
Squirt.

1114
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,740
What is that?

1115
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:17,492
Where are we?

1116
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:19,245
Nowhere.

1117
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:23,666
The Phantom Zone?

1118
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,251
It's lonely here,
my Kara.

1119
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:28,837
So sad.

1120
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:35,261
I've been here forever
and I shall stay here forever.

1121
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:39,807
<i>- Ethan'?
- Yes, my damn'.</i>

1122
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:42,768
Don't call me your "darling."
You despise me.

1123
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:45,187
- Get me the coffer of shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

1124
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:47,064
Now...

1125
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:52,028
...l think we need something.

1126
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:55,448
<i>There.</i>

1127
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:01,537
Oh, Jimmy.

1128
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:04,498
Oh, terrific.

1129
01:40:04,707 --> 01:40:08,043
The old dangling-in-a-cage
routine.

1130
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:10,337
Pathetic, Selena.

1131
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:14,842
- Who's that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

1132
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,343
What are they for?

1133
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,804
Insurance.

1134
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,020
But you can't just give up.

1135
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,272
You founded a whole city.

1136
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:31,192
I did, and then
I doomed it to destruction.

1137
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,652
That was an error.
A tragic one.

1138
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:35,988
When you're my age
and you make as many

1139
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:38,991
tragic errors as I do,
it is a different tune

1140
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,159
that you will sing.

1141
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:42,244
I will not.
I'll never give up.

1142
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,997
I will never spend my entire
life in a place like this.

1143
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:47,625
- I would die first!
- Strong words.

1144
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:51,545
There are worse things than
dying and I deserve every one.

1145
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:12,191
- What is this?
- A horse...l think.

1146
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:17,279
On earth I think
it's called a horse.

1147
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:20,157
- And you made this here?
- Mm.

1148
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:25,537
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1149
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:28,040
Earth, Zaltar.
Earth, a tree, a horse.

1150
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:29,667
You keep making things
from earth.

1151
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:32,085
- The place intrigues me.
- Well, then, let's go there.

1152
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:34,630
Certainly.
When is the next train?

1153
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,466
What is a train?

1154
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:43,930
What's so funny?
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

1155
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:46,934
I'm only laughing
at myself.

1156
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:49,812
For you, I weep.

1157
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:52,856
Is this train
a way out of here?

1158
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:55,484
There is no way
out of here.

1159
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:58,654
That is the point
of the Phantom Zone.

1160
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:02,032
My neighbors now: the criminals,
the corrupt, the evil...

1161
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:03,283
...they're here.

1162
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,076
Over the hill there.

1163
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:06,954
With no way out.

1164
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:11,333
But, there's always a way out.

1165
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:14,211
<i>If there's a way in,
there's a way out.</i>

1166
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:18,966
There is a way.

1167
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:22,720
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

1168
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:24,930
No, it wouldn't work.

1169
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:26,515
<i>You'd be swept into
a singularity</i>

1170
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:28,016
if it didn't work. No.

1171
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:31,395
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

1172
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:38,319
I could do it.

1173
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:44,158
Then, please.
At least teach me how.

1174
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:46,285
There's nothing to teach.
You can't, as they say

1175
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:51,035
practice at the rift.
You get one chance only.

1176
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:54,460
- The rift?
- Sure? You won't have a squirt?

1177
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,838
Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.

1178
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:05,554
You're right.

1179
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,224
You are absolutely right.

1180
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:15,272
There is enough doom
and gloom in the air already.

1181
01:43:15,481 --> 01:43:17,691
And it is better
to accept defeat

1182
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:20,402
than to take a chance and try
like fools to redeem ourselves

1183
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:23,155
<i>and save our city and all those
who we love there.</i>

1184
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:25,574
Plus all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress

1185
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:28,619
is going to make suffer
just because of us. Cheers!

1186
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:34,875
We could die trying.

1187
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:37,877
But we won't.

1188
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,547
We won't. Come on.

1189
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:10,160
Tomorrow.

1190
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:13,455
Thursday. Friday.

1191
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:16,041
Just like here, we go
for the cops first, right?

1192
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,918
And the army.

1193
01:44:18,127 --> 01:44:21,088
By Saturday, we have
the continental United States,

1194
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:23,257
Mexico, Canada.

1195
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:29,555
<i>Oh, my God, Selena.
It's the box.</i>

1196
01:44:29,764 --> 01:44:32,016
- Hush it up.
- No.

1197
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:36,353
What the box wants,
the box gets.

1198
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:53,954
What is it?

1199
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:55,831
Fascinating.

1200
01:44:58,667 --> 01:45:00,251
I don't know.

1201
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:03,380
ls this it?

1202
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:04,756
Is this the way out?

1203
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:08,718
Not yet! This
is the Quantum Vortex!

1204
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:12,347
We must risk
our destruction in it.

1205
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:17,227
To move mountains,
you must make sacrifices.

1206
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:19,354
Zaltar, I'm scared!

1207
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:22,232
Accept your fears.

1208
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:24,652
Confront your demons.

1209
01:45:24,944 --> 01:45:28,489
Find your destiny
in the maelstrom!

1210
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:21,124
Zaltar, I can't.
I can't.

1211
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:24,377
You...can!

1212
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:51,446
Two specks.
Look!

1213
01:46:57,745 --> 01:46:59,288
What do I do?

1214
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:03,667
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

1215
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,632
She's with some old guy,
it looks like.

1216
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:13,426
Move, huh.
Come on!

1217
01:47:13,636 --> 01:47:15,220
Calm down, okay.

1218
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:19,516
Ah. This is what I want.

1219
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:23,562
The Salian Fireballs.

1220
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:27,733
Page 321. Chapter 6.

1221
01:47:42,748 --> 01:47:43,749
Whoa!

1222
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:46,460
What is that?

1223
01:47:50,965 --> 01:47:52,257
Watch out!

1224
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:21,870
"Power of Rainmaking". No!

1225
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:23,413
"How to separate
husband and wife."

1226
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:25,123
No, not now.
Not now!

1227
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:28,209
Well, you better find something
fast, like an atom bomb.

1228
01:48:40,264 --> 01:48:41,306
I found it.

1229
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:47,683
"Summoning...the demon storm."

1230
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:50,357
Hurry...go_

1231
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:53,902
Higher girl, higher.

1232
01:48:54,111 --> 01:48:58,073
- Come with me!
- I am with you!

1233
01:48:58,282 --> 01:48:59,783
On, girl.

1234
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:14,505
I am with you.

1235
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:20,053
Zaltar!

1236
01:50:13,565 --> 01:50:14,941
Oh, thank God.

1237
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:21,906
You've had your fun, Selena.
The game is finished.

1238
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:23,408
Hardly.

1239
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:26,703
One false step, bluebird.

1240
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:31,082
And even if you don't,
your friends will get the point.

1241
01:50:33,877 --> 01:50:35,253
Hey: "C!

1242
01:50:42,678 --> 01:50:43,637
I don't like this.

1243
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:46,556
Don't worry, Lucy.
Don't worry.

1244
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:50,561
I wouldn't
if I were you.

1245
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:53,146
Well, you're not me.

1246
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:01,070
- Oh!
- Ah!

1247
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:04,408
Quick, get out 0f the way.
Into the alcove over there.

1248
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:06,993
- Come on, out.
- Hurry, Jimmy. Hurry.

1249
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:13,542
The Omegahedron, Selena.

1250
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:15,168
I want it.

1251
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:19,960
Well, then, Supergirl.
You shall have it.

1252
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,158
Ah!

1253
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:54,291
Ah!

1254
01:52:06,053 --> 01:52:07,888
Supergirl, above you.
Look out!

1255
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:13,267
Ah!

1256
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:25,530
I think I'll be going.
If you'll excuse me.

1257
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:33,371
That's what I said.
I'm staying, I'm staying.

1258
01:52:47,386 --> 01:52:49,679
You have no friends, Selena.

1259
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:52,223
You treat everyone as if
they were put on this earth

1260
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:53,891
to serve you.

1261
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:56,520
More or less,
I think they were.

1262
01:52:57,604 --> 01:52:59,606
You included.

1263
01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:05,070
Power of shadow.

1264
01:53:05,487 --> 01:53:07,405
Appear!

1265
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:30,553
Power of shadow...

1266
01:53:33,015 --> 01:53:35,767
...destroy her!

1267
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:16,974
Ah!

1268
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:18,059
Oh!

1269
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:33,908
L...can't.

1270
01:54:35,452 --> 01:54:37,454
I can't!

1271
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:39,914
You can!

1272
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:44,002
<i>On, girl.</i>

1273
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:54,137
Yes!

1274
01:55:04,314 --> 01:55:06,899
Confront her with it!
It's the only way!

1275
01:55:22,624 --> 01:55:23,875
Q-oh!

1276
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:39,557
No, no, no!

1277
01:55:50,193 --> 01:55:51,611
Argh!

1278
01:56:29,524 --> 01:56:30,274
Oh!

1279
01:56:31,151 --> 01:56:32,485
I have to go.

1280
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:34,487
I have to return this
to where it belongs.

1281
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:36,239
<i>And I must
ask you all something.</i>

1282
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:39,409
It's alright, Supergirl.
We never saw you.

1283
01:56:39,618 --> 01:56:41,119
We never even
heard of you.

1284
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,621
Thank you.

1285
01:56:43,163 --> 01:56:45,081
<i>(Supergirh
Ethan, Linda, she...</i>

1286
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:47,417
Well, she had to leave
in a hurry, but she...

1287
01:56:47,626 --> 01:56:49,294
You don't have to
say a word.

1288
01:56:50,128 --> 01:56:51,379
I know.

1289
01:56:57,427 --> 01:56:59,345
I'll explain
about Linda.

1290
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:02,307
Thank you, Ethan.

1291
01:57:03,725 --> 01:57:05,351
Take care of
yourself, kiddo.

1292
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:31,669
Wow!
That was some kiss.

1293
01:57:31,878 --> 01:57:32,753
Wow!

1294
01:57:35,423 --> 01:57:37,049
Goodbye, Linda.
