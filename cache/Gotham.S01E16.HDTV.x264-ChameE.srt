1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,203
<i>Previously, on</i> Gotham:
I start a new job
in the morning.

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,404
A new job?! Congratulations!

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,539
I'm coming to work
at the GCPD.

4
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,375
I'm your new
medical examiner.

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,610
I have some questions I need to
ask the members of the board.

6
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,545
What kind of questions?
About Arkham.

7
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,347
It seems very likely
those gangsters

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,715
are actually given
their shares in Arkham

9
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,450
by Wayne Enterprises.

10
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,652
This nightclub makes
a lot of money.

11
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,088
That's why I want to
re-open it under
your care.

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,656
I can have the club?

13
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,958
You're with me now.

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,993
What is this place?
Where are we?

15
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,295
<i>Some people think it's a
prison, some think it's Hell.</i>

16
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,965
They took my eyes.

17
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,366
<i>People call him Mace.</i>

18
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,734
<i>He's the one in charge.</i>

19
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:40,638
Ah!

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,273
<i>My name is Fish Mooney.</i>

21
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,542
I'm in charge now.

22
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,002

Jim?

40
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:32,783
Hi.

41
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:38,289
Where's Jim?

42
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,559
He dropped off his keys,
like, last week.

43
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,803
So screw him anyway, right?

44
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:01,479
So who are you guys?

45
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:14,725
Thanks.

46
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:41,786
Ladies and
gentlemen, the Flying Graysons!

47
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,456
Show them your appreciation!

48
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,891
Thank you from
the Flying Graysons!

49
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,360

00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,748
Calm down, now.
Calm down! Stop that!

54
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:13,751
Come on!

55
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,756
Stop it! Calm down!

56
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,460

You...

65
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,453
Why did you attack
Mr. Grayson?

66
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,654
No reason.

67
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:25,956
I don't like him.

68
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:29,527
I have no idea why he did it.

69
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:33,064
Beats me.

70
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,673
Wow, you circus people
don't mess around, do you?

71
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,875
I swear, John Grayson,

72
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,410
if you give me
that look one more time,

73
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,545
I will slap you silly.

74
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,579
You wish.

75
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,581
Don't think I can't.

76
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,948
Whoa, kids.

77
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,817
What's the big problem,
anyhow?

78
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,518
The Graysons are a bunch
of arrogant buttheads

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,721
is the problem.
The Lloyds are feckless
drunkards,

80
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,356
is more like it.

81
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,990
So it's a family feud.

82
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,592
Graysons don't
get along with Lloyds.

83
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,561
Been that way for years.

84
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,862
It's sort of a tradition.

85
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,664
You guys fight like this
every night?

86
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,299
No.

87
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,601
That was just her idiot uncle
doing his thing.

88
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,536
You know damn well
it must be Lila's fault.

89
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:15,005
Mary...
What?

90
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:21,712
Hey.

91
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,681
Sorry the date went south.

92
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,749
Are you kidding?

93
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,751
Best date ever.

94
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,385
Who gets to see a circus brawl?

95
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,552
True.

96
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,388
None of them will talk,
of course.

97
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,656
So I've no idea what
those two were fighting over.

98
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,592
I think they're rival lovers.

99
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,861
Their families have been
fighting since way back,

100
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,529
but this particular fight was

101
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,498
apparently over
a woman named Lila.

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,334
She's a snake dancer
in the sideshow.

103
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,769
Wow.
I know.

104
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,470
How cool is that?
A snake dancer.

105
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,606
No, I mean, wow,
you're really good.

106
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,342
People talk to doctors.
I guess so.

107
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,043
I should find this woman
Lila, make sure she's okay.

108
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,578
Might take little awhile.

109
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,713
I'll have a patrolman
drive you home.

110
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,516
Oh... I could come with you.

111
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,751
Lee, this is police business.

112
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,887
Come on, Jim.

113
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,088
I'm dying to meet Lila.

114
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,592
Well, bringing along
medical personnel

115
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,794
is a justifiable precaution,

116
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,595
I guess.
There you go.

117
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:15,966
Sir... where's Lila?

118
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,368
Lila?

119
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,470
The Snake Dancer.

120
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,052
GCPD.

121
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,454
We need to speak with Lila.

122
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,622
She's not here.

123
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,024
Why? What's happened?

124
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,459
Where is she?

125
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,094
Uh, I don't know.

126
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,696
She was supposed to
be home ages ago.

127
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,730
You a relative?

128
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,033
Uh, I'm her son... Jerome.

129
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,702
Jerome, when did you
last see her?

130
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,671
This morning.

131
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,573
She was here when I
left for the library.

132
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,875
Relax, Jerome,
this gentleman is just here

133
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,577
because Owen and Al
had a disagreement.

134
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,847
Your mother's fine,
gone on a spree, no doubt.

135
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,949
- You know how she is.
- A spree?

136
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,152
Without her hat,
her coat or her purse?

137
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,922
And look at Sheba.

138
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,424
She's distraught.

139
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,692
She knows something's wrong.

140
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,961
The snake does seem
to be agitated.

141
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,129
Sir...

142
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,698
she's what you call
a party girl.

143
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,533
Back in the morning
with her knickers

144
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,568
in a handbag, sure as eggs.

145
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,904
But she didn't take
her handbag, did she?

146
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:31,108
How fast does an animal
like that move?

147
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,611
Oh, fast walking pace.

148
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,946
They rely on
surprise, mainly.

149
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,615
Let her out.

150
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:39,917
I'm sorry?

151
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,152
Let her out.

152
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,936
Oh! Oh...

153
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,941
Oh, my God.

154
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:47,685
You knew.

155
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,687
You knew she was here.

156
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,021
No.

157
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,723
Look at me.

158
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:58,963
She was like that
when we found her.

159
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:09,940
Let's talk straight.

160
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,176
Those people out there

161
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,278
are using us
as transplant donors.

162
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,915
We are simply spare parts.

163
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,818
Unless...

164
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,520
unless we do something about it.

165
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,123
How?

166
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,524
I have a plan.

167
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,761
But you must do
exactly what I say.

168
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,263
You do as I say,
and I promise you,

169
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,399
I will get some of us
out of here alive.

170
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,500
That's right.

171
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,269
No, you heard me correctly.

172
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:43,007
I said,<i> some...</i> of us.

173
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,578
Because the truth of the
matter is some will die.

174
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,016
But we will die with dignity.

175
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,118
We will die for a reason,

176
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,353
and we will die next to family,

177
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,189
and I tell you what...
we are family.

178
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,192
We're all we got.

179
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:05,195
That's family!

180
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,165
We have one simple choice:

181
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,402
we die here alone on our knees

182
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:16,006
or we stand up and we fight
with our family!

183
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,986
A couple of riggers
found her right here.

184
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,854
We decided to hide her
on the truck.

185
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,289
We were going to give her

186
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,525
a proper burial as soon as
we got back on the road.

187
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,427
Decent of you.

188
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,095
Who's "we"?
Who else knew?

189
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,830
Just me and the head
of the families.

190
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,533
If an outsider killed her,
what can you do?

191
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,967
An act of God.

192
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,003
If it was one of us,

193
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,938
we always find out.

194
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,973
And we make sure
they're punished.

195
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,208
How?

196
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,243
We have our ways.

197
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,112
And we have ours.

198
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,380
Hook him up.

199
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:12,362
Morning, partner.

200
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,031
Gonna need a little help here.

201
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,299
No kidding.

202
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,867
I mean, you're kidding, right?

203
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,070
This isn't
an elaborate prank or...?

204
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:27,511
Tell me about
your mother, Jerome.

205
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:32,216
She's my mother.

206
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,051
What can I say? I love her.

207
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,487
She's perfect.

208
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,490
Not a very good cook.

209
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,493
Except for that...

210
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,428
Did she have any enemies?

211
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,896
Someone with a grudge?

212
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,966
No.

213
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,634
Boyfriends?

214
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,636
No.

215
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,971
No?

216
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,673
She had lovers.

217
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,444
They're sex partners
really, but not boyfriends.

218
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,079
She didn't want the commitment.

219
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,280
Alphonse Grayson?

220
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,581
Yes, he was one of them.

221
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,150
Owen Lloyd?

222
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,685
Yes.

223
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,687
Any others?

224
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,956
Not that I could put a name to.

225
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,561
How do you feel about
your mother's love life?

226
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:21,298
I feel fine about it.

227
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,133
If not for
my mother's love life,

228
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,535
I wouldn't be here, would I?

229
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,370
Sex is

230
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,105
a healthy human activity.

231
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,040
Yes, it is.

232
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,944
Do you have any other family?

233
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,681
The circus is my family.

234
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:42,019
One more time. Why did
you assault Mr. Grayson?

235
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,053
You know why.

236
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,721
Tell me.
He killed Lila.

237
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,957
Why would he do that?

238
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,258
She was gonna choose me
over him,

239
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,593
and he's an arrogant
son of a bitch.

240
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,028
Not gonna let a Lloyd

241
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,463
humiliate a Grayson that way.

242
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,032
How come your families
don't get along?

243
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,467
His great-grandfather
falsely accused

244
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,470
my mother's uncle Barry
of stealing a horse.

245
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,472
When was this?

246
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,739
Before the Great War.

247
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,341
World War One.

248
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,576
Yeah.

249
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,444
<i>For three generations,</i>

250
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,646
your families have been feuding
over a stolen horse?

251
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,448
Yes. And the Lloyds
are still trash.

252
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,549
Blood is blood.

253
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,051
Must be a hell
of a horse.

254
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,686
Why did Mr. Lloyd
assault you?

255
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,689
He killed Lila, and fears
I'm gonna kill him for it.

256
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,157
He says the opposite.

257
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,758
He says you killed her.

258
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,995
Yes, I suppose he would
have to say that, wouldn't he?

259
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,330
It wasn't Uncle Owen.

260
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,131
He could never do
such a terrible thing.

261
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,133
Holy crap, Mary!

262
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,667
How can you be so blind?

263
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,269
Quiet, you.

264
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,403
Yeah, quiet, you.

265
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,504
You're the blind one.

266
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:35,539
My brother is a man of honor.

267
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,241
Your uncle is
a violent drunk.

268
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,443
Do the math, little girl.
My uncle is an artist.

269
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,279
Your brother is a conceited
muscle-head, like the rest

270
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,413
of you flying douche bags.

271
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,681
I can't believe I ever thought

272
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,683
I loved you.

273
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,451
Enough. Huh?

274
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,230
They're coming.

275
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,498
Are you ready?

276
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,066
Yes!

277
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,035
I said, are you ready?!

278
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,870
Yes!

279
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:13,243
Inmate 57A, raise your hand.

280
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,280
57A...

281
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,815
raise your hand.

282
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,855
Step forward.

283
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,828
One moment, please, sir.

284
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:36,400
We need to talk.

285
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,674
Back up, inmate.

286
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,842
You're in violation.

287
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:45,976
57A,

288
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,878
step forward!

289
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,380
Excuse me one moment, please.

290
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:53,882
I'm the new "shot caller" here.

291
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:55,484
My name is Fish Mooney,

292
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:58,487
and with all due
respect, for you and I

293
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:03,356
to have a good
working relationship,

294
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:05,458
there's some things
that need to change.

295
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,226
Is that right?

296
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:07,461
What's your name?

297
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:09,930
None of your damn business
what my name is.

298
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:12,432
Right. Okay, well...

299
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:14,334
I know you have a job to do.

300
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:17,237
And I am more than willing
to give you 57A,

301
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,239
in exchange for

302
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:23,210
60 crates of water, 30 blankets,
50 pounds of fresh fruit,

303
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:25,145
and a few magazines.

304
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:28,548
What if I refuse?

305
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,584
What will you do?

306
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:34,521
Well, I'd be willing
to give you 57A,

307
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:36,089
just not alive.

308
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:39,226
We need them alive.

309
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:40,894
Exactly.

310
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:43,530
I'm gonna count to three.

311
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:45,899
You'll disappear

312
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,667
or get a severe beating.

313
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:49,870
I'm gonna take that as a no.

314
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:51,905
One...

315
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:53,707
two...

316
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,142
It's simple economics.

317
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:31,211
Our lives are worth something.

318
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:37,684
60 crates of water,
30 blankets...

319
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:39,519
You...

320
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,021
you're coming with me.

321
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:42,956
The manager is gonna be

322
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,190
very unhappy with you.

323
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:53,567
I would think this manager

324
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:55,969
wouldn't be too happy
with you either.

325
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:58,505
So if he wants
to talk to me,

326
00:17:58,507 --> 00:18:00,974
I'll be right here.

327
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:02,542
Manager doesn't come down here.

328
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:06,980
Well, looks like
we have a standoff.

329
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:10,050
I'll tell you what.

330
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:11,685
I can be flexible.

331
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:14,688
So I'll go talk to this manager,

332
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,324
but while I'm gone,
you're going to stay right here,

333
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:19,192
as our guest.

334
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:20,594
How's that sound?

335
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:26,533
We'll be back.

336
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:37,310
Yeah!

337
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:13,413
Wait, back up a little.

338
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:15,782
So you set the snake loose?

339
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:17,417
Yes, ma'am.
To track down the body?

340
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:19,052
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:20,720
Snakes have an excellent
sense of smell.

342
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,255
Well, now I know.

343
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:24,257
And your prime suspects

344
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,393
are a clown and an acrobat?

345
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:28,294
Yeah.

346
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:30,263
Ain't this one a doozy?

347
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:32,065
Your victim, Lila Valeska,

348
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,200
was killed by
a large knife or hatchet.

349
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:36,336
Multiple blows to the
head and upper torso.

350
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:38,571
Around 3:00 yesterday afternoon.

351
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:40,807
From 2:30 to 4:15,
both Grayson and Lloyd

352
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:42,475
were in the ring
for the matinee.

353
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,144
Well, how precise
is that time of death?

354
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:46,179
Give or take
45 minutes.

355
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:49,082
Still possible then,
but cutting it close.

356
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:50,717
Hold and press your guys,

357
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,318
but keep looking.

358
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,087
Yeah, boss. Forensics is
working the crime scene now.

359
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:56,923
We're going through
her phone records.

360
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:00,195
All right!

361
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:02,697
We're gonna send
the rest of you home now,

362
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:05,300
but the investigation
is ongoing.

363
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:06,968
Nobody leaves town.

364
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,736
And listen up.

365
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,171
No more fighting!

366
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,040
Look where your friends are.

367
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,445
What good is this feud
doing you?

368
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:27,922
I like it when
you act all tough.

369
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:31,893
"Nobody leave town."

370
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:33,761
Sounds better when you say it.

371
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:36,798
I feel like we should

372
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,733
finish up our date.

373
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:40,335
Do you want
to come over tonight?

374
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:41,769
I can cook you dinner.

375
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,838
Sure. That sounds good.

376
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,640
Good.

377
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:46,774
Get some rest.

378
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,810
I will try. See you later.

379
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:53,982
I have to ask.

380
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:56,684
If you were to guess, who
do you think killed Lila?

381
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,086
I try not to guess.

382
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,321
I work the suspects
and I wait on forensics.

383
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:02,490
Excuse me.

384
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:07,862
Am I speaking to
Detective James Gordon?

385
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:10,431
Yes.

386
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:15,203
Then this must be Dr. Thompkins,
the medical examiner.

387
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:17,972
I'm sorry, how did
you know who we were?

388
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,874
My name is Paul Cicero.

389
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:21,009
I'm a psychic

390
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,111
with the sideshow.

391
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:25,980
Lila Valeska was
an old friend of mine.

392
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:27,982
A psychic. I see.

393
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,917
How could I help you,
Mr. Cicero?

394
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,922
I sense that you don't think
Owen or Alphonse are guilty.

395
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:36,157
You must be psychic.

396
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,725
In which case,

397
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:39,694
perhaps you'd like to hear
the message

398
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:42,764
Lila sent me
from the other side.

399
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:44,999
Thanks, Mr. Cicero,
we're not quite looking at

400
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,734
the other side just yet.

401
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:49,370
As you wish.
I'm merely a messenger.

402
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:51,739
What's the message?

403
00:21:51,741 --> 00:21:54,075
Thank you, Doctor.

404
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:57,111
Lila told me

405
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:58,913
that the servant

406
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:00,415
of the Devil

407
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:04,085
lies in the garden
of the Iron Sisters.

408
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:06,054
The Iron Sisters?

409
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:07,255
What does that mean?

410
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:08,723
I don't know.

411
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:09,824
We'll get right on it.

412
00:22:09,826 --> 00:22:11,392
I don't think sarcasm

413
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:12,927
is your métier, James.

414
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:14,862
Make of the message
what you will.

415
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:16,130
Good day to you both.

416
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:26,808
Well, that wasn't
very open-minded of you.

417
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,143
Oh, come on, Lee.
He's a fraud.

418
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:30,511
He's gonna go straight
to the press

419
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:32,347
and say he's consulting
on the case.

420
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:33,748
He's looking for publicity.

421
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,116
Maybe.

422
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:37,919
If you were gonna send a message

423
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,287
from beyond the grave,

424
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:40,988
don't you think
priority number one

425
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,957
would be the killer's name
and not a riddle?

426
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,425
Who knows how it works?

427
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:47,428
All right.
I'm not gonna argue with you.

428
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,297
Good.

429
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:50,998
Later, then.

430
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:53,935
Later.

431
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,514
They called to confirm

432
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:10,017
your meeting with the board
of Wayne Enterprises tomorrow.

433
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:12,286
Excellent.

434
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:14,188
I was afraid
they'd postpone again.

435
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,390
Well, I'll say it one more time.

436
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:17,058
I think that, uh,

437
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,927
it's an incredibly bad idea,
Master Bruce.

438
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:21,129
I think it's reckless,

439
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:23,164
I think it's premature,

440
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,966
and, quite frankly,
I think it's bloody dangerous.

441
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:27,101
And we've already been over this
100 times, Alfred.

442
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:30,071
My mind is made up.

443
00:23:31,874 --> 00:23:34,175
Can you pass me
that file over there?

444
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:37,044
The file...

445
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:38,846
Well...

446
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:41,048
I've said my piece.

447
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,518
If we're both found

448
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,052
dead in a ditch,

449
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:47,422
don't blame me.

450
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:28,095
Ta-da.

451
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:31,432
Nah.

452
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:33,200
No?

453
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:35,703
Jim loves me in this color.

454
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,504
It's too obvious.

455
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:39,440
You gotta dress like
you're not trying,

456
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:41,075
like you're on your way

457
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:42,643
to go meet
some other guy.

458
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:45,179
To go... sailing,

459
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:47,181
or whatever.

460
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:49,383
Really? Sailing?

461
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:54,855
Okay.

462
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,338
Oh, my God.

463
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,840
You like?

464
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:14,608
Oh, my God.

465
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,312
Oh, my God!

466
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:20,147
What's wrong?

467
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:21,348
No, it's good.

468
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,516
It's my sister's recipe;

469
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:23,718
she's a really,
brilliant cook.

470
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,185
I was thinking
of my sister,

471
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:26,487
and it came to me:

472
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:27,688
Mm-hmm?
I think I know

473
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,356
what the blind man's
message means.

474
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:30,724
The servant of the devil

475
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:32,626
lies in the garden
of the Iron Sisters?
Oh?

476
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:34,595
It's Arkham Bridge.
Hmm?

477
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:36,697
The Iron Sisters.
Arkham Bridge.

478
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:38,098
The towers.

479
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,500
They're called, uh,
Mary and Betty?

480
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:41,468
Mmm. I remember,
as a kid,

481
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,870
we used to call
them that, but...

482
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:45,672
Right. And there's a park,
um, under the towers

483
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,541
on the Gotham side.

484
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:49,710
A garden? It all fits.

485
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:51,211
Lee...

486
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:52,880
it fits an
impossible story.

487
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:54,281
He didn't speak
with Lila Valeska;

488
00:25:54,283 --> 00:25:56,383
she's dead.
So you say!

489
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:58,285
Come on, you're a doctor.
A scientist.

490
00:25:58,287 --> 00:25:59,686
There are plenty of things
in this world

491
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:01,155
that can't be explained
by rational science.

492
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:02,356
Yeah, people who enjoy

493
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:03,557
folk dancing, for instance.

494
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,125
Doesn't mean ghosts exist.

495
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:06,794
You're very arrogant
in your certainty.

496
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,228
What if this is

497
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,397
a clue to a murder?

498
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,865
The poor woman!

499
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:16,804
Fine. I'll go myself.

500
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:18,839
Thank you.
Sure.

501
00:26:18,841 --> 00:26:20,574
I'll come with you.
Okay.

502
00:26:20,576 --> 00:26:22,409
We'll go together.
First thing in the morning.

503
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:23,577
Morning?

504
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:26,780
Now?

505
00:26:26,782 --> 00:26:28,248
You want to go now?

506
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:30,651
It's only a half a mile away.

507
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:32,319
It's dark.

508
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:33,821
I have a flashlight.

509
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:42,329
So what are we looking for,
exactly, do you think?

510
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:43,697
I know, I know.

511
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,599
This is probably a
complete waste of time.

512
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:47,768
Thank you for
doing this.
No problem.

513
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,271
But, uh, let's not make
a habit out of it, okay?

514
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:52,773
This is no place
for a lady.

515
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:54,641
Ha!

516
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:56,677
What do you
mean, "ha"?

517
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:58,412
You're a hypocrite.

518
00:26:58,414 --> 00:27:00,314
You say you want
a strong woman

519
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:02,516
to share this crazy life
you've chosen,

520
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:03,750
but when push
comes to shove,

521
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:06,320
you want me to stay home
and bake cookies.

522
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:10,224
Not cookies,
necessarily.

523
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:12,359
Pie. Any kind of pie.

524
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,927
Ha, ha!

525
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:18,232
So if someone were
to throw something

526
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:19,633
from a car on the bridge,

527
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:20,901
this is where it would land.

528
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:24,805
Yeah, I guess you're right.

529
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:41,822
Lee...

530
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:49,830
THFC.

531
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:51,331
What does that mean?

532
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,333
The Hellfire Club.

533
00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:55,636
It's a Satanist cult.

534
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:58,906
Committed a string
of ritual murders.

535
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:01,942
But they haven't been active
for a decade or more.

536
00:28:01,944 --> 00:28:03,944
I guess they're back.

537
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,447
No.

538
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:09,683
No, I don't think so.

539
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:13,921
Hey, Sarge, I'm gonna need

540
00:28:13,923 --> 00:28:16,590
a couple of mobile units
to pick some people up.

541
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:19,326
But listen...
they need careful handling.

542
00:28:31,436 --> 00:28:33,070
Sir, they're in
three and four.

543
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:34,271
Thanks, Zeke.
Neither of them knows

544
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:36,439
the other one's here, right?

545
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:37,840
Right, like you said.

546
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,309
Ah, good work.

547
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:39,977
Just bear in mind
that you could be wrong

548
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:41,612
about all of this.
I will bear
it in mind.

549
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,847
I will, but
I'm not wrong.

550
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,949
So go on home now, lady.

551
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:47,751
Hey.

552
00:28:47,753 --> 00:28:50,120
We were having
a perfectly lovely evening.

553
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:52,088
I am not the
one who wanted

554
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,790
to go out searching
for Satanist hatchets.

555
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,859
You... know what I wanted to do.

556
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:57,961
You're right.

557
00:28:57,963 --> 00:28:58,995
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, what?

558
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,800
I tend to get
overly enthusiastic

559
00:29:03,802 --> 00:29:05,168
about things.
It's an issue for me.

560
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,703
My mom always said...

561
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,672
Oh, who gives a crap
what my mom said, right?

562
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:11,975
Have a good night, Jim.

563
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:13,176
Let me know
how it all turns out.

564
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:14,911
Good night, Lee.

565
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:17,514
Wait!

566
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,594
What you said earlier,

567
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:32,529
about hypocrisy,
sharing lives...

568
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:36,933
You're right. Let's go.

569
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:39,502
I'm what?

570
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,908
Right.

571
00:29:55,987 --> 00:29:58,588
Good evening,
Mr. Cicero.

572
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,657
Sorry to bring you
down here so late.

573
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:04,694
Good evening, Detective Gordon;

574
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,162
Dr. Thompkins.

575
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:08,565
How did you...

576
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:10,767
He smells your perfume.

577
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,469
We solved the message
Lila sent you.

578
00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:14,037
Oh?

579
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,473
Took us to Arkham
Bridge Park.

580
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:19,209
We found a hatchet there

581
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,744
with Satanist symbols

582
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:22,078
scratched into it.

583
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,713
Dear lord.

584
00:30:23,715 --> 00:30:25,215
You know what that hatchet
means, Mr. Cicero?

585
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:26,683
Tell me.

586
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:28,551
It means you're
an accessory to murder.

587
00:30:28,553 --> 00:30:30,520
Such drama.

588
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:32,989
I merely passed along a message.

589
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:34,758
A message
from the dead.

590
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,892
Didn't happen.

591
00:30:35,894 --> 00:30:37,260
Which means

592
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:39,162
you invented the message...

593
00:30:39,164 --> 00:30:41,665
which means you had someone
plant the hatchet

594
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,566
for us to find.

595
00:30:43,568 --> 00:30:45,201
You wanted us to think

596
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:47,570
Satanist were responsible
for Lila's death.

597
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:50,507
You're protecting somebody.

598
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:52,509
Lila spoke to me.

599
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:53,777
That's all.

600
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:58,648
You know,

601
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,884
a hatchet is a clumsy ploy.

602
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:03,286
You wouldn't try it
unless you were desperate.

603
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:07,691
Which suggests
you're protecting someone close.

604
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:10,593
Someone you love.

605
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:12,262
This fantasia

606
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:16,166
was conjured
in your blinkered mind.

607
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:19,235
If you could only see
what I see...

608
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:23,540
Hi, Jerome.

609
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:24,841
Please.

610
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,042
Take a seat.

611
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:28,278
You know Mr. Cicero,

612
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,846
from the show.

613
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,147
Yes, sir.

614
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:33,149
Hello, Mr. Cicero.

615
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:35,118
Good evening, Jerome.

616
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:43,893
Do you know why you're here?

617
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:45,996
Did you find out
who killed my mother?

618
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:47,731
You killed your mother, Jerome.

619
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:50,767
Me?

620
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:52,635
You killed her up on that hill

621
00:31:52,637 --> 00:31:54,704
and Mr. Cicero let you clean up
in his trailer.

622
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:56,039
He told you to scratch

623
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,574
the Satanist stuff
on the hatchet

624
00:31:57,576 --> 00:31:58,775
and throw it
off the bridge.

625
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:01,644
Sir, that's... absurd and...

626
00:32:01,646 --> 00:32:02,979
and offensive.

627
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:04,948
But it's the truth.

628
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,282
What I don't know
is why this man

629
00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:08,918
risked so much
to help you.

630
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,653
I think he's your father.

631
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,191
You don't know
what you're talking about.

632
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:17,360
My father was a sea captain.

633
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:20,163
Am I wrong,

634
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:21,231
Mr. Cicero?

635
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,866
Yes.

636
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,200
He was a sea captain.

637
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:26,069
His name was Sven Karlsen.
He died at sea.

638
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:29,239
What was the name of his ship?

639
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,775
He worked on a lot
of different ships.

640
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:34,010
The one he went down in.

641
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:38,314
She never said.

642
00:32:38,316 --> 00:32:41,251
We can do a blood test
to prove I'm right.

643
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,620
It takes only half an hour
to get a foolproof result.

644
00:32:43,622 --> 00:32:45,088
Isn't that right, Dr. Thompkins?

645
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,023
Yes.

646
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:49,359
Save yourself a needle.

647
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,828
I do hate needles.

648
00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:55,832
I'm sorry, Jerome.

649
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,668
What are you talking about?

650
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,304
He's right.

651
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:04,240
I am your father.

652
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:06,009
No, you're not.
Why would you say that?

653
00:33:06,011 --> 00:33:08,678
You must have suspected
the truth.

654
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,313
You're not my father.
My mother would never...

655
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:11,981
Your mother was

656
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:14,050
a cruel woman;
she was often unkind to me,

657
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:16,786
but she did once love me,

658
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:19,389
in her way.

659
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:22,759
And she loved you very much.

660
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:25,895
That's why she gave you
a better father.

661
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:43,746
My mother

662
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:44,914
was a cold-hearted whore

663
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,449
who never loved anyone.

664
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:48,184
And she'd never touch

665
00:33:48,186 --> 00:33:51,721
a pathetic old creep like you.

666
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:53,790
All these years,

667
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:55,792
do you think I was kind to you

668
00:33:55,794 --> 00:33:57,193
because I'm such a good man?

669
00:33:57,195 --> 00:34:00,063
If I wasn't your father,

670
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:03,900
would I help you as I have,
after what you did?

671
00:34:07,905 --> 00:34:10,707
My father... Hm.

672
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:12,342
I'll be damned.

673
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,113
Oh, that's very funny.

674
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:23,987
Ba-doom-shh!

675
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:27,423
Looks like the bitch got me
with a zinger in the end.

676
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:30,260
Why did you kill
your mother, Jerome?

677
00:34:30,262 --> 00:34:32,962
Oh, you know how mothers are.

678
00:34:32,964 --> 00:34:36,900
She just kept pushing.

679
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:38,801
And I'm like, fine, Mom.

680
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:40,270
Be a whore.

681
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:42,805
Be a drunken whore, even.

682
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:44,140
But don't be

683
00:34:44,142 --> 00:34:47,177
a nagging drunken whore.

684
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,912
You know?

685
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:50,780
Don't come yell at me

686
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:52,348
to do the dishes

687
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,217
if you've been banging

688
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,486
a clown in the next room!

689
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,757
You know?

690
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:22,046
Long night, huh?

691
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:25,783
Guess it got kind of ugly.

692
00:35:25,785 --> 00:35:27,218
Yes, it did.

693
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,887
You okay?

694
00:35:29,889 --> 00:35:31,989
I'm good.

695
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,392
Truly.

696
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:38,529
It was ugly, but it was also
kind of thrilling.

697
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:40,464
Thrilling?

698
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:43,300
Thrilling and scary.

699
00:35:43,302 --> 00:35:47,104
Like-like looking
down a deep, dark tunnel.

700
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:55,079
Thanks for letting me be there.

701
00:35:57,382 --> 00:36:00,217
You are an unusual woman.

702
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:03,554
You just don't know many women.

703
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,537
Can we go home now?

704
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,674
Mm-hmm.

705
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,318
Hello, Penguin.

706
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:12,456
Victor.

707
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,358
How nice.

708
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:21,365
Don Falcone thinks
you're messing up.

709
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:24,902
You don't know
how to run a club.

710
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:26,537
Your numbers...

711
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:28,972
stink.

712
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,342
With all due respect...

713
00:37:31,344 --> 00:37:33,577
I didn't come here to talk.

714
00:37:35,113 --> 00:37:37,081
Good manners cost nothing,
you know?

715
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:02,906
Relax.

716
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,042
He's harmless.

717
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:06,743
Say hi, Butch.

718
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:08,412
Hi.

719
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:11,648
Falcone didn't want
to throw him away,

720
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,350
so I worked on him
in my basement

721
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:14,985
for a couple of weeks.

722
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:17,254
He's a whole new man.

723
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:18,922
Right, Butch?

724
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,390
Yes, sir, Mr. Zsasz.

725
00:38:19,892 --> 00:38:23,394
Butch knows the club scene
up and down.

726
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:25,196
He'll help you out.

727
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:28,132
But he's...

728
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:30,234
He's Butch Gilzean.

729
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:31,835
He's loyal to Fish Mooney.

730
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:33,904
And he'll do...

731
00:38:33,906 --> 00:38:36,774
exactly what you say.

732
00:38:38,476 --> 00:38:40,477
Really?

733
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:41,978
Really.

734
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:47,851
Hey, Butch,

735
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:50,953
dance for me.

736
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,293
I do good work.

737
00:39:32,062 --> 00:39:34,029
Good morning, everyone.

738
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:35,831
Good morning, Bruce.

739
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:37,399
Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.

740
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:38,334
So happy to see you.

741
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:40,870
Thank you for
meeting with me.

742
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:44,740
I have some questions

743
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:46,108
regarding Wayne Enterprises
business affairs.

744
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,276
Of course.

745
00:39:47,278 --> 00:39:48,844
It's your company, after all.

746
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:50,813
Fire away, young man.

747
00:39:50,815 --> 00:39:53,282
I have two main areas
of concern.

748
00:39:53,284 --> 00:39:55,417
Underworld involvement
in the Arkham Project.

749
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:57,920
And chemical weapons
manufacture

750
00:39:57,922 --> 00:40:00,356
at our Wellzyn affiliate.

751
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:07,396
That's great.

752
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:08,998
Congratulations.

753
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,366
We wanted to thank you.

754
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:12,168
If you hadn't figure
out who killed Lila

755
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,203
and talked to sense
to us the way you did,

756
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:15,938
our families never
would have reconciled,

757
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,740
and we could've never
gotten together.

758
00:40:17,742 --> 00:40:20,509
Just doing my job.

759
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:22,077
Hey, if we have a son,
we'll name him Gordon.

760
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,046
Well...

761
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,381
we'll discuss that,

762
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:26,448
but we're certainly

763
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,983
very grateful.

764
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:29,518
Sure.

765
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:39,829
Why so happy?

766
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:41,964
Happy customers.

767
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:43,065
That's not it.

768
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,266
It's something else.

769
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:47,369
You got laid, didn't you?

770
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:49,839
That's impressive.
You slept somewhere

771
00:40:49,841 --> 00:40:52,541
without razors
and you smell like ladies' soap.

772
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:54,610
Easy catch.

773
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,151
I can only conclude

774
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:04,887
that high-level individuals
or groups

775
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:06,956
within Wayne Enterprises
have colluded

776
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:10,159
in corruption,
bribery, racketeering,

777
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:12,428
and unethical medical research.

778
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,530
Thank you for
that input, Bruce.

779
00:41:14,532 --> 00:41:16,232
I'm so sorry if
you've been alarmed

780
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:18,801
or upset by these
shocking stories

781
00:41:18,803 --> 00:41:20,936
and rumors
you've been exposed to.

782
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:22,972
These are much
more than rumors.

783
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:24,807
We'll look into them thoroughly
and carefully, of course.

784
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:27,142
Bruce, let's be fair.

785
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:30,446
You've told us nothing with any
substantive proof behind it.

786
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:35,417
I haven't told you all I know.

787
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:37,453
No?

788
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:39,088
What else is there?

789
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,357
I hope you do look closely
into these issues.

790
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,959
Because I'll be raising them at
the next shareholders' meeting

791
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,295
with a view
to possible legal action.

792
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,364
Dear me.

793
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:50,599
Legal action?

794
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,301
These are all
very deep waters

795
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:53,836
for such a young man.

796
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:55,838
My youth is not relevant.

797
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,973
Except that if I were a man,

798
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:00,843
I would be chairing this board.

799
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:03,078
And I would be sure
that Wayne Enterprises

800
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,313
was run honestly.

801
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:06,148
Thank you for your time.

802
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:27,970
The manager says
you have a deal.

803
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:30,506
You go up and see him,

804
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:31,941
I stay here.

805
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:39,882
What's your name?

806
00:42:39,884 --> 00:42:41,417
Schmidt.

807
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,586
Your first name.

808
00:42:44,588 --> 00:42:47,022
Thomas.

809
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:48,657
Thomas.

810
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:50,726
Welcome.

811
00:42:51,995 --> 00:42:53,529
Why don't you

812
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:56,332
take off that heavy gear

813
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:58,400
and relax?

814
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,338
My family's gonna show you
a good time.
