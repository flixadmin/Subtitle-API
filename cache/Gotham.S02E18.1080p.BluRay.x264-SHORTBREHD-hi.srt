<i>and failed.</i>

161
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,355
Oh, but I have a very good feeling
about Patient 44.

162
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,941
You need to be more positive.

163
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:06,612
Someone at Wayne Enterprises
ran a search for Karen Jennings.

164
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,366
Do you think she's been found?

165
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:12,577
I don't see how. We've never been able to.

166
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,287
But someone is looking.

167
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,581
She was our first.

168
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,751
One small stroke
on the canvas of possibility.

169
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,545
Such promise, do you remember?

170
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,883
I remember the orderlies she maimed
and the two she killed.

171
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,343
Creation is always so violent.

172
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,511
MS. PEABODY: <i>She could expose us.</i>

173
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,890
HUGO: Oh, Karen, who's looking for you?

174
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,934
Do they know what you've become?

175
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,939
What I turned you into?

(CROW CAWING)

177
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,300
Nope. No joy, never mind.

178
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,970
Still kind of nice to get out the manor,
have a little drive in the country.

179
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,225
<i>Oh, that's terrific, isn't it?
She's made a bloody tea leaf out of you.</i>

She's got some kind
of weird hunting knife.

My name is Bruce Wayne.

191
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,584
I just wanna talk to you.

192
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,713
Bruce Wayne?

193
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,215
You're Bruce Wayne?

194
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,551
That's far enough.

195
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,678
Drop the knife.

196
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,013
It's not a knife.

197
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,058
Whatever it was you used to do this to me,
just drop it right now.

198
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,351
I can't.

199
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,578
- Listen to me--
- That's far enough.

200
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,746
Alfred!

201
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,581
Look around you, Master Bruce.

202
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:10,796
Listen, I have no idea what you are,
but whatever that thing is,

<i>it's bloody dangerous.</i>

<i>You seemed to recognize me.</i>

206
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:20,973
How did you find me?

207
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:25,227
My father, Thomas Wayne, came here
the week before he died.

208
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:28,564
He had it in his calendar.

209
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,776
His calendar? Great. Were you followed?

210
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,321
No. I don't know. By who?

211
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,783
No, no, we weren't followed.

212
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,285
Good. (INHALES SHARPLY)
Then you can leave.

213
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:43,996
Not until you answer my questions.

214
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,874
I know my father came to talk to you
about something called Pinewood Farms.

215
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,042
What is that?

216
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,252
God. You don't know anything, do you?

217
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,629
So tell me.

218
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,133
Do you not understand
that these people will kill you?

219
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,718
I've been trying to tell him that.

220
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:01,013
I'm not afraid to die.

221
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,391
Not if it means doing the right thing.

222
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,894
Yeah? How'd that work out for your dad?

223
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:12,233
You have to go.
It's not safe for you here.

224
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,319
I don't care.

225
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:21,492
Whatever my father was investigating
got him and my mom killed.

226
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,287
You're the first person I've found
who might know why. Please.

227
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,083
You have to tell me what he was doing.

- (WOMEN LAUGHING)

229
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,097
The Artemis is a private club, sir.

230
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,183
I need to see if someone's inside.
It'll just take a minute.

231

233
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,402
What a coincidence.

234
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,531
Can I borrow him a moment?

235
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,209
Did I not make myself clear last night?

236
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,711
Oh, you did.

237
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,796
And I wanted to respect your boundaries,

238
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,758
but I was wondering if you knew
that this is a women's-only club.

239
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,888
Plus, its members are, shall we say,
of a criminal persuasion.

240
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,139
Hmm?

241
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:28,017
Didn't think so, which is why I'm here.

242
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:29,852
Let me guess.

243
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,146
You're gonna talk to the Lady for me,

244
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:35,941
get the information I need
if I just, what, trust you?

245
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,652
No one likes a smarty pants.
So what's your plan, then?

246
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,820
- My plan?
- Mmm-hmm.

247
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,572
My plan is to stick a gun
in the Lady's face

248
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,908
and have her beg me
not to pull the trigger

249
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,243
until she tells me
everything I want to know.

250
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:50,080
The Gordon special. I remember it well.

251
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,751
Problem is you're not a cop anymore.

252
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,544
Why is that by the way?

253
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,090
The point is,
if you go in there guns blazing,

254
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,134
the Lady will disappear,
probably for good.

255
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,596
I can go inside and get you what you want.

256
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,765
What do you have to lose?

257
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,646
Why are you doing this?

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,150
I was there, remember?

259
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,945
When you first caught the Wayne case?

260
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,822
I know what it means to you.

261
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,951
You think that if you can solve it,

262
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,079
you can close the door on the past

263
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:34,458
and maybe, just maybe, it will stay shut,

264
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,294
and then you'll be able to start over.

265
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,006
And you really have to ask me
why I'm doing this?

266
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:49,974
(MUSIC PLAYING)

267
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,612

268
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,283

269
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,827
No, but I'm kind of famous.

00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,330
Oh...

271
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,667
The notorious Barbara Kean. Please.

272
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,175
Sorry about your hand.

273
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:27,595
I don't get many visitors.

274
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:29,763
You, uh, spooked me.

275
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,057
Wait, what, we, we spooked you?

276
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,435
How long have you lived here?

277
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,688
- Ten years. Ever since Pinewood.
- (WIND CHIMES CLINKING)

278
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:42,026
Is that where you got that?

279
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:47,698
Pinewood Farms was a bioengineering
program at Wayne Enterprises,

280
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,742
the kind that was kept off the books.

281
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:51,744
I was one of their first volunteers.

282
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,037
What? You volunteered for that, did you?

283
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,580
I didn't have many options at the time.

284
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:56,707
I was at Blackgate.

285
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,667
Blackgate? Nice.

286
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,295
I take it you weren't a guard, then?

287
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,881
I was born with a crippled arm.

288
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:10,888
Growing up, my father liked two things,
booze and beating his deformed daughter.

289
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,474
One night, I fought back.

290
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,895
He fell down the stairs
and broke his neck.

291
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,106
I went to Blackgate for murder.

292
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,150
But that's self-defense.

293
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,902
Well, people are scared of different.

294
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,613
Jury sent me away.

295
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,407
<i>One day, these men show up,</i>

296
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,369
tell me they're gonna fix my arm.

297
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,913
Not only fix it, make it better.

298
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,918
Instead, they turned me into the monster
who everybody thought I was.

299
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,756
Did my father know what was going on
at Pinewood Farms?

300
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,257
No. No.

301
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,261
When he found out what was going on,

302
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,307
<i>when he saw what they were doing to us,
he shut it down.</i>

303
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,434
Paid to put us into hiding.

304
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,729
So how many were there of you?

305
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,233
I'm not sure. I know
most didn't survive the experiments.

306
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,487
It started up again, didn't it?

307
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,408
<i>That's why my father came to see you
after all those years.</i>

308
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,955
He wasn't sure, but he had his suspicions.
He came to warn me.

309
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,668
Whoever was running Pinewood,

310
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:26,505
whoever started it up again,
I know that's who killed my parents.

311
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,340
<i>Do you remember any names?</i>

312
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,843
None of them ever used their names
around us,

313
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,637
but the man who was in charge,

314
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:38,976
I can still see his face
every time I close my eyes.

315
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,104
Then you need to take us there.

316
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,608
- You need to take us to Pinewood Farms.
- (CHUCKLES)

317
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,905
My father risked his life to save you.

318
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,660
