2
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,800
Alert the queen.

3
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:30,800
Hyah!

4
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:03,342
Bruce Vayne.

5
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,175
Bruce Wayne.

6
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:24,592
Talk.

7
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:27,467
I believe there is a stranger.

8
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,217
Comes to this village
from the sea.

9
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,300
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

10
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:35,633
He brings fish.

11
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:37,425
He comes on the king tide.

12
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:38,717
That was last night.

13
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:47,717
You have eyes, so see.

14
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,508
Icebergs in the harbor.

15
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:52,675
It's four months since
the last ship got through.

16
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:57,092
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

17
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:07,675
There are enemies
coming from far away.

18
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,508
I need warriors.

19
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:14,133
This stranger,
others like him.

20
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:18,592
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

21
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:21,883
It's very important
that I see this man.

22
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,258
If this stranger exists,

23
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,550
he'll give him your message.

24
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,842
$5,000 American.

25
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:30,675
Look, I'll give you $25,000

26
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:33,842
to talk to this man
right now, outside.

27
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:50,842
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

28
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:54,675
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

29
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:57,758
We are poor, not stupid.

30
00:10:57,842 --> 00:10:59,633
Get out.

31
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,217
I'm sorry.

32
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,008
Can't do that.

33
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:06,383
I'll leave after we've spoken.

34
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:12,550
He said, "Get out."

35
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,300
Arthur Curry.

36
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:36,383
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

37
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,717
The Aquaman.

38
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,925
So, let me
get this straight.

39
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:49,717
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

40
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,592
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

41
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,508
Oh, that shithole.

42
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,467
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

43
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,050
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

44
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,092
'Cause I don't like you coming
here, digging into my business

45
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:02,925
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.

46
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:04,592
Is that why you do this?

47
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,342
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?

48
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,675
I've read the stories.

49
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:10,008
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.

50
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:11,550
You'll join us.

51
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:13,467
"Strong man
is strongest alone."

52
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,092
You ever heard that?

53
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:16,717
You ever hear
of Superman?

54
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,508
He died fighting next to me.

55
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:21,092
My point exactly.

56
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,508
He believed
we were stronger together.

57
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:25,217
We owe it to him.

58
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,758
I don't owe anyone anything.

59
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:37,842
Dressed like a bat.

60
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,008
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.

61
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:09,758
Move over, Dusty.

62
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:08,508
My God, Master Wayne,
but this is cold.

63
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:13,050
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?

64
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,592
Might be
a metahuman or two in Fiji.

65
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:17,425
Costa Rica's nice.

66
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:19,050
I found him.

67
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:24,050
He said no.

68
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,467
So the draft stands
at naught for two?

69
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:31,508
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living

70
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:35,300
isn't cut out to be
a recruiter. Hmm?

71
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:56,758
That's $10, please.

72
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,883
Good morning, Miss Lane.

73
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,425
Jerry, hi.

74
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:40,050
Wow.

75
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,592
You don't miss a day, do you?

76
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:44,967
Like it here.

77
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:31,425
Excuse me.

78
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:34,133
Move!

79
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,508
Move it! Move it!

80
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,258
- No, mate, don't shoot!
- Move, move!

81
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,050
Get the fuck
over there!

82
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,592
Move! All of ya!

83
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,133
Line them up
along the wall.

84
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:15,842
Keep them quiet.

85
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:18,467
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!

86
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,050
Shut them up too!

87
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:25,550
We'll be making
a statement shortly.

88
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,508
Until then,
if I see any movement,

89
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:29,842
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.

90
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:46,300
Should I take him?

91
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:48,175
Hold your fire.

92
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:50,758
They've got kids in there.

93
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:54,342
Yeah,
he's not bluffing, chief.

94
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:56,842
St. Brigid's had
a school trip today.

95
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,633
Quiet! Shut up!

96
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:30,092
Down with the modern world.

97
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,842
Back to the Dark Ages.

98
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:38,300
Quiet!

99
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:42,967
I said
shut your fucking mouth.

100
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,675
Who are you?

101
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,842
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

102
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:04,425
Now, who are you?

103
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:07,592
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists

104
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:09,383
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe

105
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,925
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?

106
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,550
We have no demands.

107
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,425
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.

108
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,967
While you do what?

109
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,175
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.

110
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:24,800
In a few minutes,
four city blocks...

111
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:29,050
...while the world watches.

112
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:09,925
No!

113
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,967
Like lambs
to the slaughter.

114
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:02,675
I don't believe it.

115
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:03,883
Believe it.

116
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,342
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?

117
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:44,550
Good. It's okay.

118
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:46,925
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.

119
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:48,300
It's all good.

120
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:50,300
It's over now.
Are you okay?

121
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:52,675
You okay? Good.

122
00:24:58,217 --> 00:24:59,633
Are you okay, princess?

123
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,883
Can I be like you someday?

124
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:09,675
You can be anything
you want to be.

125
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:13,925
Come on. Let's go.

126
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:57,925
Any changes today?

127
00:25:58,008 --> 00:25:59,592
No, my Queen.

128
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,133
The Mother Box has awoken,

129
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:06,133
yet nothing has happened.

130
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:08,425
It has slept
for thousands of years

131
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:10,550
since the First Age.

132
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:12,092
Why did it wake at all?

133
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:21,758
This is the first time
it's gone quiet

134
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:23,092
since the crack appeared.

135
00:26:23,175 --> 00:26:26,008
Maybe it's going
back to sleep.

136
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:31,842
Evil does not sleep.

137
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,633
It waits.

138
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:38,092
Something is coming.

139
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:44,675
Prepare for battle!

140
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,967
Amazons,
on your marks!

141
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,425
Ready!

142
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,633
Defenders.

143
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:47,883
They have failed
100,000 worlds.

144
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,550
They always fail.

145
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:56,133
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.

146
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:59,258
I will bathe in your fear.

147
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:03,258
Daughters of Themyscira,

148
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:06,092
show him your fear!

149
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:08,717
We have no fear!

150
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:29,633
Gather the legions!

151
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:31,675
Go with her!

152
00:28:31,758 --> 00:28:33,175
You must seal the cage!

153
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:35,592
- Go!
- Phillipus!

154
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:03,425
No!

155
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,133
Behind you!

156
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,425
Ahhh!

157
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,717
Epione.

158
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,675
Honor us. It's right.

159
00:29:32,592 --> 00:29:33,967
Seal it.

160
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:41,675
Ready the hammers!

161
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,175
Seal it now!

162
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:32,092
Guard it with your life.

163
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,050
- Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.

164
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,675
Hyah! Hyah!

165
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Hyah!

166
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:21,842
Got it! Go!

167
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:24,217
Hyah!

168
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:48,925
Oh, noble Queen.
Why do you fight?

169
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,633
You can't save her.

170
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,383
You can't save any of them.

171
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:03,758
The great darkness begins.

172
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:05,717
Amazons!

173
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:18,633
Yes, we will find the others.

174
00:35:20,342 --> 00:35:23,008
Draw!

175
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:26,550
Loose!

176
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:26,342
He's gone back
to his universe.

177
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:27,550
No.

178
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:32,383
He's gone to the lands of men

179
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:35,675
to find the other two boxes.

180
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:38,883
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

181
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:42,550
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

182
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,342
Men won't know what it means.

183
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:46,633
Men won't.

184
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,800
She will.

185
00:37:20,383 --> 00:37:23,092
It's toxic.

186
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:25,008
That's good.

187
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:47,008
Go!

188
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:49,258
Follow the scent
of the Mother Boxes.

189
00:37:49,342 --> 00:37:50,842
Find the missing two.

190
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:54,925
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.

191
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:58,008
This world
will join the others.

192
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:01,800
He will be pleased.

193
00:38:01,883 --> 00:38:05,008
He will see my worth again.

194
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,300
Hey.

195
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:12,133
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?

196
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:13,800
Possibly.

197
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:16,633
"Possibly."

198
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:19,300
If I had a dollar
for every "possibly."

199
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:22,300
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

200
00:38:25,008 --> 00:38:27,883
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,

201
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:30,258
our disappearing man.

202
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:35,175
One Mr. Barry Allen
from Central City.

203
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:36,633
Might be
another false positive,

204
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:38,175
you'll have to give me
a little time

205
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:40,758
- to confirm.
- We don't have any more time.

206
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:44,008
Master Wayne,

207
00:38:44,092 --> 00:38:46,592
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

208
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:47,800
to build this team

209
00:38:47,883 --> 00:38:49,675
of people you can't even find.

210
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:52,133
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.

211
00:38:52,217 --> 00:38:54,217
Just because Lex Luthor says

212
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,175
the planet's
in danger of attack?

213
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:58,425
This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.

214
00:38:58,508 --> 00:38:59,842
It has to do with him.

215
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:04,008
I made a promise to him
on his grave.

216
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,258
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

217
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:10,842
I need to bring us together
and make this right.

218
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:13,675
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

219
00:39:13,758 --> 00:39:18,092
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

220
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:21,675
Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.

221
00:39:21,758 --> 00:39:23,550
Maybe they're already here.

222
00:39:27,342 --> 00:39:29,300
Keep looking.
What else do you have?

223
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,842
Lab's all yours, Howard.

224
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:11,550
11:30.

225
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:13,092
Early night for you, Silas.

226
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:15,800
Yes, early night.

227
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,175
Tell your family I said hello.

228
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,133
What the...

229
00:40:58,008 --> 00:40:59,133
Jesus.

230
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,092
The Arrow of Artemis.

231
00:42:15,175 --> 00:42:17,883
It will reach
the lands of men.

232
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:28,842
Sky torch,

233
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:30,550
hero beacon,

234
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:32,300
scatter the darkness.

235
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,883
Burn as you burned
in days before.

236
00:42:37,175 --> 00:42:41,133
Show her the darkness before
the daylight of history.

237
00:42:41,217 --> 00:42:45,008
Warn my daughter
that war has come

238
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,092
and protect her.

239
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:15,133
Return to me, Diana.

240
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:56,467
<i>What did you do
this weekend, Diana?</i>

241
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,800
Nothing very interesting.

242
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:01,425
That's all you ever tell us.

243
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:05,008
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.

244
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:09,300
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.

245
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:14,633
Again?

246
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:16,925
- What is it?
- Now what?

247
00:44:17,008 --> 00:44:20,217
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

248
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,967
Now add to the list "arson."

249
00:44:24,592 --> 00:44:26,342
<i>Yes, good morning</i>

250
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:28,050
<i>From the isle of Crete.</i>

251
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:29,550
<i>As you can see behind me,</i>

252
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,008
<i>an enormous bonfire
is burning.</i>

253
00:44:32,092 --> 00:44:34,383
<i>This fire has been burning
through the night.</i>

254
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:35,842
<i>We're now into the morning</i>

255
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:38,217
<i>and we are
at least five miles away.</i>

256
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,675
<i>And we can still
see it burning as we speak.</i>

257
00:44:41,758 --> 00:44:45,050
<i>This has baffled locals and
government authorities alike</i>

258
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:46,967
<i>here at this historical site</i>

259
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,550
<i>of the so-called shrine
of the Amazons.</i>

260
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:51,550
<i>Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to</i>

261
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,925
- <i>what may have caused this.</i>
- Invasion.

262
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:04,008
Ryan.

263
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:05,508
- Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...

264
00:45:05,592 --> 00:45:07,717
No damage
to the electron-laser.

265
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,883
- Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
- Yeah.

266
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:11,842
- Ryan Choi?
- That's us.

267
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:14,300
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?

268
00:45:14,383 --> 00:45:15,967
They took
whatever was in here.

269
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,925
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?

270
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,800
No. That was misplaced
a while ago.

271
00:45:22,883 --> 00:45:26,800
Object 6-1-9-8-2. Department
of Defense Archives.

272
00:45:26,883 --> 00:45:29,175
- Mmm-hmm.
- What was it?

273
00:45:29,258 --> 00:45:30,217
I don't know.

274
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,675
You don't know?

275
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:33,717
I don't know, which was why
I was studying it.

276
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,550
What's your rank, Doctor?

277
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:37,800
Ryan, would you, uh,
do the honors?

278
00:45:37,883 --> 00:45:39,467
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.

279
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,050
Civilian. STARLABS
is a private contractor.

280
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:43,300
We work for the DoD.

281
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:46,342
We advise them
on xeno-science.

282
00:45:46,425 --> 00:45:48,008
"Xeno-science"?

283
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:50,050
Alien technology.

284
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,217
For example,

285
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,967
the Superman ship.

286
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,425
Eight people

287
00:46:10,508 --> 00:46:12,300
never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.

288
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:13,592
Cleaning staff, guards,

289
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:15,758
a few of
your research scientists.

290
00:46:15,842 --> 00:46:16,967
They were abducted.

291
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:19,300
Are you sure?

292
00:46:19,383 --> 00:46:21,842
Witness saw it all.
He escaped.

293
00:46:21,925 --> 00:46:25,342
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.

294
00:46:28,092 --> 00:46:32,717
Any idea who
or what that might be?

295
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:54,842
The box
isn't safe here.

296
00:46:57,258 --> 00:46:58,717
Victor,

297
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,092
they came looking for it
at the lab.

298
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:05,883
People were taken by some kind
of monster or something.

299
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,550
You know a lot about monsters,

300
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:12,675
don't you?

301
00:47:18,883 --> 00:47:21,675
Especially how to make 'em.

302
00:50:21,592 --> 00:50:25,383
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

303
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:30,300
My hull is breached.
I'm going down.

304
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:37,508
Mayday!

305
00:50:37,592 --> 00:50:39,800
Is there anybody out there?

306
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:46,258
Ahh!

307
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:21,383
Whiskey.

308
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:33,133
Tell him to respect
the storm next time.

309
00:51:42,217 --> 00:51:43,342
It's on him.

310
00:54:11,383 --> 00:54:13,467
King who would be man.

311
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,967
Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.

312
00:54:17,717 --> 00:54:19,425
All the time I've wasted

313
00:54:19,508 --> 00:54:22,842
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.

314
00:54:24,717 --> 00:54:26,133
Are you finished,
old man?

315
00:54:26,217 --> 00:54:28,675
You never sleep
in the same place twice,

316
00:54:28,758 --> 00:54:31,675
yet you keep coming back here.

317
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:35,550
I like it. It's quiet.

318
00:54:35,633 --> 00:54:37,425
It's your inheritance.

319
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:39,842
You're the rightful king
of Atlantis.

320
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:42,092
Our people suffer.

321
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,092
Your people.

322
00:54:44,175 --> 00:54:47,842
A brutal, petty,
superstitious race.

323
00:54:47,925 --> 00:54:50,133
Is the surface any different?

324
00:54:50,217 --> 00:54:52,508
Nobody calls me
King of the Surface.

325
00:54:53,425 --> 00:54:55,550
What do you want, Vulko?

326
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:57,050
Guards near
the stronghold

327
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:58,675
have been disappearing.

328
00:54:58,758 --> 00:55:00,258
Snatchers from above.

329
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:01,550
Talk to King Orm.

330
00:55:01,633 --> 00:55:03,133
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.

331
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,675
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.

332
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:09,342
He lies.

333
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:11,675
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

334
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:14,175
They're looking for it.

335
00:55:14,258 --> 00:55:18,550
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.

336
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:21,175
Go to the stronghold
of Atlantis.

337
00:55:21,258 --> 00:55:22,842
Protect the box.

338
00:55:23,717 --> 00:55:25,050
The time has come.

339
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:29,175
Take up your mother's trident.

340
00:55:40,092 --> 00:55:44,092
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

341
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,925
Above or below.

342
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,717
DeSaad.

343
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,883
DeSaad! I call to thee.

344
00:56:31,675 --> 00:56:36,925
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?

345
00:56:37,008 --> 00:56:40,133
This world is divided.

346
00:56:40,217 --> 00:56:41,758
They are a primitive species.

347
00:56:41,842 --> 00:56:44,342
Unevolved and at war
with one another.

348
00:56:44,425 --> 00:56:47,258
Too separate to be one.

349
00:56:47,342 --> 00:56:49,758
Their free will
must be ripped from them,

350
00:56:49,842 --> 00:56:51,675
like the other worlds.

351
00:56:51,758 --> 00:56:56,092
Given absolution
in one glorious belief,

352
00:56:56,175 --> 00:56:58,050
to serve him.

353
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:01,092
The Mother Boxes?

354
00:57:01,175 --> 00:57:04,092
I have found one of the three.

355
00:57:04,175 --> 00:57:06,758
The one that woke
and called to me.

356
00:57:06,842 --> 00:57:08,383
The other two still sleep,

357
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:12,550
but the parademons
feel their presence.

358
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:14,050
They fly,

359
00:57:14,133 --> 00:57:17,717
they search, they take
prisoners who carry the scent,

360
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,967
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

361
00:57:23,467 --> 00:57:25,425
Yes.

362
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:30,258
Mighty Steppenwolf,

363
00:57:30,342 --> 00:57:35,050
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.

364
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,550
But undone by his self-pride.

365
00:57:42,675 --> 00:57:44,133
DeSaad...

366
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:48,092
I fall before you.

367
00:57:48,175 --> 00:57:50,092
Let me make a plea to him

368
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,050
that I may come home

369
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:55,133
after I take this world
in his name.

370
00:57:55,217 --> 00:57:57,758
You betrayed him.

371
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,633
Your own family.

372
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:02,842
I saw my mistake.

373
00:58:02,925 --> 00:58:05,592
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

374
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:11,050
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

375
00:58:12,008 --> 00:58:14,217
He will hear your plea

376
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,675
when you pay your debt.

377
00:58:19,425 --> 00:58:22,717
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.

378
00:58:23,508 --> 00:58:25,675
No protectors here.

379
00:58:25,758 --> 00:58:29,175
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

380
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:33,175
This world will fall,
like all the others.

381
00:58:34,092 --> 00:58:35,967
For Darkseid.

382
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,383
For Darkseid.

383
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:04,425
You know,
I paid millions of dollars

384
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:06,092
for this building's security.

385
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,883
You got
your money's worth.

386
00:59:07,967 --> 00:59:10,592
Took me almost a minute
to disable it.

387
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,425
Hi there.

388
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:16,133
A new toy?

389
00:59:16,883 --> 00:59:19,175
Prototype troop carrier.

390
00:59:20,717 --> 00:59:22,217
I once knew a man

391
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,883
who would have loved
to fly it.

392
00:59:24,967 --> 00:59:26,800
The best minds
at Wayne Aerospace

393
00:59:26,883 --> 00:59:28,133
couldn't make it fly.

394
00:59:29,092 --> 00:59:30,758
But you can?

395
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:32,467
I have no choice.

396
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,383
I need more range
and I need more cargo.

397
00:59:35,467 --> 00:59:37,508
I think
there's an attack coming.

398
00:59:37,592 --> 00:59:39,467
Not coming, Bruce.

399
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:42,800
It's already here.

400
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:44,675
From what I've learned,

401
00:59:44,758 --> 00:59:47,508
they are things
from another universe.

402
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:50,050
They serve a dark power.

403
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:51,883
An old power.

404
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:53,300
What do they want?

405
00:59:53,383 --> 00:59:57,508
To invade.
To conquer.

406
00:59:57,592 --> 01:00:02,050
They came here once before,
long ago.

407
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:09,467
<i>A great armada
appeared in the sky,</i>

408
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:12,133
<i>laying waste
to all who opposed it.</i>

409
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:16,425
<i>The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.</i>

410
01:00:16,508 --> 01:00:21,550
<i>A name cursed and feared
in every universe.</i>

411
01:00:21,633 --> 01:00:25,758
<i>Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.</i>

412
01:00:25,842 --> 01:00:28,675
<i>The old gods, men...</i>

413
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:32,175
<i>Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea...</i>

414
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:38,383
<i>Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement</i>

415
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:40,883
<i>and guardians from the stars.</i>

416
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:42,967
<i>Their histories
had taught them</i>

417
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,675
<i>not to trust each other,</i>

418
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:47,092
<i>not to hope for an alliance.</i>

419
01:00:47,175 --> 01:00:49,300
<i>To fight apart.</i>

420
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:40,967
<i>As Darkseid
waged war on Earth,</i>

421
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:42,425
<i>he found a secret there.</i>

422
01:01:42,508 --> 01:01:46,467
<i>A power hidden
in the infinity of space.</i>

423
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,050
<i>He called forth mystics</i>

424
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:51,467
<i>who worshipped and controlled
three objects...</i>

425
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:52,883
<i>the Mother Boxes.</i>

426
01:01:52,967 --> 01:01:54,467
Wait, wait, wait.

427
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:55,550
"Mother Boxes"?

428
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:58,717
Indestructible
living machines,

429
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,592
<i>made from a science
so advanced,</i>

430
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:03,758
<i>it looks like sorcery.</i>

431
01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:06,633
<i>To conquer, three boxes
have to synchronize</i>

432
01:02:06,717 --> 01:02:10,008
<i>and join together
into The Unity.</i>

433
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:13,175
<i>The Unity cleanses
a planet with fire,</i>

434
01:02:13,258 --> 01:02:16,967
<i>transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.</i>

435
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:20,717
<i>All who live
become servants of Darkseid.</i>

436
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,883
<i>Alive but drained of life.</i>

437
01:02:23,967 --> 01:02:25,383
<i>Parademons.</i>

438
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,758
Amazons!

439
01:02:34,592 --> 01:02:36,300
With me!

440
01:03:05,342 --> 01:03:08,008
<i>But before The Unity
could synchronize,</i>

441
01:03:08,092 --> 01:03:10,217
<i>the defenders of Earth
attacked</i>

442
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,050
<i>and fought as one.</i>

443
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:15,258
<i>Amazons alongside Atlanteans.</i>

444
01:03:15,342 --> 01:03:16,967
<i>Zeus and his son Ares</i>

445
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:20,633
<i>alongside the guardians
from the sky.</i>

446
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:23,967
<i>A golden Age of Heroes
fighting together</i>

447
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,675
<i>to defend life on Earth.</i>

448
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:24,925
<i>They did what no world
had ever done.</i>

449
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:27,383
<i>Sent the enemies
back into the stars.</i>

450
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:33,467
<i>The three Mother Boxes
never synchronized.</i>

451
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,925
<i>The Unity never came to pass.</i>

452
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:39,633
<i>But, in their retreat,</i>

453
01:05:39,717 --> 01:05:42,925
<i>the boxes were left behind
on Earth.</i>

454
01:05:43,008 --> 01:05:47,008
<i>They grew weak.
Dogs without masters</i>

455
01:05:48,675 --> 01:05:50,342
<i>falling asleep,</i>

456
01:05:50,425 --> 01:05:52,842
<i>awaiting their return.</i>

457
01:05:52,925 --> 01:05:55,342
<i>Fading from the view
of the enemy,</i>

458
01:05:55,425 --> 01:05:58,925
<i>anonymous
among a trillion worlds.</i>

459
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:19,050
<i>The defenders of Earth
made a vow.</i>

460
01:06:19,133 --> 01:06:22,467
<i>Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.</i>

461
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,300
<i>Each would enshrine and guard</i>

462
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,383
<i>one of the three
sleeping Mother Boxes</i>

463
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:30,133
<i>according to the rites
and rituals of their culture</i>

464
01:06:30,217 --> 01:06:32,967
<i>in case a box
should ever wake again</i>

465
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,800
<i>to call out
to the planet Apokolips</i>

466
01:06:34,883 --> 01:06:36,633
<i>to return and conquer</i>

467
01:06:36,717 --> 01:06:40,842
<i>the only world
Darkseid had ever lost.</i>

468
01:07:56,508 --> 01:07:59,800
Something woke the box
my people guard.

469
01:07:59,883 --> 01:08:02,050
It called out
to the dark place...

470
01:08:02,133 --> 01:08:04,758
to one of Darkseid's
conquerors.

471
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,842
The enemy is here.

472
01:08:07,925 --> 01:08:09,592
If he's here, where is he?

473
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:11,800
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.

474
01:08:11,883 --> 01:08:14,925
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.

475
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:19,467
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.

476
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:22,675
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.

477
01:08:22,758 --> 01:08:24,258
No, it will.

478
01:08:24,342 --> 01:08:26,175
It has to.

479
01:08:27,675 --> 01:08:31,425
The others.
Where are they?

480
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:54,342
Am I late?

481
01:08:54,425 --> 01:08:56,883
No, I'm so late.
I'm very late.

482
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:58,633
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

483
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:00,467
Oh. No.

484
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:03,508
Okay, bye. Okay.

485
01:09:03,592 --> 01:09:05,967
I'm so sorry.

486
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,383
I'm late.

487
01:09:12,675 --> 01:09:14,133
- Are you, uh...
- I'm...

488
01:09:14,217 --> 01:09:16,133
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.

489
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:17,842
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.

490
01:09:17,925 --> 01:09:19,175
Essentially,
the bus didn't come,

491
01:09:19,258 --> 01:09:20,383
then the bus did come,

492
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:21,508
but then there was
this old woman

493
01:09:21,592 --> 01:09:22,800
counting change for the fare,

494
01:09:22,883 --> 01:09:24,300
like, nickel, penny,
nickel, penny.

495
01:09:24,383 --> 01:09:25,967
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.

496
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:27,383
She's 107 years old,

497
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,008
these are some of her
last few moments of life.

498
01:09:29,092 --> 01:09:30,508
Resume.

499
01:09:30,592 --> 01:09:31,633
Resume.

500
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:36,717
Come on.

501
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,342
Come on.

502
01:09:40,425 --> 01:09:41,967
From the French, of course.

503
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:45,342
<i>"Resume,"</i> I believe,
is a past participle of...

504
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:52,383
Uh, wow. That's no good.

505
01:09:52,467 --> 01:09:54,175
It's like, what lives
in my pocket, right?

506
01:09:54,258 --> 01:09:57,050
"Paper monster hungry."
Uh...

507
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:07,883
Come on. Supposed to be
friends now.

508
01:10:14,092 --> 01:10:15,550
Yes.

509
01:10:24,217 --> 01:10:26,717
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.

510
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,133
You said you had experience

511
01:10:28,217 --> 01:10:29,342
walking dogs.

512
01:13:09,633 --> 01:13:11,717
Oh, gosh,
I hope everyone's okay.

513
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,508
See, in times of crisis,
for dog work,

514
01:13:14,592 --> 01:13:16,633
I always bring a meat snack.

515
01:13:16,717 --> 01:13:18,467
'Cause it makes them
feel calm.

516
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:20,300
'Cause you never know what's
going to happen in this city.

517
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:22,008
I mean, oh, my gosh.

518
01:13:22,092 --> 01:13:24,800
Right? I start on Monday?

519
01:14:02,883 --> 01:14:05,758
You have been
near a Mother Box.

520
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,383
The scent is on you.

521
01:14:09,467 --> 01:14:10,883
Where is it?

522
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:14,633
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.

523
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:31,258
Our people have guarded
the Mother Box

524
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,592
for thousands of years.

525
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:41,383
I will never betray
my own people.

526
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,383
You already have.

527
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:58,383
<i>This was taken in
the deepest trench on Earth.</i>

528
01:15:58,467 --> 01:16:00,633
He must be an Atlantean.

529
01:16:00,717 --> 01:16:02,092
A water-breather.

530
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,717
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.

531
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,675
Mixed-blood, then.

532
01:16:05,758 --> 01:16:07,758
He said he'll fight with us?

533
01:16:07,842 --> 01:16:09,300
More or less.

534
01:16:10,508 --> 01:16:12,925
More more or more less?

535
01:16:13,008 --> 01:16:14,050
Probably more less.

536
01:16:14,133 --> 01:16:16,258
- He said no?
- He said no.

537
01:16:16,342 --> 01:16:18,883
Atlanteans
can be tricky.

538
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:21,925
My people went to war
with them once.

539
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:24,925
I'm not sure we can trust him.

540
01:16:25,008 --> 01:16:26,258
Diana,
if we're gonna do this,

541
01:16:26,342 --> 01:16:27,425
you're gonna need to be open

542
01:16:27,508 --> 01:16:28,883
to more things
that we didn't...

543
01:16:28,967 --> 01:16:30,092
you know...

544
01:16:30,175 --> 01:16:31,592
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.

545
01:16:31,675 --> 01:16:32,883
Don't worry about it.

546
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,217
- Let's...
- It happens.

547
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:35,842
so...

548
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,508
This is the
third person.

549
01:16:37,592 --> 01:16:40,175
Disappears for 1/30
of a second here.

550
01:16:40,258 --> 01:16:41,842
One frame of video, see?

551
01:16:41,925 --> 01:16:44,592
Barry Allen. Central City.

552
01:16:44,675 --> 01:16:45,633
Go to him.

553
01:16:45,717 --> 01:16:47,425
I'll work on number four.

554
01:16:47,508 --> 01:16:50,675
Organic and biomechatronic
body parts.

555
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,425
He's a cyborg.

556
01:17:14,383 --> 01:17:16,550
- Ready!
- Break!

557
01:17:31,925 --> 01:17:33,258
Three...

558
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:34,967
eighty...

559
01:17:35,925 --> 01:17:38,133
set... go!

560
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:53,508
<i>Your son may be captain
of the football team</i>

561
01:17:53,592 --> 01:17:56,842
and a certified genius,
Mrs. Stone...

562
01:17:56,925 --> 01:17:59,050
Dr. Stone.

563
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:03,508
...but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system

564
01:18:03,592 --> 01:18:06,175
to change his friend's grades.

565
01:18:06,258 --> 01:18:10,175
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.

566
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:12,925
How could that child
pass her classes?

567
01:18:14,217 --> 01:18:17,467
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.

568
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:19,717
What did you do to help her?

569
01:19:43,675 --> 01:19:46,800
- Your father...
- Mom, Mom, don't.

570
01:19:48,133 --> 01:19:51,092
He got held up at the lab.

571
01:19:51,175 --> 01:19:54,383
Okay. He always does.

572
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,300
He wanted to be here.

573
01:19:58,383 --> 01:20:00,217
You always say that.

574
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,967
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.

575
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:04,967
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.

576
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,842
He just has difficulty
showing it, but...

577
01:20:08,925 --> 01:20:11,217
I know he's proud of you.

578
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,883
We both are, Victor.

579
01:20:13,967 --> 01:20:17,092
Hey, hey, hey.

580
01:20:17,175 --> 01:20:20,300
With everything I know
you can do today,

581
01:20:20,383 --> 01:20:23,133
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

582
01:20:28,508 --> 01:20:30,425
<i>Dr. Stone,
I'm sorry,</i>

583
01:20:31,383 --> 01:20:33,342
your wife didn't survive.

584
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,133
I'm afraid
your son won't either.

585
01:20:51,092 --> 01:20:52,925
I won't let you die.

586
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,467
I won't allow it.

587
01:21:03,633 --> 01:21:05,508
I won't allow it.

588
01:21:08,883 --> 01:21:09,967
Victor.

589
01:21:11,092 --> 01:21:14,592
Victor, you're not
stuck in here.

590
01:21:14,675 --> 01:21:17,967
You still have a life
ahead of you.

591
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:21,633
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

592
01:21:24,133 --> 01:21:25,842
If you were there,

593
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:29,092
Mom would still be alive.

594
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,800
All right, look,

595
01:21:34,967 --> 01:21:37,467
you don't have to give me
a second chance,

596
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:39,258
but give yourself one.

597
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:44,342
If you can't stand
looking at me,

598
01:21:45,925 --> 01:21:47,675
try listening.

599
01:22:16,133 --> 01:22:18,800
<i>What you can do now, Victor.</i>

600
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:22,717
<i>Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

601
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,508
<i>The tip of the tip.</i>

602
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,508
<i>In the world
of ones and zeroes,</i>

603
01:22:57,592 --> 01:23:00,342
<i>you are the absolute master.</i>

604
01:23:00,425 --> 01:23:03,092
<i>No firewall can stop you.</i>

605
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:05,550
<i>No encryption can defy you.</i>

606
01:23:05,633 --> 01:23:08,342
<i>We're all at your mercy, Vic.</i>

607
01:23:08,425 --> 01:23:10,967
<i>From our power grids
to our telecommunications,</i>

608
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:13,133
<i>everyone's lives
are controlled</i>

609
01:23:13,217 --> 01:23:16,258
<i>and dominated
by complex digital networks</i>

610
01:23:16,342 --> 01:23:20,717
<i>that will bend
without effort to your will.</i>

611
01:23:30,925 --> 01:23:32,467
<i>The fate of the world</i>

612
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,592
<i>will literally
rest in your hands.</i>

613
01:23:43,175 --> 01:23:45,300
<i>Its entire nuclear arsenal,</i>

614
01:23:45,383 --> 01:23:48,425
<i>you could launch
with a thought.</i>

615
01:23:59,008 --> 01:24:00,508
<i>The world's monetary systems</i>

616
01:24:00,592 --> 01:24:02,175
<i>and its complex interactions</i>

617
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:05,217
<i>will seem as easy
to manipulate for you</i>

618
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,050
<i>as a child's plaything.</i>

619
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,842
<i>The question...
No, the challenge</i>

620
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:48,758
<i>won't be doing it.</i>

621
01:24:48,842 --> 01:24:50,883
<i>It will be not doing.</i>

622
01:24:50,967 --> 01:24:53,092
<i>Not seeing.</i>

623
01:24:54,842 --> 01:24:57,175
<i>It is the burden
of this responsibility</i>

624
01:24:57,258 --> 01:25:00,883
<i>that will define you
and who you choose to be.</i>

625
01:25:32,342 --> 01:25:33,467
<i>Now, make a wish.</i>

626
01:25:34,717 --> 01:25:36,550
<i>One more time.</i>

627
01:25:36,633 --> 01:25:39,133
<i>Good job. Wave to Grandma!</i>

628
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:40,550
<i>Hi, Grandma!</i>

629
01:26:40,592 --> 01:26:41,842
What?

630
01:26:43,675 --> 01:26:45,550
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

631
01:26:46,675 --> 01:26:48,092
Oh, my God.

632
01:26:48,175 --> 01:26:50,092
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

633
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:58,050
<i>Victor...</i>

634
01:26:58,133 --> 01:27:02,633
<i>Victor, these are the words
and deductions of a scientist.</i>

635
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:05,175
<i>That's how I've been
speaking to you.</i>

636
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,675
<i>Now,</i>

637
01:27:08,758 --> 01:27:13,258
<i>let me speak to
you from my heart, not as a scientist,</i>

638
01:27:13,342 --> 01:27:14,675
<i>as a father.</i>

639
01:27:28,883 --> 01:27:30,133
Hey.

640
01:27:31,342 --> 01:27:33,050
Hey, you!

641
01:27:48,633 --> 01:27:52,133
<i>Because you are
holding yourself back.</i>

642
01:27:52,217 --> 01:27:55,300
You're going in circles, man.

643
01:27:55,383 --> 01:27:57,758
Holding down
three dead-end jobs,

644
01:27:57,842 --> 01:27:58,925
going on four.

645
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:00,508
Where do you
even find the time?

646
01:28:00,592 --> 01:28:01,800
I make the time.

647
01:28:01,883 --> 01:28:03,258
- I just need one more gig...
- Barry.

648
01:28:03,342 --> 01:28:04,258
...then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.

649
01:28:04,342 --> 01:28:05,425
You can't.

650
01:28:05,508 --> 01:28:06,800
Like I always said
I would.

651
01:28:06,883 --> 01:28:08,425
You cannot keep
doing this to yourself.

652
01:28:08,508 --> 01:28:10,092
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

653
01:28:10,175 --> 01:28:11,508
- Please, we have 10 minutes.
- And this is all to pay

654
01:28:11,592 --> 01:28:12,800
for a criminal justice degree,
huh?

655
01:28:12,883 --> 01:28:13,967
Yeah.

656
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:15,300
For what?

657
01:28:15,383 --> 01:28:18,342
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,

658
01:28:18,425 --> 01:28:19,967
who's still in prison
for the murder

659
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:21,633
of my mother,
which he didn't commit.

660
01:28:21,717 --> 01:28:23,592
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

661
01:28:23,675 --> 01:28:25,342
I can't remember.

662
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:26,592
Oh, boy.

663
01:28:26,675 --> 01:28:29,133
This path has clearly
chosen me, Dad.

664
01:28:29,967 --> 01:28:31,217
Give me your hand, man.

665
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:39,800
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.

666
01:28:39,883 --> 01:28:43,717
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

667
01:28:49,425 --> 01:28:51,550
I want you
to give all that up.

668
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:57,592
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

669
01:28:59,842 --> 01:29:03,008
I am a drag on your life.

670
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:10,133
Okay. Um...

671
01:29:10,217 --> 01:29:13,842
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

672
01:29:13,925 --> 01:29:15,133
Please.

673
01:29:15,217 --> 01:29:16,758
Hey, you know what
criminal justice

674
01:29:16,842 --> 01:29:18,467
would be for me?

675
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:23,467
My son not wasting his life.

676
01:29:24,717 --> 01:29:26,508
You can be
whatever you wanna be.

677
01:29:26,592 --> 01:29:28,092
You're brilliant, man.

678
01:29:30,425 --> 01:29:33,425
Absolute best of the best.

679
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:39,967
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

680
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,842
for some old dude

681
01:29:41,925 --> 01:29:45,050
who's not going anywhere.

682
01:29:45,133 --> 01:29:46,717
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

683
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,008
That's not true.

684
01:29:48,092 --> 01:29:49,467
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

685
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,217
I want you
to make your own future.

686
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,175
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

687
01:29:53,258 --> 01:29:54,842
Open gate.

688
01:29:54,925 --> 01:29:56,258
Great.

689
01:29:59,883 --> 01:30:02,175
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

690
01:30:02,258 --> 01:30:03,925
Clear.
Close the gate.

691
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:59,967
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

692
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:01,633
You said that like it explains

693
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:03,967
why there's a total stranger
in my place

694
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:07,133
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

695
01:31:09,092 --> 01:31:11,050
Tell me about this.

696
01:31:14,883 --> 01:31:17,800
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

697
01:31:17,883 --> 01:31:20,758
but who is definitely not me.

698
01:31:21,717 --> 01:31:23,675
Somebody... I don't know.

699
01:31:23,758 --> 01:31:25,633
Hippie, long hair.

700
01:31:25,717 --> 01:31:28,675
Very attractive Jewish boy.

701
01:31:29,967 --> 01:31:32,717
Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.

702
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,383
I know you have abilities.

703
01:31:34,467 --> 01:31:36,717
I just don't know
what they are.

704
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,800
My special skills

705
01:31:37,883 --> 01:31:40,633
include viola, web design,

706
01:31:40,717 --> 01:31:43,675
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

707
01:31:43,758 --> 01:31:47,425
Silica-based
sand quartz fabric.

708
01:31:47,508 --> 01:31:49,675
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.

709
01:31:49,758 --> 01:31:51,675
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

710
01:31:51,758 --> 01:31:53,675
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

711
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,467
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

712
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:58,258
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

713
01:31:59,425 --> 01:32:01,425
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

714
01:32:01,508 --> 01:32:03,717
but whoever
you're looking for,

715
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:04,925
it's not me.

716
01:32:46,633 --> 01:32:48,550
You're the Batman?

717
01:32:48,633 --> 01:32:51,467
So, you're fast.

718
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:53,217
That feels
like an oversimplification.

719
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,133
I'm putting together a team.

720
01:32:55,217 --> 01:32:57,342
People with special abilities.

721
01:32:57,425 --> 01:32:59,092
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

722
01:32:59,175 --> 01:33:01,383
Stop right there. I'm in.

723
01:33:02,383 --> 01:33:03,717
You are?

724
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,967
Just like that?

725
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:06,300
Yeah.

726
01:33:08,133 --> 01:33:10,633
I need friends.

727
01:33:10,717 --> 01:33:14,133
Great. Great.

728
01:33:14,217 --> 01:33:16,342
Can I keep this?

729
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:18,300
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

730
01:33:18,383 --> 01:33:20,217
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

731
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,717
I call it the Speed Force.

732
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,550
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

733
01:33:23,633 --> 01:33:26,425
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

734
01:33:26,508 --> 01:33:28,925
I am a snack hole.

735
01:33:29,008 --> 01:33:32,050
How many people are
on this special fight team?

736
01:33:32,133 --> 01:33:34,217
- Three, including you.
- Three?

737
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:36,925
Against what?

738
01:33:37,008 --> 01:33:38,633
I'll tell you on the plane.

739
01:33:39,175 --> 01:33:40,800
Plane?

740
01:33:40,883 --> 01:33:42,883
What are your
superpowers again?

741
01:33:42,967 --> 01:33:44,758
I'm rich.

742
01:34:07,633 --> 01:34:09,467
Oh, Miss Prince,
let me do that.

743
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:12,633
No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

744
01:34:12,717 --> 01:34:14,467
Would you like
to have some?

745
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:15,967
Uh, no, thank you.

746
01:34:17,133 --> 01:34:19,633
If you put the water in first.

747
01:34:19,717 --> 01:34:23,050
- Of course.
- So we don't scald the tea.

748
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,342
- Yes.
- Great.

749
01:34:27,425 --> 01:34:29,633
No, that's probably
enough tea.

750
01:34:29,717 --> 01:34:32,008
All right.

751
01:34:32,092 --> 01:34:33,633
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

752
01:34:33,717 --> 01:34:37,717
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

753
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,842
I will.
I will, definitely will.

754
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,258
Uh... What are you working on?

755
01:34:43,342 --> 01:34:45,008
It's a gauntlet

756
01:34:45,092 --> 01:34:49,008
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

757
01:34:49,092 --> 01:34:51,508
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.

758
01:34:51,592 --> 01:34:54,758
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.

759
01:34:56,258 --> 01:34:57,758
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

760
01:34:57,842 --> 01:34:59,258
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.

761
01:34:59,342 --> 01:35:00,550
Of course.

762
01:35:05,592 --> 01:35:07,300
Ah.

763
01:35:07,383 --> 01:35:10,508
Ah, now,
let's see how that did.

764
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,925
Ha! Yes.

765
01:35:13,008 --> 01:35:14,592
Not to be sneezed at.

766
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:17,300
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

767
01:35:17,383 --> 01:35:19,008
It's Master Wayne's idea.

768
01:35:19,092 --> 01:35:21,467
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

769
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:24,383
- In black, of course.
- Oh.

770
01:35:31,133 --> 01:35:34,300
All right. Victor Stone.

771
01:35:50,383 --> 01:35:52,842
Something is not working.

772
01:35:52,925 --> 01:35:54,675
Mmm.

773
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,758
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.

774
01:37:03,592 --> 01:37:06,842
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

775
01:37:06,925 --> 01:37:08,217
You know who I am.

776
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:10,633
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

777
01:37:10,717 --> 01:37:14,050
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

778
01:37:14,133 --> 01:37:15,300
The world does.

779
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:18,342
Fuck the world.

780
01:37:19,717 --> 01:37:22,342
You've obviously
been through a great deal.

781
01:37:23,425 --> 01:37:26,467
I can't begin to imagine what.

782
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:30,300
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

783
01:37:30,383 --> 01:37:32,008
Gifts?

784
01:37:32,092 --> 01:37:34,425
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

785
01:37:34,508 --> 01:37:36,258
We need you, Victor.

786
01:37:36,342 --> 01:37:38,008
And maybe you need us.

787
01:37:38,092 --> 01:37:39,925
I don't need anyone.

788
01:37:42,008 --> 01:37:43,133
Not anymore.

789
01:37:43,217 --> 01:37:45,842
I told myself the same
for a long time.

790
01:37:52,467 --> 01:37:55,383
I lost someone I loved once.

791
01:37:58,092 --> 01:38:03,050
I shut myself off
from everyone.

792
01:38:04,467 --> 01:38:07,425
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

793
01:38:09,883 --> 01:38:13,425
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

794
01:38:13,508 --> 01:38:17,550
And if you asked to meet me...

795
01:38:17,633 --> 01:38:20,508
you're working on it, too.

796
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:34,092
You were right
about the metal sample

797
01:39:34,175 --> 01:39:35,717
from the Superman ship.

798
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:39,425
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

799
01:39:39,508 --> 01:39:41,092
look what happens.

800
01:39:49,925 --> 01:39:51,800
3.5 million kelvin.

801
01:39:51,883 --> 01:39:55,092
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

802
01:39:55,175 --> 01:39:57,633
Hot, dense matter.

803
01:40:00,633 --> 01:40:03,633
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

804
01:40:03,717 --> 01:40:06,008
Exact words I said
to my prom date.

805
01:40:06,092 --> 01:40:07,675
She dumped me anyway.

806
01:40:07,758 --> 01:40:09,092
Yeah.

807
01:40:13,217 --> 01:40:14,300
Hey, Doc,

808
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:16,092
do you think
Batman is connected

809
01:40:16,175 --> 01:40:18,883
to the object
the CID is looking for?

810
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:23,092
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

811
01:40:24,175 --> 01:40:25,342
No...

812
01:40:26,258 --> 01:40:27,550
I don't.

813
01:41:02,258 --> 01:41:04,467
Oh, Victor.

814
01:41:21,425 --> 01:41:23,508
All right! Let's go!

815
01:41:24,633 --> 01:41:25,925
Commissioner Gordon?

816
01:41:26,008 --> 01:41:27,217
Come on!

817
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:28,508
Your messages.

818
01:41:28,592 --> 01:41:30,008
Hey, hey!

819
01:41:32,758 --> 01:41:35,383
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

820
01:41:35,467 --> 01:41:38,425
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged
community showed up.

821
01:41:38,508 --> 01:41:40,800
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

822
01:41:40,883 --> 01:41:42,925
You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.

823
01:41:43,008 --> 01:41:44,883
What's wrong
with dental school?

824
01:41:47,758 --> 01:41:50,925
"Attacked by
a flying vampire."

825
01:41:51,008 --> 01:41:54,092
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

826
01:41:54,175 --> 01:41:56,008
On a possibly related note,

827
01:41:56,092 --> 01:41:58,467
sketch of the suspect
in the abductions

828
01:41:58,550 --> 01:42:00,092
at the lab across the harbor.

829
01:42:00,175 --> 01:42:03,425
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.

830
01:42:03,508 --> 01:42:06,092
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

831
01:42:06,175 --> 01:42:09,175
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

832
01:42:10,050 --> 01:42:11,300
I'll talk to him tonight.

833
01:42:11,383 --> 01:42:12,967
How, Jim?

834
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:14,633
How do you think?

835
01:42:32,717 --> 01:42:34,175
Silas?

836
01:42:34,258 --> 01:42:35,550
Hey, hey.

837
01:42:35,633 --> 01:42:37,050
Hey, hey!

838
01:42:41,550 --> 01:42:43,967
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?

839
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:45,300
His name is Victor.

840
01:42:46,008 --> 01:42:48,925
We met, spoke.

841
01:42:49,758 --> 01:42:51,842
Give him time.

842
01:42:51,925 --> 01:42:53,842
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

843
01:42:53,925 --> 01:42:57,758
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

844
01:42:57,842 --> 01:43:00,258
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.

845
01:43:00,342 --> 01:43:01,592
Oh!

846
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:04,467
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

847
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:06,800
- Oh, sorry.
- That's your signal.

848
01:43:06,883 --> 01:43:08,342
That means we have to go now.

849
01:43:08,425 --> 01:43:12,217
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool.

850
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:11,050
Commander Mera,
I told the king

851
01:44:11,133 --> 01:44:12,967
the perimeter guards
were taken.

852
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:14,633
He won't send reinforcements.

853
01:44:14,717 --> 01:44:17,383
He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

854
01:44:17,467 --> 01:44:21,883
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.

855
01:44:21,967 --> 01:44:23,592
All right, take what men
we have left

856
01:44:23,675 --> 01:44:25,550
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.

857
01:46:05,383 --> 01:46:07,508
You can't escape.

858
01:46:08,175 --> 01:46:10,258
I'm not trying to.

859
01:48:12,592 --> 01:48:14,883
Vulko told me
you would come.

860
01:48:14,967 --> 01:48:17,883
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

861
01:48:20,467 --> 01:48:21,800
Wait.

862
01:48:23,758 --> 01:48:24,925
Please.

863
01:48:28,425 --> 01:48:29,883
I knew her.

864
01:48:31,967 --> 01:48:34,342
Well, that makes one of us.

865
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:36,217
My parents died in the wars.

866
01:48:38,008 --> 01:48:39,508
She took me in.

867
01:48:39,592 --> 01:48:41,342
What a saint.

868
01:48:41,425 --> 01:48:43,592
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

869
01:48:43,675 --> 01:48:46,467
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

870
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:48,175
and never gave me
another thought.

871
01:48:48,258 --> 01:48:51,508
Your mother left you
to save your life.

872
01:48:51,592 --> 01:48:54,300
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

873
01:48:55,758 --> 01:48:57,883
What it cost her.

874
01:48:58,925 --> 01:49:01,342
But you're not
a defenseless child now.

875
01:49:03,508 --> 01:49:05,175
It would have been
her responsibility

876
01:49:05,258 --> 01:49:08,675
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

877
01:49:09,217 --> 01:49:10,383
Now,

878
01:49:11,550 --> 01:49:13,008
it's yours.

879
01:50:17,258 --> 01:50:18,758
Yes.

880
01:50:41,592 --> 01:50:43,008
<i>Steppenwolf,</i>

881
01:50:43,092 --> 01:50:45,050
tell me what you've learned.

882
01:50:45,133 --> 01:50:47,800
Two boxes
found and awake.

883
01:50:47,883 --> 01:50:50,925
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

884
01:50:51,008 --> 01:50:54,175
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

885
01:50:54,258 --> 01:50:56,717
Where is the third Mother Box?

886
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,383
The parademons
sense its presence

887
01:50:59,467 --> 01:51:01,092
and search for the third.

888
01:51:01,175 --> 01:51:02,300
They have taken prisoners

889
01:51:02,383 --> 01:51:04,592
who carry its scent.

890
01:51:05,258 --> 01:51:06,967
Go.

891
01:51:07,050 --> 01:51:09,133
Interrogate the prisoners.

892
01:51:09,842 --> 01:51:11,842
Find the third.

893
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:15,550
They will tell me
what they know,

894
01:51:16,592 --> 01:51:19,300
or I will rip it from them.

895
01:52:02,467 --> 01:52:04,175
How many of you are there?

896
01:52:04,967 --> 01:52:06,175
Not enough.

897
01:52:07,967 --> 01:52:10,383
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

898
01:52:10,467 --> 01:52:11,758
Description
matches the suspect

899
01:52:11,842 --> 01:52:13,758
in the Metropolis abductions.

900
01:52:13,842 --> 01:52:14,967
Parademons.

901
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:16,967
Okay.

902
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:19,383
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

903
01:52:19,467 --> 01:52:20,883
At the lab.

904
01:52:20,967 --> 01:52:22,967
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

905
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:24,300
So the eight
may still be alive.

906
01:52:24,383 --> 01:52:25,342
Nine.

907
01:52:25,425 --> 01:52:27,217
Oh.

908
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:30,050
The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.

909
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:37,758
Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

910
01:52:37,842 --> 01:52:39,217
So, how do we find him?

911
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:40,925
There must be a nest nearby.

912
01:52:41,008 --> 01:52:45,258
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

913
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:47,508
No discernable pattern
I can see.

914
01:52:47,592 --> 01:52:49,133
The lines on the map
don't converge.

915
01:52:49,217 --> 01:52:50,508
On land.

916
01:52:50,592 --> 01:52:52,050
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

917
01:52:52,133 --> 01:52:53,300
between the two cities.

918
01:52:53,383 --> 01:52:54,508
These are air vents.

919
01:52:54,592 --> 01:52:56,092
They all lead
down to the tunnel

920
01:52:56,175 --> 01:52:58,342
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

921
01:52:58,425 --> 01:53:00,717
The nest could be there.

922
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,758
Uh,
is he coming with us now,

923
01:53:02,842 --> 01:53:04,758
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

924
01:53:04,842 --> 01:53:06,383
I have something bigger.

925
01:53:07,592 --> 01:53:10,300
Do you really think that...

926
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:14,133
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

927
01:53:14,217 --> 01:53:16,842
Oh. That's rude.

928
01:53:55,383 --> 01:53:57,550
We're close.

929
01:53:57,633 --> 01:53:59,800
The scent of the enemy.

930
01:54:00,425 --> 01:54:01,633
Of absence.

931
01:54:02,175 --> 01:54:03,758
Darkness.

932
01:54:04,425 --> 01:54:05,675
Death.

933
01:54:05,758 --> 01:54:07,050
Where are we, Alfred?

934
01:54:07,133 --> 01:54:08,175
<i>Stryker's Island.</i>

935
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:10,342
You should be directly under

936
01:54:10,425 --> 01:54:13,217
the venting tower
for the tunnel.

937
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:14,675
<i>Now look to your left,</i>

938
01:54:14,758 --> 01:54:16,675
<i>you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.</i>

939
01:54:16,758 --> 01:54:19,508
<i>Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.</i>

940
01:54:19,592 --> 01:54:20,925
That's it.

941
01:54:21,008 --> 01:54:22,342
Let's go.

942
01:54:36,217 --> 01:54:39,008
Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?

943
01:54:40,467 --> 01:54:41,717
Either of you?

944
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,758
Don't engage alone.

945
01:54:43,842 --> 01:54:45,217
We do this together.

946
01:54:54,092 --> 01:54:56,050
I heard about you.

947
01:54:57,633 --> 01:54:59,217
Didn't think you were real.

948
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:00,967
I'm real when it's useful.

949
01:55:10,967 --> 01:55:12,883
I grow tired of your silence.

950
01:55:12,967 --> 01:55:15,217
Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?

951
01:55:22,050 --> 01:55:24,342
Please. We have families.

952
01:55:24,425 --> 01:55:26,633
Then you have weakness.

953
01:55:26,717 --> 01:55:28,092
Steppenwolf.

954
01:55:28,175 --> 01:55:32,592
Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.

955
01:55:32,675 --> 01:55:34,008
Good guess.

956
01:55:34,092 --> 01:55:37,758
I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.

957
01:55:37,842 --> 01:55:40,008
Circle to the other side.

958
01:55:40,092 --> 01:55:42,342
We'll surround them
and surprise him.

959
01:55:46,675 --> 01:55:48,675
You have been
near a Mother Box.

960
01:55:48,758 --> 01:55:50,425
The scent is on you.

961
01:55:50,508 --> 01:55:52,092
I don't know
what you're talking about.

962
01:55:52,175 --> 01:55:54,175
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

963
01:55:54,258 --> 01:55:56,633
He... He doesn't know.

964
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:01,925
Wait, please, please!

965
01:56:07,425 --> 01:56:10,467
You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.

966
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:12,800
I will die before I tell you.

967
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:15,133
You'll die if you don't.

968
01:56:15,217 --> 01:56:16,300
No!

969
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:26,550
Victor.

970
01:56:26,633 --> 01:56:28,008
Kill them both.

971
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:33,925
Ah, Amazon.

972
01:56:34,008 --> 01:56:36,675
But not like your sisters.

973
01:56:36,758 --> 01:56:38,050
Stronger.

974
01:57:08,925 --> 01:57:11,258
Amazon.

975
01:57:13,592 --> 01:57:15,217
Hold!

976
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:17,633
This one will be mine.

977
01:57:19,467 --> 01:57:22,050
I belong to no one.

978
01:57:35,925 --> 01:57:38,092
Guys, this is not together.

979
01:57:44,883 --> 01:57:46,383
Help get those people
out of here.

980
01:57:46,467 --> 01:57:48,508
I'll make sure these things
follow me.

981
01:57:58,383 --> 01:57:59,967
Everybody, move!

982
01:58:08,633 --> 01:58:10,258
A little quicker.

983
01:58:12,467 --> 01:58:13,925
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

984
01:58:14,008 --> 01:58:16,592
I've got this. Keep moving.

985
01:58:18,425 --> 01:58:19,508
This way.

986
01:58:55,717 --> 01:58:57,300
The energy
is dissipating.

987
01:58:57,383 --> 01:58:59,967
<i>My gauntlet worked!</i>

988
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:02,508
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.

989
01:59:02,592 --> 01:59:04,592
Thought you'd never ask.

990
01:59:04,675 --> 01:59:07,092
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

991
01:59:37,092 --> 01:59:38,217
Thank you, Alfred.

992
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,633
Don't mention it.

993
02:00:02,425 --> 02:00:03,508
No!

994
02:00:07,092 --> 02:00:08,175
Whew.

995
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:12,800
They're safe.
Get back to the tunnel.

996
02:00:12,883 --> 02:00:16,300
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

997
02:00:27,967 --> 02:00:29,383
My turn.

998
02:01:51,508 --> 02:01:53,133
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.

999
02:01:53,217 --> 02:01:55,800
Are you all right,
Master Wayne?

1000
02:01:55,883 --> 02:01:57,050
Are you all right?

1001
02:02:07,467 --> 02:02:11,217
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.

1002
02:02:25,508 --> 02:02:26,592
You okay?

1003
02:02:27,092 --> 02:02:28,342
Mm.

1004
02:02:28,425 --> 02:02:30,217
Wasn't sure you'd come.

1005
02:02:31,133 --> 02:02:32,550
You're my father.

1006
02:02:35,967 --> 02:02:37,050
Go.

1007
02:02:50,592 --> 02:02:51,675
No!

1008
02:03:36,883 --> 02:03:39,508
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.

1009
02:03:41,008 --> 02:03:42,925
Uh, do I know you?

1010
02:04:13,675 --> 02:04:15,050
What are we under, right now?

1011
02:04:15,717 --> 02:04:17,092
Gotham Harbor.

1012
02:04:55,717 --> 02:04:57,092
Who is that?

1013
02:05:22,342 --> 02:05:23,633
Come on.

1014
02:05:28,633 --> 02:05:29,925
Diana, get on!

1015
02:06:31,758 --> 02:06:33,383
What is it?

1016
02:06:41,092 --> 02:06:42,592
Show me.

1017
02:07:21,633 --> 02:07:23,383
It is here.

1018
02:07:24,008 --> 02:07:27,092
On this world.

1019
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,300
Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine

1020
02:08:02,383 --> 02:08:03,800
for possible alien microbes.

1021
02:08:03,883 --> 02:08:05,675
U.S. government protocols
require that...

1022
02:08:05,758 --> 02:08:08,758
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

1023
02:08:13,092 --> 02:08:14,592
It called to him.

1024
02:08:14,675 --> 02:08:16,258
The Mother Box.

1025
02:08:16,342 --> 02:08:17,842
The one he already has.

1026
02:08:17,925 --> 02:08:21,092
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1027
02:08:21,175 --> 02:08:23,592
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

1028
02:08:23,675 --> 02:08:25,050
If he doesn't already have it.

1029
02:08:28,592 --> 02:08:30,133
He doesn't have it.

1030
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:34,550
I do.

1031
02:08:44,883 --> 02:08:47,133
Have you finished
the conquest?

1032
02:08:47,217 --> 02:08:48,508
Not yet, DeSaad.

1033
02:08:48,592 --> 02:08:50,967
Then why do you summon me?

1034
02:08:51,050 --> 02:08:52,633
I bring news.

1035
02:08:52,717 --> 02:08:55,717
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

1036
02:08:55,800 --> 02:09:00,967
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1037
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:03,217
The Anti-Life Equation.

1038
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:05,383
The key to
controlling all life

1039
02:09:05,467 --> 02:09:07,925
and all will
throughout the multiverse.

1040
02:09:08,008 --> 02:09:11,217
He found it hidden on a primitive
planet, but before...

1041
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:14,300
The story of the defiance
is well-known.

1042
02:09:14,383 --> 02:09:17,050
I have found
the primitive planet.

1043
02:09:17,133 --> 02:09:19,300
The world that fought back.

1044
02:09:19,383 --> 02:09:21,258
It is Earth.

1045
02:09:21,342 --> 02:09:23,592
The Anti-Life Equation
is carved

1046
02:09:23,675 --> 02:09:27,717
into the surface
of this very world.

1047
02:09:31,342 --> 02:09:32,842
Are you certain?

1048
02:09:32,925 --> 02:09:33,925
I have seen it.

1049
02:09:34,008 --> 02:09:37,467
I have looked
with my own eyes.

1050
02:09:39,133 --> 02:09:40,133
Anti-Life.

1051
02:10:20,925 --> 02:10:22,592
My lord.

1052
02:10:24,050 --> 02:10:27,967
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1053
02:10:28,050 --> 02:10:32,092
My lord, I am
but your humble servant.

1054
02:10:32,175 --> 02:10:35,133
Can it be true
that you have found it?

1055
02:10:35,217 --> 02:10:38,175
I have, great one.

1056
02:10:38,258 --> 02:10:41,300
The lost world is Earth.

1057
02:10:41,383 --> 02:10:45,467
Anti-Life is here.

1058
02:10:45,550 --> 02:10:48,883
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

1059
02:10:48,967 --> 02:10:52,175
synchronize The Unity,
and when this world is scorched,

1060
02:10:52,258 --> 02:10:55,675
I will come
for my great prize.

1061
02:10:56,467 --> 02:10:59,550
You will come to Earth?

1062
02:10:59,633 --> 02:11:04,050
I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust

1063
02:11:04,133 --> 02:11:05,633
looking for Anti-Life.

1064
02:11:05,717 --> 02:11:09,008
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1065
02:11:09,092 --> 02:11:12,342
I will stride
across their bones

1066
02:11:12,425 --> 02:11:15,008
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

1067
02:11:15,092 --> 02:11:17,925
And all of existence

1068
02:11:18,008 --> 02:11:21,508
shall be mine.

1069
02:11:24,883 --> 02:11:28,967
It shall be so, my master.

1070
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:34,675
So cool.

1071
02:11:34,758 --> 02:11:37,842
From the outside,
it looks like this building was abandoned.

1072
02:11:41,175 --> 02:11:43,050
It wants to fly.

1073
02:11:44,092 --> 02:11:46,133
You talk to machines?

1074
02:11:46,217 --> 02:11:48,300
I speak
to intelligence.

1075
02:11:48,383 --> 02:11:49,675
This one's saying
she can't fly

1076
02:11:49,758 --> 02:11:51,300
because of a software issue,

1077
02:11:51,383 --> 02:11:53,550
but I could fix it
with a little time.

1078
02:12:03,133 --> 02:12:05,592
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

1079
02:12:05,675 --> 02:12:08,092
I could feel
the other two boxes.

1080
02:12:08,175 --> 02:12:10,008
I know they're awake,

1081
02:12:10,092 --> 02:12:11,675
but I can't see
where they are.

1082
02:12:11,758 --> 02:12:13,967
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

1083
02:12:14,050 --> 02:12:16,217
Even if we knew,

1084
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:19,425
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1085
02:12:21,508 --> 02:12:22,842
Maybe one.

1086
02:12:22,925 --> 02:12:25,300
Hmm, Superman.

1087
02:12:25,383 --> 02:12:27,092
As long as
the third box is asleep,

1088
02:12:27,175 --> 02:12:29,508
they can't see it,
only sense it.

1089
02:12:29,592 --> 02:12:31,842
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1090
02:12:31,925 --> 02:12:33,467
No. That's just a strategy

1091
02:12:33,550 --> 02:12:35,550
to lose more slowly,
not to win.

1092
02:12:35,633 --> 02:12:38,467
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

1093
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:39,717
Why don't we just destroy it?

1094
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:41,925
Fire doesn't
destroy the boxes.

1095
02:12:42,008 --> 02:12:43,842
They're an unknown form
of matter.

1096
02:12:43,925 --> 02:12:45,175
Oh, they love heat.

1097
02:12:45,258 --> 02:12:47,508
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

1098
02:12:47,592 --> 02:12:50,342
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

1099
02:12:50,425 --> 02:12:51,633
Makes you think.

1100
02:12:51,717 --> 02:12:54,300
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

1101
02:12:54,383 --> 02:12:56,133
Are you trying
to say something?

1102
02:12:56,217 --> 02:12:58,092
Oh, I'm saying it.

1103
02:12:58,175 --> 02:13:00,258
How do we know you're not
working for them?

1104
02:13:02,050 --> 02:13:04,008
It's a long story.

1105
02:13:04,092 --> 02:13:06,175
You got somewhere else to be?

1106
02:13:13,425 --> 02:13:14,967
The Nazis found the box

1107
02:13:15,050 --> 02:13:17,258
at the end
of the Second World War,

1108
02:13:17,342 --> 02:13:20,467
buried under
an Italian monastery.

1109
02:13:20,550 --> 02:13:22,967
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1110
02:13:23,050 --> 02:13:25,925
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

1111
02:13:26,008 --> 02:13:30,258
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1112
02:13:30,342 --> 02:13:32,342
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

1113
02:13:32,425 --> 02:13:34,217
for 70 years

1114
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:37,800
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

1115
02:13:39,092 --> 02:13:41,592
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

1116
02:13:41,675 --> 02:13:42,842
between the ship...

1117
02:13:44,008 --> 02:13:46,175
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1118
02:13:46,258 --> 02:13:49,842
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

1119
02:13:49,925 --> 02:13:52,008
Different civilizations,

1120
02:13:52,092 --> 02:13:55,258
similar properties.

1121
02:13:55,342 --> 02:13:58,675
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1122
02:13:58,758 --> 02:14:02,342
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

1123
02:14:02,425 --> 02:14:04,300
And so did.

1124
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:07,633
Then...

1125
02:14:09,508 --> 02:14:12,675
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

1126
02:14:12,758 --> 02:14:16,008
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

1127
02:14:16,092 --> 02:14:18,675
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

1128
02:14:34,633 --> 02:14:36,883
He unleashed
an alien technology

1129
02:14:36,967 --> 02:14:39,633
he didn't fully understand.

1130
02:14:39,717 --> 02:14:42,342
He used that power
to keep me alive.

1131
02:14:45,842 --> 02:14:47,842
Alive...

1132
02:14:47,925 --> 02:14:50,050
but turned into this.

1133
02:14:52,675 --> 02:14:55,133
The box went back to sleep

1134
02:14:55,883 --> 02:14:57,717
and he never returned it.

1135
02:15:00,133 --> 02:15:02,383
That researcher
was Silas Stone.

1136
02:15:04,008 --> 02:15:05,717
My father.

1137
02:15:08,967 --> 02:15:10,508
Wait,

1138
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:14,092
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1139
02:15:14,175 --> 02:15:16,592
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

1140
02:15:16,675 --> 02:15:18,925
They're change machines.

1141
02:15:19,008 --> 02:15:22,217
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

1142
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:24,258
alive or dead.

1143
02:15:24,342 --> 02:15:26,842
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1144
02:15:26,925 --> 02:15:28,633
regenerate, reinstate.

1145
02:15:28,717 --> 02:15:30,133
Reinstate?

1146
02:15:30,217 --> 02:15:31,592
A box has the power

1147
02:15:31,675 --> 02:15:33,675
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1148
02:15:33,758 --> 02:15:35,717
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1149
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:36,967
can't be created or destroyed,

1150
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:39,092
their relations
just transform.

1151
02:15:39,175 --> 02:15:42,008
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1152
02:15:42,092 --> 02:15:44,633
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1153
02:15:44,717 --> 02:15:49,050
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1154
02:15:50,925 --> 02:15:52,675
But a Mother Box...

1155
02:15:52,758 --> 02:15:55,217
...turns smoke
back into a house.

1156
02:16:00,925 --> 02:16:03,717
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

1157
02:16:04,883 --> 02:16:07,675
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

1158
02:16:34,842 --> 02:16:36,050
Who is it?

1159
02:16:36,633 --> 02:16:37,925
Martha.

1160
02:16:42,592 --> 02:16:43,925
Hi.

1161
02:16:45,675 --> 02:16:47,175
Hi.

1162
02:16:56,133 --> 02:16:57,592
I went to the <i>Daily Planet</i>

1163
02:16:57,675 --> 02:17:01,342
to finally pick up
Clark's things.

1164
02:17:02,633 --> 02:17:06,133
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

1165
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,550
I lost the farm.

1166
02:17:11,925 --> 02:17:14,258
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

1167
02:17:15,467 --> 02:17:17,008
Truth is, the house is too big

1168
02:17:17,092 --> 02:17:19,717
for me to live in
by myself anyway.

1169
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:22,800
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1170
02:17:22,883 --> 02:17:25,008
for as long as you need.

1171
02:17:26,008 --> 02:17:28,842
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

1172
02:17:30,217 --> 02:17:32,550
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1173
02:17:32,633 --> 02:17:34,633
right by the diner.

1174
02:17:34,717 --> 02:17:36,217
I'm not here for help.

1175
02:17:37,342 --> 02:17:39,758
I'm here because

1176
02:17:39,842 --> 02:17:42,550
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

1177
02:17:43,758 --> 02:17:46,925
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

1178
02:17:51,633 --> 02:17:53,342
I can't.

1179
02:18:00,008 --> 02:18:02,758
The whole world is mourning.

1180
02:18:04,008 --> 02:18:06,342
Grieving over a symbol.

1181
02:18:06,425 --> 02:18:10,550
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."

1182
02:18:11,508 --> 02:18:13,592
I hear what people say.

1183
02:18:13,675 --> 02:18:15,675
They talk like they knew him.

1184
02:18:16,717 --> 02:18:19,175
But they didn't know Clark.

1185
02:18:20,550 --> 02:18:22,800
And I can't stop them

1186
02:18:22,883 --> 02:18:27,508
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

1187
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:31,967
You're the only one who knows.

1188
02:18:32,050 --> 02:18:34,592
Who feels what I do.

1189
02:18:35,717 --> 02:18:38,883
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

1190
02:18:41,758 --> 02:18:45,258
I came all this way
because I wanted...

1191
02:18:45,342 --> 02:18:47,508
because I wanted to see you.

1192
02:18:48,633 --> 02:18:50,675
Tell you...

1193
02:18:50,758 --> 02:18:52,717
I understand.

1194
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:56,592
I...

1195
02:18:56,675 --> 02:19:00,592
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1196
02:19:04,175 --> 02:19:06,342
And I just miss him.

1197
02:19:07,342 --> 02:19:09,967
I miss him so much.

1198
02:19:16,258 --> 02:19:18,092
So do I, sweetheart.

1199
02:19:22,508 --> 02:19:27,508
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1200
02:19:30,883 --> 02:19:33,717
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1201
02:19:35,967 --> 02:19:38,383
Come back to the living.

1202
02:20:18,175 --> 02:20:21,217
The world
needs you, too, Lois.

1203
02:20:24,842 --> 02:20:26,258
<i>The dead are dead.</i>

1204
02:20:26,342 --> 02:20:28,258
The box brought Victor back.

1205
02:20:28,342 --> 02:20:29,925
Victor wasn't dead.

1206
02:20:30,008 --> 02:20:31,800
Life is either one or zero.

1207
02:20:31,883 --> 02:20:34,883
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

1208
02:20:34,967 --> 02:20:36,633
Can you operate this box,
Victor?

1209
02:20:36,717 --> 02:20:38,008
Of course.

1210
02:20:38,092 --> 02:20:40,550
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1211
02:20:40,633 --> 02:20:42,717
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

1212
02:20:44,425 --> 02:20:45,967
Okay, but...

1213
02:20:46,050 --> 02:20:50,342
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1214
02:20:50,425 --> 02:20:51,758
What do we have to lose?

1215
02:20:51,842 --> 02:20:54,300
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

1216
02:20:54,383 --> 02:20:55,925
As soon as it wakes up...

1217
02:20:56,008 --> 02:20:58,425
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1218
02:20:58,508 --> 02:21:01,092
activates The Unity.
The end.

1219
02:21:01,175 --> 02:21:03,592
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1220
02:21:03,675 --> 02:21:05,842
to a bunch of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

1221
02:21:05,925 --> 02:21:08,467
Even if Superman could return,

1222
02:21:08,550 --> 02:21:10,633
who's to say
that he could defeat them?

1223
02:21:10,717 --> 02:21:12,633
The Mother Box did.

1224
02:21:12,717 --> 02:21:14,967
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

1225
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:18,008
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

1226
02:21:18,092 --> 02:21:19,967
Didn't call out
to Steppenwolf.

1227
02:21:20,050 --> 02:21:21,675
None of the boxes did.
Not until...

1228
02:21:21,758 --> 02:21:23,967
Not until Superman died.

1229
02:21:24,050 --> 02:21:26,425
Not until Superman died.

1230
02:21:26,508 --> 02:21:28,467
It's like they were
afraid of him?

1231
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:31,633
Yes,
they were afraid of him.

1232
02:21:34,425 --> 02:21:36,383
This is the only way.

1233
02:21:37,717 --> 02:21:41,800
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1234
02:21:57,925 --> 02:22:00,008
Cross this one off
the bucket list.

1235
02:22:00,092 --> 02:22:04,133
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

1236
02:22:05,883 --> 02:22:08,592
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

1237
02:22:09,217 --> 02:22:10,675
We could.

1238
02:22:18,092 --> 02:22:19,842
He was my hero.

1239
02:22:22,342 --> 02:22:23,675
All right.

1240
02:22:27,133 --> 02:22:30,342
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

1241
02:22:30,425 --> 02:22:31,758
Half-Atlantean.

1242
02:22:33,342 --> 02:22:36,717
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1243
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:40,842
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1244
02:22:40,925 --> 02:22:43,883
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

1245
02:22:43,967 --> 02:22:46,092
Hate is useless.

1246
02:22:49,133 --> 02:22:50,508
Yep.

1247
02:22:51,717 --> 02:22:53,425
No, thank you.

1248
02:22:57,800 --> 02:22:58,925
You know, my father told me

1249
02:22:59,008 --> 02:23:00,925
there's a saying
in Atlantis...

1250
02:23:02,425 --> 02:23:04,758
"None are taken back
from the darkness.

1251
02:23:04,842 --> 02:23:05,967
"Not without..."

1252
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:07,800
"Not without
giving one up in return."

1253
02:23:09,883 --> 02:23:11,592
We say the same thing.

1254
02:23:14,133 --> 02:23:15,883
How about that?

1255
02:23:15,967 --> 02:23:17,967
Wonder Woman.

1256
02:23:19,175 --> 02:23:20,467
What do you think, man?

1257
02:23:20,550 --> 02:23:23,425
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

1258
02:23:23,508 --> 02:23:26,258
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1259
02:23:27,967 --> 02:23:29,967
Every guy's a younger guy.

1260
02:23:31,842 --> 02:23:32,925
Jesus.

1261
02:23:34,425 --> 02:23:36,258
Oh, Christ.

1262
02:23:38,592 --> 02:23:41,217
Oh, bloody...

1263
02:23:42,508 --> 02:23:43,508
Any luck?

1264
02:23:43,592 --> 02:23:44,925
If by "luck" you mean

1265
02:23:45,008 --> 02:23:48,050
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1266
02:23:48,133 --> 02:23:50,300
then, no. No luck.

1267
02:23:51,050 --> 02:23:52,467
It's okay.

1268
02:23:52,550 --> 02:23:54,508
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1269
02:23:54,592 --> 02:23:55,758
to the Kryptonian ship.

1270
02:23:55,842 --> 02:23:57,175
It's basically
an organic computer.

1271
02:23:57,258 --> 02:23:58,967
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

1272
02:23:59,050 --> 02:24:01,675
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?

1273
02:24:01,758 --> 02:24:03,133
Something like that.

1274
02:24:03,217 --> 02:24:07,008
Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

1275
02:24:13,508 --> 02:24:15,133
Master Wayne...

1276
02:24:17,092 --> 02:24:18,467
you did it!

1277
02:24:18,550 --> 02:24:22,133
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1278
02:24:22,217 --> 02:24:25,383
You've fulfilled your promise.

1279
02:24:25,467 --> 02:24:29,383
But to try to do that...
I mean...

1280
02:24:29,467 --> 02:24:32,425
your guilt's
overcome your reason.

1281
02:24:32,508 --> 02:24:34,675
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

1282
02:24:34,758 --> 02:24:38,133
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

1283
02:24:38,217 --> 02:24:40,550
not on reason.

1284
02:24:40,633 --> 02:24:45,008
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

1285
02:24:45,092 --> 02:24:47,217
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

1286
02:24:47,300 --> 02:24:50,342
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

1287
02:24:50,425 --> 02:24:52,883
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

1288
02:24:52,967 --> 02:24:54,800
then don't wave
the red cape at it.

1289
02:24:54,883 --> 02:24:56,592
You do
when it's this red cape.

1290
02:24:56,675 --> 02:24:59,008
This red cape charges back.

1291
02:25:13,633 --> 02:25:14,925
Okay.

1292
02:25:21,550 --> 02:25:24,133
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

1293
02:25:24,217 --> 02:25:25,842
Everyone's clear,
including you.

1294
02:25:25,925 --> 02:25:28,592
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1295
02:25:28,675 --> 02:25:30,508
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1296
02:25:30,592 --> 02:25:31,717
Absolutely.

1297
02:25:35,508 --> 02:25:36,842
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.

1298
02:25:36,925 --> 02:25:39,467
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

1299
02:25:39,550 --> 02:25:41,175
If you need
more medical attention...

1300
02:25:41,258 --> 02:25:45,050
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1301
02:25:45,133 --> 02:25:46,550
- Definitely not "A."
- Okay.

1302
02:25:46,633 --> 02:25:49,883
Or... "B"?

1303
02:25:51,342 --> 02:25:52,758
Let me see "A" again?

1304
02:25:58,217 --> 02:26:01,550
Right. We should get dressed.

1305
02:26:03,508 --> 02:26:05,633
I'm always dressed.

1306
02:26:32,633 --> 02:26:33,842
ID?

1307
02:26:33,925 --> 02:26:35,175
ID.

1308
02:26:38,300 --> 02:26:39,508
Aye, aye.

1309
02:26:41,717 --> 02:26:43,050
"Aye, aye"?

1310
02:27:06,133 --> 02:27:07,508
Okay.

1311
02:27:07,592 --> 02:27:09,800
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1312
02:27:16,717 --> 02:27:17,758
Doc!

1313
02:27:17,842 --> 02:27:19,175
They let you out
of quarantine.

1314
02:27:19,258 --> 02:27:20,842
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1315
02:27:20,925 --> 02:27:23,050
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

1316
02:27:23,133 --> 02:27:24,425
with the electron-laser.

1317
02:27:24,508 --> 02:27:26,800
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

1318
02:27:41,758 --> 02:27:44,592
Victor, clear this place out.

1319
02:27:44,675 --> 02:27:46,133
Done.

1320
02:27:49,925 --> 02:27:52,592
<i>Code Red.
Contamination breach.</i>

1321
02:27:52,675 --> 02:27:56,008
<i>All personnel
evacuate immediately.</i>

1322
02:27:56,092 --> 02:27:58,300
Bio red five.

1323
02:27:58,383 --> 02:28:00,883
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

1324
02:28:00,967 --> 02:28:03,758
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

1325
02:28:03,842 --> 02:28:05,217
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1326
02:28:05,300 --> 02:28:07,300
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.

1327
02:28:07,383 --> 02:28:08,842
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.

1328
02:28:08,925 --> 02:28:10,258
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1329
02:28:10,342 --> 02:28:11,717
- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.

1330
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:12,800
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!

1331
02:28:12,883 --> 02:28:15,008
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1332
02:28:15,092 --> 02:28:18,050
<i>Remain calm and
proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

1333
02:28:24,467 --> 02:28:26,217
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

1334
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:29,258
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!

1335
02:28:29,342 --> 02:28:31,050
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1336
02:28:31,133 --> 02:28:32,800
Everybody out! Go!

1337
02:28:53,008 --> 02:28:55,800
Yes! Gotcha!

1338
02:28:55,883 --> 02:28:58,633
Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

1339
02:28:58,717 --> 02:29:01,258
- <i>Go ahead, Dr. Stone.</i>
- This is a false alarm.

1340
02:29:01,342 --> 02:29:04,092
Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert...

1341
02:29:14,050 --> 02:29:15,550
Victor.

1342
02:29:17,008 --> 02:29:19,508
<i>Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.</i>

1343
02:29:20,425 --> 02:29:21,467
I was mistaken.

1344
02:29:21,550 --> 02:29:22,758
The alarm's legit.

1345
02:29:22,842 --> 02:29:24,550
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

1346
02:29:24,633 --> 02:29:27,550
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

1347
02:29:27,633 --> 02:29:29,008
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1348
02:29:39,050 --> 02:29:40,758
Get the civilians out!

1349
02:29:40,842 --> 02:29:42,050
Let's go! Let's go!

1350
02:29:46,217 --> 02:29:47,592
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.

1351
02:29:47,675 --> 02:29:48,842
- Everybody?
- Yes.

1352
02:30:22,092 --> 02:30:23,425
This way.

1353
02:30:33,842 --> 02:30:36,800
It knows he's here.

1354
02:30:36,883 --> 02:30:39,092
Ooh, that's intense.

1355
02:30:43,467 --> 02:30:45,467
This is amazing.

1356
02:30:46,175 --> 02:30:47,467
This is crazy.

1357
02:30:47,550 --> 02:30:49,383
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1358
02:30:49,467 --> 02:30:52,133
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

1359
02:33:17,883 --> 02:33:19,925
<i>Systems coming online.</i>

1360
02:33:22,633 --> 02:33:24,967
<i>Welcome, Victor.</i>

1361
02:33:25,050 --> 02:33:26,925
<i>Would you like
to assume command?</i>

1362
02:33:27,008 --> 02:33:28,092
I'm in.

1363
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:39,550
The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.

1364
02:33:39,633 --> 02:33:41,383
I can override
the security protocols,

1365
02:33:41,467 --> 02:33:43,217
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

1366
02:33:43,300 --> 02:33:44,675
that Luthor's
power surges caused

1367
02:33:44,758 --> 02:33:45,842
to the primary capacitors.

1368
02:33:45,925 --> 02:33:47,050
English.

1369
02:33:47,133 --> 02:33:49,550
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

1370
02:33:49,633 --> 02:33:51,758
I might be able to do it.

1371
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:55,883
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

1372
02:33:55,967 --> 02:33:57,258
I don't like
to break this rule,

1373
02:33:57,342 --> 02:33:59,133
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

1374
02:33:59,217 --> 02:34:00,758
Look, crazy things
happen to time,

1375
02:34:00,842 --> 02:34:03,508
but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.

1376
02:34:03,592 --> 02:34:05,425
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

1377
02:34:05,508 --> 02:34:07,758
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

1378
02:34:07,842 --> 02:34:10,633
I might be able to wake
the box, if that's...

1379
02:34:10,717 --> 02:34:12,425
still what we want?

1380
02:34:12,508 --> 02:34:14,008
It is. Do it.

1381
02:34:18,758 --> 02:34:20,050
Hey, Miss Lane.

1382
02:34:20,133 --> 02:34:21,092
Morning.

1383
02:34:21,175 --> 02:34:22,550
I didn't think
you were coming.

1384
02:34:23,508 --> 02:34:25,175
One last time.

1385
02:34:41,967 --> 02:34:45,925
I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...

1386
02:34:46,008 --> 02:34:47,092
<i>I'm in position.</i>

1387
02:34:49,842 --> 02:34:52,425
<i>Ready to initiate
drop sequence.</i>

1388
02:34:52,508 --> 02:34:54,258
The Mother Box is ready.

1389
02:35:13,508 --> 02:35:15,383
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.

1390
02:35:15,467 --> 02:35:17,258
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

1391
02:35:17,342 --> 02:35:18,758
It's afraid.
It knows Steppenwolf will come for it.

1392
02:35:18,842 --> 02:35:20,717
We know that already.
Continue.

1393
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:23,425
<i>I strongly advise
against activation.</i>

1394
02:35:23,508 --> 02:35:25,092
Barry, I'm initiating
the countdown.

1395
02:35:25,175 --> 02:35:26,925
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

1396
02:35:27,008 --> 02:35:28,175
- Five...
- <i>Five...</i>

1397
02:35:28,258 --> 02:35:29,550
- Five...
- <i>Apokoliptian technology</i>

1398
02:35:29,633 --> 02:35:30,758
- <i>is hostile.</i>
- This is a bad idea.

1399
02:35:30,842 --> 02:35:31,633
No, it isn't.
Keep going.

1400
02:35:31,717 --> 02:35:32,717
Four...

1401
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:34,383
- <i>Four...</i>
- Four...

1402
02:35:34,467 --> 02:35:35,842
<i>I strongly advise
against activation.</i>

1403
02:35:35,925 --> 02:35:37,300
- We need to abort, now.
- Just do it.

1404
02:35:37,383 --> 02:35:38,550
- Three...
- <i>Three...</i>

1405
02:35:38,633 --> 02:35:39,550
Three...

1406
02:35:39,633 --> 02:35:41,508
- Two...
- <i>Two...</i>

1407
02:35:41,592 --> 02:35:43,383
- Two...
- <i>This course is irreversible.</i>

1408
02:35:43,467 --> 02:35:44,842
- One.
- <i>One.</i>

1409
02:35:45,842 --> 02:35:47,133
One.

1410
02:35:47,217 --> 02:35:48,550
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

1411
02:37:17,633 --> 02:37:19,175
- <i>Victor?</i>
- No.

1412
02:37:20,008 --> 02:37:21,092
Go?

1413
02:38:51,592 --> 02:38:54,508
<i>The future
has taken root in the present.</i>

1414
02:38:54,592 --> 02:38:56,383
Get down!

1415
02:40:40,425 --> 02:40:42,092
He's back.

1416
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:11,758
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.

1417
02:41:13,883 --> 02:41:15,342
What?

1418
02:41:30,258 --> 02:41:31,383
Victor?

1419
02:41:32,592 --> 02:41:33,675
Victor?

1420
02:41:35,758 --> 02:41:37,675
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

1421
02:41:37,758 --> 02:41:39,467
It's my auto-defense system.

1422
02:41:39,550 --> 02:41:40,675
It senses danger.

1423
02:41:40,758 --> 02:41:42,008
Victor, no! Victor!

1424
02:41:42,092 --> 02:41:44,050
- I can't control it.
- Don't!

1425
02:41:56,383 --> 02:41:57,675
Kal-El, no!

1426
02:42:05,800 --> 02:42:07,967
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

1427
02:42:14,967 --> 02:42:17,800
Arthur,
we need to restrain him.

1428
02:42:48,133 --> 02:42:52,008
Kal-El,
the last Son of Krypton...

1429
02:42:52,925 --> 02:42:55,258
remember who you are.

1430
02:42:56,800 --> 02:42:58,092
Tell me who you...

1431
02:44:32,967 --> 02:44:36,175
Let's go!

1432
02:44:43,300 --> 02:44:44,800
You should probably move.

1433
02:44:48,133 --> 02:44:49,342
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1434
02:44:49,425 --> 02:44:52,300
Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.

1435
02:45:44,175 --> 02:45:46,383
Please don't make me do this.

1436
02:46:19,050 --> 02:46:20,258
Clark.

1437
02:46:21,217 --> 02:46:22,508
Clark, no.

1438
02:46:33,967 --> 02:46:35,300
Clark.

1439
02:46:35,383 --> 02:46:37,217
No.

1440
02:46:37,300 --> 02:46:39,175
This world needs you.

1441
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:45,633
Clark.

1442
02:46:45,717 --> 02:46:46,925
Clark.

1443
02:46:47,008 --> 02:46:49,050
Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1444
02:46:50,675 --> 02:46:51,883
Clark.

1445
02:46:55,217 --> 02:46:56,675
Please.

1446
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:32,050
Please.

1447
02:47:43,133 --> 02:47:44,383
Please.

1448
02:47:45,092 --> 02:47:47,258
Just go.

1449
02:47:47,342 --> 02:47:48,425
Yeah.

1450
02:47:49,217 --> 02:47:50,592
Let's go.

1451
02:48:23,050 --> 02:48:25,342
I'm so sorry.

1452
02:48:34,592 --> 02:48:35,592
Take cover!

1453
02:48:35,675 --> 02:48:38,258
- He's coming.
- The Mother Box.

1454
02:48:38,342 --> 02:48:39,508
Where is it?

1455
02:48:50,050 --> 02:48:51,383
Come on.

1456
02:48:52,258 --> 02:48:54,133
Come on.

1457
02:49:18,758 --> 02:49:22,508
<i>Attention,

1458
02:49:22,592 --> 02:49:24,758
<i>Sector Four, Level Three.</i>

1459

<i>Implement lockdown

1460
02:49:56,342 --> 02:49:58,050
Give me the Mother Box.

1461
02:50:11,133 --> 02:50:12,675
No, no, no.

1462
02:50:15,133 --> 02:50:16,967
Dad, wait! Don't!

1463
02:50:57,175 --> 02:51:00,175
So begins the end.

1464
02:51:05,758 --> 02:51:07,217
Victor?

1465
02:51:09,467 --> 02:51:12,883
Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

1466
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:20,050
Victor?

1467
02:51:21,050 --> 02:51:22,592
He's dead.

1468
02:51:22,675 --> 02:51:23,800
What?

1469
02:51:24,758 --> 02:51:26,092
My father.

1470
02:51:27,342 --> 02:51:31,050
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

1471
02:51:31,133 --> 02:51:32,592
Oh, my God.

1472
02:51:39,342 --> 02:51:41,467
His father's dead
'cause of us.

1473
02:51:41,550 --> 02:51:43,175
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

1474
02:51:43,258 --> 02:51:44,842
It wasn't a bad idea.

1475
02:51:44,925 --> 02:51:47,300
We needed Superman.
We still do.

1476
02:51:47,383 --> 02:51:49,800
Well, whatever
returned, it isn't Superman.

1477
02:51:49,883 --> 02:51:53,050
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

1478
02:51:53,133 --> 02:51:54,842
It is him.

1479
02:51:54,925 --> 02:51:57,300
He recognized Lois Lane.

1480
02:51:57,383 --> 02:51:59,550
- Who?
- The woman he loves.

1481
02:51:59,633 --> 02:52:02,050
- He remembers her.
- Nah.

1482
02:52:02,133 --> 02:52:04,092
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.

1483
02:52:04,175 --> 02:52:05,758
It's called instinct, Diana.

1484
02:52:12,925 --> 02:52:14,800
Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?

1485
02:52:14,883 --> 02:52:16,592
He's gone back to his base

1486
02:52:16,675 --> 02:52:18,300
to assemble the three boxes.

1487
02:52:18,383 --> 02:52:19,925
And we don't know
where his base is.

1488
02:52:20,008 --> 02:52:21,633
- Or how long until...
- Hours.

1489
02:52:21,717 --> 02:52:23,383
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,

1490
02:52:23,467 --> 02:52:26,675
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

1491
02:52:26,758 --> 02:52:29,008
This is not your...

1492
02:52:31,092 --> 02:52:32,675
He knew.

1493
02:52:32,758 --> 02:52:34,383
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1494
02:52:34,467 --> 02:52:36,258
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...

1495
02:52:36,342 --> 02:52:38,342
he was trying to superheat it.

1496
02:52:38,425 --> 02:52:39,758
He made the core
the hottest thing

1497
02:52:39,842 --> 02:52:41,092
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.

1498
02:52:41,175 --> 02:52:42,258
Now, anything that hot
would have to...

1499
02:52:42,342 --> 02:52:43,383
Blink off the charts

1500
02:52:43,467 --> 02:52:45,675
on a thermal imaging system.

1501
02:52:45,758 --> 02:52:49,175
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

1502
02:52:49,258 --> 02:52:51,300
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

1503
02:52:51,383 --> 02:52:53,592
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.

1504
02:52:53,675 --> 02:52:54,967
I'm already on it.

1505
02:52:55,050 --> 02:52:57,050
I'm sorry.
You have a satellite?

1506
02:52:57,133 --> 02:52:58,592
I have six.

1507
02:52:58,675 --> 02:52:59,800
Right.

1508
02:53:01,383 --> 02:53:03,633
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.

1509
02:53:28,008 --> 02:53:30,217
You brought us here.

1510
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:31,592
You remembered.

1511
02:53:32,383 --> 02:53:34,133
This is home.

1512
02:53:35,967 --> 02:53:37,258
You spoke.

1513
02:53:41,175 --> 02:53:43,175
Did I not before?

1514
02:54:16,925 --> 02:54:19,717
Your mother got behind
on the payments.

1515
02:54:21,050 --> 02:54:23,217
She never told anyone.

1516
02:54:24,758 --> 02:54:26,675
I don't understand.

1517
02:54:29,550 --> 02:54:32,175
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1518
02:54:35,217 --> 02:54:36,675
Here.

1519
02:54:51,425 --> 02:54:53,258
She loved it here.

1520
02:55:03,967 --> 02:55:05,675
So did I.

1521
02:55:07,592 --> 02:55:09,133
So did I.

1522
02:55:34,633 --> 02:55:36,008
Wow!

1523
02:55:36,092 --> 02:55:37,717
This is awesome.

1524
02:55:37,800 --> 02:55:39,508
Brought some friends.

1525
02:55:45,925 --> 02:55:48,508
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1526
02:55:48,592 --> 02:55:51,258
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

1527
02:55:51,342 --> 02:55:53,717
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.

1528
02:55:54,883 --> 02:55:57,092
Oh...

1529
02:56:00,008 --> 02:56:02,050
It's badass, Alfred.

1530
02:56:04,633 --> 02:56:07,217
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1531
02:56:07,300 --> 02:56:08,592
Great.

1532
02:56:08,675 --> 02:56:10,425
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

1533
02:56:13,092 --> 02:56:16,008
There's the
Mother Box, right there.

1534
02:56:16,092 --> 02:56:18,133
Go to visible spectrum.

1535
02:56:20,008 --> 02:56:22,092
Pozharnov.

1536
02:56:22,175 --> 02:56:25,175
Ghost city
not far from Moscow.

1537
02:56:25,258 --> 02:56:26,550
It's been abandoned since

1538
02:56:26,633 --> 02:56:28,008
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

1539
02:56:28,092 --> 02:56:29,425
Not even the army goes in.

1540
02:56:29,508 --> 02:56:30,925
Right, it's probably
so radioactive

1541
02:56:31,008 --> 02:56:33,175
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

1542
02:56:33,258 --> 02:56:34,592
Not anymore.

1543
02:56:34,675 --> 02:56:36,383
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

1544
02:56:36,467 --> 02:56:37,467
Zoom.

1545
02:56:41,425 --> 02:56:42,925
What the hell is he building?

1546
02:56:43,008 --> 02:56:44,342
The Unity's in there.

1547
02:56:44,425 --> 02:56:45,842
We'll attack from above.

1548
02:56:45,925 --> 02:56:48,633
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,

1549
02:56:48,717 --> 02:56:50,592
only strengthen their bond.

1550
02:56:50,675 --> 02:56:51,925
What?
So we can't blow it up?

1551
02:56:52,008 --> 02:56:53,675
Not from the outside.

1552
02:56:55,008 --> 02:56:58,133
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.

1553
02:56:58,217 --> 02:56:59,592
Fuse with it.

1554
02:56:59,675 --> 02:57:00,967
Weaken its bond
from the inside

1555
02:57:01,050 --> 02:57:02,425
so we can break it back
into three.

1556
02:57:02,508 --> 02:57:04,592
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

1557
02:57:04,675 --> 02:57:08,342
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

1558
02:57:08,425 --> 02:57:10,967
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

1559
02:57:11,050 --> 02:57:12,467
A billion years old.

1560
02:57:12,550 --> 02:57:14,758
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

1561
02:57:14,842 --> 02:57:17,175
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

1562
02:57:17,258 --> 02:57:19,467
Just get me in
and get me time.

1563
02:57:19,550 --> 02:57:20,717
You could die, Victor.

1564
02:57:20,800 --> 02:57:23,342
If I don't, we all die.
Period.

1565
02:57:27,925 --> 02:57:29,842
I got nothing left.

1566
02:57:34,925 --> 02:57:37,175
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

1567
02:57:40,092 --> 02:57:41,675
That's what I'm gonna do.

1568
02:57:41,758 --> 02:57:44,175
Okay. So...

1569
02:57:44,258 --> 02:57:45,925
if Victor wants
to try to save the world

1570
02:57:46,008 --> 02:57:47,633
by fusing
with the doom boxes,

1571
02:57:47,717 --> 02:57:50,092
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

1572
02:57:50,175 --> 02:57:53,133
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

1573
02:57:53,217 --> 02:57:55,675
Fighting the devil
and his army

1574
02:57:55,758 --> 02:57:57,008
in hell.

1575
02:57:57,092 --> 02:57:59,092
I mean,
this guy's probably fought

1576
02:57:59,175 --> 02:58:01,508
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

1577
02:58:01,592 --> 02:58:03,300
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

1578
02:58:03,383 --> 02:58:04,925
And we have to assume
he's won.

1579
02:58:05,008 --> 02:58:06,758
I don't care
how many demons he's fought

1580
02:58:06,842 --> 02:58:08,217
in how many hells...

1581
02:58:08,300 --> 02:58:12,050
he's never fought us.
Not us united.

1582
02:59:02,342 --> 02:59:04,050
Take that as a "yes."

1583
02:59:04,133 --> 02:59:05,592
What?

1584
02:59:08,967 --> 02:59:10,258
The ring.

1585
02:59:13,842 --> 02:59:15,550
You're really back.

1586
02:59:48,842 --> 02:59:51,258
I have a second chance, Lo.

1587
02:59:53,342 --> 02:59:56,008
And I am not gonna waste it.

1588
03:00:54,133 --> 03:00:55,383
Are you really you?

1589
03:00:55,467 --> 03:00:57,842
I'm really me, Ma.

1590
03:01:15,217 --> 03:01:17,383
Listen, Ma.

1591
03:01:18,717 --> 03:01:21,008
They wanted me back
for a reason.

1592
03:01:22,633 --> 03:01:24,342
I need to find out why.

1593
03:01:44,300 --> 03:01:45,883
How's Victor doing?

1594
03:01:50,050 --> 03:01:53,008
You know,
wanted to be by himself.

1595
03:01:54,342 --> 03:01:57,550
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

1596
03:01:57,633 --> 03:01:59,300
to go up against
the most powerful machines

1597
03:01:59,383 --> 03:02:00,717
in the universe.

1598
03:02:02,425 --> 03:02:04,092
It's not fair.

1599
03:02:05,675 --> 03:02:07,467
I thought you didn't care?

1600
03:02:08,717 --> 03:02:10,383
I never said that.

1601
03:02:23,175 --> 03:02:24,717
What is it?

1602
03:02:26,425 --> 03:02:28,300
Uh...

1603
03:02:28,383 --> 03:02:31,592
I had a dream,
like, I don't know,

1604
03:02:31,675 --> 03:02:34,300
almost like a premonition.

1605
03:02:34,383 --> 03:02:37,258
It was the end of the world

1606
03:02:37,342 --> 03:02:40,175
and Barry Allen
was right here

1607
03:02:40,258 --> 03:02:44,425
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

1608
03:02:46,967 --> 03:02:50,342
She is... to Superman.

1609
03:02:51,217 --> 03:02:53,342
Every heart has one.

1610
03:02:53,425 --> 03:02:55,508
I think it's something more.

1611
03:02:56,258 --> 03:02:58,258
Something darker.

1612
03:03:02,300 --> 03:03:03,383
Master Wayne.

1613
03:03:03,467 --> 03:03:05,675
Master Wayne!

1614
03:03:05,758 --> 03:03:07,592
You need to see this.

1615
03:03:30,758 --> 03:03:32,550
You fixed it.

1616
03:03:32,633 --> 03:03:34,467
It wanted to fly.

1617
03:03:35,592 --> 03:03:37,008
Flight is its nature.

1618
03:03:37,092 --> 03:03:38,508
Yours, too.

1619
03:03:45,092 --> 03:03:47,175
He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.

1620
03:03:47,258 --> 03:03:49,550
What makes you so sure?

1621
03:03:49,633 --> 03:03:52,383
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1622
03:04:14,425 --> 03:04:16,092
At last.

1623
03:04:17,800 --> 03:04:20,633
Prepare for his arrival.

1624
03:04:22,300 --> 03:04:26,592
My redemption is nigh.

1625
03:04:34,383 --> 03:04:35,925
Unite.

1626
03:04:40,967 --> 03:04:43,592
Synchronize.

1627
03:05:27,675 --> 03:05:29,008
The satellites revealed

1628
03:05:29,092 --> 03:05:30,758
he's created a defensive dome.

1629
03:05:30,842 --> 03:05:32,092
It's a design flaw.

1630
03:05:32,175 --> 03:05:34,425
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.

1631
03:05:34,508 --> 03:05:36,592
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

1632
03:05:36,675 --> 03:05:38,300
Right, probably
'cause he didn't think

1633
03:05:38,383 --> 03:05:40,467
anyone would be that nuts.

1634
03:05:41,342 --> 03:05:42,592
Bruce is right.

1635
03:05:42,675 --> 03:05:44,300
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

1636
03:05:44,383 --> 03:05:46,800
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

1637
03:05:46,883 --> 03:05:48,800
What if the dome's
not destroyed?

1638
03:05:48,883 --> 03:05:50,217
It'll be destroyed.

1639
03:05:50,300 --> 03:05:52,092
Once Victor
is linked with The Unity

1640
03:05:52,175 --> 03:05:53,467
with Barry's help,

1641
03:05:53,550 --> 03:05:55,383
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

1642
03:05:55,467 --> 03:05:57,092
Remind me,
how's that again?

1643
03:05:57,175 --> 03:05:58,633
Uh, with the power of love.

1644
03:05:58,717 --> 03:06:01,758
- Barry.
- With a catastrophic energy surge.

1645
03:06:01,842 --> 03:06:03,175
Good.

1646
03:06:03,258 --> 03:06:05,050
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

1647
03:06:05,133 --> 03:06:07,467
to generate
a charge of that size.

1648
03:06:07,550 --> 03:06:09,800
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

1649
03:06:09,883 --> 03:06:12,883
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

1650
03:06:12,967 --> 03:06:14,883
And, Victor,
it's all up to you.

1651
03:06:14,967 --> 03:06:18,342
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

1652
03:06:18,425 --> 03:06:22,050
Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.

1653
03:06:22,133 --> 03:06:24,008
We have a plan.

1654
03:06:39,050 --> 03:06:41,133
<i>The symbol
of the house of El means hope.</i>

1655
03:06:41,217 --> 03:06:43,467
<i>Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief</i>

1656
03:06:43,550 --> 03:06:47,508
<i>in the potential of every
person to be a force for good.</i>

1657
03:06:47,592 --> 03:06:49,008
<i>Clark...</i>

1658
03:06:49,092 --> 03:06:50,675
<i>That's what
you can bring them.</i>

1659
03:06:50,758 --> 03:06:52,342
<i>...you were
sent here for a reason.</i>

1660
03:06:52,425 --> 03:06:54,050
<i>You will give
the people of Earth</i>

1661
03:06:54,133 --> 03:06:56,217
<i>an ideal to strive towards.</i>

1662
03:06:56,300 --> 03:06:57,467
<i>And even if it takes you</i>

1663
03:06:57,550 --> 03:06:59,217
<i>the rest of your life,</i>

1664
03:06:59,300 --> 03:07:02,467
<i>you owe it to yourself to
find out what that reason is.</i>

1665
03:07:02,550 --> 03:07:05,217
<i>They will stumble,
they will fall.</i>

1666
03:07:05,300 --> 03:07:07,383
<i>You're gonna
have to make a choice.</i>

1667
03:07:07,467 --> 03:07:09,925
<i>They will join you
in the sun, Kal.</i>

1668
03:07:10,008 --> 03:07:12,008
<i>A choice
of whether to stand proud</i>

1669
03:07:12,092 --> 03:07:14,050
<i>in front of the human race
or not.</i>

1670
03:07:14,133 --> 03:07:17,633
<i>You will help them
accomplish wonders.</i>

1671
03:07:34,425 --> 03:07:39,092
<i>All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.</i>

1672
03:07:39,175 --> 03:07:42,675
<i>I'm so proud of you, son.</i>

1673
03:07:42,758 --> 03:07:45,425
<i>Your mother and I
loved you.</i>

1674
03:07:45,508 --> 03:07:47,008
<i>Your mother and I knew</i>

1675
03:07:47,092 --> 03:07:49,300
<i>you would change the world.</i>

1676
03:07:50,383 --> 03:07:53,342
<i>Your heart was tested.</i>

1677
03:07:53,425 --> 03:07:56,050
<i>I know
it's been hard, Clark.</i>

1678
03:07:56,133 --> 03:07:59,092
<i>But you gave hope
to their world.</i>

1679
03:07:59,175 --> 03:08:02,633
<i>You need
to show them who you are.</i>

1680
03:08:02,717 --> 03:08:04,925
<i>Love them, Kal.</i>

1681
03:08:05,008 --> 03:08:07,342
<i>The way we loved you.</i>

1682
03:08:09,633 --> 03:08:10,925
<i>Fly, son.</i>

1683
03:08:11,842 --> 03:08:13,175
<i>It's time.</i>

1684
03:09:16,758 --> 03:09:18,175
I'm gonna take out that tower

1685
03:09:18,258 --> 03:09:20,050
and knock down
that shield dome.

1686
03:09:20,133 --> 03:09:21,383
Whatever you see,

1687
03:09:22,592 --> 03:09:24,675
stick to the plan.

1688
03:09:26,342 --> 03:09:28,467
It's why
I brought you together.

1689
03:10:08,300 --> 03:10:10,300
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

1690
03:10:13,133 --> 03:10:16,133
Just have to knock
a little louder.

1691
03:10:41,008 --> 03:10:42,550
Kill him!

1692
03:10:42,633 --> 03:10:45,633
Get to the carriage.
Defend The Unity.

1693
03:10:50,425 --> 03:10:51,675
Oh, shit.

1694
03:11:11,758 --> 03:11:13,092
The tower's down.

1695
03:11:14,592 --> 03:11:16,508
Do you read me?

1696
03:11:16,592 --> 03:11:17,883
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

1697
03:11:18,758 --> 03:11:20,342
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1698
03:11:21,425 --> 03:11:24,217
<i>Bruce? Bruce?</i>

1699
03:11:24,300 --> 03:11:25,383
Get to the reactor.

1700
03:11:25,467 --> 03:11:26,800
I'll lure as many
of these monsters

1701
03:11:26,883 --> 03:11:29,008
- away from you as I can.
- What does that mean?

1702
03:11:31,758 --> 03:11:33,758
Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.

1703
03:11:36,550 --> 03:11:37,592
They're here.

1704
03:11:37,675 --> 03:11:38,967
<i>Bruce?</i>

1705
03:11:41,883 --> 03:11:43,342
Comm went dead.

1706
03:11:44,967 --> 03:11:46,300
Let's go.

1707
03:12:24,967 --> 03:12:27,050
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

1708
03:13:46,758 --> 03:13:48,175
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1709
03:14:27,967 --> 03:14:29,425
You really are
outta your mind.

1710
03:14:56,217 --> 03:14:57,467
You're welcome.

1711
03:14:57,550 --> 03:14:59,175
My man.

1712
03:16:31,842 --> 03:16:33,550
Yeah, we got this.

1713
03:16:33,633 --> 03:16:35,050
You go do your thing.

1714
03:17:30,842 --> 03:17:32,508
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1715
03:17:34,258 --> 03:17:35,675
Master Kent.

1716
03:17:37,592 --> 03:17:39,217
He said you'd come.

1717
03:17:40,675 --> 03:17:44,342
Now, let's hope
you're not too late.

1718
03:17:54,967 --> 03:17:57,467
Hey!

1719
03:18:05,467 --> 03:18:06,925
Remember me?

1720
03:18:09,342 --> 03:18:10,883
Round two?

1721
03:18:11,467 --> 03:18:12,758
Hell yeah.

1722
03:18:34,133 --> 03:18:35,633
Shall we?

1723
03:18:36,467 --> 03:18:38,717
Tell me, Amazon,

1724
03:18:38,800 --> 03:18:42,883
why did you
abandon your own sisters

1725
03:18:42,967 --> 03:18:45,633
only to cast your lot
with these creatures

1726
03:18:45,717 --> 03:18:49,050
clinging to their puny lives?

1727
03:18:49,133 --> 03:18:52,217
You weren't there
to protect them from me.

1728
03:18:52,300 --> 03:18:54,425
And, sadly, you could have.

1729
03:19:35,300 --> 03:19:37,175
Barry, I'm in position.

1730
03:19:55,717 --> 03:19:59,008
Okay.
I built the charge.

1731
03:19:59,092 --> 03:20:00,258
<i>You call it.</i>

1732
03:20:01,383 --> 03:20:03,217
Barry, on one.

1733
03:20:03,300 --> 03:20:05,592
Three, two...

1734
03:20:08,425 --> 03:20:10,300
Get the hell off me!

1735
03:20:10,383 --> 03:20:11,800
Victor!

1736
03:20:47,758 --> 03:20:49,425
Victor!

1737
03:20:53,092 --> 03:20:55,592
I watched your island burn,

1738
03:20:55,675 --> 03:20:59,300
your sisters
begging for their lives.

1739
03:20:59,383 --> 03:21:02,008
As did your mother.

1740
03:21:02,092 --> 03:21:03,175
Liar.

1741
03:21:28,717 --> 03:21:30,883
I can't maintain this!

1742
03:21:31,675 --> 03:21:32,800
Victor!

1743
03:21:54,842 --> 03:21:57,133
Victor, I can't hold this!

1744
03:22:03,758 --> 03:22:06,133
For Darkseid.

1745
03:22:09,967 --> 03:22:12,467
Not impressed.

1746
03:22:56,925 --> 03:22:58,133
All right.

1747
03:22:58,217 --> 03:22:59,883
Kal-El.

1748
03:23:38,175 --> 03:23:40,508
Barry, I'm connected
to The Unity.

1749
03:23:40,592 --> 03:23:42,758
I need the charge
to get inside.

1750
03:24:04,717 --> 03:24:05,800
Barry?

1751
03:24:06,550 --> 03:24:08,383
Barry, are you okay?

1752
03:24:09,800 --> 03:24:10,967
<i>Barry!</i>

1753
03:24:11,050 --> 03:24:12,258
I got the wind
knocked out of me.

1754
03:24:12,342 --> 03:24:15,050
Need a few seconds,
that's all!

1755
03:24:31,883 --> 03:24:34,592
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!

1756
03:24:34,675 --> 03:24:36,550
Okay, okay.

1757
03:24:36,633 --> 03:24:39,508
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.

1758
03:24:39,592 --> 03:24:41,383
Heal. Heal.

1759
03:25:07,133 --> 03:25:08,800
Barry!

1760
03:25:21,592 --> 03:25:23,425
It's too late.

1761
03:25:24,675 --> 03:25:26,175
Oh, no.

1762
03:25:30,258 --> 03:25:32,050
He's here!

1763
03:26:01,425 --> 03:26:02,675
Okay.

1764
03:26:02,758 --> 03:26:03,842
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.

1765
03:26:03,925 --> 03:26:05,008
Far beyond the speed of light.

1766
03:26:05,092 --> 03:26:06,342
You gotta break the rule,
Barry,

1767
03:26:06,425 --> 03:26:08,550
and you gotta do it now.

1768
03:26:21,425 --> 03:26:23,342
Dad...

1769
03:26:26,967 --> 03:26:29,508
whatever happens,
I want you to know

1770
03:26:32,008 --> 03:26:34,217
your kid was one of them, Dad.

1771
03:26:37,258 --> 03:26:39,342
One of the best of the best.

1772
03:27:34,592 --> 03:27:37,300
Make your own future.

1773
03:27:43,592 --> 03:27:45,717
Make your own past.

1774
03:27:50,217 --> 03:27:53,883
It's all right now.

1775
03:28:40,717 --> 03:28:43,092
We've been waiting
for you, Victor.

1776
03:28:44,092 --> 03:28:46,300
My broken boy.

1777
03:28:48,467 --> 03:28:50,675
You don't have to be
alone anymore.

1778
03:28:50,758 --> 03:28:52,550
We'll be together again.

1779
03:29:00,092 --> 03:29:02,467
we can put it back, Vic.

1780
03:29:06,633 --> 03:29:08,925
Make you whole again.

1781
03:29:20,633 --> 03:29:22,550
I'm not broken.

1782
03:29:32,133 --> 03:29:34,133
And I'm not alone.

1783
03:29:50,800 --> 03:29:51,967
Superman!

1784
03:31:22,508 --> 03:31:24,592
I told you

1785
03:31:26,008 --> 03:31:28,800
Steppenwolf would fail.

1786
03:31:29,592 --> 03:31:33,425
Yes. Yes, you did.

1787
03:31:33,967 --> 03:31:35,217
My master,

1788
03:31:35,300 --> 03:31:39,133
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

1789
03:31:39,217 --> 03:31:43,175
how will you retrieve
your great prize?

1790
03:31:43,258 --> 03:31:46,717
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

1791
03:31:46,800 --> 03:31:51,717
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.

1792
03:31:54,758 --> 03:31:56,383
Ready the armada.

1793
03:31:57,133 --> 03:31:59,758
We will use the old ways.

1794
03:34:23,800 --> 03:34:26,217
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1795
03:34:33,258 --> 03:34:35,800
<i>Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,</i>

1796
03:34:35,883 --> 03:34:37,800
<i>not as a scientist,</i>

1797
03:34:37,883 --> 03:34:39,508
<i>as a father.</i>

1798
03:34:39,592 --> 03:34:42,925
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1799
03:34:45,217 --> 03:34:48,675
<i>I brought you into the world
and back to it.</i>

1800
03:34:48,758 --> 03:34:53,050
<i>You can't imagine how proud
I am of who you are.</i>

1801
03:34:53,133 --> 03:34:54,800
<i>Have always been.</i>

1802
03:34:56,800 --> 03:34:58,175
<i>So many years
with you I wasted.</i>

1803
03:34:58,258 --> 03:35:01,925
<i>So many wrongs
I've left un-righted.</i>

1804
03:35:04,175 --> 03:35:06,592
<i>Everything breaks, Victor.</i>

1805
03:35:06,675 --> 03:35:09,092
<i>Everything changes.</i>

1806
03:35:19,592 --> 03:35:21,842
I gotta go see my father.

1807
03:35:57,217 --> 03:35:59,258
<i>The world is hurt.</i>

1808
03:35:59,342 --> 03:36:00,425
<i>Broken.</i>

1809
03:36:00,508 --> 03:36:02,925
<i>Unexchangeable.</i>

1810
03:36:03,008 --> 03:36:04,800
Ship's
all yours now, kid.

1811
03:36:04,883 --> 03:36:06,342
You're the boss.

1812
03:36:08,383 --> 03:36:11,800
"Ryan Choi,
Director of Nanotechnology."

1813
03:36:11,883 --> 03:36:13,508
That's your thing.

1814
03:36:14,050 --> 03:36:15,967
Uh, yep.

1815
03:36:16,050 --> 03:36:17,758
That's my thing.

1816
03:36:22,508 --> 03:36:26,758
<i>But the world's
not fixed in the past,</i>

1817
03:36:26,842 --> 03:36:28,133
<i>only the future.</i>

1818
03:36:29,842 --> 03:36:33,717
<i>The not yet. The now.</i>

1819
03:36:33,800 --> 03:36:37,383
Wow.
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1820
03:36:37,467 --> 03:36:38,925
Must be.

1821
03:36:39,925 --> 03:36:41,633
Big round table.

1822
03:36:41,717 --> 03:36:44,008
Six chairs, right there.

1823
03:36:45,008 --> 03:36:46,758
But room for more.

1824
03:36:49,050 --> 03:36:50,842
But room for more.

1825
03:36:51,717 --> 03:36:53,550
God help us.

1826
03:36:55,217 --> 03:36:57,383
<i>The now is you.</i>

1827
03:37:01,008 --> 03:37:02,467
What?

1828
03:37:02,550 --> 03:37:05,300
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1829
03:37:05,383 --> 03:37:07,883
But, uh,
my foot's in the door.

1830
03:37:07,967 --> 03:37:09,717
This is like a "job" job?

1831
03:37:10,425 --> 03:37:11,633
"Job" job.

1832
03:37:15,092 --> 03:37:17,883
Your foot's in the door.

1833
03:37:20,008 --> 03:37:21,258
Isn't that a thing people say?

1834
03:37:21,342 --> 03:37:23,258
Your foot's in the door.

1835
03:37:23,342 --> 03:37:25,675
Yeah, that's something
people say, man.

1836
03:37:25,758 --> 03:37:27,342
His foot's in the door!

1837
03:37:27,425 --> 03:37:30,175
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1838
03:37:30,300 --> 03:37:31,592
Taught him nothing he knows.

1839
03:37:31,675 --> 03:37:32,842
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna

1840
03:37:32,925 --> 03:37:34,050
get maced again.

1841
03:37:37,342 --> 03:37:39,217
No stopping you now.

1842
03:37:41,258 --> 03:37:42,550
Thanks, Dad.

1843
03:37:42,633 --> 03:37:43,883
<i>Now.</i>

1844
03:37:43,967 --> 03:37:47,008
<i>Now's your time, Victor,
to rise.</i>

1845
03:37:47,092 --> 03:37:50,133
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1846
03:37:50,217 --> 03:37:53,842
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.

1847
03:38:03,967 --> 03:38:06,925
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1848
03:38:07,008 --> 03:38:09,175
I bought the bank.

1849
03:38:11,425 --> 03:38:14,008
Congratulations, by the way.

1850
03:38:14,092 --> 03:38:15,800
<i>Do this. Be this.</i>

1851
03:38:15,883 --> 03:38:21,133
<i>The man I never was.
The hero you are.</i>

1852
03:38:21,217 --> 03:38:23,550
<i>Take your place
among the brave ones.</i>

1853
03:38:23,633 --> 03:38:28,758
<i>The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.</i>

1854
03:39:01,383 --> 03:39:04,467
<i>It's time you stand,</i>

1855
03:39:08,133 --> 03:39:09,717
<i>fight,</i>

1856
03:39:12,217 --> 03:39:13,758
<i>discover,</i>

1857
03:39:18,383 --> 03:39:20,592
<i>heal, love,</i>

1858
03:39:24,050 --> 03:39:25,217
<i>win.</i>

1859
03:39:51,717 --> 03:39:53,508
<i>The time</i>

1860
03:39:53,592 --> 03:39:55,092
<i>is now.</i>

1861
03:40:04,092 --> 03:40:05,467
Ready?

1862
03:40:05,550 --> 03:40:06,717
Come on, Stevens.

1863
03:40:10,467 --> 03:40:11,883
All right,
let's keep it moving.

1864
03:40:13,675 --> 03:40:14,925
Keep going.

1865
03:40:16,425 --> 03:40:18,508
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1866
03:40:22,092 --> 03:40:23,300
Luthor.

1867
03:40:28,133 --> 03:40:29,300
Open up two, Carl, please.

1868
03:40:38,342 --> 03:40:39,758
Luthor.

1869
03:40:44,550 --> 03:40:46,175
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

1870
03:40:46,258 --> 03:40:48,008
or I'm gonna
have to come in there.

1871
03:42:16,508 --> 03:42:18,550
Ah, there he is.

1872
03:42:19,217 --> 03:42:20,383
Welcome aboard.

1873
03:42:20,467 --> 03:42:22,383
Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?

1874
03:42:22,467 --> 03:42:24,425
I was just celebrating
God's return.

1875
03:42:24,508 --> 03:42:26,967
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1876
03:42:27,050 --> 03:42:29,633
I heard you were
a few clowns short of a circus.

1877
03:42:29,717 --> 03:42:31,342
I was, thank you,

1878
03:42:31,425 --> 03:42:33,675
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

1879
03:42:33,758 --> 03:42:35,842
find some much needed clarity.

1880
03:42:35,925 --> 03:42:38,258
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

1881
03:42:38,342 --> 03:42:39,383
free of charge.

1882
03:42:39,467 --> 03:42:41,258
Why the pro bono work?

1883
03:42:41,342 --> 03:42:43,342
It's personal.

1884
03:42:43,425 --> 03:42:46,425
Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?

1885
03:42:48,258 --> 03:42:50,050
You said you had something
I'd want?

1886
03:42:50,133 --> 03:42:51,550
You'd better not be
wasting my time.

1887
03:42:51,633 --> 03:42:53,842
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

1888
03:42:53,925 --> 03:42:55,717
No, I wouldn't think of it.

1889
03:42:55,800 --> 03:42:57,175
Uh, I have too much
to live for.

1890
03:42:57,258 --> 03:43:00,342
And more important things
to do.

1891
03:43:00,425 --> 03:43:03,883
But if you want the Batman,

1892
03:43:03,967 --> 03:43:07,342
here is something
that can help you.

1893
03:43:08,508 --> 03:43:12,800
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1894
03:43:15,842 --> 03:43:18,425
Hmm. On second thought,

1895
03:43:20,508 --> 03:43:22,675
we do have something
to celebrate.

1896
03:43:23,717 --> 03:43:25,217
Good boy.

1897
03:44:29,467 --> 03:44:30,758
Clear.

1898
03:44:36,133 --> 03:44:37,758
How much further?

1899
03:44:38,883 --> 03:44:40,217
We're almost there.

1900
03:44:42,300 --> 03:44:43,800
Well, we need to hurry.

1901
03:44:43,883 --> 03:44:45,633
We can't be out in the open
much longer.

1902
03:44:45,717 --> 03:44:47,467
He'll come for us.

1903
03:44:50,258 --> 03:44:52,300
Let him come.

1904
03:44:52,383 --> 03:44:54,175
Let the bastard come.

1905
03:44:55,383 --> 03:44:57,550
I'll stab this
through his heart

1906
03:44:57,633 --> 03:44:59,967
for what he did to Arthur.

1907
03:45:00,050 --> 03:45:02,133
I want to make him pay.

1908
03:45:03,592 --> 03:45:06,342
I understand
how you feel, Mera.

1909
03:45:06,425 --> 03:45:09,342
You have no idea how I feel.

1910
03:45:09,425 --> 03:45:11,300
But we have to
stick to the plan

1911
03:45:11,383 --> 03:45:13,800
to have any chance
to make this right.

1912
03:45:21,592 --> 03:45:25,133
Who have you ever loved?

1913
03:45:38,967 --> 03:45:42,425
<i>Au contraire,</i>
my little fish stick.

1914
03:45:45,967 --> 03:45:47,633
He knows exactly
what it's like

1915
03:45:47,717 --> 03:45:49,592
to lose someone he loves.

1916
03:45:51,467 --> 03:45:53,842
You know, like, uh,

1917
03:45:55,092 --> 03:45:56,550
a father,

1918
03:45:57,883 --> 03:45:59,967
like a mother.

1919
03:46:00,050 --> 03:46:03,383
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

1920
03:46:04,883 --> 03:46:07,050
Like an adopted son.

1921
03:46:10,675 --> 03:46:12,425
Isn't that right,

1922
03:46:13,842 --> 03:46:15,425
Batman?

1923
03:46:18,550 --> 03:46:19,842
Maybe, in a way,

1924
03:46:19,925 --> 03:46:21,883
that smelly
old flounder is right.

1925
03:46:23,467 --> 03:46:26,258
Because how many
can die in your arms

1926
03:46:26,342 --> 03:46:28,008
before you grow numb to death?

1927
03:46:29,467 --> 03:46:32,425
That's not very careful.

1928
03:46:32,508 --> 03:46:36,258
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

1929
03:46:36,342 --> 03:46:39,175
before you die inside
yourself?

1930
03:46:39,258 --> 03:46:43,092
I've been dead inside
a long time,

1931
03:46:43,175 --> 03:46:45,050
but even I have a limit.

1932
03:46:45,133 --> 03:46:47,050
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

1933
03:46:47,133 --> 03:46:50,092
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

1934
03:46:50,175 --> 03:46:52,092
You won't kill me.

1935
03:46:52,842 --> 03:46:55,008
I'm your best friend.

1936
03:46:55,092 --> 03:46:59,467
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?

1937
03:47:01,342 --> 03:47:02,842
Anyway,

1938
03:47:04,008 --> 03:47:05,675
you need me.

1939
03:47:06,633 --> 03:47:08,425
You

1940
03:47:08,508 --> 03:47:11,425
need me to help you
undo this world

1941
03:47:11,508 --> 03:47:14,425
you created
by letting her die.

1942
03:47:16,883 --> 03:47:18,800
Poor Lois.

1943
03:47:18,883 --> 03:47:21,842
How she suffered so!

1944
03:47:27,592 --> 03:47:29,842
I often wonder

1945
03:47:29,925 --> 03:47:31,758
how many
alternate timelines

1946
03:47:31,842 --> 03:47:34,258
do you destroy
the world because...

1947
03:47:35,258 --> 03:47:36,800
frankly, you don't have

1948
03:47:36,883 --> 03:47:39,592
the cojones to die yourself.

1949
03:47:40,508 --> 03:47:42,008
Hmm?

1950
03:47:44,050 --> 03:47:45,258
So, as usual,

1951
03:47:45,342 --> 03:47:47,967
I'll be the bigger man.

1952
03:47:51,717 --> 03:47:53,258
A truce,

1953
03:47:54,008 --> 03:47:55,758
Bruce.

1954
03:47:57,925 --> 03:48:02,258
As long as you
have this card, a truce.

1955
03:48:05,133 --> 03:48:06,175
But all you have to do

1956
03:48:06,258 --> 03:48:07,425
is tear it in half

1957
03:48:07,508 --> 03:48:09,008
and I'm happy
to discuss with you

1958
03:48:09,092 --> 03:48:11,675
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

1959
03:48:13,258 --> 03:48:15,258
to do a man's job?

1960
03:48:18,508 --> 03:48:20,342
You know, it's funny

1961
03:48:20,425 --> 03:48:21,842
that you would talk
about people

1962
03:48:21,925 --> 03:48:23,508
who died in my arms

1963
03:48:23,592 --> 03:48:25,383
because when I held
Harley Quinn

1964
03:48:25,467 --> 03:48:28,008
and she was bleeding
and dying,

1965
03:48:28,092 --> 03:48:31,800
she begged me
with her last breath

1966
03:48:31,883 --> 03:48:34,092
that when I killed you,

1967
03:48:34,175 --> 03:48:37,842
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...

1968
03:48:37,925 --> 03:48:39,925
that I'd do it slow.

1969
03:48:40,967 --> 03:48:43,092
I'm gonna honor that promise.

1970
03:49:13,550 --> 03:49:16,425
Oh. You're good.

1971
03:49:20,633 --> 03:49:22,342
You almost had me.

1972
03:49:41,633 --> 03:49:42,758
Where are we holing up?

1973
03:49:42,842 --> 03:49:45,383
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

1974
03:49:45,467 --> 03:49:48,425
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

1975
03:49:48,508 --> 03:49:51,300
what do you think?

1976
03:49:57,258 --> 03:49:58,383
He's found us.

1977
03:51:27,467 --> 03:51:30,008
Can I help you?

1978
03:51:30,092 --> 03:51:33,717
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

1979
03:51:33,800 --> 03:51:36,925
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

1980
03:51:37,008 --> 03:51:39,967
We have to find it
before he does.

1981
03:51:40,050 --> 03:51:41,967
There's a war coming.

1982
03:51:42,050 --> 03:51:43,883
And I'm here to help.

1983
03:51:43,967 --> 03:51:46,300
I'm sorry, who are you again?

1984
03:51:46,383 --> 03:51:48,508
I've gone by many names

1985
03:51:48,592 --> 03:51:51,883
and taken many forms.
And like you,

1986
03:51:51,967 --> 03:51:54,717
I've realized I have
a stake in this world

1987
03:51:54,800 --> 03:51:57,508
and it's time
I started fighting for it.

1988
03:51:58,175 --> 03:51:59,383
Oh.

1989
03:52:00,800 --> 03:52:03,133
Well, we could
definitely use the help.

1990
03:52:03,217 --> 03:52:06,633
So, glad you're here.

1991
03:52:07,717 --> 03:52:08,800
You know, I never thought

1992
03:52:08,883 --> 03:52:09,925
I'd see
the defenders of Earth

1993
03:52:10,008 --> 03:52:13,008
united and fighting as one.

1994
03:52:13,092 --> 03:52:15,758
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

1995
03:52:16,967 --> 03:52:19,592
Your mother and father
would be proud.

1996
03:52:20,842 --> 03:52:22,133
I hope so.

1997
03:52:28,008 --> 03:52:31,133
Well, I'll be in touch.

1998
03:52:32,008 --> 03:52:36,133
Oh, and some have called me

1999
03:52:36,217 --> 03:52:38,675
the Martian Manhunter.

2000
03:52:46,175 --> 03:52:48,758
I guess I'll see you around.

2001
03:53:28,951 --> 03:53:33,951
