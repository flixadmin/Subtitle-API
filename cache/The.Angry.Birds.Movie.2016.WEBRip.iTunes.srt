1
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,237
Okay.

2
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,322
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

3
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,533
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

4
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,784
Come on, let's go. Let's go, buddy.

5
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,661
Come on, come on, we gotta move,
we gotta move.

6
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,711
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

7
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,296
No, no, no, no, no!

8
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,390
Hey! Hey! Gotcha!

9
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,859
I don't like it! I don't like it!

10
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,082
Beak! Wing! Tail!

11
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,167
Ribs!

12
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,919
Giblets!

13
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,508
I'm flying!

14
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,634
Nope, still can't fly.

15
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,555
I cannot believe this.

16
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,724
Breathe, breathe.

17
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,063
Bottom feeder.

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,898
Up and over!

19
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,155
Ta-da!

20
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,448
No, no, no, no.

21
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,450
Look. It's okay. I'm just a clown.

22
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,785
Oh, boy.

23
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,372
That's a loud... Loud...
You're very scared of me.

24
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,166
Here, come here. Nope. Okay. Nope.
Never mind.

25
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,292
Happy hatchday!

26
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,377
Hi, pal.

27
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,756
You must be so disappointed
in yourself for being this late.

28
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,799
No. No, no, no, no.

29
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,092
I'm not late. Look at the time.

30
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,927
See, the order said before noon.

31
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,306
Okay, now you're late.

32
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,267
-What?
-Where have you been?

33
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,394
-It's funny you ask. You see, I was...
-You missed the party.

34
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,187
-What is that?
-That.

35
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,772
Yes, see, I fell on the box.

36
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,983
The squirrel?

37
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,276
That's on us.

38
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,862
You know, I tried to keep my body
between the ground and the box,

39
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,697
but, you know, I think I got a little bruise.

40
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,365
See anything back there?

41
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,575
Hear that, honey?

42
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:24,162
The clown we paid to be here an hour ago
fell on our son's hatchday cake.

43
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,165
That's why our son's hatchday party
is ruined!

44
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,919
And the next time you mess up,
don't tell me a story,

45
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,006
just take responsibility.

46
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,549
Hey, man, it wasn't a story.

47
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,928
"I'm a screwup that woke up late
and fell on the thing you paid for!"

48
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,973
-It wasn't a story. I almost drowned.
-"I'm really bad at my job and I'm late..."

49
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,433
Why don't we just settle this out

50
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,226
-and say the cake's on you.
-You.

51
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,359
I'm sorry, it's on me?

52
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,111
Well, who else would it be on?

53
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,073
Well, you know, I...

54
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,827
I'm not sure you're gonna like this,
but since you asked.

55
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,372
Rather than being on me, as you suggested,

56
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,249
this cake is on you!

57
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,338
So, you wanna hear a story?

58
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,839
I run my butt off, literally, mind you,

59
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,051
to get the "gluten-free cake."

60
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,552
What the heck is gluten?

61
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,846
I mean, does gluten even exist?

62
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,348
Who are you?

63
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,432
Get outta here!

64
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,392
Already? But you're the only one
that's had cake.

65
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,477
What...

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,271
That's good stuff.

67
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,649
Anybody want to eat some cake
off their dad or husband?

68
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,652
Who needs plates
when you got this guy's face, right?

69
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,737
Wait. I almost forgot.

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,323
You know, I'm supposed to do
a quick customer satisfaction survey

71
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,033
before I split, okay?

72
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,286
So, on a scale of one to three stars,
what would you say about my performance?

73
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,414
And don't forget, the squirrel was free...

74
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,755
-Sorry about this!
-No!

75
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,217
My bad.

76
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,064
Congratulations!

77
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,400
It's a boy!

78
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,764
Hey, Eyebrows.

79
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,230
Eyebrows!

80
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,607
Eyebrows!

81
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:11,223
Your Honour, our family has
always practised natural childhatch.

82
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,852
The risks of having
a scrambled infant are too great.

83
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,020
There was going to be music,

84
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,232
the nest was going to be full of
beautiful, fresh-cut flowers.

85
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:24,236
And the first two faces he was going to see

86
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,364
were the loving faces
of his mother and his father.

87
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,619
We can never get that moment back.

88
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,790
Ma'am, I never wanted my face to be
the first face your baby saw.

89
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,458
I mean, what are we talking about here?

90
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,294
He probably doesn't even remember me.

91
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,212
Daddy!

92
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,298
No, no, no. No. Shut up.

93
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,382
Shut up.

94
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,550
Cool it.

95
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,138
Ladies and gentlemen,
am I a passionate bird?

96
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,264
Yes.

97
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,557
Guilty as can be.

98
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,767
It was a quality cake.

99
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,855
Look, I worked very hard
to get it there on time

100
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,066
and he wouldn't even try it!

101
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:08,071
Mr Red, we are
a happy, happy bird community.

102
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,741
Under the protection of Mighty Eagle,

103
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,579
we work, we play, we laugh, we love,

104
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,874
and we live our lives
free from conflict and strife, sir.

105
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,251
We love the sound
of our own voice, too, evidently.

106
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,963
Perhaps you never heard the joke,
"Why don't birds fly?"

107
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,298
I'm gonna tell you why.

108
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,176
Because where else
would we ever wanna go?

109
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,263
-It gets me every time, guys!
-Not a good joke.

110
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,600
So now, what am I to make
of the likes of you?

111
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,895
There seems to be a recurring issue here.

112
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,563
Anger.

113
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,940
I don't think I have an anger issue.

114
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,650
I think you got an anger issue.

115
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,865
Anger is a weed growing in our garden.

116
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,494
And what do you do when you find a weed?

117
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:58,121
I don't know, but I bet you're gonna tell me.

118
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,915
You pluck it out!

119
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,792
Oh, my God.

120
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,921
Mr Red, when you moved your house
outside of our village,

121
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,924
did you notice that nobody tried to stop you?

122
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:15,264
Birds, they may smile at you on the street,
but that doesn't mean they like you.

123
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,476
Hey, you know what?
I got a question for you.

124
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,063
Are you aware that that robe
that you're wearing isn't fooling anybody?

125
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:27,359
We all see ya prancing along the street,
Your Honour!

126
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,863
And you're, what, and I'm just
approximating here, like, an inch tall?

127
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,447
You... What are you doing?

128
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,490
Voilà!

129
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:36,994
What the...

130
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,579
Daddy!

131
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,707
Mr Red, given the severity of the crimes,

132
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:48,005
I have no choice but to impose
the maximum penalty allowed by the law.

133
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,009
Anger management class.

134
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,761
Pluck my life.

135
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,141
Fresh worms caught today.

136
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,517
Hey, Red. How are ya?

137
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,810
I'm horrible.

138
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:02,853
Hi, Red.

139
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,021
It's good to see you!

140
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,523
-I wish I could say the same.
-Get your worms here!

141
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,941
Upsy-daisy!

142
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,194
Thank you.

143
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,283
Let's go.

144
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,578
How are you, Susie? You good?

145
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,413
No running. No running.

146
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,249
Come on.

147
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,211
Hey, how's that nap schedule coming along?

148
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,629
Oh, boy.

149
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,548
You guys ever thought about bird control?

150
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,176
Left, right, left, right.

151
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,636
There ya go.

152
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,891
Hey, hey.

153
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,775
All right.

154
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,735
Shirley.

155
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:52,903
Girly, you got this.

156
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,696
We don't want you to fall, now.
Take your time.

157
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,074
Here we go. That's it.

158
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:00,953
You're doing it!

159
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,288
Seriously?

160
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,581
I'm almost there.

161
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,295
Nope.

162
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,602
Pigeon pose.

163
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,064
Crane pose.

164
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,275
Okay, we worked out.

165
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,776
Who's down for a froyo?

166
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,361
Froyo.

167
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,196
"Mighty Mighty Eagle, soaring free.

168
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,948
"Defender of our homes and liberty!"

169
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,074
Hi, Red.

170
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,617
Is one of those yours?

171
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,702
What?

172
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,579
Yeah, when birds fly.

173
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,747
"Mighty Eagle is a legend."

174
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,336
You think that's funny?

175
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,504
This is funny!

176
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:41,470
Come on!

177
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:56,902
What?

178
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,465
Don't look, Bobby.

179
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,759
The anger might be contagious.

180
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,177
Let's go!

181
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,389
-He started it.
-                Move it, move it! Don't look back!

182
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,058
There you go.

183
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,323
Look at this.

184
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,158
This is gonna be awful.

185
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,246
Okay, I guess that's art.

186
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,248
That's garbage.

187
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,126
And that's exotic.

188
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,964
"Free rage" what?

189
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,048
Hi!

190
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,592
-Hi there! Welcome...
-Hello.

191
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,844
...to the Infinity Acceptance group.

192
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,345
-I am Matilda.
-Okay.

193
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:09,808
And I'm just super psyched
to be taking this journey with you!

194
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,186
You're gonna have a blast.

195
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,770
I'm really fun.

196
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,606
Everybody says that about me.

197
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,107
Hey, guys.

198
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,567
Say hello to Red, everyone.

199
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,610
Hello!

200
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,570
Hi, Red.

201
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,572
Hello, birds I won't get to know well.

202
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,200
Hey, apparently somebody didn't get
the memo that we like to start on time

203
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,284
because you're about two minutes late.

204
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,327
Don't let it happen again.

205
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,411
Hi, my name is Chuck.

206
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:30,454
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

207
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,705
I like you a lot. I can tell.

208
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,165
Okay.

209
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:37,252
Now, Red, would you like to
share your story with us?

210
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,462
No, not really.

211
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,465
Well, the court mentioned
something about a rage episode

212
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,842
at a child's birthday party.

213
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,053
How long is this class, anyway?

214
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,472
As long as you make it.

215
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,140
Really? Okay.

216
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:53,810
Gentlemen, very nice to see you,
and to almost meet you.

217
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,687
Probably the nicest part of it
is not getting to meet you,

218
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,439
you know, in some weird way.

219
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,358
All right, so I'm gonna go ahead

220
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:03,070
and scoot on back out
past those creepy statues and...

221
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,988
Back you go.

222
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,115
Sure. No, I can take a seat.

223
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,201
So, in another sense,

224
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:15,040
you are here until I notify the court
that your anger issues have been resolved.

225
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,417
Oh, boy.

226
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,502
Chuck!

227
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,045
Share your story with Red.

228
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,214
Me? I am the last guy who should be here.

229
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,674
Simple speeding ticket.

230
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,511
Judge tells me I was going too fast,
so I say, "Your Honour, to be honest, I was.

231
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:28,595
"You caught me."

232
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,180
I'm not angry. I'm honest.

233
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,349
So, shouldn't I be in
honesty management class?

234
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,643
'Cause we gotta manage my honesty.

235
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,524
My one problem, that's a different story
than you told last time.

236
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,302
Drinks on me, guys!

237
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,728
Chuck?

238
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,730
Okay, maybe it wasn't ice cream.

239
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,732
All right, Chuck, thanks. We got it.

240
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,359
And this is Terence.

241
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,280
More like terrifying.

242
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,241
Now, it says here, in your little filey...

243
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:48,550
Terence seems to have had an incident.

244
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:52,304
Now, Bomb started with us two weeks ago.

245
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,223
Tell us your story, Bomb.

246
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:55,974
Okay.

247
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,435
Well, sometimes when I get upset,

248
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:02,856
I have been known to blow up.

249
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,943
So, like... Like, what, like,
you get mad, you mean?

250
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,236
Well, no.

251
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,070
I literally blow up, okay?

252
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,615
I explode like a bomb.

253
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,996
Hence the name.

254
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,125
Surprise!

255
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,798
Excuse me.

256
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,132
Party foul.

257
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,470
Do it!

258
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,555
No can do.

259
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,306
I just went boom-boom before class.

260
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,558
Hey, look, I don't want to be here at all,

261
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:41,353
but this can maybe make it a little more
interesting to me, so please, explode.

262
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,729
You can't do it, can you?

263
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,983
Yes, I can, but I'm having back issues today.

264
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,318
So, I'm gonna have to take a rain check.

265
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,736
Do it!

266
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,154
Not the time or place, little amigo.

267
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,115
These guys are all nuts, huh, big man?

268
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,996
Are we speaking telepathically,
or you're just...

269
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,666
Good talk.

270
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,586
Nice chatting with you.

271
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:10,132
Today we're gonna be working on
managing our anger through movement.

272
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,428
The first pose is the dancer pose.

273
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,930
Great form, Terence.

274
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,140
Eagle! Heron!

275
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,183
Peacock! Warrior!

276
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,351
Mountain! Tree! Rabbit! Fish! Locust!
King pigeon!

277
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:22,978
And of course, downward duck.

278
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,232
Excuse me, boring hippie lady.

279
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,026
Looks like the explodey guy's gonna puke.

280
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,777
And have you done this before?

281
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,696
Yes, I have, but usually not for free.

282
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,239
Didn't think so.

283
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,949
-Awesome.
-And how are we doing over here, Bomb?

284
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,660
Doing wonderful. Stretching out the core.

285
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:44,124
Just remember to breathe up
through your feathers and from your talons.

286
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,043
Namaste.

287
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:47,961
Bomb?

288
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,842
Nice!

289
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,553
I don't know what happened.

290
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,556
I was doing the poses, I was feeling all Zen,

291
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,018
Matilda was digging it,
then I lost my grip on it.

292
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,062
Let it slip and it just squeaked out.

293
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,230
Hey, so, where we going?

294
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,940
I'm sorry. "We"?

295
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,024
Yes, we.

296
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,402
There's a new happiness exhibit
at the Museum of Happiness

297
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,279
that I'm dying to see.

298
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,531
You know what?

299
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,366
I... I mean, I got a... I got a thing.

300
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,408
A thing?

301
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,369
Like a disease?

302
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,120
Is it bird flu? Chicken pox?

303
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,413
Cardinal sin?

304
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,959
No, by "thing," I mean, like,
desire not to hang out.

305
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,043
With you.

306
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,880
Yeah, well...
You know, may be for the best, you know,

307
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,633
because I got something, too.

308
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,510
How did I forget?

309
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,680
Even if you'd said yes,
I probably couldn't have gone.

310
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,974
I'm busy, too.

311
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:49,439
I have a business offer deal that is...

312
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,441
No, Bomb, you're not good at this, buddy.

313
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:55,070
It's... It's charming up to a point,
and now it's just sad.

314
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,781
It's a guy I know.

315
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:02,119
And he's opening up a brand-new luxury

316
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,705
class reunion.

317
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,123
Okay.

318
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,417
Good. Good, good, good.

319
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,252
Well, looks like it's just us.

320
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,879
Want to go get a bite?

321
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:15,799
But what about your "class reunion"
where everybody brings a "business offer"?

322
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,801
No, no, no.

323
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,553
Chuck, I was lying.

324
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,846
I'm sorry if I fooled you.

325
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,353
No means no.

326
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,398
My sweetheart.

327
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,525
Cheers.

328
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,236
Hey!

329
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,946
Get over here!

330
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,948
Hey, peckerhead!

331
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,825
What's up?

332
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,835
I felt a peck!

333
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,524
This is the legendary Mighty Eagle,

334
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:18,028
our protector and hero,
but no one has seen him for years.

335
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,697
Mighty Eagle is missing.

336
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,534
When's Mighty Eagle gonna come back?

337
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,913
Eyebrows, didn't your parents ever tell you
Mighty Eagle isn't real?

338
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,207
He doesn't know that.

339
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,709
-He doesn't have parents.
-Yeah.

340
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,586
Or even friends.

341
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:25,596
Eureka!

342
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,560
Say bye to Daddy.

343
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:32,728
Bye-bye!

344
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,229
-Goodbye, hatchlings.
-Bye!

345
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,106
Have a happy day!

346
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:37,774
Good morning!

347
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:38,942
Morning, Your Honour.

348
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:41,904
Here you go.

349
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:43,614
Bless you.

350
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,747
-Yes!
-Bye!

351
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,873
Daddy's making dinner!

352
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:57,586
"If my name were Bobby
Would you ask about my hobbies?

353
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:01,298
"Or if my name were Judas
Would you ask me what my mood is?

354
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:05,385
"I laugh, I cry, I love, I hate

355
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:09,890
"I do so much more than detonate"

356
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,309
Think about it.

357
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,686
That was beautiful.

358
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,522
You're gonna make me cry!

359
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,358
Yeah, that was some real clever symbolism.

360
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,444
Red, why don't we hear your poem?

361
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:23,737
I don't have a poem.

362
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,322
Why not?

363
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:27,699
Because I didn't write one.

364
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,117
Right.

365
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,537
And is there a reason?

366
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,829
Well, you know, I was gonna do it,

367
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:37,042
but then I thought about it and I realised,
"This is a huge waste of my time."

368
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,168
So, I didn't do it.

369
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,671
Deep breath, deep breath.

370
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,130
Deep breath!

371
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,551
And we're back in the now.

372
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,595
Chuck! You've had your hand up
the whole time.

373
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,683
My poem is about a hate crime.

374
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,064
No.

375
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,608
Lot of sickos out there. Lot of sickos.

376
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:05,988
"What, oh, what did I make you of?

377
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,739
"I made you out of love

378
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:09,408
"But wait, too late!

379
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,368
"Now I see your fate

380
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,539
"Some very troubled somebody
Destroyed you out of hate

381
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:21,044
"What could have made him so despise

382
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,380
"Your happy smile, your laughing eyes?

383
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,593
"Your soul was pure, your heart was true

384
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,429
"And someone hated that

385
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,222
"But who?"

386
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:39,646
Terence.

387
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,902
Yeah, I deserved that.

388
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:49,573
Billy has passed
to a higher plane of existence.

389
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,491
Everyone, join wings.

390
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,745
Let us all say our goodbyes.

391
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,955
Yeah, let me get in here. I gotta say goodbye.

392
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,040
Okay.

393
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,168
Okay. You know,
I'll just mourn from back here.

394
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,252
That's fine.

395
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:03,921
You know, if there's one thing
Billy always hated,

396
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,215
-it was goodbyes.
-Hey, what's going on out there?

397
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,426
Class dismissed.

398
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:12,304
Very moving.

399
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:13,764
Come on, everybody! Let's go!

400
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,140
Hey, where's everybody going?

401
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:16,767
Hurry! Something's coming!

402
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,352
Last one to the beach is a rotten egg!

403
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:19,436
Let's go!

404
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,563
Coming through! Pardon me! Excuse me!

405
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,609
What?

406
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,281
Again?

407
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,242
Let's get down to the beach!

408
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,618
Follow the trail!

409
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,453
Last one there is a rotten eggy!

410
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:37,496
What?

411
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,257
Didn't mean to photobomb you.
Sorry about that.

412
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:51,677
What is that thing?

413
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,305
It looks like a UFO.
An Unidentified Floating Object.

414
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,266
Daddy!

415
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,309
Stop it. No, I'm not your daddy!

416
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,103
What is that?

417
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,605
-Look at the size of that thing!
-Where's it going?

418
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,858
I don't know, but it's not stopping.

419
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:10,821
My house, my house.

420
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:12,823
Slow down!

421
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:13,907
Stop!

422
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:31,049
What the...

423
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:38,056
That house took me five years to build.

424
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,561
It's such a shame when you create something
and someone just destroys it.

425
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,023
Ladies and gentlemen,

426
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,984
we have a very special guest for you!

427
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,112
-He's a green marine sailing machine.
-Careful, now.

428
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:55,199
And he's keen to let you know he's not mean!

429
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:59,828
Put your wings together for Leonard!

430
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,165
Thank you so much.

431
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,501
Please hold your applause.

432
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,296
Greetings from my world!

433
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,798
The world of the pigs.

434
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,258
What's a pig?

435
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:15,886
I am a pig.

436
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:22,309
Unbelievable.

437
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,727
Unbelievable.

438
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:26,355
Where we going?

439
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,731
Wrong way.

440
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,566
Oopsie. Not working.

441
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,236
We practised this 100 times.

442
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,112
-Oh, man.
-Give it to me.

443
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,906
We're gonna come in again.

444
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:37,407
I'm so sorry.

445
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,747
My name is Leonard,
but my friends call me Chuckles.

446
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,250
Very generous!

447
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,253
-Thank...
-We mean no harm.

448
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:53,340
We saw your island across the sea,
and we thought,

449
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,133
"Wonder what they're up to."

450
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,469
But there's no other place besides here.

451
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:58,762
-Yes, there is.
-Stop it!

452
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,722
-And we are from there.
-Please stop!

453
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,891
We call it Piggy Island.

454
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,560
Oh, my God.

455
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,272
P-I-double-G-Y Island.

456
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:09,982
Who else is out there?

457
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,235
My first officer, Ross, and I
have sailed everywhere.

458
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:16,029
One brave soul against the sea.

459
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,114
And Ross.

460
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,156
Excuse me.

461
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,535
Have you come to smash
all of our houses or just mine?

462
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,453
Oh, man!

463
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,122
Somebody want a gift basket?

464
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,165
Please, please, don't be afraid.

465
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:31,211
My partner and I request
the honour of your friendship.

466
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:33,213
Ross, show 'em how we do it.

467
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:35,799
Don't worry, he's had all his shots.

468
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,217
We're all friends now!

469
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:38,302
Hi, friends.

470
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,139
Not a hugger.

471
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,186
Welcome to Bird Island!

472
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:49,938
Welcome to our new friends, the pigs.

473
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,816
Let us have a celebration!

474
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,860
-Put 'er there!
-Welcome!

475
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,196
-Sorry.
-And a hoof to a wing.

476
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,325
We would like to honour the pigs
with a special performance.

477
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,915
Watch out. Shakin' my bacon!

478
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,208
They don't have feathers?

479
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,168
You know, they're just
walking around naked,

480
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,419
just presenting themselves.

481
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,213
I'm looking at all their business here.

482
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:16,048
That part about them I really admire.

483
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:19,843
Now we would like to welcome
our special guests, the pigs!

484
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:21,720
All right!

485
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,848
Thank you for your kindness and hospitality.

486
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,059
Our king sends his warmest regards.

487
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,185
"King"?

488
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:32,814
You have shared with us the wonders
of your quaint, simple little island.

489
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,525
Drop the banner, Ross!

490
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,906
Now we would love to humbly share
some of the wonders of our world.

491
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:43,033
Yeah. Humble, my bird butt.

492
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:44,284
Language.

493
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:47,037
A hundred years from now, everyone will ask,

494
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,707
"How did the friendship between
the pigs and the birds start?"

495
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,001
-Who cares?
-Oh, no.

496
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:57,047
Well, let them say we lit up the night!

497
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,051
Holy moly!

498
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,264
Yeah!

499
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:08,475
Hey, look, they destroyed more of the stuff
we worked hard to build.

500
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,227
-But there's more!
-More?

501
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,437
Has gravity gone haywire?

502
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,356
No! Even better!

503
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,568
Your friends, the pigs, proudly give you

504
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,571
the trampoline!

505
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,574
-Those are my assistants, Oinky...
-Hello.

506
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,409
...and Jon Ham!

507
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,451
Hold on a second.

508
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,453
I thought there was only supposed to be
two of these guys.

509
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:29,913
Squad goals!

510
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,374
Look at those jiggly pigglies!

511
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,459
But that's not all.

512
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:37,087
Throwing things just got a whole lot easier.

513
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:39,047
Say hello to

514
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,884
the slingshot!

515
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,428
-I can't see.
-This is crazy!

516
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,930
-Tired of carrying things from place to place?
-Yeah!

517
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:49,933
-Wish you could just get it there?
-Yeah!

518
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:51,393
-Well, now you can!
-How?

519
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:52,644
Waiters, do me a favour.

520
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:54,271
-Take the rest of the night off.
-Thank you.

521
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,773
Hey, if you got the night off,
why don't you fix my house!

522
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,067
Yeah, it's the same guy.

523
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,614
Well, the slingshot
does it all in three easy steps.

524
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:06,992
Ready, aim, fire!

525
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,076
I got it!

526
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,494
Incredible!

527
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,331
-Flown in fresh!
-Me! Me! I want fruit!

528
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,126
Guys, it's the same fruit sitting
on the plates in front of you.

529
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,962
-Watch out for that pineapple.
-Somebody, please...

530
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,174
And now for our last gift to you.

531
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,051
Shut up and fix my house!

532
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:25,677
We don't know him.

533
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,974
I'm going to ask for
a volunteer from the audience.

534
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,392
Pick me!

535
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:33,477
Who should I pick?

536
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,270
-Who, who, who?
-Pick me, Mr Pig!

537
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:38,690
How about the red guy
with the enormous eyebrows?

538
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:39,816
Me?

539
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:42,486
-Yeah!
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

540
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:43,987
Yes, you, sir.

541
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,113
Come on up here.

542
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,448
It's your lucky day!

543
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,658
Are you sure you don't want to choose

544
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,660
one of the hundreds of birds
that had their wings up?

545
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,078
-Get him up here!
-Come on, Red!

546
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,329
Have some fun!

547
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:54,623
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

548
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:56,458
He's shy.

549
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,501
You hear that?

550
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:58,627
They're cheering for you.

551
00:31:58,669 --> 00:31:59,962
You gotta be kidding me.

552
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,297
Red guy with the eyebrows!

553
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,175
I would've sat closer had I known
that I was gonna be part of the show.

554
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:06,885
Okay, now what?

555
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,846
Come on, give him a hand.

556
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:10,639
Right this way. Come on.

557
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:11,849
Relax. Be brave.

558
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,017
-Ready!
-Who, me? Yeah, no, I'm ready.

559
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,644
-Aim!
-Aim at what?

560
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,354
-Everybody on this one.
-Fire!

561
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,776
Who says birds don't fly?

562
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,653
This seems really unnatural!

563
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,655
I hope he's okay.

564
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,081
Hey, don't worry!

565
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,416
I'm fine!

566
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,001
Thanks for the lift!

567
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:41,170
I wish they would have done that
10 minutes ago.

568
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,886
You know you want to search their boat.

569
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:50,554
What? No, I don't.

570
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:53,056
Yeah, you're right, I do.

571
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:55,058
Bomb's on his way.

572
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,354
Come on. Let's go.

573
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,232
And remember, keep it quiet.

574
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,194
Yeah.

575
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,866
-This is an impressive ship!
-No. Inside voice.

576
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,117
Inside voice.

577
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:13,202
Come on.

578
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:14,328
Sorry.

579
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:17,873
Piggy fitness.

580
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,833
I don't know.

581
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,180
Very strange.

582
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,895
Who are these weirdos?

583
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:48,278
What are you doing?
We're trying to sneak around.

584
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:50,531
We didn't rent this place out.

585
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:51,949
You can rent this place?

586
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,116
Give me that!

587
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,748
Hey, you guys!

588
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,375
No.

589
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:05,003
Looks like there's
some more stuff down here.

590
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:11,635
We were hiding.

591
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,266
When I say, "Hey!" you say, "Ho!"

592
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,809
-Hey!
-Ho!

593
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,310
-Hey!
-Ho!

594
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,603
-Hey!
-Ho!

595
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,146
There's more of them!

596
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,188
Hey!

597
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,440
Ho!

598
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:27,317
That's right, I'm back.

599
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,195
Enjoying the party, everyone?

600
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,409
Because while you were living it up,
I snuck onto their boat.

601
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,411
-What?
-What did he say?

602
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,246
And look at what I found.

603
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,583
There's more of them than we thought!

604
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,168
Which is mysterious and weird, am I right?

605
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,920
Hi.

606
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,299
How ya doin'?

607
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,135
Remember, he said there were
only two pigs on board,

608
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:55,429
but he was obviously lying.

609
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,474
And there are strange devices on their boat!

610
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:02,394
So, clearly, there's, you know,
some messed-up stuff going on here.

611
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:03,854
How messed up? I don't know.

612
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:05,772
What specifically? I don't know that, either.

613
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,857
Any questions?

614
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:10,360
Sweet!

615
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,988
You snuck onto their boat?

616
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,948
You know, I don't need a reward.

617
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:17,993
If you guys are trying to think of what honour
to bestow upon me, don't need it.

618
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,870
-Boo!
-Yeah, boo 'em!

619
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:21,413
Boo!

620
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:22,956
-You're booing them or me?
-You!

621
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,374
It's me.

622
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,084
Perhaps I can explain.

623
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:29,755
You see, my cousins are simple folk.

624
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,548
Watch.

625
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:33,884
A, B, C...

626
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:37,054
Nothing. See? Nothing.

627
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:40,349
I didn't want to risk their lives
until I found out that the...

628
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,601
The new world was safe.

629
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:45,395
We were gonna put on
a cowboy show for you.

630
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:46,939
Let 'er go, boys!

631
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,988
...and I'll take the low...

632
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:56,573
Ixnay on the ongsay.

633
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,200
That was Pig Latin.

634
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:00,577
But perhaps it wasn't meant to be.

635
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:05,541
I believe that birds and pigs
are meant to be friends.

636
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:09,962
But if we crossed boundaries
that were not meant to be crossed...

637
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:17,511
Mr Red, you've shamed not only yourself,
but our entire community!

638
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:19,221
I think you... You messed up there.

639
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:21,098
You said "shamed"
and you meant "saved," right?

640
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:24,434
I sent you to treatment
to deal with your problems.

641
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,895
Clearly, more treatment is required.

642
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:28,564
-No!
-No!

643
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:31,400
Do not trouble our honoured guests again!

644
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:36,363
My friends, we would love
to see your cowboy show.

645
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:37,906
-Yeah!
-Thank you.

646
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:39,283
Thank you so much.

647
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:40,826
Come on, everybody!

648
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:42,160
Put your hands together!

649
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:43,245
Yeah!

650
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:45,289
Whatever. Don't listen to me.

651
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,457
Party train coming through!

652
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,797
It's crazy that we're standing side by side

653
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,551
Fighting just like two birds of a feather

654
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,428
I can't see. I can't see.

655
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:02,890
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?

656
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:06,685
Just some roughed-up desperados

657
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:11,315
Hanging tough through thick and thin

658
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:15,485
Kicking up dust wherever we go

659
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:20,157
I can see that you and me
Are gonna be friends...

660
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:22,534
Piggyback rides?

661
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:23,702
Yee-haw! Let's move it, piggies!

662
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,120
Oh, boy.

663
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:26,955
Group picture! Group picture!

664
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:28,582
Everybody say, "Cheese"!

665
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:30,292
-Cheese omelette.
-Cheese!

666
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:31,335
Cheese omelette.

667
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,503
Classic.

668
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:35,088
Spoiler alert.

669
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,423
-Step right up!
-Jump!

670
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,759
So, I'm thinking about what kind of nest.
I don't know.

671
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,011
I was in the store, and I saw this...

672
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:49,269
-I am famished...
-It's chow time!

673
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:53,232
Just some roughed-up desperados

674
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:58,153
-Hanging tough through thick and thin
-Hanging tough through thick and thin

675
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:01,532
Kicking up dust wherever we go...

676
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:02,866
Yeah!

677
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,328
What?

678
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:11,208
To the end
You and me are gonna be friends...

679
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,211
What the heck?

680
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,256
Who invited you to move in?

681
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:18,340
Hey!

682
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:19,800
That's my toothbrush!

683
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:20,884
Get it out!

684
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,276
All right, class, thought for the day.

685
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,403
Water is the softest thing,

686
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:43,198
yet it can penetrate mountains and earth.

687
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,576
Here's my thought of the day.
When are we done?

688
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:50,581
Red, what the caterpillar calls the end,
the world calls a butterfly.

689
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:53,750
Can I just say I never understand
a single thing you're talking about?

690
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,919
Can I just say...

691
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,260
That's very lifelike.

692
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,097
So deep.

693
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,600
And, Terence, let's see your...

694
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,102
My goodness.

695
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:15,355
I did not know you felt that way.

696
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:17,149
Class dismissed!

697
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:20,736
And now we've come to
the prestigious Palms district.

698
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:25,991
Where birds of all feathers flock together
with eight kinds of fruit and nut trees.

699
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,367
Suck those bellies in.

700
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:28,452
Insta-ham!

701
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:31,079
Is that what I think it is?

702
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,331
That's an egg.

703
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,249
That's how our children are born.

704
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,959
You guys don't lay eggs?

705
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,087
I wish we did.

706
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,133
Enchanté.

707
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,972
You look delicious, my dear.

708
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:01,902
That's us.

709
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,241
Hey. Hello.

710
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:08,450
Excuse me. Buddy?

711
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,618
Those are fragile.

712
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:11,495
Maybe you shouldn't pick 'em up, all right?

713
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:12,829
Not yours.

714
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:14,706
My friend from the banquet.

715
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,333
Well, that's a very good painting.

716
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,626
Very good.

717
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:18,877
Yeah.

718
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:22,339
The assignment was "Paint Your Pain,"
so I painted your pain.

719
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,175
It's actually the first in a series.

720
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:26,802
Here you go.

721
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:28,345
This one is nice.

722
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,430
I call this one Catharsis.

723
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:34,726
And I call this one Bye-Bye.

724
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,520
Wonderful likeness.

725
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:40,148
I thought you said
you stored your nuts for winter.

726
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,316
Burn.

727
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,026
All right, what's going on here?

728
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,153
Are you explorers, or are you staying?

729
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,198
Because if you're explorers,
then why are there more of you coming?

730
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,741
Hi, everybody!

731
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:54,246
Not my house again!

732
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:56,331
-That's my home!
-Okay!

733
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:58,876
And you know what?
If you are staying, why don't you just say so?

734
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,002
And why'd you leave your home?

735
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,045
How do we know
you're not fugitives of the law?

736
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,715
You are making our guests feel unwelcome!

737
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,216
And you're not asking basic questions.

738
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:08,552
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

739
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,679
Your opinion is not needed!

740
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:11,805
Why do we have to agree?

741
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,265
Why does it matter that we're not the same?

742
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:16,185
Anger is not always the answer!

743
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:17,519
Continue the tour.

744
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:20,063
Surf's up, you guys.

745
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:23,400
-So, get ready to hang loose.
-That went well, if you're me.

746
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,694
Dummy.

747
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:33,118
We could really use you right about now.

748
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,245
Wait, actually...

749
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,331
Hey, Chuck! It's Red!

750
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:38,707
Zip on down here!

751
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:42,294
Hey, Chuck's mom.

752
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:43,921
Can your son come out to play?

753
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:48,258
All of this does not just happen on its own.

754
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:55,849
Hey. Just taking a shower.

755
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,601
Bomb, buddy, TMI.

756
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:00,562
Now, I'm telling you,
something isn't kosher with these pigs.

757
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:01,647
Bull's-eye!

758
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,066
And it's up to us to figure it out.

759
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,567
Figure what out, exactly?

760
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,277
I don't know,
maybe they're just being innovative.

761
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:08,362
Go ahead.

762
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:09,780
All aboard!

763
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,449
Does seem a little odd, though.

764
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:18,580
-Nailed it!
-Flawless.

765
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:21,375
Come on, does none of this
seem wrong to you guys?

766
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:25,295
I'll tell you this, if anyone knows
what these pigs are up to...

767
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,130
-Hey!
-...it's Mighty Eagle.

768
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:30,133
Mighty Eagle!

769
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:32,928
Yeah!

770
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:44,147
Take that, tree!

771
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,858
Eat my foot!

772
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:49,486
Tasty! Yum, yum, yum!

773
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,659
Mighty Eagle!

774
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:58,745
Peek-a-boo.

775
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:02,875
Hello, Bird Island!

776
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:10,048
You're welcome.

777
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,051
Does Mighty Eagle still live?

778
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:14,136
Did he ever live?

779
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:15,846
And if he did live, where would he live?

780
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,682
By the Lake of Wisdom in the Ancient Tree.

781
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:19,850
That's a fairy tale.

782
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:21,143
I've run all over this island.

783
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:22,436
Where could that possibly be?

784
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:23,937
Way up high.

785
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,817
It's a long way up that mountain,

786
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:32,654
and if I'm being honest, well, I mean,
you know, I could kind of use your help.

787
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,531
What's that? What are you trying to say?

788
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:37,367
Nothing. I was just saying
that I, you know, I could use your help.

789
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,703
I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you
over your ego.

790
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,747
Could you enunciate
that last word a little bit?

791
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,915
I need your help!

792
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:45,751
Why didn't you say so?

793
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:46,877
Bomb?

794
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:48,629
Let's do it!

795
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:57,763
If there is a Mighty Eagle, well,
how come we don't ever hear his battle cry?

796
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,057
Maybe we have.

797
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,476
What would a Mighty Eagle
battle cry sound like?

798
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:03,977
You know what? I think I got an idea.

799
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:05,437
Maybe something like...

800
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:09,107
No, I bet it's more like...

801
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:13,612
That's theoretically what
it's more like, scientifically.

802
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:14,905
I got one.

803
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,328
Not bad. It's a good impression.

804
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:24,039
But in my head, I'm kind of imagining
it's something more like a...

805
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,090
That sounds about right.

806
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:35,300
Now I'm thinking maybe
it's a little bit more subtle.

807
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:37,761
Like a little bit just more majestic, like...

808
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:52,025
"Hello, world!

809
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:54,945
"I am calling for you!"

810
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,406
Stop making Mighty Eagle noises!

811
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,491
It's like running a nursery.

812
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:00,993
Absolute child care.

813
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,912
Someone has anger issues.

814
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:12,629
This... This is the wrong mountain.

815
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:17,176
My calves are killing me.

816
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:48,498
That is simply unreal.

817
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,167
The Lake of Wisdom.

818
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:55,797
What are you guys waiting for?

819
00:45:58,258 --> 00:45:59,468
Guys, hurry up!

820
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:03,096
This is what Mama talked about!

821
00:46:11,522 --> 00:46:13,732
Be honest, do I sound any wiser?

822
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,442
Way wiser.

823
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:17,861
You were kind of dumb before.
I can say that now.

824
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:19,404
That water is no joke.

825
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:23,200
I can literally taste
the intelligence and wisdom

826
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:24,701
circulating through my body now.

827
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:27,996
Guys, nobody's here.
I mean, nobody's used this place in years.

828
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:30,541
What are you doing?

829
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,377
Get out of there.

830
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:45,556
Don't spit in his mouth.

831
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:47,266
No, don't spit it back!

832
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,518
Don't swallow it.

833
00:47:04,324 --> 00:47:05,909
Get out. Let's go. Come on.

834
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:08,745
Come. Take your time, will you?

835
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:10,539
Red, I've found the meaning of life. It's...

836
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:11,874
Shut your wormhole.

837
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:35,939
It's him.

838
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:02,132
Oh, man.

839
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,643
No. No. No.

840
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:18,232
Horrible turn of events. Horrible.

841
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:38,585
Well, not so much the Lake of Wisdom,
it's more like the Lake of Whiz.

842
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:42,005
Did you just come here to look at me?

843
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:44,925
Or did you have something to say?

844
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:47,344
I think he saw us.

845
00:48:47,386 --> 00:48:48,470
You think so?

846
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,183
You have passed the first test!

847
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,852
You have found me.

848
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:56,019
Look out.

849
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:57,521
Behold.

850
00:48:57,604 --> 00:49:00,023
Gaze upon

851
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:03,610
Mighty Eagle!

852
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:11,201
I see all and know all.

853
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:12,536
What are your names?

854
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,247
If you know all,
why don't you know who we are?

855
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,292
I know very well who you are.

856
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:23,547
You are lost souls
who have come here seeking wisdom.

857
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:26,383
Can we have some?

858
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:30,220
Wisdom is not something that is given.

859
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:33,182
It is something that is attained.

860
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:34,892
Okay. Goodbye.

861
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,812
No, no, no, no.
Will I help you attain wisdom?

862
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:41,648
Yes. That I will do.

863
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:44,443
Right. So, the reason we've climbed
the mountain is that we want to know...

864
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,862
-Prepare...
-Okay.

865
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:49,448
...to have your minds blown.

866
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:50,991
Son of a...

867
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:53,660
This guy is good.

868
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:57,414
Welcome to the Hall of Heroism.

869
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:59,791
It's really amazing to meet you.

870
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,543
You know, I actually have your poster up...

871
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:06,089
You might want to shield your eyes
from the sparkle of those trophies.

872
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,675
How many? I have no idea.
Countless, I'm sure.

873
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:09,801
Thirteen.

874
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:12,596
This is way nicer than my Hall of Wimpiness.

875
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:15,265
Bring it home, mamacita.

876
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:16,850
Get outta town.

877
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:19,603
What the...

878
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:29,863
Those are some old-school moves there.

879
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:31,240
Yeah.

880
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:37,120
What?

881
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:39,998
Yes!

882
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:41,124
Yeah.

883
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:47,881
So, he's kind of a wackadoodle.
You know, that doesn't mean he's not wise.

884
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:54,263
Hey, are you tired of filling your balloons
with heavy old air?

885
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:56,390
Finally, there's a better way.

886
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:57,641
-Helium.
-Helium?

887
00:50:57,683 --> 00:50:59,434
It's a gas.

888
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:01,687
Don't worry about your balloon.

889
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,939
It'll just land in the ocean.

890
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:05,524
The fish love it.

891
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:07,442
It's good for their tummy.

892
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:15,617
Free party, free party.
It's gonna be the piggest party of the year.

893
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,080
-Party! Get a birdsitter.
-Let's go, piggies.

894
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:23,250
Well, now, that is some fine handiwork.

895
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,252
-Hey, Judge, you're under arrest.
-What?

896
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:26,879
For looking too good.

897
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:28,172
Hello. What about me?

898
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,174
Do... Do I get a plus one?

899
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:32,009
-Thank you.
-Let me see, let me see.

900
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,678
That was a wet one.

901
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:50,110
Almost there. Don't rush me!

902
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,697
Deep breath, deep breath.

903
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,117
And we're back in the now.

904
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,535
Who's ready for trust falls?

905
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,078
-I gotcha.
-No, no, no.

906
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,372
Help.

907
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:08,504
Mighty, Mighty Eagle
Soaring free

908
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:12,966
Defender of our homes
And liberty

909
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,885
Bravery! Humility!

910
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:17,471
And honesty

911
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:21,058
You must have grown up
singing this song in school.

912
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:25,062
Yeah. Yes, we did.

913
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:26,897
Right. Yeah.

914
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:31,443
Mighty, Mighty Eagle

915
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:34,071
Rescue me

916
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:35,822
Now, you do the second verse.

917
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:38,825
Come on.

918
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:40,494
-Me?
-Yes.

919
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:43,330
Do it. Do it.

920
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:46,708
Mighty, Mighty Eagle
Flap your wings

921
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,835
Yeah.

922
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:50,838
And fill up your big cave
With all your fancy things

923
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:51,964
That's it.

924
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,549
Politeness
Good sportsmanship

925
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,633
That's not me.

926
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:55,759
And a long attention span

927
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:56,844
What?

928
00:52:56,927 --> 00:52:59,429
Mighty, Mighty Eagle

929
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:00,514
Yeah!

930
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:02,391
Take it away, Charles.

931
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:06,436
Great heroic Mighty Eagle

932
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,482
With finer plumage
Than a seagull

933
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:11,608
Sing it.

934
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:17,865
Ambidexterity
Pottery

935
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,324
And bankruptcy

936
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:23,453
Mighty, Mighty Eagle

937
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:24,621
Harmonise. Harmonise.

938
00:53:24,663 --> 00:53:29,334
Rescue me

939
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:37,593
You know it better than me.

940
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:39,428
So, anyway, the other day,

941
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:44,224
these pigs showed up out of nowhere,
and it caused me a great deal of suspicion...

942
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:45,976
And he's walking out of the room.

943
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:48,437
I don't get this.

944
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:51,815
This guy sits here on his butt, all alone,
clearly doesn't leave the house.

945
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,068
He talks a good game, but he
doesn't care about anyone but himself.

946
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:56,737
Sounds a lot like you.

947
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,323
Good. Thank you for your opinion, Chuck.

948
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:04,995
Well, hello.

949
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:07,497
-Hello? Mighty Eagle?
-What?

950
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:09,041
What are you doing?

951
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:11,668
-I'm bird-watching.
-What?

952
00:54:11,919 --> 00:54:13,837
Take a peek.

953
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:19,468
-You're disgusting.
-Yeah.

954
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,512
Look, are you gonna help us or not?

955
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:24,139
-I am helping you.
-No, this is you helping.

956
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:26,558
Looking through binoculars,
spying on old ladies.

957
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:27,851
What is that?

958
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:30,229
Wait.

959
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:33,440
Oh, my...

960
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:37,194
I was right.

961
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:38,654
I was right. I knew it!

962
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:40,322
Bomb, Chuck, hurry up! Get out here!

963
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:44,159
Mighty Eagle, hey, fly us down there now.

964
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:49,623
No.

965
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:51,124
I'm sorry. What?

966
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,293
I don't do that any more. I'm retired.

967
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:54,837
Mostly just tired.

968
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:59,091
Go handle it yourself.
This is everything I've prepared you for.

969
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:00,843
What? "Prepared us for"?

970
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:02,219
Hold on, did I miss something?

971
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,054
Let me just go through my notes really quick.
Let's see.

972
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:06,515
Crazy stuff, bragging, crazy stuff, karaoke.

973
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:08,934
No, see, I don't see anything useful here.

974
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:12,604
The whole world,
everyone we know, is in danger.

975
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:14,022
Yes, it is.

976
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:15,190
So, off you go.

977
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:16,733
Hey, you know what?

978
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:19,319
I used to believe in you.

979
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:24,366
When I was a kid, I believed
nothing really bad could ever happen

980
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:25,534
because you were here.

981
00:55:25,576 --> 00:55:30,080
And now I see the fate of the world
hangs on idiots like me.

982
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:33,417
And that, sir, is sort of terrifying.

983
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:36,587
It's time for you to go.

984
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,882
You know, it's really upsetting to me
that you're the only bird that can fly

985
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:41,133
and you're too afraid to do it.

986
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,013
Hey, guys, come on, let's go.
We're done here. He's no hero.

987
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:48,432
So, I'm having a party next Tuesday.

988
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:50,642
-Could you just do, like, a little pop in?
-Come on.

989
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,857
Come on, run faster!

990
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:04,948
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.

991
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,630
I sentence you all
to four hours of hard partying.

992
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:23,967
Look out below!

993
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:28,222
-They're taking the eggs!
-Follow 'em.

994
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:36,813
Oh, man!

995
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:41,735
Move it!

996
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:48,075
Right on time. Eggcellent.

997
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,871
Chuck, go shut that party down now!

998
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:55,916
Me? But I only know
how to get parties started!

999
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:57,292
-Go!
-On it.

1000
00:56:57,334 --> 00:56:58,877
-Bomb, we gotta stop 'em.
-Yeah.

1001
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:06,009
Gotta get more speed!

1002
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:11,139
It's Chuck time!

1003
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:13,642
Get to the ship!

1004
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:16,854
Move 'em out!

1005
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:19,273
Catch.

1006
00:57:22,484 --> 00:57:26,363
Can everybody please stop partying?
There are eggs being stolen!

1007
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:31,410
Matilda, we need your help.
The pigs are stealing our eggs!

1008
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:32,536
What?

1009
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:33,662
I'm airborne!

1010
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:36,081
We have to get back to the village!

1011
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,876
Stop dancing and start running!

1012
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,253
Hors d'oeuvres. My weakness.

1013
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:44,590
Come on, let's wrap it up.

1014
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:46,925
-We gotta get the eggs off the ship.
-Yes!

1015
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,385
-Is everyone on board?
-Let's go. Let's go.

1016
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,636
Use the trampolines.

1017
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:53,182
Can you get up there?

1018
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:54,975
We've got intruders!

1019
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:56,393
What the heck are they doing?

1020
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:58,562
Untie the ropes, drop the eggs in the water.

1021
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:01,398
Get rid of 'em! Get him off of there!

1022
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:04,526
It's too strong. I can't break it.

1023
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:06,653
Bomb, blow up the chain.

1024
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:08,530
Knock 'em down.

1025
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:11,617
Come on, Bomb, you can do this.

1026
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:17,080
Come on, Bomb, you got this. Blow up.

1027
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:18,248
You gotta get me mad.

1028
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,125
Okay, well, then what makes you mad?

1029
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:22,336
Try insulting me on a personal level.

1030
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,631
Your poetry stinks.

1031
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:28,175
You're just a bad poet. And you know it.

1032
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:30,928
I know! I know!

1033
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:32,262
Hey, who wants a birdie bath?

1034
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,773
I'm sorry, Red. I couldn't do it.

1035
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,733
Don't give up. This isn't over.

1036
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:47,402
Thanks for your hospitality.

1037
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:52,908
Set sail for Piggy Island.

1038
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:27,150
Oh, no.

1039
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:28,610
We'll find them.

1040
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,408
They're all gone.

1041
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:40,330
It's okay.

1042
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:48,714
Mr Red.

1043
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:56,263
What do we do now?

1044
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,224
Wait, hold on, you're asking me?

1045
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:02,186
You knew. You tried to tell us.

1046
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:03,645
But we didn't listen.

1047
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:06,773
I didn't listen.

1048
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:10,360
Red, we need a leader.

1049
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:11,987
-What are we gonna do?
-What do we do now?

1050
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:14,031
Wait a minute. I'm not a leader.

1051
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:16,283
Okay, pigs stole our kids. That sucks.

1052
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:18,118
Made all you guys look like idiots.

1053
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:19,578
You know what we gotta do?

1054
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:22,039
We start replacing those kids.

1055
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,375
Ladies, get busy!

1056
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:27,503
We're gonna be laying some eggs tonight.

1057
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:29,379
No, no, stop. No, no, no, no. No.

1058
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:31,340
We're not gonna replace those kids.

1059
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:32,633
We're gonna get them back.

1060
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:34,384
How are we gonna do that?

1061
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,512
What do you mean how?
The pigs already showed us how.

1062
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:39,223
That is where they went.

1063
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:41,934
And so, that is where we're going.

1064
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:43,894
But how do we get from here to there?

1065
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:46,104
I am not aquatic in the least.

1066
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:47,523
Well, you know...

1067
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:49,900
We're gonna build our own boat.

1068
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:51,276
What are you talking about?

1069
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,778
They stole your kids...

1070
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:53,904
No.

1071
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:55,405
They stole our kids.

1072
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,491
I mean, who does that?

1073
01:00:57,574 --> 01:01:00,577
Have you ever stolen anyone's children?

1074
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,454
Have you?

1075
01:01:02,538 --> 01:01:04,414
I mean, you look like you would.

1076
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,708
And you know what? I'm a little bit angry.

1077
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,586
Correction. I'm really angry.

1078
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,922
And I don't think I'm the only one.

1079
01:01:11,964 --> 01:01:15,425
Come on, we're birds.
We're descended from dinosaurs.

1080
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:17,511
We're not supposed to be nice. Right?

1081
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,893
Yeah. Point... Point made.

1082
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:26,228
Who else here is angry?

1083
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,604
-I am!
-Yeah, you are.

1084
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,232
We're getting our kids back.

1085
01:01:30,274 --> 01:01:34,194
And I don't need any calm,
detached, happy birds.

1086
01:01:34,278 --> 01:01:36,405
Not gonna help us. Don't need it.

1087
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:39,783
I need some angry flockin' birds.

1088
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:41,702
You hear me? Now, who's angry?

1089
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:43,954
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Let's go!

1090
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:46,748
Bring me everything that floats.

1091
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:48,500
Yeah, yeah, that's perfect. Yeah.

1092
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:01,138
With every single feather of my being,

1093
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:05,100
I am not gonna let any of these eggs
get taken from their parents.

1094
01:02:14,776 --> 01:02:16,570
Chuck, I need you to
tie those crates together.

1095
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:17,654
You got it.

1096
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:20,157
Done and done.

1097
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:21,366
A little help here?

1098
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,993
Let's go. Move it, everybody.

1099
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,703
Push with your upper body.

1100
01:02:24,786 --> 01:02:27,956
I have no upper body!

1101
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:29,499
Darn good for a bunch of birds.

1102
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,014
All right!

1103
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:47,309
When I say, "Eat the," you say, "Eggs."

1104
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:49,061
-Eat the...
-Eggs.

1105
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:50,562
-Eat the...
-Eggs.

1106
01:02:51,355 --> 01:02:52,439
What a reception!

1107
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:54,483
All right, snouts up.

1108
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:59,696
Man, it's a snout staircase.
Who thinks of that?

1109
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:06,036
Welcome home, King Mudbeard!

1110
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:13,043
My father and my father's father
and my weird Aunt Chloe

1111
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:15,212
have all searched for the eggs.

1112
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:18,340
But only I, King Mudbeard...

1113
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:19,466
My pom-pom.

1114
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,926
-...have found them.
-We love you, Leonard!

1115
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:23,387
I present to you the eggs!

1116
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:26,557
Oh, man!

1117
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:28,725
Say goodbye to Harvey.

1118
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,227
A feast!

1119
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:33,897
I proclaim a feast two nights hence.

1120
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,652
Let's go make some omelettetes!

1121
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,789
I feel a little nervous inside,
but that's normal, right?

1122
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:52,207
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

1123
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:57,087
Anybody else got butterflies in the stomach?

1124
01:03:57,129 --> 01:03:58,255
Yeah.

1125
01:03:58,297 --> 01:04:00,132
Probably because
you ate too many caterpillars.

1126
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:04,720
Drop your nuts and move your butts!

1127
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:07,431
Come on, let's go!

1128
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:14,104
Oh, no.

1129
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:18,859
I wasn't expecting this.

1130
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:23,614
Hold on a second.

1131
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:26,617
That guy's the king?

1132
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,161
He's got to have the eggs
with him in the castle.

1133
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,121
-What the heck's a castle?
-And that's where we're going.

1134
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:34,541
Hey, guys, do you remember
everything you learned in my class?

1135
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:35,626
-Yep.
-Nope.

1136
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:37,920
-What class?
-Well, forget all of it for now.

1137
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:39,713
Now it's time to let loose.

1138
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:41,757
Good, because I never
learned anything anyway.

1139
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:43,383
Me, neither. I actually just came to socialise.

1140
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:44,801
I came for the snacks.

1141
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:46,637
You don't happen to have any now, do you?

1142
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:49,097
Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath!

1143
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:51,308
How are we gonna get over those walls?

1144
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,396
I'll tell you how. We're gonna fly.

1145
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,233
Remember, the goal is the castle.

1146
01:04:59,316 --> 01:05:00,984
Get to the castle.

1147
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:02,152
Who wants to go first?

1148
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:03,987
-Over here! Me! Me! Me!
-I do!

1149
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:05,322
Hey! All right, Matilda.

1150
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:07,616
Always a bridesmaid.

1151
01:05:07,658 --> 01:05:10,577
Step right up, keep your wings, legs and feet
inside the slingshot at all times.

1152
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:12,079
-Shoot it!
-Okeydoke.

1153
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:13,205
Fire!

1154
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,126
And a one and a...

1155
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:19,837
Take that, porkers!

1156
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:21,672
Incoming!

1157
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:24,299
Boom, baby, boom!

1158
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:25,467
Well, how about that?

1159
01:05:25,509 --> 01:05:27,511
My teacher can shoot fireballs
out of her butt.

1160
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:28,887
You! What's your name? Hal?

1161
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:30,222
I've seen you
do something strange before, right?

1162
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:32,182
Well, let's see, I'm really good at...

1163
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:33,267
Doesn't matter. Launch him.

1164
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:36,770
This guy looks good.

1165
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:38,772
He's gonna make it!

1166
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,526
This is incredible.
We're witnessing history right now.

1167
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:44,528
Nope. He's coming back.

1168
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:46,238
He's coming, duck. Get down.

1169
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,159
Did we win?

1170
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:53,120
No, not quite yet, buddy.

1171
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:56,039
We're still tied.
Hey, can we get an ice pack for Hal?

1172
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:58,166
-Medic!
-All right, who's up next?

1173
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,377
What can you do?

1174
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:04,756
Need a tissue?

1175
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:16,643
Who's next? We need fliers, not standbyers!

1176
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:18,061
Let's go!

1177
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:20,772
You go out there and you show them
how frightening mimes can be.

1178
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:21,899
Yeah!

1179
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:23,817
Oh, my God!

1180
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,653
We're having a feast
We're eating the eggs

1181
01:06:26,737 --> 01:06:30,657
Gonna have a big feast
We're gonna eat all the eggs

1182
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:31,950
What?

1183
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:34,328
What is that?

1184
01:06:37,748 --> 01:06:38,999
Fire!

1185
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,459
That guy again.

1186
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:42,753
Citizens of Pig Island,

1187
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:46,590
if you spot any birds
destroying your neighbourhood,

1188
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,550
please, capture them.

1189
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:51,428
-What did he say?
-There's been a change of plans.

1190
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,097
We will eat the eggs for lunch.

1191
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:56,183
Did he say, "Eat the eggs"?

1192
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:10,280
Okay, I want you to curl up into a little ball.

1193
01:07:10,322 --> 01:07:11,823
All right? Make yourself aerodynamic.

1194
01:07:11,907 --> 01:07:12,991
Like this?

1195
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:15,160
-To the left. To the left!
-Let me at 'em!

1196
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:16,286
Launch!

1197
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:22,167
Don't mess with Bubbles!

1198
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,087
Get him!

1199
01:07:25,128 --> 01:07:26,797
-Piggy pile!
-Hog-tie him!

1200
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:29,967
I told you not to mess with me!

1201
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,885
That blows.

1202
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:33,470
In a good way.

1203
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:35,180
-To the left!
-Hold on, wait.

1204
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,640
My left or your left?

1205
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:40,060
My left is your left.
We are facing the same direction.

1206
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:41,228
Right. Good call.

1207
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:44,231
Just look where the last bird went
and adjust from there.

1208
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,441
-I got this, you guys.
-All right.

1209
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:07,337
She got far, but not far enough.

1210
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:09,464
Get out of our town!

1211
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:10,924
We have to get closer.

1212
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:15,679
Judge power...

1213
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:21,393
Trial by fire!

1214
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:23,145
No, literally, he's on fire right now.

1215
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:24,520
Can somebody please help him?

1216
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:38,702
Mighty Eagle!

1217
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:48,504
Terence, I got an idea.

1218
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:52,841
Do you think you can pull the slingshot back
far enough to hit that giant boulder?

1219
01:08:52,883 --> 01:08:55,761
Okay. Launch me
right towards the top of that thing.

1220
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:00,640
Ready?

1221
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:04,019
Red, I'm not gonna lie to you. I am

1222
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:06,813
really gonna miss you when you die.

1223
01:09:06,897 --> 01:09:09,858
Rest in peace, my friend. Rest in peace.

1224
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:12,236
Hey, guys, let's not get cheesy, okay?

1225
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,569
Ready? Fire!

1226
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:23,121
This is gonna hurt.

1227
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:25,832
What was that?

1228
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:28,919
My roof!

1229
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:30,420
Did he make it?

1230
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:32,005
I hope he's okay.

1231
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:34,424
I'm in!

1232
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:35,843
Yeah. I knew he'd make it!

1233
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,013
Send everyone else!

1234
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:43,600
Guards! There is a red bird in these walls.

1235
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:45,769
Bring him to me.

1236
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,395
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Roger that, boss.

1237
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:51,774
Not in these walls.

1238
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:52,943
In the castle!

1239
01:09:52,984 --> 01:09:54,444
Come on, you guys.

1240
01:09:54,486 --> 01:09:56,113
Here, pretty bird. Here, pretty bird.

1241
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:01,952
Transport the eggs!

1242
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:04,454
Trot, trot, trot, trot, trot...

1243
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:12,212
Launch me exactly the same way
you did for Red...

1244
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:14,798
I wasn't ready!

1245
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:16,133
Faster!

1246
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:33,483
Chuck, is that you?

1247
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:36,028
This is the house of horrors.

1248
01:10:36,153 --> 01:10:37,863
I gotta be honest, you look a little...

1249
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:39,114
Fine. You look fine. Come on.

1250
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:40,490
Bomb's on his way.

1251
01:10:49,374 --> 01:10:51,418
Call in the Piggy Air Force!

1252
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:56,590
My loyal subjects,

1253
01:10:56,673 --> 01:10:59,843
the treacherous birds
have repaid our friendship

1254
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:02,554
with an unprovoked act of aggression.

1255
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:04,848
The attack will fail.

1256
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:09,728
We have glass, we have wood, we have TNT.

1257
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:13,857
We tried to kill them with kindness,
and now we're just gonna have to...

1258
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:15,692
-Well, you know.
-Bye-bye.

1259
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:21,031
Who's gonna go next?

1260
01:11:27,788 --> 01:11:29,289
Aim for that ramp.

1261
01:11:30,832 --> 01:11:33,418
Terence! Terence! Terence!

1262
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:48,308
No eggs in here.
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

1263
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:49,726
Hey! I'm on this.

1264
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:54,189
Redrum.

1265
01:11:55,816 --> 01:11:56,984
Never mind.

1266
01:11:59,236 --> 01:12:00,487
Backup engines!

1267
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:07,494
Wait, hold on a second.

1268
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:09,037
Wait, I know that rear end. That's Bomb.

1269
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:11,915
Yeah, Chuck, that's not his rear end,
that's his face, man.

1270
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:13,417
-Sorry, Bomb.
-No prob.

1271
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,294
Easy mistake to make.

1272
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:16,587
Thanks for getting me out.

1273
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:18,380
We want eggs!

1274
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:19,548
We want eggs!

1275
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:21,425
We want eggs!

1276
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:22,759
We want eggs!

1277
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:26,847
He was sick, but then he got cured.

1278
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:30,017
"No eggs in here."

1279
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,435
These are clever pigs.

1280
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:33,896
Okay, look, I'm gonna run up
and tackle the pig on the left.

1281
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:35,147
Bomb, you could handle two.

1282
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,773
Chuck, I don't know if you can help.

1283
01:12:36,857 --> 01:12:40,861
We gotta figure out a way
to get into that room.

1284
01:13:00,088 --> 01:13:01,632
Anyone have any bright ideas?

1285
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:08,555
You are gonna pay for that.

1286
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:11,975
What the heck just happened?

1287
01:13:12,017 --> 01:13:14,311
I'm sorry. You were saying?

1288
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:16,480
And here we are?

1289
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:18,398
We found 'em!

1290
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:19,733
Come on!

1291
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:24,821
-Red!
-Guys, come on!

1292
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:26,031
Quick, follow him.

1293
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:29,159
-We want eggs!
-Things are looking sunny side up!

1294
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:32,412
Guys, I'm here. Everything's gonna be okay.

1295
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:33,539
We're gonna get you out of here.

1296
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:34,915
-Hurry up, Bomb! Come on!
-I'm coming!

1297
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:36,375
Don't lose me!

1298
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,919
Doesn't this nightmare ever end?

1299
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:40,254
Oh, boy!

1300
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:41,880
We want eggs!

1301
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:43,173
We want eggs!

1302
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:46,218
What is he doing up there?
This is a civilised buffet.

1303
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:56,478
Don't hatch now. Do not hatch now.

1304
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:58,814
Get that red scab off my eggs.

1305
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:00,732
-Hey!
-Oh, man.

1306
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:02,484
-Bomb, are you okay?
-I've been better.

1307
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:04,361
We want eggs!

1308
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:06,029
I'm gonna get a running start.

1309
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,616
Chuck time!

1310
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:12,953
Fine. Boil him, too.

1311
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:14,872
Let's pig out!

1312
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:17,457
Looks like it's just you and me, pork belly.

1313
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:19,042
I'll be taking that.

1314
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:25,716
Hey!

1315
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:26,884
No!

1316
01:14:29,136 --> 01:14:31,013
Red, we're coming!

1317
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:32,139
Deep breath.

1318
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:38,645
I'm in!

1319
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:40,564
Classy joint.

1320
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:42,065
Hello!

1321
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:43,775
Where is everyone?

1322
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:45,485
Mighty Eagle! Where's he going?

1323
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:47,279
I can't believe I'm about to do this.

1324
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:51,491
My battle cry?

1325
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:55,954
Coming in, coming in.

1326
01:14:56,538 --> 01:14:59,124
Mighty Eagle!

1327
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:15,974
Mighty Eagle.

1328
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:18,936
Mighty Eagle, wake up.
Come on. That's bad breath.

1329
01:15:18,977 --> 01:15:22,189
I can sleep late, Mom. It's not a school day.

1330
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:23,482
Throw them in the pot, too.

1331
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:25,192
I'll have the big turkey.

1332
01:15:28,612 --> 01:15:29,696
Red!

1333
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,407
-Hey!
-What did I miss?

1334
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:34,076
You gotta fly those eggs to safety.

1335
01:15:34,117 --> 01:15:36,119
I got this. Here we go.

1336
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,460
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1337
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:48,507
My eggs!

1338
01:15:48,674 --> 01:15:50,676
-Don't forget Chuck and Bomb!
-Who?

1339
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:51,802
-Hey!
-Those guys!

1340
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:53,053
Right, right.

1341
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:55,138
Gotcha!

1342
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,772
You're not getting away that easy.

1343
01:16:07,526 --> 01:16:08,569
No!

1344
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:15,659
-Save yourselves!
-Hold on, Red!

1345
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:16,827
I'm gonna save that egg.

1346
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:20,038
-Red, don't be a hero. Red, no!
-No!

1347
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:27,171
Get out of town, everybody.

1348
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,006
Get down!

1349
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,092
There's just so many of them!
We're outnumbered!

1350
01:16:32,176 --> 01:16:33,510
What? How many?

1351
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:35,554
No, not that many.
Just the right amount, really.

1352
01:16:35,637 --> 01:16:38,182
No need to look back.
Just keep flying. Faster!

1353
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:40,684
I'll take that.

1354
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:42,019
-No, you won't.
-Get him!

1355
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,353
Gimme that!

1356
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:48,817
You just don't know when to stop, do you?

1357
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:50,277
Here's a two-word answer.

1358
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:54,364
Looks like your little
slingshot game ends here.

1359
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:55,908
-Gimme that!
-Not gonna happen!

1360
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:00,162
Oh, no.

1361
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:03,248
Get out of my way!

1362
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:07,211
Every pig for themselves!

1363
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:08,337
I quit!

1364
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:13,884
I know what I gotta do.

1365
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:15,427
I gotta blow up that ramp.

1366
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:18,305
And that would be a good plan
if you were good at blowing up.

1367
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:19,890
I need to stop those planes.

1368
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:21,850
Remember me, Chuck. Remember me!

1369
01:17:21,892 --> 01:17:23,519
Bomb's away!

1370
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:32,444
-Hi there.
-Here, chickie, chickie, chickie.

1371
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:34,029
This little piggy popped.

1372
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:36,740
This little piggy exploded.

1373
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:40,994
And this little piggy went,
"Wee, wee, wee, I want my mama!"

1374
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,458
Come on, Bomb, you can do this.

1375
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,210
Blow up! Blow up!

1376
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:54,883
No.

1377
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,553
Think explosive thoughts.

1378
01:17:57,594 --> 01:17:58,762
Surprise parties!

1379
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:01,557
Yoga poses!

1380
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:04,852
Pigs in aeroplanes!

1381
01:18:10,524 --> 01:18:11,775
I blew up.

1382
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:13,151
On purpose.

1383
01:18:13,861 --> 01:18:16,113
You're wrecking my house.
What's wrong with you?

1384
01:18:16,196 --> 01:18:17,531
You wrecked my house.

1385
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:18,615
Your house was ugly.

1386
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:19,741
Well, now we're even.

1387
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,083
Strike!

1388
01:18:31,003 --> 01:18:32,129
Run! Run!

1389
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:36,717
Guys, look out!

1390
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:40,470
Everyone, stand back.

1391
01:18:46,476 --> 01:18:47,769
Terence?

1392
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:50,314
Put on your seat belts, everyone. Trust me.

1393
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:58,989
Well, this is dynamite.

1394
01:19:07,331 --> 01:19:10,000
-There you are.
-Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!

1395
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:16,840
Delicious bird eggy-weggy.

1396
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:18,300
You can't eat eggs!

1397
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:19,885
What are you gonna do? I'm a foodie.

1398
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,350
It's over. You're finished, Eyebrows.

1399
01:19:27,017 --> 01:19:31,063
-Eyebrows!
-Someone has anger issues.

1400
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:33,732
Anger is not always the answer!

1401
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:38,070
Well, you know what?

1402
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:39,488
I guess you win.

1403
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:40,656
What?

1404
01:19:41,865 --> 01:19:43,867
That was an awesome plan.

1405
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:45,911
Mindblower.

1406
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,996
Really? Well, thank you.

1407
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:51,375
You know, a lot of hard work
goes into my sinister plans.

1408
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:52,584
It does.

1409
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:56,588
Nah, I mean, your plan was great.

1410
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:58,131
But you didn't plan for this!

1411
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:19,069
You have annoyed me for the last time.

1412
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:20,237
Yup.

1413
01:20:21,738 --> 01:20:22,781
No!

1414
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:25,784
Faster!

1415
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:39,631
Cramp. Cramp.

1416
01:20:40,424 --> 01:20:41,508
It's him!

1417
01:20:41,592 --> 01:20:42,718
Look at that!

1418
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:44,094
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

1419
01:20:44,136 --> 01:20:46,221
-Jeez, is that Mighty Eagle?
-It's him!

1420
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:48,348
This guy looks nothing like his statue.

1421
01:20:48,432 --> 01:20:50,184
-Honey.
-Our eggs!

1422
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,450
-Are you okay?
-Chuck, my man.

1423
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:08,452
-Did you see what I did back there?
-Yeah.

1424
01:21:11,705 --> 01:21:13,540
This egg is the spitting image of you.

1425
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:15,792
There. Safe and sound.

1426
01:21:24,885 --> 01:21:26,512
-Where is he?
-Red?

1427
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:29,556
Where is he?

1428
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:41,652
I think he might be dead.

1429
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,584
Daddy!

1430
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:00,128
He's alive!

1431
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:01,713
He's alive!

1432
01:22:10,347 --> 01:22:11,348
What?

1433
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:21,733
Yeah!

1434
01:22:21,817 --> 01:22:24,486
Red, you're alive! I thought you had died!

1435
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:26,029
Or defected to the pigs' side.

1436
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:28,115
Hey, buddy, way to not be dead.

1437
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:29,825
Hey. It's good to see you guys.

1438
01:22:29,867 --> 01:22:30,909
Come on.

1439
01:22:47,467 --> 01:22:49,011
Sir. Ma'am.

1440
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:52,556
I think these belong to you.

1441
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:02,065
Thank you.

1442
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:06,612
Crimson, Woody, Ash.

1443
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:08,071
-Who?
-Is he talking to us?

1444
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:10,407
You learned your lessons well.

1445
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,159
Come on, bring it in.

1446
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:14,328
No. I'm not really the affectionate type.

1447
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:19,291
Okay. Does it feel like
this is crossing the line to anyone else?

1448
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:21,168
-Yup.
-Nope.

1449
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:23,754
You're my prize pupils.

1450
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:26,298
-Your prized what?
-Don't you see?

1451
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:31,345
I had to make you lose faith in me
so you could learn to have faith in yourself.

1452
01:23:31,428 --> 01:23:33,096
That's really not how it felt.

1453
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,223
Tell them, Rosy.

1454
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:36,058
Yeah, I don't think
that's what happened, man.

1455
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:38,352
Look, he's blushing.

1456
01:23:39,728 --> 01:23:41,772
I'm not blushing. I'm just red.

1457
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:48,153
Okay, who wants an autograph?

1458
01:23:58,205 --> 01:23:59,289
Hoist it up.

1459
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:01,124
Nice.

1460
01:24:10,801 --> 01:24:12,970
Grand reopening. Get your worms.

1461
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:15,806
Well done, indeed.

1462
01:24:20,686 --> 01:24:22,771
Is that you right there, Red?

1463
01:24:22,813 --> 01:24:24,731
Really? Where? No. They didn't have to do...

1464
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,483
Yeah.

1465
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:29,945
That's funny, I don't remember
crying on my knees like that.

1466
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:32,114
But, you know, it's nice.

1467
01:24:32,155 --> 01:24:35,409
Look at that.
They gave Mighty Eagle all the credit.

1468
01:24:35,492 --> 01:24:38,287
They made him look
so much more handsome than you.

1469
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:42,833
You know, back when I was angry,
that would have really ticked me off.

1470
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:44,751
Forget about that.

1471
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:46,461
You know what we should do?
Let's go to the village.

1472
01:24:46,503 --> 01:24:47,629
Let's do it.

1473
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:49,089
No, actually, I'd love to
go hang out with you guys,

1474
01:24:49,173 --> 01:24:51,842
but, you know, I got this thing,
and I have another thing after that thing,

1475
01:24:51,884 --> 01:24:53,010
and there's all these things in a row, so...

1476
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:54,094
Would you look at that!

1477
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,056
What the...

1478
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:23,040
Mr Red, welcome back to the village.

1479
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:56,823
Mighty, Mighty Red
You rescued me

1480
01:25:57,115 --> 01:26:02,204
Defender of our homes
And liberty

1481
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,873
-Bravery
-Humility

1482
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:07,167
Anger-y

1483
01:26:08,669 --> 01:26:11,880
Mighty, Mighty Red
You

1484
01:26:13,173 --> 01:26:18,011
Rescued me

1485
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:37,614
Oh, my God.

1486
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:49,877
How did you guys
find the time to pull this off?

1487
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,296
This is why we went to
go get pedicures, isn't it?

1488
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:54,798
Nope. We got pedicures
because we're worth it.

1489
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,967
-I got gels.
-You guys are something else.

1490
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:59,094
To be honest with you,
I am gonna miss the beach view.

1491
01:26:59,136 --> 01:27:00,554
But so what? It's still there.

1492
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:03,140
It's just not right there when I wake up
and look out my window.

1493
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:05,976
Well, you can still look out your window
and see me and Bomb.

1494
01:27:06,059 --> 01:27:07,311
Right.

1495
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:09,188
So, you know, pluses and minuses.

1496
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:10,564
Okay. See you later.

1497
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:16,111
Well, this just got awkward.

1498
01:27:16,153 --> 01:27:17,654
That's really insensitive.

1499
01:27:18,655 --> 01:27:20,115
Want to go get a bite?

1500
01:27:20,157 --> 01:27:22,492
Forget it. Let's just go home.

1501
01:27:25,996 --> 01:27:28,540
Guys! I'm just messing with you.

1502
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:29,708
Get in here.

1503
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,337
-I knew it!
-Let's be roomies.

1504
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:35,631
Roommates! I can't wait to make
a chores list.

1505
01:27:35,672 --> 01:27:36,757
Wait, hold on a second.

1506
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,133
I'll move my nest in the master bedroom.

1507
01:27:38,175 --> 01:27:39,510
Bomb, you can stay in the guest house.

1508
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:41,261
-No, no, no.
-Can we get a bunk nest?

1509
01:27:41,345 --> 01:27:42,846
This is gonna be perfect!

1510
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:44,389
Guys! No!

1511
01:27:56,276 --> 01:27:57,319
Yeah.

1512
01:27:59,112 --> 01:28:00,197
Groovin' out.

1513
01:28:01,823 --> 01:28:02,866
Watch this. Coming right at you.

1514
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:07,097
Come on, Leonard.

1515
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:08,724
Leonard can't dance.

1516
01:29:08,765 --> 01:29:11,268
He's hatching a new plan.

1517
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:12,686
Yeah!

1518
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:20,194
Okay, maybe I'll dance for just a sec.

1519
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,243
Show 'em what you got, Red.

1520
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:29,620
Come on, Red Stuff.

1521
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:30,787
-No.
-Yeah, yeah.

1522
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:31,872
Nice try.

1523
01:29:37,503 --> 01:29:38,670
Okay.

1524
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,159
There you go.

1525
01:30:15,999 --> 01:30:17,626
Wait. What are we doing?

1526
01:30:22,172 --> 01:30:23,340
Watch out.
