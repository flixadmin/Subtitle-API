murdered your own father

65

which they will be.

And in her mind, she's winning.

00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:10,227
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

126

Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

- After all this time, it still amazes me that you...
- It was Olenna.

She confessed before she died.

134
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:41,685
And this was before or after

135
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,768
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

After.

137

And you believed her?

138

If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

143

She was telling the truth.

144
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,769
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

145
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:17,351
She should have died screaming.

146
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:18,643
She's dead, like her son,

147
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:20,727
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

148

of this war, we'll follow them.

You weren't gone long.

167
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:05,810
No.

168
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,810
And?

169
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:10,519
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

You're not sure
how you feel about that.

171
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:16,977
No, I'm not.

172
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:20,351
How many men did your army kill

173
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,352
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

174
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,893
Thousands.

175
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:27,018
We both want to help people.

176
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,727
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

177

When you first came here,

Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

180
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,060
Ser Davos gets carried away.

181
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,518
So, it was a figure of speech?

You found a cure?

I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

I return to your

- Do you know him?

215
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,059
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

216
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,226
I saw him go beyond the Wall.

217
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,810
And?

218
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,727
Somehow, a crippled boy

219
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:17,810
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

not the wildlings, no one.

Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

228
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,934
to hold the Wall, they'll do it.

00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:12,603
It could be done.

And this news
could be authentic.

It's possible.

It's also possible
that this message

238
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:25,602
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

239
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:28,560
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

240
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,602
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

I'm afraid so.

Horrible business.

I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

00:21:41,686 --> 00:21:44,518
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

267

What else could she do?

268

Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

I can't make
her decisions for her.

That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

I was only a purveyor

You don't look happy.

Bran saw the Night King
and his army

marching towards Eastwatch.

297

If they make it past the Wall...

298
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:37,268
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

299

00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:40,643
You said you don't
have enough men.

We'll fight
with the men we have.

302
00:23:43,227 --> 00:23:44,852
Unless you'll join us.

303
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:47,018
And give the country to Cersei?

304
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:50,852
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

305
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:53,184
Perhaps not.

306
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:56,602
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

307
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:59,852
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

308
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:01,602
What if we prove her wrong?

309
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:05,019
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

310
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,352
So bring the dead to her.

311
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:11,685
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

312
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:14,059
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

313
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,101
Only one soldier.

314
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:18,019
Is that possible?

315
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:23,560
The first wight I ever saw

316
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:26,393
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

317
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:28,727
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

318
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:31,018
and show her the truth.

319
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,059
Anything you bring back
will be useless

320
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,893
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

321
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:37,435
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

322
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:39,685
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

323
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,268
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

324
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:45,102
He might listen to me.

325
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:50,935
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

326
00:24:57,102 --> 00:24:58,934
I can smuggle you in,

327
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:01,560
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

328
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:04,768
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

329
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,184
Well, it will all be for nothing

330
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:07,976
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

331
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:09,351
Fair point.

332
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:10,644
How do you propose to find one?

333
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,269
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

334
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:22,310
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

335
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,935
Allow me to serve you.

336
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:29,435
The Free Folk will help us.

337
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:32,184
They know the real north
better than anyone.

338
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:33,727
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

339
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:34,935
They won't have to.

340
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:44,393
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

341
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:47,018
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

342
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:49,602
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

343
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:51,977
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

344
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,352
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

345
00:25:58,185 --> 00:26:01,560
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

346
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,769
I am a king.

347
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:05,810
And I came here

348
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,643
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

349
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:10,852
or your dragons burn me alive.

350
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:15,268
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

351
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,268
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

352
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:20,436
for all our people.

353
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:26,311
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

354
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,519
because it's our best chance.

355
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:48,518
(ALL CHATTERING)

356
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,853
GLOVER: The King in the North
should stay in the North.

357
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:59,768
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

358
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:02,603
- But perhaps we should have.
- (ALL MURMURING)

359
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:09,893
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

360
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,352
MEN: Aye.

361
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:19,226
You are very kind, my lords.

362
00:27:19,227 --> 00:27:21,268
But Jon is our king.

363
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:23,810
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

364
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:26,436
(CHATTER)

365
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:35,768
SANSA: I warned Jon
this would happen.

366
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:37,435
That he couldn't leave the North

367
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:40,268
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

368
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:42,643
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

369
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:45,436
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

370
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,393
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

371
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:53,935
And?

372
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,976
Nothing.

373
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,768
Don't do that.

374
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:04,269
- What?
- Say what you mean.

375
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,394
You always liked nice things.

376
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:12,102
They made you feel
better than everyone.

377
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:18,602
Are you angry with me?

378
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:20,934
They were insulting Jon,

379
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:22,310
and you sat there and listened.

380
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:23,810
I listened to their complaints,

381
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:26,852
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

382
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:29,810
Their opinions
are important to you.

383
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:32,518
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

384
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,476
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

385
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:37,477
Not if they lose
their heads first.

386
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:44,101
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

387
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:45,976
We took it back,

388
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:47,934
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

389
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,393
and the wildlings and the Vale.

390
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,934
All of us, working together.

391
00:28:50,935 --> 00:28:55,268
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

392
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:58,811
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

393
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:04,268
And if Jon doesn't come back,

394
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:06,226
you'll need their support...

395
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:08,351
so you can work together

396
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:10,310
to give you
what you really want.

397
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:12,894
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

398
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:17,644
You're thinking it right now.

399
00:29:19,644 --> 00:29:22,602
You don't want to be,

400
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:24,894
but the thought
just won't go away.

401
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,686
I have work to do.

402
00:29:36,352 --> 00:29:37,644
My lady.

403
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:44,019
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

404
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:52,934
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

405
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:55,894
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

406
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,893
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

407
00:30:01,894 --> 00:30:04,560
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

408
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:05,935
Too many steps.

409
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,101
You're not staying here?

410
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:15,602
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

411
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:17,435
What if someone takes the boat?

412
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:19,728
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

413
00:30:25,144 --> 00:30:26,560
We don't have time for this.

414
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:28,727
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

415
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:29,893
The Dothraki are coming.

416
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,018
All the more reason
for you to train.

417
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:34,018
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

418
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:36,560
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

419
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:38,560
And here I am, ready to train.

420
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:40,518
Why down here?

421
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,351
I don't think
you want people to see

422
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:45,268
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

423
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:48,059
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

424
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,603
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

425
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:00,477
I'll leave you to it.

426
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:05,603
I needed to see you.

427
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,894
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

428
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:15,393
You made me look
like a complete fool.

429
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:17,685
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

430
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:20,643
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

431
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:23,226
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

432
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:24,727
Father would have been proud.

433
00:31:24,728 --> 00:31:26,476
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

434
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:27,976
I once told Bronn

435
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:30,811
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

436
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:36,311
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

437
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:47,393
He was going to execute me.

438
00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:50,101
He knew I was innocent.

439
00:31:50,102 --> 00:31:52,435
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

440
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,810
he hated me
because of what I am.

441
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:57,977
A little monster
sent to punish him.

442
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:02,059
Did he...
did he think...

443
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,852
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

444
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:05,733
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?!

445
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:13,811
Daenerys will win this war.

446
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,602
You're a military man.

447
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,352
You must know there's
no way around that.

448
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:23,976
Daenerys is not her father.

449
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:26,852
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

450
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:29,352
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

451
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,893
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

452
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:33,351
you can ask her yourself.

453
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,728
I... I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

454
00:32:37,144 --> 00:32:38,853
Not right now, anyway.

455
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:43,269
She has a more
important request.

456
00:32:46,728 --> 00:32:48,894
(CHATTER)

457
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,977
I wasn't sure I'd find you.

458
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:34,268
Thought you might
still be rowing.

459
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:36,436
(CHUCKLES)

460
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:40,976
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

461
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,268
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

462
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,768
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

463
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:48,184
Haven't been here in years.

464
00:33:48,185 --> 00:33:50,602
Why should they recognize me?

465
00:33:50,603 --> 00:33:53,269
Sometimes I hardly do.

466
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,102
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

467
00:34:01,894 --> 00:34:03,976
Anybody give you any trouble?

468
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:06,435
Here I am, arming Lannisters,

469
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:08,310
and I never get a second look.

470
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:09,810
But you were right.

471
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:12,351
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

472
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,852
Don't be so sure.

473
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:16,769
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

474
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:20,519
Bad things are coming.

475
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,240
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

476
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,399
Well, the thing you need to
understand is...

477
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,089
I'm ready.

478
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:29,560
- You...
- Let's go.

479
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,476
You should know
what you're heading into.

480
00:34:31,477 --> 00:34:33,476
What do you think
I've been thinking about

481
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:34,852
with every swing of the hammer?

482
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:37,310
How happy I am making weapons

483
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:39,768
for the family
that killed my father?

484
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:41,476
The family that
tried to kill me?

(SCOFFS)

486
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,852
I've been getting ready.

487
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:47,310
I never knew what for,

488
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:49,853
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

489
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,602
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

490
00:34:54,603 --> 00:34:56,519
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

491
00:34:58,019 --> 00:34:59,352
But this...

492
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:02,519
this I know.

493
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:13,018
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

494
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:15,811
Situation's complicated
enough already.

495
00:35:17,185 --> 00:35:18,853
Well, who should I say I am?

496
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:25,101
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

497
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:26,942
- someone's going to...
- GOLD CLOAK: You there!

498
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,561
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

499
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:34,226
What can I do for you?

500
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:36,727
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

501
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:39,143
- GOLD CLOAK: The docks are that way.
- DAVOS: That they are.

502
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:40,643
I try to stay away from them

503
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:42,894
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

504
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,893
- Still five gold dragons?
- (LAUGHS) Are you joking?

505
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:51,143
You must be even older
than you look.

506
00:35:51,144 --> 00:35:53,059
- 15.
- 15?!

507
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,185

I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

510
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:08,603
GOLD CLOAK #2:
What's in the boat?

511
00:36:14,144 --> 00:36:15,310
Not more gold.

512
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:17,059
- Wine?
- Mm.

513
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,060
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

514
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:22,102
Come have a look.

515
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:32,560
- Fermented crab.
- What?

516
00:36:32,561 --> 00:36:34,435
DAVOS:
Fermented crab.

517
00:36:34,436 --> 00:36:37,435
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

518
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:39,393
A man thinks he's done.

519
00:36:39,394 --> 00:36:41,976
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

520
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:43,893
But before he gets
his breeches up,

521
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:47,268
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

522
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:50,810
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

523
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:53,311
Here, have a taste.

524
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:07,852
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

525
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:10,351
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:39,352
Oi, dwarf!

529
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,226
I really wouldn't try any more

530
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,268
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

531
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:46,143
That dwarf...

532
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:47,768
Where'd you get that scar?

533
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,310
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

534
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,393
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

535
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:55,435
DAVOS: Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

- This is Gendry.

541
00:38:12,561 --> 00:38:14,060
He'll do.

00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:17,769
Go, go, go.

00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:22,059
QYBURN:
I could give you something.

544
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,561
That won't be necessary.

545
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,227
Ser Jaime.

546
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,728
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Why was Qyburn here?

547
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:42,394
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

548
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,603
I met with Tyrion.

549
00:38:57,477 --> 00:39:00,227
What did our brother
have to say?

550
00:39:02,811 --> 00:39:05,268
Daenerys wants to meet.

551
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:07,893
To discuss her surrender?

552
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:09,727
To discuss an armistice.

553
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:12,518
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

554
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,268
Because an army of dead men

555
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,811
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

556
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:21,143
Tyrion claims he'll have proof.

(CHUCKLES)

558
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:27,393
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

559
00:39:27,394 --> 00:39:28,894
Bronn.

560
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,810
He betrayed you.

561
00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:36,185
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

562
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:41,310
Do you think
anything of importance

563
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:43,810
happens in this city
without me knowing?

564
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:47,059
You let it happen.
Why?

565
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,727
I've come to believe that

566
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:52,435
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

567
00:39:52,436 --> 00:39:54,976
could be in our
immediate interest.

568
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:58,310
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

569
00:39:58,311 --> 00:40:00,477
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

570
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:07,102
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

571
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:12,143
Whatever stands in our way,

572
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:13,893
we will defeat it.

573
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,685
For ourselves, for our house,

574
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:18,686
for this.

575
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:32,893
Who will you say is the father?

576
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:34,185
You.

577
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:41,352
People won't like that.

578
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:49,393
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

579
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:53,352
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

580
00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:09,227
Never betray me again.

DAVOS:
We're leaving today.

582
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:19,810
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

583
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,393
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

584
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:24,852
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

585
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:27,184
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

586
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,184
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

590
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:37,268
You survived King's Landing.

591
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:40,268
Yet again. Your
Grace, this is Clo...

592
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:42,685
Name's Gendry, Your Grace.

593
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:44,268
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

594
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,394
Bastard son.

595
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:50,934
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

596
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:52,768
Our fathers trusted each other.

597
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:54,102
Why shouldn't we?

598
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:58,893
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

599
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:02,102
I met yours in my shop.

600
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:06,144
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

601
00:42:16,227 --> 00:42:20,018
I grew up on stories about them.

602
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:23,019
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

603
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:27,560
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

604
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:29,351
Let me come with you.

605
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:31,226
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

606
00:42:31,227 --> 00:42:33,059
No, but I'm a fighter.

607
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,144
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

608
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:40,059
You know how to use one?

609
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,435
Well, that's a problem.

610
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,977
I prefer a hammer.

611
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:48,686
He can handle himself.

612
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:52,560
We could use the help.

613
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:54,435
As my father used to say,

614
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:56,518
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

615
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,768
than dead for
the rest of your life."

616
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:01,184
I owe you my life.

617
00:43:01,185 --> 00:43:02,976
Twice over.

618
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:06,226
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

619
00:43:06,227 --> 00:43:08,686
I can't wait out this war.

620
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:14,393
Yeah, nobody mind me.

621
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:18,435
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

but I've missed you, Mormont.

626
00:43:34,894 --> 00:43:38,018
Nobody glowers quite like you.

627

Not even Grey Worm.

628
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:47,059
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

629
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,059
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

630
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,894
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

631
00:43:58,352 --> 00:43:59,728
Take it with you.

632
00:44:02,394 --> 00:44:03,893
But bring it back.

633
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:05,060
Our queen needs you.

634
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:16,894
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

Your Grace, I...

636

If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

637
00:44:39,728 --> 00:44:41,088
with the King
in the North anymore.

638
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:45,269
I've grown used to him.

639
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,977
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

640
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,728

steps there are in the Citadel?

643
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:29,518
No.

644
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,477
15,782.

645
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,477
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

646
00:45:42,603 --> 00:45:45,143
None anymore.

647
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:46,810
That's true.

648
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:51,143
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

649
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:53,352
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

650
00:45:56,894 --> 00:46:00,101
What does "annulment" mean?

651
00:46:00,102 --> 00:46:03,976
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

652
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:09,351
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

653
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:12,852
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

654
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,393
in a secret ceremony in Dorne.

655
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:17,310
Is that a common thing
in the south or...?

656
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:18,686
These maesters...

657
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:24,143
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

658
00:46:24,144 --> 00:46:26,435
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

659
00:46:26,436 --> 00:46:28,226
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

660
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:30,893
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

661
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:32,810
But that's all right, isn't it?

662
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:36,893
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

663

as long as we can have access
to the full records

664
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,561
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

665
00:46:44,894 --> 00:46:46,519
Steps.

666
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:51,686
That number was the steps.

Are you sure
you want to do this?

669
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,644
You always wanted
to be a maester.

670
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:24,436
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

WOLKAN:
I found it, my lord.

675
00:49:59,102 --> 00:50:00,810
It, uh, took some searching.

676
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:02,894
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

677
00:50:07,603 --> 00:50:10,226
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

678
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:12,102
Uh, yes, my lord.

679
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:18,811
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

job to talk him out

682
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:54,810
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

683
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:57,603
I've been failing
at that job of late.

Two.

686
00:53:02,603 --> 00:53:05,768
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

687
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:07,602
or the one who
fucks her brother?

Not enough.

We were hoping some of
your men could help.

- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

695
00:53:27,686 --> 00:53:30,810
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

696
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,811
You are.

697
00:53:34,603 --> 00:53:37,811
You really want to go out there?
Again?

698

You're not the only ones.

My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

Said they were
on their way here.

You're the Hound.

702
00:54:05,144 --> 00:54:06,977
I saw you once at Winterfell.

703
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:14,852
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

704
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:18,143
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

Our Lord told us that

GENDRY:
Don't trust him.

Don't trust any of them.

They're the Brotherhood.

And the last thing
their lord told them to do

710
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:36,685
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

00:54:58,686 --> 00:55:00,893
He was my father.

00:55:00,894 --> 00:55:03,893
He hunted us like animals.
