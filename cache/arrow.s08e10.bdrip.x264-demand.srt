1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,996
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,874
After five years in hell...

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,630
1 returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,235
to save my city.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,311
For eight years, I've fought
alongside brave men and women

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,595
striving for justice,

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,718
but then a Crisis came,

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,951
and I had to become
someone else.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,714
I had to become something else.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,471
1 made the ultimate sacrifice,

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,360
which helped birth an
entirely new universe.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,440
Now my friends and family
will have to go on without me,

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,910
and although I have
become a Spectre,

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,396
there is a part of me
that will always be

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,636
the Green Arrow.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,354
Both my children will live.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,113
Mom... what are you doing?

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,079
-Thea, I love you. No.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,435
Close your eyes, baby.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,431
No!

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
You possess true courage, Moira.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,119
I'm truly sorry...

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,914
you did not pass
that on to your son.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,669
It's just such a
strange thing to learn

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,194
that there's a whole other...

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,712
world, I guess...

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,395
where I died.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,035
The people that knew
my son best tefl me

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,797
that when Oliver sacrificed
himself during the Crisis,

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,874
that somehow he's the
reason that everything changed,

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,874
that the world we're
living in right now is

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,350
a kind of gift from him.

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,790
I don't know. I'm just
trying to process it.

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,275
II think we're all still
trying to process it,

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,078
not only Oliver's death...

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,272
but what he leaves behind.

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,639
It's a hell of a legacy.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,958
Not just a city of heroes,

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,229
a world of heroes.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,639
When I started this project,

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,519
it was intended to
explore the history

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,593
and the pitfalls of
vigilantism in Star City.

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,318
I never thought this documentary
would have to be retooled

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,754
to be a memorial.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,034
Nothing really ever, um,

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,075
happens the way you
expect it to happen,

47
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,274
and that was, uh,
certainly the case...

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,477
with Oliver and his mission.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,593
He always said
he would go it alone

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,794
and that the mission
would never...

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,150
be over.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,631
I'm glad he was...wrong
about the first part...

53
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,393
heartbroken he was
wrong about the second.

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,272
Thank you.

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,270
That was very moving.

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,391
Yeah.

57
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,679
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, man.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,076
You all right?

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,595
Everything good.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,709
Why do I get the sense
that answer disappoints you?

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,077
I just can't believe it.

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,556
Let's go.

63
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,957
When Oliver
rebooted the universe,

64
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,229
he fixed things.

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,519
Ever since the Crisis,

66
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,992
crime in Star City
disappeared overnight

67
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,750
literally.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,636
Dig, he...he saved this city.

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,556
Yeah.

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,875
Come on. It's time.

71
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,710
Prochnost.

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,714
Ugh. I didn't know
you speak Russian.

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,154
No. That's what
Oliver used to say

74
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,390
every time he drank this stuff.

75
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,631
“What exactly is
this stuff? “Vodka.

76
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,109
Yeah. It tastes like turpentine.

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,958
With faint hints of
nail polish remover.

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,675
So what's the plan?

79
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,958
I plan on getting as drunk

80
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,673
as humanly possible.

81
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,079
No. I mean after the funeral.

82
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,991
From what Dinah tells me,

83
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,310
there's not much need
for vigilantes anymore.

84
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,313
Lance's term ends in April.

85
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,913
He's endorsing
me to replace him.

86
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,516
-As mayor? No. As a
bald guy with an attitude.

87
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,590
Yeah, as mayor.

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,356
What about you, D?

89
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,509
Mayor, uh--for now at
least-- Lance actually

90
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,109
just offered me a
promotion to Chief of Police.

91
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,079
Guys, look. I know
how this looks.

92
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,159
1 just don't feel
like this is over,

93
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,039
Yeah. You're not reading
the same comstat reports I am.

94
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,078
We're a month out
of this Crisis, Dinah,

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,080
and there's tons
that we don't know,

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,919
what I do know is this.

97
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,833
Though Oliver's
gone, his mission

98
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,589
is far from over.

99
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,199
Finally. What the hell happened?

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,712
Jimmy Tarallo gave
me a few problems.

101
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,116
And by a few, you mean a
dozen men armed with knives?

102
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,239
No. I mean 22 with machetes.

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,029
Queen, you shouldn't
be doing this alone.

104
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,520
You're not ready to
go into the field, Diggle.

105
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,835
Yeah? Well, when I signed on,

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,832
I told you I was here to
keep the body count low.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,274
That includes you.

108
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,556
Well, I'm fine.

109
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,950
And Tarallo?

110
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,079
Alittle less so.

111
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,551
What's this?

112
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,995
The next name on the list.

113
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,513
John Byrne? What's the
CEO of a beer company

114
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,637
have to do to deserve an
arrow between the eyes?

115
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,074
Well, the company's a front.

116
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,639
He's using his trucks to ferry

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,598
a very different
type of commodity.

118
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,552
Drugs?

119
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,911
People.

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,631
Human trafficking?
Where does this end?

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,716
How many names are on your list?

122
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,439
Too many to cross
off. Listen, Diggle.

123
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,398
This doesn't end.

124
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,994
The mission is never over.

125
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,234
You can survive this,

126
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,919
make it home, right my wrongs,

127
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,314
but you got to live
through this first.

128
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,875
Survive.

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,312
No!

130
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,317
Hey. “What the frak?

131
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,637
Sorry. Il didn't
mean to scare you.

132
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,632
I meant to time portal
to your front door,

133
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,679
but I guess Il
overshot the mark a bit.

134
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,353
This is a-this is a nice room.

135
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,835
Time portal?

136
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,434
Yeah. I'm a time
traveler, remember?

137
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,713
Right. Okay. Um, and why
did you time travel here?

138
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,830
Because I'm here to take
you to your father's funeral.

139
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,994
You know, I actually
should have tried that sooner.

140
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,275
It's not that hard, actually.

141
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,910
That's because your arms
are the size of telephone poles.

142
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,078
You doing okay?

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,320
When am I never not okay?

144
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,751
I don't think any of
us are really okay,

145
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,231
but it seems to be hitting
you particularly hard.

146
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,357
I'm fine, like always.

147
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,197
You ready?

148
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,638
-Yeah. Let's do this. Yeah.

149
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,358
So what did Oliver
call this thing?

150
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,196
He called it the Mark of Four.

151
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,275
So how you doing?

152
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,712
Uh, I'm just--I'm
nervous about the funeral.

153
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,151
Yeah.

154
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,431
Yeah. You know,
Thea's gonna be there.

155
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,990
Imagine both of Oliver's
sisters would be there.

156
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,195
1kind of left Thea abruptly.

157
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,280
Ah. You're worried about
an awkward reunion.

158
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,039
I'm worried about
any kind of reunion.

159
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,789
Well, hey. Look at it this way.

160
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,118
After fighting the
Mirakuru soldiers

161
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,873
and the Thanatos Guild,

162
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,118
seeing your ex-girlfriend
should be cake.

163
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,635
That's why I'm scared.

164
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,156
I don't want her to
be my ex-girlfriend.

165
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,839
So when's Felicity get to town?

166
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,192
I don't know if she's coming.

167
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,394
It's her husband's funeral, man.

168
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,392
Which is exactly why I
think she might miss it.

169
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,676
I don't know, Rene.

170
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,471
She has a nanny
watching Mia right now.

171
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,193
Felicity hasn't even
made it out of bed.

172
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,913
I have no idea how to help her.

173
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,999
At least bring me for backup.

174
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,559
How many times are we
gonna go over this, Diggle?

175
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,679
You know, I went
through Byrne's financials.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,320
Every month, he gives
over a million dollars

177
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,551
to this outfit called
Black Armada.

178
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,030
-You know who they are?
-Private security firm.

179
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,278
Former special forces.
-That's right,

180
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,271
and you don't think
it's a good idea to bring

181
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,794
a former soldier of your own?

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,392
No.

183
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,436
You know what I think?

184
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,790
I don't think you
really want me there.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,559
Oh. Thanks for
finally getting my point.

186
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,074
I don't think you want me
there because you're afraid

187
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,197
1 will stop you from
committing cold-blooded murder.

188
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,951
You think that your role is
to keep the body count low.

189
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,271
There's a way you can stop
him tonight without killing him.

190
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,910
You could take him to prison,

191
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,954
you could see that
justice is served.

192
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,997
The man traffics
in human beings.

193
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,235
Killing him is justice.
-But at what cost?

194
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,399
You say your mission will
never end. Well, trust me,

195
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,313
it will end a lot sooner
if you lose who you are.

196
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,271
Mia?

197
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,878
Don't worry. The
Monitor didn't drop me off

198
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,519
because there's
another Crisis coming.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,832
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

200
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,275
Laurel's sister showed up,

201
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,310
thought I might enjoy
going to my dad's funeral.

202
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,078
And what are you
doing with all this stuff?

203
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,638
Trying my best to
channel my mom.

204
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,830
Sorry. Um, when
Sara dropped me off,

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,150
she gave me this whole
lecture about not telling people

206
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,680
about the future, SO...

207
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,672
Few weeks before
Sara showed up...

208
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,035
something happened.

209
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,030
William!

210
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,470
Right in front of me. I couldn't
do anything to stop it, and...

211
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,715
I am already failing at
being the Green Arrow.

212
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,998
What we do is not easy.

213
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,949
There are setbacks,
there are tragedies,

214
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,872
but, God, Mia, your father,

215
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,671
he would be so, so proud

216
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,792
of how you're
carrying all of that.

217
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,198
I can't even do
the one thing that

218
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,959
he risked his
entire life to do--

219
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,355
protect my family.

220
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,556
What's this?

221
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,713
Well, your mother's
Archer protocol scans

222
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,553
news stations for
certain key words.

223
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,037
William Clayton, the son of
the late hero Oliver Queen,

224
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,919
was abducted tonight in
his hometown of Central City.

225
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,878
The police have
been unable to confirm

226
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,997
any suspects in the kidnapping.

227
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,998
Hey. Hey.

228
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,910
Look. I'm sorry about
the way that I left.

229
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,871
ljust...

230
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,074
Ollie's just passed away,

231
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,594
and William's been kidnapped,

232
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,354
50...as far as apologies go,

233
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,318
your timing's a
little not great.

234
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,590
If you still think Oliver's
mission's finished,

235
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,678
tell that to William
when we get him back.

236
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,877
We will get him back,
but, John, William

237
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,872
was kidnapped
outside of Star City.

238
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,792
I'm sure that'll make
him feel a whole lot better.

239
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,836
- reached out to Felicity.
-Yeah. Me, too.

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,035
Radio silence.

241
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,195
I asked Sara to check on her.

242
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,149
Ah. I haven't seen this many
people down here in a while.

243
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,231
Hey.

244
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,997
Hey.

245
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,592
It's almost like a party.

246
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,960
Um, I tried running a
quad-grid search task

247
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,030
to a keyhole
satellite array, but...

248
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,316
That array's dark-sided as it
undergoes a firmware upgrade,

249
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,352
but fortunately when
William moved to Central City,

250
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,712
his overbearing stepmom implanted a
subdermal tracking device into his arm.

251
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,553
Ethical--debatable.

252
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,952
Which went dark as soon
as he reentered Star City.

253
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,873
Well, that's
convenient at least.

254
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,395
Just one second as I work
up a statistically correlated list

255
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,880
of possible locations
he could be at.

256
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,951
That is a very long list.

257
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,390
Which is exactly why
we called everyone.

258
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,955
Thank you all for coming,

259
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,719
some on very short notice.

260
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,389
Oliver made the
ultimate sacrifice

261
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,756
for his friends and his family.

262
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,557
Now a part of his
family needs our help.

263
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,639
This is our most
important mission.

264
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,956
Suit up.

265
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,672
Okay. Well, he's not here.

266
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,558
What was the next
place on Felicity's list?

267
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,790
Kord industries.

268
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,509
All right. Well, let's go.

269
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,114
Hey. Can I talk to
you for a second?

270
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,635
You already did back
at the bunker, okay? I...

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,957
I get it. You're sorry.

272
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,316
No. I never told you why I left.

273
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,914
And you don't need to.

274
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,236
I understand. You
were going through a lot.

275
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,676
Dying, getting resurrected,

276
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,359
it gave me a whole new
perspective on--on everything,

277
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,835
including you.

278
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,952
You know, I got
my whole life back,

279
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,077
and I realized that
I wanted you in it...

280
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,198
forever and... and always.

281
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,997
And what does that mean?

282
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,271
It means...

283
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,195
will you marry me?

284
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,475
Uh...

285
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,834
Get out.

286
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,433
Get out!

287
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,593
“What the hell is that thing?
-Get outta here!

288
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,632
-Come on. Let's go!
-Go, go, go, go!

289
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,315
Ahh,

290
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,078
Nice. I would have fired
some shots in the air.

291
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,835
My way's scarier.

292
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,751
So, how are things?

293
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,355
It's been a while.

294
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,159
Yeah. Well, a
while is what it took

295
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,038
for these rags to work again.

296
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,438
Since then, I've been
fighting for justice.

297
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,189
To honor your father?

298
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,760
To honor Oliver.

299
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,191
We've had our
differences over the years.

300
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,555
Yeah, I assumed.

301
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,956
Why?

302
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,235
Of everyone,

303
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,833
you're the most like him.

304
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,149
Clear! Clear!

305
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,430
Damn it!

306
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,551
What?

307
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,556
He's not here.

308
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,233
Curtis said there's a bunch
of places he could still be.

309
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,834
-Well, we need to
find him. We will.

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,434
We have to find him, Johnny.

311
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,874
We will, Lyla. Are you okay?

312
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,952
Oliver put our
family back together.

313
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,430
What happens if--

314
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,079
if we can't do the same for his?

315
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,674
Lyla, look at me. We can,

316
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,999
and we will, I promise.

317
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,151
We will.

318
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,076
Let him go!

319
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,280
Who the hell are you?

320
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,312
I said, who are you?

321
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,876
You're wearing his
hood. You should know.

322
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,713
No, please, please.

323
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,550
Agh!

324
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,437
Unh!

325
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,836
You stay back!

326
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,635
John Bye...

327
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,277
you have failed this city.

328
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,359
Let him go!

329
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,796
I' brought him up
here to throw him off.

330
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,312
My whole life ended right here!

331
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,598
I don't care! Final warning.

332
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,111
He thought he was saving me.

333
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,791
eight years in Iron Heights
never saved anyone.

334
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,189
So you kidnap his son,

335
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,035
the man who spared your life?

336
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,077
I should put this
arrow in you right now!

337
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,590
Do it! After eight
years in prison,

338
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,990
1 got nothing left
to live for anyway!

339
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,830
Go ahead!

340
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,032
No.

341
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,878
Oliver Queen didn't kill you,

342
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,195
then neither will I,

343
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,552
but your ass is
going back to prison.

344
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,674
This is the riser,

345
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,393
uh, this is the arrow shelf,

346
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,556
and this is the fadeout.

347
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,275
That's really cool.

348
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,951
That's...

349
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,031
Mia.

350
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,634
Must be a lot to take in.

351
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,995
Yeah. That's the...

352
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,838
understatement
of the millennium.

353
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,155
She became a hero.

354
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,240
Well, she had good parents.

355
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,794
Do you...you want to meet her?

356
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,836
I don't know.

357
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,509
She--she might be here,

358
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,115
but she's...she's also at home,

359
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,994
waiting for me,

360
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,071
and I get to see her grow up.

361
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,632
I'm not sure I
want to rush that.

362
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,195
- Hey.
- Hey.

363
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,960
Something on the
news you should see.

364
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,871
What?

365
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,356
William Clayton
was safely recovered

366
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,318
from his kidnapper John Byrne.

367
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,596
Apparently the
abduction was revenge

368
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,196
for Oliver Queen bringing
Byrne to justice eight years ago.

369
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,829
We have exclusive
footage of the rescue.

370
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,910
With Oliver Queen
confirmed dead,

371
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,799
we can only speculate
that he inspired

372
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,318
a new generation of heroes
to carry on his mission.

373
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,714
Like I said...proud.

374
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,396
Diggle!

375
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,837
Don't use just your arms.

376
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,234
Power's coming from your hips.

377
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,310
Thanks for the tip.

378
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,238
Just get real good at that,

379
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,158
and maybe I'll eventually
take you out in the field.

380
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,716
Byrne didn't really have
a good night, did he?

381
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,191
He had a better
night than you think.

382
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,713
He's being arraigned
in the morning.

383
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,631
Hmm.

384
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,557
Plenty of people in this
book that deserve to die,

385
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,676
plain and simple,

386
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,475
probably not everyone.

387
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,033
Let's consider
Mr. John Byrne to be

388
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,080
proof of concept.

389
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,993
That people can be redeemed?

390
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,233
That one day I'll
be able to trust you.

391
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,395
Your mom let me in.

392
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,357
Is it just me, or
does the new Moira

393
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,352
seem to like me a lot
more than the old Moira?

394
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,550
Yeah. She never really
liked you that much,

395
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,471
but in her defense,
you were a criminal.

396
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,875
Well, I regret nothing.

397
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,790
If I never stole your purse,

398
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,030
then I never would have met you,

399
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,237
and even if you do
say no to my proposal,

400
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,080
which II really hope you don't--

401
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,910
loving you has
changed my life, Thea.

402
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,275
If Ollie's death has
taught me anything, it's...

403
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,236
that we don't have a
lot of time in this life.

404
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,879
As long as you promise

405
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,071
if you ever freak out
on me like that again,

406
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,233
you tell me instead
of just leaving.

407
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,995
Yeah, yeah. I--] can
make that promise.

408
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,116
Then yes.

409
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,758
Yes?

410
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,072
1 will marry you, Roy Harper.

411
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,915
Hey. What are you doing here?

412
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,036
Looking for you.

413
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,674
Well, I was just
looking for Dinah.

414
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,877
I think she's, uh, ghosting me.

415
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,554
Do you have a second to talk?

416
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,276
Want to step into not my office?

417
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,312
So, uh, what's up?

418
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,750
It's about Oliver.

419
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,039
Well, not exactly him, but...

420
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,719
who his sacrifice brought back.

421
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,790
-Like me?
-And Tommy and Moira...

422
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,110
but not me

423
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,838
or the other me, your--

424
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,870
your Laurel.

425
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,394
Look. We don't
exactly know the rules

426
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,755
of this whole
resurrection thing.

427
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,830
Yes, we do.

428
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,034
You're all of the
people who Oliver

429
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,271
would have wanted his
sacrifice to bring back,

430
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,350
and Laurel, she--

431
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,959
she would have
been on that list, too,

432
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,475
if it wasn't for me.

433
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,995
Oliver's death, it
fixed everything else.

434
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,154
Why didn't it fix this, too?

435
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,752
Because, sweetheart,
there is nothing about you

436
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
that needed to be fixed.

437
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,510
All right.

438
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,316
Dig, what's going on?

439
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,595
The end of the line.

440
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,874
You were right.
The mission's over.

441
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,638
Just took me a
while to accept that.

442
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,589
I think accepting
that meant accepting

443
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,234
that Oliver is really gone.

444
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,950
You know, Sara said
that before Oliver died

445
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,519
that he became something else.

446
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,872
I'd like to think that
somehow, someway,

447
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,910
he's still here.

448
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,389
I'd drink to that.

449
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,671
Just as long as it's no more
of that God-awful vodka.

450
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,671
Okay. Cool. So...
you're moving on.

451
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,796
So what's next for you?

452
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,111
Lyla accepted a promotion
in Metropolis, so...

453
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,954
we're all gonna move
there after the funeral.

454
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,111
Soaml.

455
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,198
I'm not gonna
take the promotion.

456
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,834
Just no point being
police in a safe city,

457
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,471
and there are lots of
cities that still need saving.

458
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,437
Damn.

459
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,113
And here I am getting to
be elected in a few months,

460
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,476
and you guys
decide to move away.

461
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,071
Kind of hard not to
take that personally.

462
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,073
Don't worry, Rene. You
are gonna be a great mayor

463
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,149
because you're a great man.

464
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,990
I learned from the best.

465
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,476
Oliver.

466
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,435
And the two of you.

467
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,950
Who's getting the lights?

468
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,191
1 will.

469
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,034
I'm gonna miss this place.

470
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,150
We all will.

471
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,955
Thank you for coming.

472
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,794
For a long time...

473
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,914
I hated Oliver Queen.

474
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,791
I blamed him for the death
of my youngest daughter,

475
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,873
I blamed him for the
violence in my city,

476
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,711
I interrogated
him, I hunted him,

477
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,269
persecuted him.

478
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,117
I've never been
more wrong in my life.

479
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,550
Oliver Queen wasn't just a hero.

480
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,995
He was a good man.

481
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,074
He was an honorable person.

482
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,193
The fact that he
didn't start out that way

483
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,839
makes him, in my book,

484
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,920
even more honorable.

485
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,080
He stands as a
reminder to all of us

486
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,919
that anyone can change.

487
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,669
So will this.

488
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,633
I just don't understand.

489
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,558
If Ollie could fix everything,

490
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,154
then why couldn't he fix this?

491
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,357
I think that Oliver could
only change the things

492
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,079
that didn't change him,

493
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,158
and if not for
your father and...

494
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,830
what he did for Oliver,

495
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,791
your brother would never have
become the man that he was.

496
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,269
still can't believe
Ollie's really gone.

497
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,433
I know, sweetheart.

498
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,599
I'm sorry to intrude,

499
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,436
but I wanted to meet you.

500
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,639
-I'm-- My sister.

501
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,118
Oliver told me a lot about you.

502
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,998
I'm sorry that it took
something like this

503
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,116
for us to finally meet.

504
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,399
Yes. Emiko, you are
welcome here anytime.

505
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,911
Thank you.

506
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,992
So you're from
another Earth, is that it?

507
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,833
I know it's a lot to take in.

508
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,471
Well, I just found out there's
a reality where I was dead,

509
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,149
so that's the curve I'm
grading on these days.

510
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,038
The Laurel of, well,
this Earth, um...

511
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,633
she was my wife.

512
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,032
So it must be strange seeing me.

513
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,278
Ho! Yeah. Well, strange
enough to blow the curve...

514
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,438
but there's something
nice about it, too.

515
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,557
My condolences on
your husband's passing.

516
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,832
I had our marriage erased.

517
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,593
Feelings cannot be erased.

518
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,359
I had no feelings for him.

519
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,036
Our marriage was
Father's perverse joke,

520
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,039
meant to torment me.

521
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,032
Our father only ever meant
for you to have a normal life.

522
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,998
I have lived a life
far more normal

523
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,958
than the one father
designed for me.

524
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,517
Hey. Thank you for coming.

525
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,274
There's nowhere else I'd be.

526
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,633
Sara, this is my sister Talia.

527
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,110
-Hi. Hello.

528
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,078
Talia, this is Sara,

529
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,996
my beloved.

530
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,430
Hey, Dad.

531
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,311
Hi.

532
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,035
Oh. Hi.

533
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,189
"me - know.

534
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,349
This morning, you were teething,

535
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,239
and now you're-- I mean, wow.

536
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,789
Dad had a very similar
reaction when he first saw me.

537
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,195
You met your father.

538
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,035
Yeah. He trained me.

539
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,274
He taught me to be a hero,

540
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,709
how to be like him.

541
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,193
I can tell you're
a lot like him.

542
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,314
I can only hope.

543
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,636
Felicity.

544
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,271
Hey.

545
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,754
I'm so sorry.

546
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,430
He was a good man.

547
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,476
I was there at the end, and...

548
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,709
every day, I'm tortured
with the thought

549
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,950
that I could have done more,

550
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,598
should have done more.

551
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,953
No. You did everything
that you could, Barry.

552
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,350
How could you know that?

553
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,591
Well, because, you
know, I know you.

554
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,991
I'm sorry.

555
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,116
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

556
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,470
Felicity.

557
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,469
I'm so sorry.

558
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,231
There is no body down there, no?

559
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,431
No.

560
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,717
We buried a casket
full of mementos.

561
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,595
Does anybody wanna
say a few words?

562
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,957
I'm barely keeping
it together as it is.

563
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,639
I think that Oliver
would have been worried

564
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,837
that I'd say something
tactless anyway, so...

565
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,757
- don't know what to say. Yeah.

566
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,874
Words seem... meaningless.

567
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,598
Hey.

568
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,955
Should be you.

569
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,954
The Oliver that I
met eight years ago

570
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,680
is not the one that we
say good-bye to today.

571
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,274
Oliver always told me
that in order to save his city,

572
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,158
he had to become someone else,

573
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,914
he had to become something else.

574
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,397
I always thought that meant
becoming the Green Arrow,

575
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,157
but...today, I realized
that meant becoming

576
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,230
a better man,

577
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,319
the best man he knew how to be,

578
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,229
and he took all of us
with him on that journey.

579
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,949
He changed everything.

580
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,755
Oliver brought
heroes into the world,

581
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,716
he inspired heroes,

582
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,998
he inspired all of us here.

583
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,950
I was his brother,

584
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,754
and Oliver Queen... was mine.

585
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,111
Of course, life will go on.

586
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,115
It always does,

587
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,436
but how, what twists
and turns it will take,

588
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,670
I can't say.

589
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,759
I don't know what
the future holds...

590
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,350
except to say fo
expect the unexpected.

591
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,833
bangs]

592
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,319
Oliver may be gone,

593
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,512
but his mission endures.

594
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,114
That mission lives on,

595
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,513
Oliver lives on in the
people he inspired.

596
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,475
Some will take that mission
to the rest of the world...

597
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,118
maybe even beyond that...

598
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,794
because if the past eight
years has shown us anything...

599
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,236
it's that this
universe is far bigger

600
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,513
than any of us could
have dared imagine...

601
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,592
even ifitis a little less bright

602
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,555
without him in it.

603
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,994
Where I'm taking you,

604
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,870
there is no return.

605
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,316
I have waited a very
long time to see him.

606
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,276
I'm ready.

607
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,711
Hi.

608
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,238
Glad you could finally make it.

609
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,269
This is so nice.

610
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,869
Not to complain. I just thought

611
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,519
that the afterlife
would look a little less

612
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,795
like your old office.

613
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,839
It's my mom's office.

614
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,433
I wanted to be
where I first saw you.

615
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,196
Well, that would be in the IT
Department seven floors down.

616
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,111
You sure?

617
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,590
You're cute.

618
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,511
Too bad you're, you know, dead,

619
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,030
which is obviously a lot
worse for you than it is for me.

620
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,835
It's a long story.

621
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,033
Lucky for us...

622
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,195
we have all the
time in the world

623
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,720
for me to tell it to you.

624
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,989
Greg, move your head!
