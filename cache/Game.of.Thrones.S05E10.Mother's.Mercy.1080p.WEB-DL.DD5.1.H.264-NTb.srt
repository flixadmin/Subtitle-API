1
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,294
<i>Brace the wind.</i>

2
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,866
The Lord of Light has made
good on his promise, my king.

3
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:17,702
His fires have melted
the snows away.

4
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:19,287
The way ahead is clear.

5
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:20,922
We ride for Winterfell.

6
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:22,373
And you will take it.

7
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,378
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

8
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:30,048
You will receive
what is yours by right.

9
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,820
Your Grace.

10
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,372
Prepare to form up.

11
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:56,157
Your Grace.

12
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:00,795
Tell me.

13
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,499
The men, many deserted
before dawn.

14
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,670
<i>How many?</i>

15
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,755
<i>Nearly half.</i>

16
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:13,675
All the sellswords
with all the horses.

17
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:26,571
Your Grace.

18
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:31,943
Speak up. Can't be
worse than mutiny.

19
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,392
Cut her down.

20
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,407
<i>Your Grace.</i>

21
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:22,410
The Lady Melisandre was just
seen riding out of camp.

22
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,758
Get the men
into marching formation.

23
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:40,762
On to Winterfell.

24
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:48,403
He raised his hands

25
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:50,738
and they all stood up at once.

26
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:57,095
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

27
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,780
So what are you gonna do?

28
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,836
I'm gonna hope they don't
learn how to climb the Wall.

29
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,622
But the dragonglass...

30
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,458
No one's ever
getting that back now.

31
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,111
<i>It wouldn't have
mattered anyway.</i>

32
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,595
<i>Not unless we had
a mountain of it.</i>

33
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,265
But you killed a white walker.

34
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,900
<i>With Longclaw.</i>

35
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,637
I saw them shatter steel
axes like they were glass.

36
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:25,640
<i>- But Longclaw...
- Is Valyrian steel.</i>

37
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:28,259
How many Valyrian steel swords
are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

38
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:30,111
Not enough.

39
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,148
The first Lord Commander
in history

40
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,617
to sacrifice the lives
of sworn brothers

41
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,736
to save the lives of wildlings.

42
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:45,376
How's it feel to be friends with the
most hated man in Castle Black?

43
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,462
<i>You were friends with me
when I first came here.</i>

44
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,580
And I wasn't winning
any elections back then.

45
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,667
Here's to us, then.

46
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,385
Long may they sneer.

47
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:04,595
What?

48
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,783
I wanted to ask you something.

49
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:12,353
To ask something of you.

50
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:18,159
Send me, Gilly,
and the baby to Oldtown

51
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:20,361
so I can become a maester.

52
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:23,164
That's what I'm meant to be.
Not this.

53
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:26,417
I need you here, Sam.

54
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,870
If you leave, who's left
to give me advice I trust?

55
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,340
Well, there's Edd.

56
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,678
I'd be more use
to you as a maester.

57
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:41,682
More use to everyone now
that Maester Aemon is gone.

58
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:44,519
The Citadel has the
world's greatest library.

59
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:47,722
I'll learn about history,

60
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:50,258
strategy, healing.

61
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,959
And other things,

62
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,896
things that will
help when--

63
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,564
when they come.

64
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:02,270
If Gilly stays here,
then she'll die.

65
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:07,108
And the baby that she
named after me will die.

66
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:10,378
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

67
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:15,333
Which means that the last thing
that I'll see in this world

68
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,336
will be the look in her
eyes when I fail them.

69
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:26,260
And I'd rather see a thousand
white walkers than see that.

70
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,827
Thank you.

71
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,497
You know that the Citadel will
make you swear off women, too.

72
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,783
Oh, they'll bloody try.

73
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,889
- Sam.
- What?

74
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,492
Sam.

75
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,296
You had just been beaten half to death.
How did you--

76
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,966
Oh, very carefully.

77
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:08,102
I'm glad the end of the world's

78
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:09,870
working out well for someone.

79
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,744
I'll come back.

80
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,197
To your return.

81
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,867
To my return.

82
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,752
<i>Aye, this way.</i>

83
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,788
<i>My lady!</i>

84
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,542
Stannis.

85
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:46,711
Stannis Baratheon is coming.
His whole army.

86
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:48,179
How do you know it's Stannis?

87
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:50,131
They're carrying his
flaming heart banners.

88
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:53,718
From the Blackwater.
I'll never forget it.

89
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:32,590
Trench here.

90
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:34,842
Another one 300 yards
from the castle wall.

91
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,061
Hurry them along.

92
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:38,596
- Right, Curlew.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:39,847
<i>Dig between those two rises.</i>

94
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,782
<i>- Spread out.
- I'm with you.</i>

95
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:44,018
<i>- Archers!
- Spread out!</i>

96
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,654
And send out a foraging
party immediately.

97
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:48,989
Siege begins at sunrise.

98
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,442
There's not going to be
a siege, Your Grace.

99
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:35,619
<i>We've got no chance!</i>

100
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:47,558
<i>No, please, please.</i>

101
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:43,113
Bolton has women
fighting for him?

102
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:46,433
I don't fight for the Boltons.

103
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,803
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

104
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:54,742
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.

105
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:04,585
I was there when he was murdered
by a shadow with your face.

106
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:10,791
<i>You murdered him
with blood magic?</i>

107
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:18,098
I did.

108
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:29,543
In the name of Renly
of House Baratheon,

109
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:31,278
First of His Name,

110
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:34,298
rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

111
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:37,584
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

112
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:41,689
I, Brienne of Tarth,
sentence you to die.

113
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,097
Do you have any last words?

114
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,442
Go on, do your duty.

115
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:21,595
Looks like we're done here.

116
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:40,447
I surrender!
I surrender!

117
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,483
And I accept your surrender.

118
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:56,163
Let's head back.

119
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,499
My wife must be lonely.

120
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,283
My lady.

121
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:35,586
I've come to escort you
back to your chamber.

122
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,172
Go with her, please.

123
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,878
I know what Ramsay is.

124
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,131
I know what he'll do to me.

125
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:52,386
If I'm going to die,

126
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:55,939
let it happen while there's
still some of me left.

127
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,643
Die?

128
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,129
Who said anything about dying?

129
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:03,831
You can't die.

130
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,599
Your father was
Warden of the North.

131
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,568
Ramsay needs you.

132
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:13,040
Though I suppose he
doesn't need all of you.

133
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:15,742
Just the parts he'll use
to make his heir,

134
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:18,912
until you've given him a boy or
two and he's finished using them.

135
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:25,552
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.

136
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:28,755
So, shall we wait
for him to come back

137
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,757
or should we begin now?

138
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,978
You're leaving it to me?

139
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,647
Good.

140
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,432
Let's begin.

141
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,936
Reek-- stop!

142
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,855
Stop!

143
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:54,615
<i>Open the gate!</i>

144
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,674
He's coming back.

145
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:42,356
I can see I have
my work cut out for me.

146
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,608
You two, out.

147
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:42,749
You were the first person
on my list, you know.

148
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,786
For killing Syrio Forel.
Remember him?

149
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,121
Probably not.

150
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:53,293
I've gotten a few of the others.

151
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:56,463
The Many-Faced God stole
a few more from me.

152
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:59,049
But I'm glad he left me you.

153
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:04,721
Do you know who I am?

154
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:11,194
I can't hear you.

155
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,905
You know who I am.

156
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:23,990
I'm Arya Stark.

157
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:35,585
Do you know who you are?

158
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:39,756
You're no one.

159
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:42,893
You're nothing.

160
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:28,772
A girl has taken a life.

161
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:31,274
The wrong life.

162
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,111
I was right about her.

163
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:36,563
You were.

164
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:40,400
You're not ready.

165
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:43,787
Not at all.

166
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,993
That man's life
was not yours to take.

167
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:53,580
A girl stole from
the Many-Faced God.

168
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,501
Now a debt is owed.

169
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:05,425
Only death can pay for life.

170
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:20,907
No! No!

171
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:24,361
No, you-- don't die!
Don't die!

172
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:31,718
Why are you crying?

173
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,921
He was my friend.

174
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:37,691
No, he wasn't.
Didn't you listen to him?

175
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:41,011
<i>He was no one.</i>

176
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:46,266
But if you're--

177
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:50,237
who's this?

178
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:52,205
<i>No one at all.</i>

179
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,942
Just as a girl should have been
before she took a face from the hall.

180
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:04,751
<i>The faces are for no one.</i>

181
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:06,319
You are still someone.

182
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,791
And to someone,

183
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:13,326
the faces are as good as poison.

184
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:28,191
I can't see.

185
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:36,983
What's happening?

186
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:39,102
What's happening?!

187
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:52,032
<i>- I wish you a safe journey home.
- Thank you.</i>

188
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:59,589
Forgive me, child.

189
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:03,460
I wish you all the
happiness in the world.

190
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:22,979
Maybe I'll come
visit you sometime.

191
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,948
Maybe I'll come visit you.

192
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:26,616
Don't wait too long.

193
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,368
Got a noblewoman
to marry back home.

194
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:31,071
You want a good girl,

195
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,406
but you need the bad pussy.

196
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,745
<i>Whenever you're ready, my lord.</i>

197
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:56,813
Try not to lose it this time.

198
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:01,685
I'll never take it off again.

199
00:27:01,736 --> 00:27:04,738
I know you didn't
want to leave Dorne,

200
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:06,940
but I'm glad you're coming home.

201
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:08,692
Your mother's desperate
to see you.

202
00:27:08,743 --> 00:27:11,111
I'm glad Trystane
is coming with us.

203
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,946
He seems like a nice boy.

204
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:14,748
You're lucky.

205
00:27:14,782 --> 00:27:18,118
Arranged marriages
are rarely so--

206
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,286
so well arranged.

207
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,088
Do you think Mother
will like him?

208
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,960
If she sees you're happy,
I'm sure she will.

209
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:28,323
You really believe that?

210
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:31,131
Have you ever known
your mother to like anyone

211
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,466
aside from her children?

212
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:35,301
She likes you.

213
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:38,221
I'm not so sure about that.

214
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:39,806
Listen...

215
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:44,110
there's something
I wanted to tell you.

216
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:48,615
Something I should
have told you long ago.

217
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:50,483
So...

218
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,371
now that you've seen
more of the world,

219
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:59,075
you've learned how
complicated things can be,

220
00:27:59,126 --> 00:28:01,227
people can be.

221
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,497
The Lannisters and the Martells
have hated each other for years,

222
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:06,800
but you've fallen
in love with Trystane.

223
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:09,552
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

224
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,387
You happen to fall
in love with the man

225
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:13,506
you were assigned to marry?

226
00:28:13,557 --> 00:28:15,308
My point is...

227
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:20,513
we don't choose whom we love.

228
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:22,849
It just, well--

229
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:27,487
it's beyond our control.

230
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:29,405
- I sound like an idiot.
- No, you don't.

231
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,991
What I'm trying to say--
what I'm trying

232
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:33,326
and failing to say--

233
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,744
I know what
you're trying to say.

234
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,163
No, I'm afraid you don't.

235
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:38,865
I do.

236
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:44,704
I know.

237
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:46,339
About you and Mother.

238
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,127
I think a part of me
always knew.

239
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,882
And I'm glad.

240
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:01,521
I'm glad that you're my father.

241
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,308
Myrcella?

242
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:42,929
Myrcella?

243
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,188
Myrcella?
Myrcella?

244
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,518
You love her, don't you?

245
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:18,691
How could you not?

246
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:22,161
Of course it's hopeless
for the both of you.

247
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:25,698
A sellsword from the fighting
pits, a disgraced knight.

248
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:27,867
Neither one of you is fit
consort for a queen.

249
00:31:30,037 --> 00:31:34,173
But we always want
the wrong woman.

250
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,292
Does he always talk so much?

251
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:41,381
Jorah the Andal.

252
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,599
Torgo Nudho.

253
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:45,134
He should not be here.

254
00:31:45,185 --> 00:31:46,519
No, but he is.

255
00:31:46,553 --> 00:31:49,222
Our queen ordered him
exiled from city.

256
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:51,524
Our queen would be dead
if not for him.

257
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:56,083
_

258
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,447
_

259
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,368
_

260
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:06,775
_

261
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:10,617
_

262
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,928
_

263
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,799
<i>Puñila.
Thank you.</i>

264
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,585
I am sorry.

265
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:22,088
Sorry I not there
to fight for our queen.

266
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,636
You missed a good scrap.

267
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:25,141
None of that matters now.

268
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:26,592
The longer we sit
here bantering,

269
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:29,178
the longer Daenerys is out
there in the wilderness.

270
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:31,597
He's right.
The dragon headed north.

271
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,649
If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.

272
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:34,767
We?

273
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,686
You're a Lannister.

274
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:39,655
The queen intends to remove
your family from power.

275
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,407
And I intend to help her do it.

276
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:43,617
You've been here
for how many days now?

277
00:32:43,737 --> 00:32:45,611
I've fought for her for years.

278
00:32:45,662 --> 00:32:47,246
Since she was little
more than a child.

279
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:49,532
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.

280
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,951
And she exiled you.
Twice, I believe.

281
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,619
The second time thanks to you.

282
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,955
Don't blame me for
your crimes, Mormont.

283
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:58,708
He's right.
Our queen exiled Jorah.

284
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,761
And he's right.
Jorah saved her life.

285
00:33:01,795 --> 00:33:03,796
Perhaps she feels
differently about him now.

286
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:06,741
Perhaps not. The only way
we'll know is if we ask her.

287
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:10,053
<i>Fine, fine. I
suppose he can join us.</i>

288
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,638
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

289
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,892
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.

290
00:33:15,943 --> 00:33:18,644
Forgive me, but why
would we bring you?

291
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:21,481
Pardon me?

292
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,649
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

293
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:26,536
Not precisely, but I have other
skills that would be useful.

294
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,571
Can you fight?

295
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:29,989
I have fought.

296
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,824
I don't claim to be
a great warrior.

297
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,960
Are you good on a horse?

298
00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:35,328
Middling.

299
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:37,497
So mainly you talk.

300
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:39,715
And drink.
I've survived so far.

301
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,136
Which I respect, but you would
not help us on this expedition.

302
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:47,106
You would help us
here in Meereen, though.

303
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:49,976
None of us have experience
governing a city

304
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,227
except for him.

305
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:53,262
You want to prove
your value to the queen?

306
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:54,647
Prove it right here in Meereen.

307
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:57,433
He's a foreign dwarf that
barely speaks the language.

308
00:33:57,484 --> 00:33:58,935
Why would the Meereenese
listen to him?

309
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,853
They wouldn't.

310
00:34:00,904 --> 00:34:02,772
They will listen to Grey Worm.

311
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:04,440
I'll come with you.

312
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:06,526
I'll find our queen.

313
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:08,995
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

314
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:11,280
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

315
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:14,450
But you still can't go.

316
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:16,202
The people believe in you.

317
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:18,037
They know you speak
for the queen.

318
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:20,006
It's true.

319
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,041
Only the Unsullied can keep
the peace in Meereen.

320
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:25,378
If you leave, half this city
will consume the other half.

321
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,680
And Missandei.

322
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:30,633
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

323
00:34:30,684 --> 00:34:33,436
Certainly not me.

324
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,555
The queen's closest confidante,

325
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,274
the commander of the Unsullied,

326
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:41,060
and a foreign dwarf
with a scarred face.

327
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,729
Good fortune, my friends.

328
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:45,648
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

329
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,733
Try not to ruin her.

330
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:51,237
Looks like it's you and me,
Jorah the Andal.

331
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:53,372
Let's find some good horses.

332
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:55,791
We have so much to talk about.

333
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:30,743
Hello, old friend.

334
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:36,282
I thought we were so happy
together until you abandoned me.

335
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:40,953
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

336
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:43,339
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

337
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,625
if one knows how to listen.

338
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:48,511
They tell me you've
already found favor

339
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:50,630
with the Mother of Dragons.

340
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,432
Well, she didn't execute me,

341
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:56,802
so that's a promising start.

342
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:58,938
Now the heroes
are off to find her

343
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:01,140
and I'm stuck here

344
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:04,777
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

345
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:06,562
Any advice for an old comrade?

346
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:08,114
Information is the key.

347
00:36:08,148 --> 00:36:10,700
You need to learn your enemy's
strengths and strategies.

348
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:15,238
You need to learn which of your
friends are not your friends.

349
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:18,574
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

350
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,660
If only.

351
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:25,464
A grand old city

352
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:28,217
choking on violence,
corruption, and deceit.

353
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,220
Who could possibly
have any experience

354
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:34,090
managing such a massive,
ungainly beast?

355
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:42,014
I did miss you.

356
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:44,934
Oh, I know.

357
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,424
We have to go home.

358
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,883
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

359
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:20,052
Does it hurt?

360
00:37:22,723 --> 00:37:24,724
We have to go home.

361
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:29,362
Drogon.

362
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:31,614
Can you take me back to Meereen?

363
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:38,237
How far did you carry me?

364
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,798
Drogon, we need to return.

365
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,583
My people need me.

366
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,867
Well, there's no food.

367
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:28,003
At the very least, you
could hunt us some supper.

368
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:06,946
Confess.

369
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,952
Confess.

370
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:26,298
I have sinned.

371
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:29,134
I see that now.

372
00:41:29,185 --> 00:41:31,887
How can I have been
so blind for so long?

373
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:36,108
I want to be clean again.

374
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,528
I want absolution.

375
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:45,317
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

376
00:41:45,352 --> 00:41:47,052
And by its holy light--

377
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,622
You wish to make a confession?

378
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,294
Once I've confessed,
will I be free?

379
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:58,330
Your Grace will be dealt
with according to her sins.

380
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,935
The Mother have mercy, then.

381
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:08,040
I lay with a man outside the
bonds of marriage. I confess.

382
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:09,808
Name him.

383
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,381
Lancel Lannister.

384
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:18,651
Your cousin
and the king's squire.

385
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:21,520
- I was lonely and afraid.
- You had a husband.

386
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,572
A husband off whoring
every chance he--

387
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,525
His sins do not pardon your own.

388
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:30,613
May the gods forgive me.

389
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:34,500
Other men?

390
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:36,869
No.

391
00:42:36,871 --> 00:42:39,088
No others?

392
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:42,341
No.

393
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:45,878
<i>Speaking falsehoods before
the gods is a great crime.</i>

394
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:47,463
<i>You understand this?</i>

395
00:42:47,514 --> 00:42:49,181
I do.

396
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:53,302
There are those
that say your children

397
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:56,188
were not fathered
by King Robert,

398
00:42:56,222 --> 00:42:59,808
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

399
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:01,727
A lie.

400
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:04,063
A lie from the lips
of Stannis Baratheon.

401
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:06,782
He wants the throne, but his
brother's children stand in his way.

402
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:10,069
So he claims they are
not his brother's.

403
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,121
That filth.

404
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:15,708
There is not one shred
of truth to it.

405
00:43:15,742 --> 00:43:17,876
I deny it.

406
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:21,380
Good.

407
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,918
But these are terrible charges.

408
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:28,587
And the realm must know
the truth of them.

409
00:43:28,638 --> 00:43:31,090
If Your Grace has given
honest testimony,

410
00:43:31,092 --> 00:43:33,308
your trial will prove
your innocence.

411
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:35,761
Trial?
I have confessed.

412
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:37,463
To a single sin.

413
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,431
Others you have denied.

414
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:43,268
Your trial will separate the
truths from the falsehoods.

415
00:43:45,438 --> 00:43:48,824
I bow to the wisdom
of Your High Holiness.

416
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,112
But if I might beg

417
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:55,748
for just one drop
of the Mother's mercy.

418
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:00,786
I haven't seen my son--

419
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:03,589
I don't know how long it's been.

420
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:05,457
I need to see him, please.

421
00:44:05,508 --> 00:44:09,328
You have taken the first step on
the path back to righteousness.

422
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:13,198
In light of this,

423
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,934
I will permit you
to return to the Red Keep.

424
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:20,139
Thank you.

425
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,141
Thank you.

426
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,642
The Mother is merciful.

427
00:44:23,644 --> 00:44:25,944
It is her you should thank.

428
00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:27,980
I will. I will.

429
00:44:27,982 --> 00:44:30,282
I swear it, day and night.

430
00:44:32,368 --> 00:44:34,319
Good.

431
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,825
Am I free to go?

432
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:42,211
After your atonement.

433
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:46,715
My atonement?

434
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:04,603
A sinner comes before you.

435
00:47:04,637 --> 00:47:07,856
Cersei of House Lannister.

436
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:11,009
Mother to His Grace King Tommen.

437
00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:14,329
Widow of His Grace King Robert.

438
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:18,483
She has committed
the acts of falsehood

439
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:20,786
and fornication.

440
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,455
<i>She has confessed her sins</i>

441
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:25,390
<i>and begged for forgiveness.</i>

442
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,076
<i>To demonstrate her repentance,</i>

443
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:32,331
<i>she will cast aside
all pride, all artifice,</i>

444
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:35,717
<i>and present herself
as the gods made her</i>

445
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,170
to you,

446
00:47:38,221 --> 00:47:40,839
the good people of the city.

447
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:44,259
She comes before you
with a solemn heart,

448
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,062
shorn of secrets,

449
00:47:47,096 --> 00:47:51,016
<i>naked before the eyes
of gods and men...</i>

450
00:47:52,518 --> 00:47:55,737
to make her walk of atonement.

451
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:19,428
Shame.
Shame.

452
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,630
<i>Shame.</i>

453
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:24,516
Shame.

454
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:28,720
Shame. Shame.

455
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:32,391
Shame.

456
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,577
<i>Shame. Shame.</i>

457
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:39,231
Shame.

458
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:42,985
Shame. Shame.

459
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:49,574
<i>Shame. Shame.</i>

460
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:52,244
Shame.

461
00:48:52,295 --> 00:48:54,079
Shame.

462
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,915
Shame. Shame.

463
00:48:58,634 --> 00:49:02,287
Shame. Shame.

464
00:49:02,355 --> 00:49:03,505
Shame.

465
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:07,009
Shame.

466
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,226
- Cunt!
- Shame.

467
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:09,594
<i>- Sinner!
- Whore!</i>

468
00:49:09,596 --> 00:49:10,762
<i>- Shame.
- Whore!</i>

469
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:12,481
Shame.

470
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:15,600
<i>- Whore! Whore!
-  Shame.</i>

471
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,655
<i>Shame.</i>

472
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,941
<i>Shame.</i>

473
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:24,826
Whore! Sinner!

474
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:27,279
- Shame.
- Bitch! Brother fucker!

475
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:29,948
- Whore!
- Shame.

476
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,001
- Fuck off!
- Shame.

477
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,453
Shame.

478
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,205
<i>- All hail the royal tits.
- You're a bitch!</i>

479
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:38,507
Shame.

480
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:39,958
- Get her!
- Whore!

481
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:41,460
- Bitch!
- Fucker!

482
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,045
- Fucker!
- You bitch!

483
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:44,629
<i>-  Shame.

484
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,431
<i>Shame.</i>

485
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:48,767
Shame. Shame.

486
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:51,720
- Brother fucker!
- Bitch!

487
00:49:51,804 --> 00:49:54,806
I've had half as many
cocks as the queen.

488
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:57,225
- Bitch!
- Shame.

489
00:49:57,276 --> 00:49:59,361
- Shame.
- Sinner! Whore! Slut!

490
00:50:01,147 --> 00:50:02,981
Shame.

491
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:07,486
Shame. Shame.

492
00:50:07,488 --> 00:50:10,906
- Whore!
- Whore, whore.

493
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,991
I'm a Lannister.
Suck me off!

494
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:14,910
- Suck me off, you bitch!
- Back!

495
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:16,161
- Whore!
- Shame.

496
00:50:16,245 --> 00:50:18,713
Shame.

497
00:50:18,748 --> 00:50:22,084
Whore!

498
00:50:22,135 --> 00:50:25,387
Whore! Whore! Whore!

499
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:30,475
<i>Shame. Shame.</i>

500
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:33,345
Shame.

501
00:50:33,347 --> 00:50:36,064
<i>Shame.</i>

502
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,850
Shame.

503
00:50:38,852 --> 00:50:40,936
Shame.

504
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:43,989
<i>- Bitch! Bitch!
- Shame.</i>

505
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:53,915
Brother fucker!

506
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,869
Shame. Shame.

507
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,871
Shame.

508
00:50:59,922 --> 00:51:02,674
- Whore!

509
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:05,043
- Whore!

510
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:07,846
Shame.
Shame.

511
00:51:09,765 --> 00:51:12,884
Shame.

512
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:15,103
Shame.

513
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,521
Shame.

514
00:51:17,523 --> 00:51:18,857
Shame.

515
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:26,064
<i>Shame.</i>

516
00:51:26,816 --> 00:51:29,284
<i>-  Shame.
- Fucker!</i>

517
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:35,490
Shame. Shame.

518
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,577
Shame.

519
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:41,997
Shame.
Shame.

520
00:51:42,048 --> 00:51:45,917
<i>Shame. Shame.</i>

521
00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:48,503
Shame.

522
00:51:48,554 --> 00:51:51,506
<i>Shame. Shame.</i>

523
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:56,595
Shame. Shame.

524
00:51:56,629 --> 00:51:59,264
Shame.

525
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:02,267
Shame.
Shame.

526
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:04,436
Shame.

527
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:13,662
Shame. Shame.

528
00:52:13,696 --> 00:52:16,531
Shame. Shame.

529
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:20,118
Shame.

530
00:52:58,324 --> 00:53:00,325
Your Grace.

531
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,333
It's good to have you back.

532
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:12,504
Come.

533
00:53:12,555 --> 00:53:14,256
We'll take you inside.

534
00:53:14,307 --> 00:53:16,007
I need to have a look
at those feet.

535
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:26,084
May I have the honor of presenting
the newest member of the Kingsguard?

536
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:45,453
If it please Your Grace, he has
taken a holy vow of silence.

537
00:53:45,504 --> 00:53:47,922
He has sworn
that he will not speak

538
00:53:47,957 --> 00:53:50,709
until all His Grace's
enemies are dead

539
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:53,678
and evil has been
driven from the realm.

540
00:54:00,386 --> 00:54:02,854
Who came to your aid?
Stannis.

541
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:04,055
Now he needs you.

542
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:05,724
We don't have enough men
to make any difference.

543
00:54:05,726 --> 00:54:07,475
The wildlings will make
a difference.

544
00:54:07,526 --> 00:54:08,893
The wildlings will never
fight for Stannis.

545
00:54:08,944 --> 00:54:12,364
- I told him before.
- You saved their bloody lives.

546
00:54:12,398 --> 00:54:14,282
If they're gonna live
in the Seven Kingdoms,

547
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:18,119
<i>safe behind our Wall, they ought
to fight for the damn place.</i>

548
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,122
<i>- It's not their fight.
- Open the gates!</i>

549
00:54:40,426 --> 00:54:41,843
Stannis?

550
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:50,902
Shireen?
The princess?

551
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:46,658
Lord Commander.

552
00:55:46,742 --> 00:55:48,877
<i>It's one of the wildlings
you brought back.</i>

553
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:50,545
<i>Says he knows your Uncle Benjen.</i>

554
00:55:50,629 --> 00:55:52,247
Says he's still alive.

555
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:55,917
Are you sure he's
talking about Benjen?

556
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:57,869
Said he was First Ranger.

557
00:56:00,005 --> 00:56:01,973
Said he knows where to find him.

558
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:10,815
Man says he saw
your uncle at Hardhome

559
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,434
at the last full moon.

560
00:56:12,485 --> 00:56:14,519
- Could be lying.
- Could be.

561
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:15,854
There are ways to find out.

562
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,906
- Where is he?
- Over there.

563
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,591
For the Watch.

564
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:42,764
For the Watch.

565
00:56:45,518 --> 00:56:46,885
For the Watch.

566
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:50,522
For the Watch.

567
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:54,309
For the Watch.

568
00:57:38,103 --> 00:57:39,521
Olly...

569
00:57:47,446 --> 00:57:49,447
For the Watch.
