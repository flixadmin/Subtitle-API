is fight and fuck, fuck and fight.

we'll get to stick around for the rest.

I know. Why are you here?

34
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:34,905
Why not send 40 of me? Or an army?

35
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:36,948
Unlike most folks, you've actually got one.

36
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,393
Because I don't want to start a war.

37
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:43,425
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

38
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,704
It has to be me.

39
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:53,869
If I'm putting something

one of the most recognizable faces
in Westeros is not...

42

It has to be me.

You set your brother free, didn't you?

44
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:11,707
I'll bet your sister didn't like that.

if you ever see the wee fucker,
give him my regards.

48
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,465
He murdered my father.

49
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:38,147
If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.

50
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:41,352
And then I'll give him your regards.

51

The Iron Bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

52
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,394
Given the expense
of rebuilding the royal fleet...

53
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:56,908
How much can the crown afford?

54
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:58,348
With winter coming,

55

56

You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

57
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:09,385
Well, House Tyrell could front the gold,
and the crown would pay us back in time,

58
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:12,512
or I'd have words with my daughter.

59
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:19,784
You've already given us too much.

60
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:24,066
No, we must arrange better terms
with the Iron Bank.

61
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,554
- Absolutely.
- In person.

62
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:29,184
Me?

63
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,186
We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

64
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:34,864
someone of importance
to show these bankers our respect.

65
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:37,913
As the king's Master of Coin,
I can think of no one more qualified.

No.

77
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:39,110
The old High Septon
would have asked the vintage.

78
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:42,346
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven,

79
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:44,744
and should be kept pure.

80
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:47,952
But the truth is, I don't like the taste.

81
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:49,464
Hmm.

00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,464
How may I serve?

83
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:57,384
All over Westeros
we hear of septs being burned,

84
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:59,306
Silent Sisters raped,

85
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:02,626
the bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

86
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:06,785
Wars teach people to obey the sword,
not the gods.

87
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:09,150
Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.

88
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:11,833
In the days before the Targaryens,

89
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:15,265
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

90
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:19,905
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

91
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:23,385
If I explain their holy purpose
to my son, the king,

92
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:27,673
I have no doubt he will sign a decree
arming the believers you felt worthy.

93
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:32,228
An army that defends
the bodies and souls of the common people?

94
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,749
An army in service to the gods themselves.

95
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:36,868
And to you, of course,

96
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:39,545
as the chosen representative of the Seven.

97
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:42,314
An honor I never expected.

98
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:44,192
Or ever wished for.

99
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:45,788
Which is why you were chosen.

100
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,667
You and I both know how the world works.

101
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:54,429
Too often, the wicked are the wealthiest,
beyond the reach of justice.

102
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:58,269
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

103
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:01,233
All sinners are equal before the gods.

104

What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

165
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:16,225
And your wife has every right to criticize.

166
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:20,829
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother,

167
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:22,746
no matter his perversions.

168
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:25,024
Then,

169
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:29,550
can I tell Margaery
you'll have Ser Loras released?

170
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:32,103
I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras.

171
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:34,234
You're the king.

172
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:38,274
I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow,
he'll release the poor boy.

173
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:44,674
Halt!

174
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:11,033
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

175
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:15,383
Give the order, and we'll
clear out this rabble.

176
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,746
You mean kill them?

177
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:22,267
Here, at the sept?

178
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,306
You'd be sending them
to meet the gods that they love.

179
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,393
MAN 1: Bastard!

180
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:32,544
MAN 2: You're an abomination!

181
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:39,787
MAN 3: Born of sin!

182
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,108
WOMAN: Filthy bastard!

183
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:48,788
We'll find another way.

184
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:52,868
MAN 4: Abomination!

185
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:00,234
My queen?

186
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,070
There was no way
to free Ser Loras without violence.

187
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:14,189
You're the King of the Andals,

188
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:17,904
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
the Protector of the Realm,

189
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:21,112
and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother-by-law.

190
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,314
I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.

191
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,147
Are you? When?

192
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:29,434
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

193
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:32,790
He was praying just now.

194
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:37,628
I have to send word to Grandmother.

195
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:40,473
Will you come back later?

196
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,265
I need to be with my family, Your Grace.

197
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:48,348
Of course.

198
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:51,070
(GRUNTING)

199
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:53,107
SELYSEI You think highly of this boy?

200
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:54,624
Good.

201
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,114
STANNIS: Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

202
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,393
And a bastard by some tavern slut.

203
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:02,273
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

204
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:08,107
I should have given you a son.

205
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:11,588
Not your fault.

206
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:13,108
Whose, then?

207
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:16,184
I gave you nothing but weakness

208
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:20,384
and deformity.

209
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:24,548
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

210
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,113
My lady.

211
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:29,309
Her father is the Lord's chosen king,

212
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:31,909
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

213
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:43,385
You march on Winterfell soon?

214
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:46,751
We must to beat the snows.

215
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:52,511
Once before, you put your faith
in Ser Davos and left me behind.

216
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,071
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

217
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:58,349
I won't.

218
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:02,983
I need you.

219
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,464
You only need faith, my king.

220
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:11,833
And you. What do you need?

221
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:15,593
To serve my Lord.

222
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,074
(GRUNTING)

223
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:21,948
Lord Ashford.

224
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,832
Lady Caulfield.

225
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,148
Lord Smallwood.

226
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:36,274
I've never even heard of these people.

227
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:38,226
They haven't heard of you, either.

228
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:41,270
But we need men, and they have some.

229
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:46,633
How many men does this Lord Mayzen
have to send us?

230
00:17:46,823 --> 00:17:49,110
More than Lord Wibberley.

231
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:04,744
- Not him.
- I know. I'm sorry.

232
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:06,473
But we need men and supplies,

233
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:08,673
and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North.

234
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:09,869
He murdered my brother.

235
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:12,753
We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.

236
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:15,232
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

237
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:20,829
And we can't get more men
without help from the Warden of the North.

238
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:45,947
Apologies, my lady-

239
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:55,944
(DOOR CLOSES)

240
00:18:58,143 --> 00:18:59,633
Lord Commander.

241
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:02,426
How can I help you?

242
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:04,585
Come with us when we ride south.

243
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:07,633
None of us know the
castle as well as you do.

244
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:11,310
Its hidden tunnels, its
weaknesses, its people.

245
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:15,064
Winterfell was your home once.

246
00:19:16,543 --> 00:19:19,023
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

247
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,269
Castle Black is my home now.

248
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,792
The Night's Watch take no part
in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

249
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:29,308
There's only one war.

250
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:31,907
Life against death.

251
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:37,226
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

252
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:39,305
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

253
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:43,671
Forgive me. I don't trust in visions.

254
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:47,344
No visions. No magic.

255
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:49,989
Just life.

256
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:12,670
Do you feel my heart beating?

257
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:17,232
There's power in you.

258
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:21,150
You resist it, and that's your mistake.
Embrace it.

259
00:20:32,223 --> 00:20:35,113
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

260
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:38,304
Two parts of a greater whole.

261
00:20:39,383 --> 00:20:41,954
In ourjoining, there's power.

262
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:45,863
Power to make life,

263
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:48,469
power to make light,

264
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:50,545
and power to cast shadows.

265
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,273
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

266
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:56,748
Then we shouldn't tell him.

267
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:00,984
- I can't.
- Why?

268
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:02,904
I swore a vow.

269
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:07,633
I loved another.

270
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,390
The dead don't need lovers.

271
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,584
Only the living.

272
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:18,503
I know.

273
00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:21,634
But I still love her.

274
00:21:36,943 --> 00:21:38,832
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

275
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:53,944
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

276
00:22:16,663 --> 00:22:17,710
Are you lonely?

277
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:20,744
Just bored.

278
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:24,225
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

279
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:25,989
Were you bored a lot, too?

280
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:30,113
I know Castle Black
is no place for a child, but...

281
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,834
I like it. I thought I'd be left at home.

282
00:22:33,823 --> 00:22:35,666
I know Mother didn't want to bring me.

283
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:37,943
Why do you say that?

284
00:22:40,143 --> 00:22:41,952
She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

285
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,508
She shouldn't have said that.

286
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,512
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

287
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:10,389
When you were an infant,

288
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,394
a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.

289
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:18,546
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

290
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,345
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

291
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:31,072
No doubt he'd heard of your birth
and assumed new fathers were easy targets.

292
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:37,546
I still remember how you smiled
when I put that doll in your cradle.

293
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:41,026
How you pressed it to your cheek.

294
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:50,870
By the time we burned the
doll, it was too late.

295
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:55,872
I was told you would die.

296
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,034
Or worse,

297
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,032
the greyscale would go slow.

298
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:06,266
Let you grow just enough to know the world
before taking it away from you.

299
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:08,914
Everyone advised me to send you
to the ruins of Valyria

300
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:11,185
to live out your short
life with the stone men,

301
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:14,107
before the sickness
spread through the castle.

302
00:24:15,943 --> 00:24:17,672
I told them all to go to hell.

303
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:22,673
I called in every maester
on this side of the world.

304
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:25,792
Every healer. Every apothecary.

305
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,990
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

306
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,587
Because you do not belong across the world
with the bloody stone men.

307
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:38,624
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

308
00:24:41,503 --> 00:24:43,267
And you are my daughter.

(WATER DRIPPING)

310
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:46,024
LITTLEFINGER:
I thought I might find you here.

311
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,513
Your Aunt Lyanna.

312
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:54,466
Father never talked about her,

313
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:58,827
but sometimes I'd find him down here
lighting the candles.

314
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:02,068
They say she was beautiful.

315
00:26:02,903 --> 00:26:04,428
I saw her once.

316
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:07,666
I was a boy living with
your mother's family.

317
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:10,713
Lord Whent held a great
tourney at Harrenhal.

318
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:13,547
Everyone was there.

319
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,752
The Mad King, your father,

320
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:18,427
Robert Baratheon,

321
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:20,549
and Lyanna.

322
00:26:20,623 --> 00:26:22,864
She was already promised to Robert.

323
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:28,754
You can imagine what it was like for me, a
boy from nowhere with nothing to his name,

324
00:26:28,823 --> 00:26:32,430
watching these legendary men
tilting at the lists.

325
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:38,305
The last two riders were Barristan Selmy
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

326
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:42,064
When Rhaegar won,
everyone cheered for their prince.

327
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,066
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet,

328
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:46,350
and they saw that silver hair.

329
00:26:46,423 --> 00:26:47,584
How handsome he was.

330
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:51,508
Until he rode right past his wife,

331
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:55,344
Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

332
00:26:56,663 --> 00:26:58,950
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

333
00:27:00,383 --> 00:27:02,147
He rode past his wife,

334
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:07,504
and he lay a crown of winter roses
in Lyanna's lap.

335
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,108
Blue as frost.

336
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:17,114
How many tens of thousands had to die
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

337
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:21,785
Yes, he chose her.

338
00:27:22,623 --> 00:27:25,024
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

339
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,714
Come.

340
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:37,874
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

341
00:27:43,143 --> 00:27:44,349
You're dressed for riding.

342
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:45,424
I am.

343
00:27:47,343 --> 00:27:48,947
Where are you going?

344
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:51,071
King's Landing.

345
00:27:51,143 --> 00:27:52,713
King's Landing?

346
00:27:52,783 --> 00:27:54,865
Cersei sent for me.

347
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:57,310
We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.

348
00:27:57,703 --> 00:27:59,193
You can't leave me here.

349
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:01,505
I know how hard it is
to live with people you despise.

350
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,630
Believe me.

351
00:28:03,503 --> 00:28:04,629
But it won't be for long.

352
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:06,550
How do you know?

353
00:28:08,383 --> 00:28:11,592
Stannis Baratheon garrisons
at Castle Black.

354
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,789
He'll march south to King's Landing
before the winter snows block his way.

355
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:19,265
But first, he has to take Winterfell.

356
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,664
- You don't know that.
- I do.

357
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,745
Once he liberates these lands
from the Boltons,

358
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:27,343
he'll rally your father's bannermen
to his cause.

359
00:28:27,423 --> 00:28:31,951
With the North behind him,
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

360
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,946
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

361
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,393
He has a larger army.

362
00:28:36,463 --> 00:28:39,114
He's the finest military commander
in Westeros.

363
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:42,949
A betting man would
put his money on Stannis.

364
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:45,469
I am a betting man.

365
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:48,432
And if you're right?

366
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:50,505
Stannis takes Winterfell,

367
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:53,712
he rescues you from
the most despised family in the North.

368
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:56,753
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

369
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:59,269
he names you Wardeness of the North.

370
00:29:00,223 --> 00:29:01,668
But I...

371
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:03,427
I wouldn't...

372
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:04,914
Wardeness of the North?

373
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:07,190
You are the last surviving Stark.

374
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,664
He needs you.

375
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:12,593
And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?

376
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:15,354
Or he does, and the Boltons defeat him?

377
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:18,950
Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay,
and make him yours.

378
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:21,154
I don't know how to do that.

379
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,987
Of course you do.

380
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,827
He's already fallen for you.

381
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:26,993
His father frightens me.

382
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:28,633
He should. He's a dangerous man.

383
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,746
But even the most dangerous men
can be outmaneuvered.

384
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:36,710
And you've learned to maneuver
from the very best.

385
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:41,664
I'll return before too long.

386
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:43,552
You be strong without me.

387
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,425
The North will be yours.

388
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:57,148
Do you believe me?

389
00:29:59,943 --> 00:30:03,311
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

That would have been a shit way to die.

396

As far as I've seen, they're
all shit ways to die.

397
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:20,946
Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers a good ending.

398
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:23,867
I don't care
what's sung about me when I'm dead.

399
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:25,183
No?

400
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:30,266
Two knights off to rescue a princess.
Sounds like a good song to me.

401
00:31:30,383 --> 00:31:31,748
Sounds like all the rest.

402
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:37,546
What about you?

403
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:39,864
What shit way would you choose?

404
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:46,268
In my own keep, drinking my own wine,
watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

405
00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:49,984
How disappointing.

406
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:53,033
I thought you'd have
something more exciting planned.

407
00:31:53,543 --> 00:31:57,389
I've had an exciting life.
I want my death to be boring.

408
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:00,987
How do you want to go?

409
00:32:01,063 --> 00:32:03,464
In the arms of the woman I love.

410
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,224
She want the same thing?

411
00:32:14,463 --> 00:32:15,908
Let's go.

412
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:29,465
The captain of that ship,
what was he, Braavosi?

413
00:32:29,543 --> 00:32:31,272
JAIME: Pentoshi.

414
00:32:31,343 --> 00:32:32,913
BRONN: And he's headed to Oldtown?

415
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:34,951
JAIME: As I said. Why?

416
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:37,671
What's to stop him
from docking down the coast,

417
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:40,389
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

418
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:41,953
A bag of gold.

I'm not sure you understand

420
00:32:44,343 --> 00:32:46,914
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

421
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:48,826
It was a heavy bag.

422
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:51,713
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

423
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,911
But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.

Over the hill.

Cooper. This is Darnell.

00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:42,913
You're from King's Landing.

Why are you here?

440

Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.

441

It was a near thing, really.

00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:58,625
Thought the sharks would get us.

443

There are no sharks in Dorne.

444
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:05,504
Could have sworn those were shark fins.

445

When I was a child,
Oberyn came to take me to court.

490
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:26,514
I had never seen this man,
and yet he called himself my father.

491
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:31,188
My mother wept, said I was too young
and a girl.

492
00:38:33,903 --> 00:38:36,827
Oberyn tossed his spear
at my feet and said,

493
00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:39,747
"Girl or boy, we fight our battles,

494
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:42,952
"but the gods let us choose our weapons."

495
00:38:43,303 --> 00:38:47,627
My father pointed to the spear,
and then to my mother's tears.

496
00:38:50,623 --> 00:38:51,624
(GRUNTS)

497
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,670
I made my choice long ago.

TYRION: (MUFFLED) Will you untie me?

499
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:06,147

00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:08,149

00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:32,829
Thank you.

503
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:42,104
Who are you?

504
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:44,184
Your captor.

505
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:48,474
Do you have wine?

506
00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:49,783
No.

507
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,268
Can't sleep without wine.

508
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:53,874
Then stay awake.

509
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:02,033
You're going the wrong way.

510
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:08,383
My sister is in Westeros. Westeros is west.

511
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:10,187
We're heading east.

512
00:40:10,263 --> 00:40:12,470
I'm not taking you to your sister.

513
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:16,304
You said you were taking me to the queen.

514
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:21,150
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
She's the queen I serve.

515
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:23,588
(LAUGHING)

516
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:30,748
What a waste of a good kidnapping.

517
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:33,232
It so happens I was heading there myself.

518
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:36,065
What business would you have
with the queen?

519
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:38,623
Gold and glory. Oh, and hate.

520
00:40:39,823 --> 00:40:42,429
If you'd ever met my
sister, you'd understand.

521
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:46,791
So now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

522
00:40:57,103 --> 00:41:02,587
A highborn knight from the north of
Westeros down on his luck in Essos.

523
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:05,946
Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate.

524
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:09,707
You're Jorah Mormont.

525
00:41:11,103 --> 00:41:12,912
I have to ask.

526
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:17,511
How exactly were you serving your queen
in a whorehouse half a world away?

527
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,544
Is it possible that you were running?

528
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:25,344
Why would you be running?
And why would she have sent you away?

529
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,430
Oh, wait.

530
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:31,144
You were spying on her, weren't you?

531
00:41:32,263 --> 00:41:33,913
It's all coming back to me.

532
00:41:33,983 --> 00:41:35,951
I was drunk through
most of the Small Council meetings,

533
00:41:36,023 --> 00:41:37,752
but it's all coming back.

534
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:40,992
You passed notes to Varys' little birds.

535
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:45,183
She found out, didn't she?

536
00:41:45,263 --> 00:41:47,504
Found out and exiled you.

537
00:41:48,663 --> 00:41:51,906
Now you hope to
win back her favor with a gift.

538
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:54,834
Risky scheme.

539
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:58,223
One might even say desperate.

540
00:41:59,863 --> 00:42:03,072
You think Daenerys will execute me
and pardon you?

541
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:06,983
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

- What?

545
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:36,951
I was thinking about all
the times your brother

546
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:40,470
made me go with him down from the Red Keep
into the streets of King's Landing.

547
00:42:40,543 --> 00:42:43,387
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

548
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:45,033
He liked to sing to them.

549
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:46,990
He sang to them?

550
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:48,747
- Yes.
- (LAUGHS)

551
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:54,753
Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook,
or the Street of Seeds, and then he'd sing.

552
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,154
Just like all the other minstrels.

553
00:42:56,223 --> 00:42:57,384
And what did you do?

554
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:59,228
I made sure no one killed him.

555
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:02,548
And I collected the money.

556
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:04,625
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

557
00:43:04,743 --> 00:43:06,711
- He was good?
- He was very good.

558
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:08,023
Viserys never told you?

559
00:43:08,103 --> 00:43:10,629
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

560
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,508
Rhaegar never liked killing.
He loved singing.

561
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:16,554
And what did you do with the money?

562
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:19,911
Well, one time, he gave it
to the next minstrel down the street.

563
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:22,463
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

564
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:26,270
One time, we got horribly drunk.

from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

all can die in glory.

- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

577
00:44:04,463 --> 00:44:07,945
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

578
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,549
So their names would live on.

Those who find victory in the fighting pits
will never become kings,

but their names will live on.

It's the best chance they'll ever have.

Is that what you used to tell men

583
00:44:19,143 --> 00:44:22,033
before you set them
to butchering each other for sport?

584

Today is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

I do not recognize this tradition.
