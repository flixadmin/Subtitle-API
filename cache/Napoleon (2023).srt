1
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,308
Get back, you lot.

2
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:02,994
Get to the guillotine.

3
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:10,437
The scourge of France!

4
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:42,510
Terror is nothing more than justice.

5
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,681
Prompt, severe, inflexible.

6
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:51,520
It is therefore an emanation of virtue.

7
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:56,692
Now, she was guilty of three charges
against you:

8
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:00,153
depletion of the national treasury,

9
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:05,909
conspiracy against the internal
and external security of state,

10
00:05:06,993 --> 00:05:12,374
and high treason for acting
in the interests of the enemy.

11
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:17,838
Mercy for the villains?

12
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:21,383
No.

13
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:25,012
Mercy for the innocent.

14
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:27,806
Mercy for the unfortunate.

15
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:30,600
Mercy for humanity.

16
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:38,692
An inescapable outcome
of democracy's connection

17
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:42,988
in relation to the nation's
immediate demands at this moment...

18
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:45,574
The British navy have taken
the port of Toulon.

19
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:48,410
Half the French fleet is trapped there.

20
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,788
If we lose those ships,
the Republic will fall.

21
00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:56,293
Lucky for us, there are only
2,000 English troops in Toulon.

22
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:03,592
But we are short of artillery and led by
a general who was a court painter.

23
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,179
It is not necessary
to recapture Toulon itself.

24
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,391
The town is not a town.
The town is a port.

25
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:14,978
If the harbor's untenable
to the English fleet,

26
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,271
the town must surrender.

27
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,567
My brother, Captain Bonaparte,
as artillery officer,

28
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:24,780
has organized heated shots
against English ships.

29
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:28,241
He has proven his commitment
to the Republic.

30
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:31,620
And how do you propose to take the harbor?

31
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,915
Capture the fort
that dominates the harbor,

32
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:36,958
and you have the city.

33
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:46,093
We must make an example,
or other cities will fall.

34
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:49,429
And I, for one,

35
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:53,600
will never let the royalists
or the English take my region.

36
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:07,614
Morning, sir.

37
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:10,158
General Carteaux?

38
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:12,577
He's over there.

39
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:22,671
Lucien, my dear brother,
I am in Toulon already.

40
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:29,761
The troops are in a poor state, and your
conscripts untrained and undisciplined.

41
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:34,182
Without equipment and resources,
I see only failure.

42
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:53,410
We are collecting scrap iron to recast
small mortars more suitable for my plan.

43
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:55,746
If we do not succeed,

44
00:07:56,455 --> 00:08:01,251
those in power will only see us as
Corsican ruffians unfit for higher office,

45
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,837
and our mother's ambitions
will be quashed.

46
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:19,519
That's it, madam. Fine eye you have.

47
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,773
- There you go.
- I'll still be here next week.

48
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:30,405
The British control the big guns
that point out at their fleet offshore.

49
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:35,744
Take those guns, and we can fire
onto them and end this blockade.

50
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:53,095
Surprise is my advantage,
but I will win by fire.

51
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:55,764
I cannot wait for your arrival.

52
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,183
Your brother, Napoleon.

53
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:02,728
Oi, shit rag! Yes, you!

54
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:10,195
Move along now. Go on. Move!

55
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:15,033
Move them fucking goats!

56
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:19,621
Last chance! Fucking move them goats!

57
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:24,918
You better fucking move them now!

58
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:27,379
Do you understand?

59
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:46,857
He sat himself down by the fire, my boys

60
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:49,901
To join in our jovial crew

61
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:53,071
- Get in position.
- Quick!

62
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:57,325
By the chimney corner was his own place

63
00:09:57,325 --> 00:10:00,912
Where he could sit and dye his old face

64
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:03,206
When Jones's ale was new, my boys

65
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:04,708
Quick, quick!

66
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,420
When Jones's ale was new

67
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:14,926
Pints of beer and bottles of sherry
To help them over the hill so merry

68
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:19,222
When Jones's ale was new

69
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:11,733
Fire!

70
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:16,530
We're under attack!

71
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:22,953
We're under attack! Grab your weapons!

72
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:27,374
Get those ladders up quick, men!

73
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,889
Fire! Hit your target!

74
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,144
Get the mortars up there!

75
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:58,363
Ready, boy?

76
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,201
Oh, God!

77
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:13,920
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

78
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,886
Get the mortars!

79
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:14,356
Protect the cannons!

80
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:18,819
Into position!

81
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:27,285
- Vive la France!
- Vive la France!

82
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:48,515
Ready the cannons!

83
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,100
Sir! Yes, sir.

84
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:52,060
Mortars!

85
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:55,689
Elevation 160.

86
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,194
- Fire!
- Firing!

87
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:06,575
Junot, heated shots!

88
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,493
Fire!

89
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:24,051
Junot, fire!

90
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:25,552
Fire!

91
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,778
- Reload!
- Reload.

92
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:50,786
Fire!

93
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:09,012
Shoulder, hold!

94
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:14,810
Captain Napoleon Bonaparte,
I award you the rank of brigadier general.

95
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:20,023
Long live the Republic!

96
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:26,154
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!

97
00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:34,830
I promised you brilliant successes,
and I've kept my word.

98
00:15:42,838 --> 00:15:45,173
Order, hold!

99
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:15,328
For Mother.

100
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:24,379
The current leadership of France has
passed from enthusiasm

101
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,797
to reckless ambition.

102
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:31,428
And the public perception
of the guillotine is lawless passion,

103
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:33,805
led by Robespierre.

104
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:36,391
He is unfit to rule.

105
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,941
Bonaparte.

106
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:48,320
France!

107
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,532
It has become increasingly clear,
Citizen Robespierre,

108
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:57,287
that your motivations are to use
this blade to your ultimate power!

109
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,248
Let me speak!

110
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,712
There is no man in this room
who has objected to my methods.

111
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:10,217
If you say I am guilty,
you are all guilty!

112
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:14,179
You are not a defender of freedom.

113
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:20,769
You have deemed yourself judge,
jury and executioner, have you not?

114
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:23,939
You're worse than Caesar!
Worse than Caesar!

115
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,234
You are, all of you, the traitors!

116
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:28,819
Arrest him!

117
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:46,378
Get him.

118
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:13,196
You missed.

119
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:17,868
The guillotine, my friend.

120
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:50,562
A seven, madame.

121
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:55,359
Deal again.

122
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:07,245
Deal again.

123
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:15,796
Your bet.

124
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:27,766
Seven again.

125
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:32,270
No. No win.

126
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:37,317
I'll be out first. That's mine.

127
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:48,704
Why are you staring at me?

128
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:51,039
Am I?

129
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,500
- No, I was not.
- Yes.

130
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:55,502
You weren't?

131
00:21:56,586 --> 00:21:57,587
I was.

132
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:01,633
I was staring at your face.

133
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:05,012
What is this costume you have on?

134
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:07,097
This is my uniform.

135
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,934
I led the French victory at Toulon.

136
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:19,484
Do not tell me your name.

137
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:39,296
General?

138
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:43,175
There is a very young man who wishes
to see you.

139
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:45,969
His name is Eugene Beauharnais.

140
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,188
Citizen.

141
00:23:04,738 --> 00:23:06,073
General Bonaparte.

142
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:07,657
Yes?

143
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:11,912
My name is Eugene Beauharnais,
son of Josaphine Beauharnais.

144
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:13,663
What do you want?

145
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,208
My father's saber.

146
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:21,254
It was taken from him before
he was arrested and executed.

147
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:23,507
Yes?

148
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:27,844
It would mean a great deal to me and
to my mother if it were returned to us.

149
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:29,805
It's all we have of him.

150
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,348
The sword is a weapon.

151
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,977
I cannot allow citizens
to have weapons in their possession.

152
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:40,148
The sword is a keepsake
for me to remember my dear late father.

153
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:42,734
Perhaps, but it is a weapon nevertheless.

154
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,115
Young man, why are you here?

155
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,869
My mother said that you were the only man
of authority to retrieve the sword.

156
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,010
All of these are
from officers who were sentenced to die.

157
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:13,015
Did no one think
to attach names to any of them?

158
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:18,061
No, there are no names.

159
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:43,837
General Bonaparte?

160
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:55,349
Thank you.

161
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:04,107
Is there reason to introduce myself?

162
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:07,069
No, General.

163
00:25:07,903 --> 00:25:08,987
Good.

164
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:13,533
My compliments to
the chef of this fine family.

165
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:36,264
Would you like to sit closer?

166
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,991
Do I look like I'm in love?

167
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:59,162
Do you find him without appeal?

168
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,544
No.

169
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,295
Then perhaps that is enough.

170
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:14,761
Do not underestimate your grace.

171
00:27:05,645 --> 00:27:07,814
When you look at me,
do you see an aristocrat?

172
00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:13,028
No.

173
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:18,909
My husband had more than one lover.

174
00:27:21,203 --> 00:27:24,081
And when his head was cut off,
all his mistresses watched.

175
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:34,549
When I was in prison, I was told the
only way to survive was to get pregnant.

176
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:38,637
So, General...

177
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:47,688
do I need warn you of my indiscretions?

178
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:50,649
No, madame.

179
00:27:52,234 --> 00:27:54,319
Does where I have been concern you?

180
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,617
No, madame.

181
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:20,262
If you look down, you'll see a surprise.

182
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:24,057
And once you see it,
you will always want it.

183
00:28:40,657 --> 00:28:43,869
People of France, don't be fooled.
There are more of us!

184
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:46,538
We can occupy this Convention!

185
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:52,419
Long live the king! Long live the king!

186
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:06,475
No doubt you've seen
the chaos in the streets.

187
00:29:06,475 --> 00:29:07,559
Yes.

188
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:10,187
There is a belief amongst the Committee

189
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:13,148
that there is an attack
on the Council coming by this mob.

190
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:18,820
I have less than 4,000 troops
and very little in the way of weapons.

191
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:23,825
There are 40 cannons in Sablons.
I could have them here in three hours.

192
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:25,827
This mob is 20,000 strong.

193
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,871
Yes.

194
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:36,004
As my second-in-command,
what would you intend to do

195
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:38,799
if this assignment of defense
was transferred to you?

196
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:48,767
I accept, on the condition
that I command this as I see fit.

197
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,435
Without interruption.

198
00:29:51,978 --> 00:29:53,897
I will not lead as second-in-command.

199
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:03,865
Come on!

200
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,055
Fire!

201
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:51,538
According to
the law of 20th September, 1792,

202
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,333
Marie josephine rose Tascher,

203
00:30:55,333 --> 00:31:00,464
born 23rd June, 1767, in Martinique,

204
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:05,302
accepts as her husband Napoleon Bonaparte,

205
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:11,683
born February, 1768, in Ajaccio, Corsica.

206
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:14,770
Do you consent?

207
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,854
- Yes.
- I do.

208
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:17,773
Do you consent?

209
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:21,985
Yes. I do.

210
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:25,655
I declare you united in marriage.

211
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,929
To the savior of the Republic!

212
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:50,681
And to Madam Bonaparte.

213
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:52,265
To Madam Bonaparte.

214
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,494
This guy right next to me?

215
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:26,216
He wants my saber.

216
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:44,943
Let that good work make us a son.

217
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:02,085
Dear Josaphine,

218
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:07,257
I follow in the footsteps
of Alexander the Great and Caesar,

219
00:33:07,257 --> 00:33:09,676
as I have been sent to liberate Egypt.

220
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,971
I have 40,000 men,

221
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:17,059
and the sights are wondrous,
and the weather is stifling hot.

222
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:22,147
I have already conquered Italy,
who surrendered without conflict.

223
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,444
The Directory has approved
my plan for attacking England

224
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:29,029
through their eastern empire.

225
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:33,867
But my achievements seem slight,
as they keep us apart.

226
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,229
Dear wife,

227
00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:05,857
This love I have for you
is a kind of death.

228
00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:09,152
There is no survival for me except in you.

229
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:10,654
Hello again.

230
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:11,988
What are you doing?

231
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:13,657
No letters from you.

232
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:14,783
Good morning, Lucille.

233
00:34:14,783 --> 00:34:17,244
If you loved me,
you'd write me twice a day.

234
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,539
Tell me there are no snakes in your bed,

235
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:23,917
in your legs, inside what is mine.

236
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:26,670
You must write me and tell me

237
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,257
that you realize that I love you
beyond the limits of imagination,

238
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:33,260
that only you can please me.

239
00:36:54,276 --> 00:36:59,031
Are there limits to what I can tell you?

240
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:02,117
There shouldn't be.

241
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:07,164
Should I tell you something
at the risk of giving you personal pain?

242
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:10,250
Yes.

243
00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:21,970
Your wife has taken
a lover named Hippolyte Charles.

244
00:37:42,532 --> 00:37:44,785
- You expect me to believe this?
- Yes.

245
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:48,705
That my wife would do this to me?

246
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:51,375
Yes.

247
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,137
No dessert for you. You may leave.

248
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:09,101
I would never lie to you.

249
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:26,702
How do you know this?

250
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:36,545
Lucille is my lover. She writes to me.

251
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:40,132
Josaphine's lady-in-waiting is your lover?

252
00:38:51,518 --> 00:38:55,272
Prepare two frigates and two
smaller vessels in the greatest secrecy.

253
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:58,066
I'm returning home.

254
00:38:58,692 --> 00:38:59,693
Napoleon,

255
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:02,446
this will be seen as desertion.

256
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:08,744
General Klüber will be informed of
his succession in command after I've left.

257
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:20,172
Napoleon the victorious!

258
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:11,973
Where's my wife?

259
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:13,809
She has left to greet you in Lyon.

260
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,478
Do not lie to me. Where is my wife?

261
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,772
She left earlier today, General.

262
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:20,732
- Lyon?
- Yes, sir.

263
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:23,944
The entire world knows of my arrival,
but not my wife?

264
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:16,288
What kind of creature are you?

265
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:23,920
How could you care so little
for me and my feelings?

266
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:27,883
You are a selfish little pig.

267
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:32,346
Do you think so lowly of me?

268
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,557
No. I don't.

269
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:36,641
Then why?

270
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:42,439
Because you're what? Say it.

271
00:41:46,693 --> 00:41:47,694
I'm sorry.

272
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:49,863
That's not enough.

273
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:54,618
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say

274
00:41:54,618 --> 00:41:57,996
that I am the most important thing
in the world!

275
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:00,332
You are.

276
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:02,876
- Say it!
- You're--

277
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:07,631
You're the most important thing
in my life, in the world. You a--

278
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:11,051
- And without me, you are nothing.
- I'm nothing.

279
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:12,803
And you will do anything!

280
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,222
I'll do anything.

281
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:20,394
I'm not built like other men.

282
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:26,108
And I'm not subject to petty insecurity.

283
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,073
You're a beast.

284
00:42:37,828 --> 00:42:39,204
I feel sorry for you.

285
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:44,835
You want to be great?

286
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:55,095
You are nothing without me.

287
00:42:56,638 --> 00:42:57,639
Say it.

288
00:43:06,023 --> 00:43:07,107
Say it.

289
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,702
You are just a brute
that is nothing without me.

290
00:43:20,078 --> 00:43:24,041
I am just a brute
that is nothing without you.

291
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:25,000
Yes.

292
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,757
You are nothing without me or your mother.

293
00:43:35,427 --> 00:43:36,511
My mother...

294
00:43:51,443 --> 00:43:52,611
Did you have affairs?

295
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:56,323
Of course I did.

296
00:44:03,663 --> 00:44:05,123
And did you love them?

297
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,794
No. No, I did not.

298
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:16,218
Were they pretty?

299
00:44:18,428 --> 00:44:20,263
Yes, some of them.

300
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:24,768
They served their purpose.

301
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,021
More than I do?

302
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,818
They cried less.
That made them more attractive.

303
00:44:36,238 --> 00:44:37,239
Don't--

304
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:41,118
Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me.

305
00:44:44,913 --> 00:44:46,415
Just don't leave me.

306
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:51,253
You don't have to forgive me.
Just promise me you won't leave again.

307
00:44:57,009 --> 00:45:00,721
What is it that made you desert
your troops in Egypt?

308
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:05,225
Citizens...

309
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:08,770
what country are we in?

310
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:15,569
Because she doesn't resemble
the France that I left.

311
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:22,159
Who should be responsible
for her governance while I'm away?

312
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:25,912
Because it is not you, Citizen Gohier.

313
00:45:26,747 --> 00:45:27,748
It is not you.

314
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:31,543
It certainly is not you.
Although you're very good at scowling.

315
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:36,590
It is not you, Barras.

316
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:37,716
Or you, Talleyrand.

317
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:40,135
Or you, SieyÃ¨s.

318
00:45:41,678 --> 00:45:42,679
So, who?

319
00:45:44,181 --> 00:45:46,808
Who should be responsible?
Fouche, do you have any ideas?

320
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:49,186
No?

321
00:45:51,396 --> 00:45:54,191
I have returned to France
to find her bankrupt.

322
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:57,944
Printing money that is spent within hours,

323
00:45:59,863 --> 00:46:02,157
the Austro-Russian overrun of Italy,

324
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:05,494
the Anglo-Russian occupation of Holland,

325
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:12,125
and what appears to be
the imminent invasion of France herself.

326
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:18,590
And yet, you accuse me of desertion.

327
00:46:20,008 --> 00:46:23,387
Added to which the discovery
that my wife is a slut.

328
00:46:36,566 --> 00:46:41,738
The only thing that every French citizen
can agree on is that you are our Caesar.

329
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:46,326
What do you want?

330
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:51,415
Well...

331
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:57,337
the people would accept my rule
if I have your support.

332
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:04,344
Like you, though,
I believe that the Directory is corrupt.

333
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:10,892
But together, we can save this country
from a restoration of the monarchy,

334
00:47:11,852 --> 00:47:14,104
and we can preserve
the ideals of the Revolution.

335
00:47:16,815 --> 00:47:20,569
And I think that
a seizure of power is possible

336
00:47:21,803 --> 00:47:23,639
with your help, at the right time.

337
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:27,034
And I think this is the right time.

338
00:47:27,784 --> 00:47:30,454
So, you expect me to be your sword?

339
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:41,923
I expect that a coup d'etat,
well-timed, well-executed...

340
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:47,471
could transfer power
into the hands of three consuls:

341
00:47:48,388 --> 00:47:49,681
myself, Ducos...

342
00:47:52,267 --> 00:47:53,310
and you.

343
00:47:55,979 --> 00:47:57,814
I'm inviting you to the winning side.

344
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,654
It's a simple letter of resignation
we would like you to--

345
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:06,865
I am not signing anything.

346
00:48:06,865 --> 00:48:10,243
You can piss before I sign anything away!

347
00:48:10,243 --> 00:48:11,328
Gentlemen.

348
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:21,713
Who's doing this?

349
00:48:23,048 --> 00:48:24,216
Good morning, Paul.

350
00:48:27,386 --> 00:48:29,513
I'm going to make this very simple
for you.

351
00:48:30,514 --> 00:48:33,892
I have documents announcing
your resignation from the Council.

352
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:37,562
You must retire
before you have your breakfast, please.

353
00:48:38,814 --> 00:48:43,151
Tell them I return with joy
to the ranks of simple citizen.

354
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:46,113
I shall.

355
00:48:51,368 --> 00:48:53,370
There are some gentlemen here to see you.

356
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:58,125
Citizen Moulins, we have
a letter of resignation for you to sign.

357
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,753
- No. I am eating my breakfast.
- No.

358
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:04,506
I am enjoying a succulent breakfast.

359
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:08,927
This is outrageous! I shall finish
my breakfast before you touch me!

360
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:11,847
- No!
- Enjoy your breakfast.

361
00:49:33,452 --> 00:49:34,745
Director!

362
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,956
I believe the time has come
to demand an explanation.

363
00:49:37,956 --> 00:49:39,041
Hear, hear!

364
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:44,880
This emergency session
is to draw a list of nominations

365
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,468
for a new Directory
to deal with the threat--

366
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:52,137
the threat of the royalists.

367
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:54,348
We are being asked to pass a resolution

368
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:57,267
forming a provisional government
to three councils:

369
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:01,897
General Bonaparte and Citizen SieyÃ¨s
and Roger Ducos.

370
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:05,609
Where are the five members
of the Directory?

371
00:50:07,819 --> 00:50:09,738
Have they magically disappeared?

372
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:14,868
And we are here, surrounded by troops,
isolated far from Paris.

373
00:50:15,535 --> 00:50:16,536
Order!

374
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:19,456
This is becoming increasingly clear:

375
00:50:20,374 --> 00:50:23,251
that your brother, Napoleon Bonaparte,

376
00:50:24,461 --> 00:50:28,340
with his show of military might,
is acting as an outlaw.

377
00:50:30,258 --> 00:50:31,593
I vow to solve this matter.

378
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:35,430
And that this is
a ridiculous and poorly executed takeover.

379
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,474
A power-hungry upstart.

380
00:50:37,974 --> 00:50:40,185
Enough!

381
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:44,189
If there is any question
of what is happening here, I will answer!

382
00:50:44,189 --> 00:50:45,565
How dare you!

383
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:49,486
This is--
You have violated the constitution!

384
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:51,613
- You have--
- Hold him!

385
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:53,198
Get him!

386
00:51:00,956 --> 00:51:03,166
- Arrest him!
- Stop him!

387
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:06,169
Oh, fuck!

388
00:51:11,675 --> 00:51:13,051
Kill him!

389
00:51:21,226 --> 00:51:22,227
Let me through!

390
00:51:25,022 --> 00:51:26,273
Right.

391
00:51:26,273 --> 00:51:30,444
We are being terrorized
by deputies armed with daggers!

392
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:34,448
And these madmen have outlawed themselves

393
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:37,159
by their attempt
on the liberty of this country!

394
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:39,745
- They're trying to kill me!
- They're trying to kill him.

395
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:41,913
Open these doors!

396
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:48,211
Let us out of here!

397
00:51:48,211 --> 00:51:53,133
I will kill my brother if he betrays
the freedom of the French people!

398
00:51:54,593 --> 00:51:56,094
Get in there now!

399
00:51:56,094 --> 00:51:57,179
Fuck.

400
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:04,394
Move. Get back. Back.

401
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:07,064
Move it!

402
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,069
- Back. Move back.
- Move back. Out of the way.

403
00:52:12,736 --> 00:52:14,821
Move. Backwards.

404
00:52:21,286 --> 00:52:22,621
Good luck, brother.

405
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,341
Stand aside.

406
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,522
Shall we vote?

407
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:53,026
Where are we going?

408
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:57,739
All our harsh words are behind us.

409
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:03,120
I need you to be my most tender friend.

410
00:53:06,957 --> 00:53:10,127
Over this door is our destiny.

411
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,872
Present arms!

412
00:54:41,426 --> 00:54:43,512
- First Consul.
- My lord.

413
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:45,514
Milady.

414
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:51,311
- Citizen Bonaparte.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

415
00:54:51,311 --> 00:54:52,938
- First Consul.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

416
00:54:52,938 --> 00:54:54,231
First Consul.

417
00:54:57,776 --> 00:54:59,069
Come, little one.

418
00:54:59,778 --> 00:55:02,698
You get into the bed of your master's.

419
00:55:16,128 --> 00:55:18,922
Hello, madame!

420
00:55:18,922 --> 00:55:20,590
Hello, good evening.

421
00:55:26,138 --> 00:55:27,764
Mother, the Duke of Avignon.

422
00:55:27,764 --> 00:55:29,016
It's good to meet you.

423
00:55:40,193 --> 00:55:41,528
Could this be Josaphine?

424
00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:45,365
- Mother, Josaphine. Josaphine, Mother.
- Good to see you.

425
00:55:47,075 --> 00:55:48,160
It's Charles.

426
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,120
This way.

427
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:03,342
"Your Majesty, England
and France are wasting their prosperity."

428
00:56:03,342 --> 00:56:04,343
Let me try again.

429
00:56:06,845 --> 00:56:09,473
Your Royal Majesty, England and France

430
00:56:09,473 --> 00:56:12,351
- are wasting their prosperity...
- Your Majesty.

431
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:14,144
What did I say?

432
00:56:16,855 --> 00:56:18,440
"Your Royal Majesty."

433
00:56:19,691 --> 00:56:20,776
"Your Royal Ma"--

434
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:25,697
Your Majesty, England
and France are wasting their prosperity.

435
00:56:28,075 --> 00:56:30,494
I am not ashamed to take the initiative.

436
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:33,330
I have, I think,
sufficiently proven to the whole world

437
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:36,249
that I do not fear the chances of war.

438
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:41,880
But peace is my heartfelt wish
for England and France.

439
00:56:43,298 --> 00:56:44,299
Read it back to me.

440
00:56:45,217 --> 00:56:48,720
I have notified all foreign powers
of your accession to the Consul,

441
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,307
I have addressed letters
to all diplomatic agents abroad,

442
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:56,311
and I understand that you have made
friendly overtures of peace to England.

443
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:57,688
Caulaincourt.

444
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,525
What I need from you is
a better understanding

445
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:03,402
of the Russian Tsar Alexander.

446
00:57:04,111 --> 00:57:06,947
Would you consider the tsar an ally
to England or France?

447
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,744
Well, I would think that his trade
with England is more beneficial to him

448
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:14,246
than his trade with France.

449
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,959
And do you have a sense of
British influence in the Russian courts?

450
00:57:18,959 --> 00:57:21,545
I do not,
but I imagine it is quite robust.

451
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:23,922
Robust?

452
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:31,847
What kind of man is he? Describe him.

453
00:57:33,432 --> 00:57:34,766
Well, he's young.

454
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:37,978
He's vain.

455
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:41,648
He's popular, and he wishes to remain so.

456
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:42,816
He's popular?

457
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:46,611
Really?

458
00:57:46,611 --> 00:57:50,323
His greatest fear is to be killed
in his bed, like his father.

459
00:57:52,659 --> 00:57:56,955
This makes him dangerously fickle
to whoever last has his attention.

460
00:57:58,081 --> 00:58:01,168
So he needs an ally
that he can also call a friend.

461
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,343
No more bets.

462
00:58:13,013 --> 00:58:14,389
What a surprise.

463
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:16,433
How nice to see you out.

464
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:18,769
Excuse me, gentlemen.

465
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:21,772
Good evening.
I'm just trying to lose some money.

466
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:25,442
Well, after this hand,
why don't you come and join me?

467
00:58:25,442 --> 00:58:27,235
I'm at my usual table.

468
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:28,487
That's a lovely idea.

469
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:31,531
Good evening.

470
00:58:34,117 --> 00:58:35,118
Did you hear?

471
00:58:36,953 --> 00:58:41,875
Your Majesty received a letter of peace
from the First Consul today.

472
00:58:43,752 --> 00:58:47,339
Monsieur Talleyrand, if I may be honest?

473
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:48,423
Of course.

474
00:58:48,423 --> 00:58:53,261
Austria's coalition with England is
in such a strong position against France,

475
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:57,224
that these peace overtures are clearly

476
00:58:57,224 --> 00:59:00,060
only for your handling
of French public opinion.

477
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,688
Oh, my friend.

478
00:59:04,731 --> 00:59:06,400
You know me so well.

479
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:11,029
Yes, it is true.
It is public opinion Napoleon is after.

480
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:14,074
But my warning to you
is that he's as hungry for it

481
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:16,243
as any man in the history of the world.

482
00:59:16,243 --> 00:59:18,120
So my suggestion, with respect,

483
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,957
would be to take
this little offering of peace from him...

484
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:30,716
or suffer the consequences
from a man bent on peace at any cost.

485
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,971
The English ambassador, Lord Whitworth,
has arrived, Consul.

486
00:59:44,855 --> 00:59:48,066
Do not look at me as if
you don't know what I'm about to say.

487
00:59:49,776 --> 00:59:52,487
Are you aware of my letter of peace
to your king?

488
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,322
I am not.

489
00:59:55,782 --> 00:59:57,075
Shall I repeat it?

490
00:59:58,368 --> 00:59:59,786
No, you may not.

491
01:00:00,912 --> 01:00:03,290
Take this as a warning to your king.

492
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:06,043
I will keep you guessing and scared.

493
01:00:06,043 --> 01:00:08,253
You will watch your borders and your back,

494
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:11,256
and your manners are bound,
sooner or later, to be French.

495
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:13,717
I will offer no more letters of peace,

496
01:00:13,717 --> 01:00:18,221
and I will take the lack of a swift reply
as an act of disrespect!

497
01:00:18,221 --> 01:00:21,433
You think you're so great
because you have boats!

498
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:28,106
'Tis a shame such a great man
should have no manners.

499
01:00:41,495 --> 01:00:42,496
Yes?

500
01:00:45,082 --> 01:00:46,083
Are you pleased?

501
01:00:48,752 --> 01:00:51,254
Are you about to tell me
something that will make me angry?

502
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:53,590
Let's hope not.

503
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:58,303
The European families think
nothing more of you than a Corsican thug.

504
01:00:59,054 --> 01:00:59,888
Therefore,

505
01:01:00,847 --> 01:01:04,518
I'm going to suggest something
that's been a long time arriving.

506
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,232
I suggest that you abandon
your role as First Consul of France

507
01:01:11,191 --> 01:01:15,612
in exchange for the title
"Victorious Consul."

508
01:01:17,656 --> 01:01:20,075
By another name, "king."

509
01:01:23,036 --> 01:01:24,037
What?

510
01:01:25,622 --> 01:01:26,623
"King."

511
01:01:29,209 --> 01:01:30,210
Yes, king.

512
01:01:32,796 --> 01:01:33,797
King?

513
01:01:53,817 --> 01:01:55,694
My hair has been set.

514
01:01:56,778 --> 01:01:58,572
The way you like it.

515
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:05,162
Oh, you filthy man.
My hair has been set now.

516
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,710
I have the most beautiful wife.

517
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,712
I-- All right, come on then.

518
01:02:16,757 --> 01:02:17,758
Hat off.

519
01:02:24,973 --> 01:02:26,767
Give me your hand.

520
01:02:27,851 --> 01:02:29,686
- You feel that?
- What?

521
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:32,439
Can you feel that?

522
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:34,399
That's yours.

523
01:02:34,983 --> 01:02:36,109
It's yours.

524
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:37,194
Thank you.

525
01:03:00,926 --> 01:03:01,927
Stop.

526
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:04,096
Why aren't you pregnant?

527
01:03:08,392 --> 01:03:11,687
Is that a question,
or is that an accusation?

528
01:03:15,899 --> 01:03:17,109
It was a question.

529
01:03:19,486 --> 01:03:20,696
Now it's an accusation.

530
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:27,411
Well, I've seen Dr. Corvisart,
and he has no answer.

531
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,459
Only that I do
what Madame de Remusat has done.

532
01:03:36,837 --> 01:03:37,838
Which is?

533
01:03:39,381 --> 01:03:40,382
Which is...

534
01:03:42,968 --> 01:03:45,679
along with hopeful thinking
and a bit of red wine,

535
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:48,598
he suggested I take the waters
at Aix-la-Chapelle.

536
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,270
And why haven't you?

537
01:03:54,646 --> 01:03:57,524
As wife of the First Consul,
I haven't found the time.

538
01:03:57,524 --> 01:04:00,527
I spend many hours cleaning up after you.

539
01:04:05,073 --> 01:04:06,533
Find the time.

540
01:04:08,994 --> 01:04:11,705
I don't need to explain
to you the importance of this, do I?

541
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:13,957
What, you want an heir?

542
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,501
I want one now.

543
01:04:34,186 --> 01:04:35,604
Oh, my God.

544
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,030
May God affirm you on his throne,

545
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:33,328
and Christ give you to rule with him
in his eternal kingdom.

546
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:02,691
I found the crown of France in the gutter.

547
01:06:04,693 --> 01:06:09,031
I picked it up with the tip of my sword
and cleaned it...

548
01:06:11,116 --> 01:06:13,243
and place it atop my own head.

549
01:06:39,853 --> 01:06:45,150
The most glorious,
the most august Napoleon,

550
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:47,778
emperor of the French,

551
01:06:47,778 --> 01:06:51,198
is crowned and enthroned!

552
01:06:52,032 --> 01:06:56,328
Long live the emperor!

553
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,830
Long live the emperor!

554
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,664
I do not support this idea.

555
01:07:40,664 --> 01:07:43,417
You suggest divorce after years of debate.

556
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:45,293
You can see that it has me divided.

557
01:07:49,506 --> 01:07:51,258
I am not ambitious.

558
01:07:51,258 --> 01:07:53,176
I've never declared war with anyone.

559
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:57,931
No.

560
01:08:00,183 --> 01:08:04,521
You are the greatest leader
in the history of the world

561
01:08:04,521 --> 01:08:06,565
and the world's only chance at peace.

562
01:08:11,611 --> 01:08:15,532
The security of the empire and peace
in the world depends upon an heir.

563
01:08:23,206 --> 01:08:24,541
It was an option.

564
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,961
And I said it at the time.

565
01:08:35,218 --> 01:08:36,845
Are you enjoying yourself?

566
01:08:38,805 --> 01:08:42,267
I'm going to war to defend our people,

567
01:08:42,267 --> 01:08:44,811
and my wife cannot provide me an heir.

568
01:08:48,523 --> 01:08:51,193
If you do not bear me a child tonight,

569
01:08:52,986 --> 01:08:54,528
there will be a divorce.

570
01:08:56,907 --> 01:09:00,285
Hasn't been enough lovemaking
in this home to bear a child.

571
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,704
Yes, there has.

572
01:09:04,664 --> 01:09:07,541
There have been years of it. Years.

573
01:09:09,294 --> 01:09:10,711
And with more than just me.

574
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:15,592
And still you are empty.

575
01:09:15,592 --> 01:09:17,177
And you're fat.

576
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:22,224
I enjoy my meals. I do.

577
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,893
Destiny has brought me here.

578
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:27,437
Destiny has brought me this lamb chop.

579
01:09:52,879 --> 01:09:53,880
Josaphine.

580
01:09:58,427 --> 01:09:59,428
Come then.

581
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:01,930
Come.

582
01:10:08,644 --> 01:10:12,523
I love your talents and your taste.

583
01:10:14,776 --> 01:10:17,446
And while I'm away,
I will miss your grace.

584
01:10:18,196 --> 01:10:19,489
And your dignity.

585
01:10:20,782 --> 01:10:22,576
And I will come back to you.

586
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,070
To today's victory.

587
01:10:59,404 --> 01:11:01,406
Look, I'm always here for you, Francis.

588
01:11:02,407 --> 01:11:05,702
But I must admit, I'm overwhelmed
with the excitement of the battlefield.

589
01:11:06,745 --> 01:11:08,538
I should not deceive you, Alexander.

590
01:11:08,538 --> 01:11:11,750
This battle against him will be brutal
and terrifying.

591
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:38,402
Come on!

592
01:11:38,402 --> 01:11:40,362
Get in defensive position!

593
01:11:50,831 --> 01:11:52,624
My good wife, Josaphine.

594
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:57,129
My God, it's cold here.
I miss your warmth.

595
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:02,175
On this day, we celebrate
the first anniversary of our coronation.

596
01:12:04,011 --> 01:12:06,680
My previous ally
has now joined with my enemy.

597
01:12:07,806 --> 01:12:11,643
The Russian Tsar Alexander
joined forces with the prince of Austria.

598
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,355
I have heard that
he's been studying the art of war

599
01:12:15,355 --> 01:12:17,190
and trying to emulate my battle tactics.

600
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,191
More fires.

601
01:12:18,191 --> 01:12:19,693
He tries to copy me,

602
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,113
but he is a little boy
who will make a terrible mistake.

603
01:12:24,281 --> 01:12:28,243
I am certain I will bring the laurels of
another glorious victory to my army today.

604
01:12:29,286 --> 01:12:31,455
Yours, Napoleon.

605
01:12:46,928 --> 01:12:49,765
Hey, tie it from the back.
Peg that corner to the ground.

606
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:50,849
That's it.

607
01:12:57,939 --> 01:12:59,149
Fuck.

608
01:13:55,914 --> 01:13:57,207
Your Majesty.

609
01:13:58,166 --> 01:13:59,668
We are discovered.

610
01:14:01,253 --> 01:14:02,254
Good.

611
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:04,840
Tell the men to rest.

612
01:14:35,287 --> 01:14:40,292
I-N-F-S.

613
01:14:42,127 --> 01:14:43,378
Infantry sighted.

614
01:14:57,517 --> 01:15:01,021
I-M-T.

615
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:04,775
Imminent!

616
01:15:07,486 --> 01:15:09,529
Stand to!

617
01:15:09,529 --> 01:15:12,282
- Stand to!
- Stand to!

618
01:15:12,282 --> 01:15:14,034
- Stand to!
- Stand to.

619
01:15:14,034 --> 01:15:17,329
- Wake up, men. Get ready!
- Stand to!

620
01:15:17,329 --> 01:15:19,081
Come on, get up!

621
01:15:46,566 --> 01:15:47,776
Wait.

622
01:15:48,318 --> 01:15:49,319
Ready!

623
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:52,989
Wait! Let them think
they have the higher ground.

624
01:16:39,036 --> 01:16:40,245
Fire!

625
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:44,791
Fire away!

626
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:53,717
Fire at will!

627
01:17:00,223 --> 01:17:01,308
Send in the infantry.

628
01:17:01,308 --> 01:17:03,769
Take their position on the higher ground.
At the double.

629
01:17:03,769 --> 01:17:06,646
Take the ground!

630
01:17:38,595 --> 01:17:41,306
Cavalry from the west.
Pierce their flanks.

631
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:58,407
Retreat! Withdraw!

632
01:17:58,407 --> 01:17:59,991
Withdraw!

633
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:13,130
It's a trap!

634
01:18:17,676 --> 01:18:19,344
Retreat!

635
01:18:57,632 --> 01:19:00,761
- Uncover the cannons.
- Cannons!

636
01:19:05,057 --> 01:19:07,309
- Fire!
- Fire!

637
01:19:11,188 --> 01:19:12,314
Reloading!

638
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,209
Keep to the one side.

639
01:19:43,887 --> 01:19:45,597
Off the ice!

640
01:20:35,772 --> 01:20:38,483
Renounce, sir. We're pinned in.

641
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:43,572
Off the ice! Withdraw!

642
01:20:50,454 --> 01:20:51,663
Cut off their retreat.

643
01:21:42,923 --> 01:21:45,717
Francis. So nice to finally meet you.

644
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,886
Please come in where it's warm.

645
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,139
- Thank you.
- You must forgive me.

646
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,725
This has been my only palace
for the last two months.

647
01:21:54,935 --> 01:21:58,939
Seems very agreeable.
You make excellent use of it.

648
01:21:58,939 --> 01:22:00,982
Well, we do what we can
on the battlefield.

649
01:22:01,775 --> 01:22:03,318
Yes, we do, don't we?

650
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:06,321
It's nice to finally meet another emperor.

651
01:22:07,614 --> 01:22:09,866
Where, may I ask, is Alexander?

652
01:22:09,866 --> 01:22:12,327
Are we waiting for his arrival
before we get started?

653
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:16,123
I do not believe he will be joining us.

654
01:22:16,123 --> 01:22:18,709
He's beside himself with rage.

655
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:25,382
I realize I must compliment you
for making me commit an enormous error.

656
01:22:26,466 --> 01:22:28,218
- An error?
- Yes.

657
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:30,762
What error have you made?

658
01:22:32,764 --> 01:22:35,892
To be speaking with you here
and accepting this invitation for peace,

659
01:22:36,768 --> 01:22:38,478
I have not followed up my victory.

660
01:22:39,938 --> 01:22:43,191
I could have taken the whole Russian
and Austrian army prisoners.

661
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:47,112
Yes.

662
01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:49,823
But after all, there will be less tears.

663
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:55,704
And I know you will remember
this gesture of kindness. Yes?

664
01:22:57,122 --> 01:22:58,123
Thank you.

665
01:23:02,794 --> 01:23:03,795
Toast?

666
01:23:12,929 --> 01:23:19,394
To friendship, a glorious peace
and the best interest of Europe.

667
01:23:26,777 --> 01:23:27,611
Burgundy.

668
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:53,011
Hold on. Hey, whoa!

669
01:23:53,804 --> 01:23:55,430
Whoa, we don't say woof. Okay.

670
01:23:57,891 --> 01:24:00,977
That's my boy. Attaboy.

671
01:24:00,977 --> 01:24:02,604
Come here. Sit.

672
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,373
It is time to put this mystery to rest,
Emperor.

673
01:24:21,915 --> 01:24:24,710
I want to know if it's you or Josaphine.

674
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:32,092
And to that end, we will conduct
a very practical experiment.

675
01:24:34,928 --> 01:24:38,098
At the end of the hallway-- Take this--

676
01:24:38,974 --> 01:24:42,936
Waiting for you, undressed,
ready to receive,

677
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:48,358
is 18-year-old
Eleanor Denuelle de La Plaigne.

678
01:24:51,528 --> 01:24:53,697
She's brunette with brown eyes.

679
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:56,450
And the object of this, well,

680
01:24:56,450 --> 01:25:01,788
hardly unpleasant task is to see
if you can father a child.

681
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:07,002
And then we will have an answer
to this nagging question

682
01:25:07,002 --> 01:25:12,132
of who is keeping who from an heir
to the throne of France.

683
01:25:17,637 --> 01:25:18,764
Shall we go?

684
01:25:19,389 --> 01:25:20,724
May I have another, please?

685
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:22,202
The girl is pregnant.

686
01:26:22,202 --> 01:26:23,745
You made her pregnant.

687
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:39,177
I know I didn't see her.

688
01:26:46,393 --> 01:26:48,562
When are you going to insist we divorce?

689
01:26:50,564 --> 01:26:52,065
Isn't that wonderful?

690
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:57,946
From the only woman that I've ever loved
and given all that I've conquered.

691
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:03,994
I'm just too tired to wait
for you to tell me what I know is coming.

692
01:27:06,413 --> 01:27:07,664
If you insist.

693
01:27:11,376 --> 01:27:13,128
I'll make it easy for you.

694
01:27:19,426 --> 01:27:22,095
I know you will have a bastard child.

695
01:27:27,309 --> 01:27:31,104
If I succeed in making the birth of a boy
that I shall call my own son,

696
01:27:32,022 --> 01:27:35,984
I want you as a witness
to pretend the confinement of the empress.

697
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:39,404
Your Highness,

698
01:27:39,404 --> 01:27:42,949
you are asking me to lie about the status
of the mother of your heir.

699
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:46,661
That is another way of putting it, yes.

700
01:27:48,914 --> 01:27:54,670
Emperor, it is my honor
and my duty, of course,

701
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,672
to do as you require of me.

702
01:27:56,672 --> 01:28:00,634
But if asked, I cannot contain
that which I know to be the truth.

703
01:28:01,677 --> 01:28:03,679
And painful though it is,

704
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:08,266
the truth is that the empress is
no longer capable of bearing you a child.

705
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:21,822
My good Josaphine.

706
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,286
You know how I've loved you.

707
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:34,626
It is you, to you alone,

708
01:28:35,836 --> 01:28:39,423
that I owe the few moments
of happiness I have known in this world.

709
01:28:43,385 --> 01:28:47,139
My destiny is more powerful than my will.

710
01:28:49,224 --> 01:28:55,230
And my affections must yield
to the interests of my people.

711
01:29:16,877 --> 01:29:20,130
The imperial decree
for the dissolution of the marriage

712
01:29:21,298 --> 01:29:25,010
between the Emperor Napoleon
and the Empress Josaphine.

713
01:29:33,643 --> 01:29:38,940
"My people desire that this throne,
where providence has placed me,

714
01:29:39,483 --> 01:29:41,151
would be given to my children.

715
01:29:42,903 --> 01:29:47,074
However, I have lost hope
of having children from my marriage

716
01:29:47,074 --> 01:29:49,826
to my beloved wife, Empress Josaphine.

717
01:29:50,827 --> 01:29:54,915
I have then been led to listen
only to the good of the state

718
01:29:54,915 --> 01:29:58,418
and to want the dissolution
of years of my life."

719
01:30:05,467 --> 01:30:10,180
You have embellished my life for 15 years.

720
01:30:12,432 --> 01:30:17,854
The memories of which
will remain forever etched in my heart.

721
01:30:34,204 --> 01:30:37,999
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

722
01:30:40,711 --> 01:30:45,215
She has been deprived
of one day being governed

723
01:30:45,215 --> 01:30:49,136
by the descendants
of the man brought to us by providence

724
01:30:49,136 --> 01:30:51,680
to mend the evils of a terrible revolution

725
01:30:52,305 --> 01:30:55,684
and restore faith, the throne
and the social order."

726
01:31:01,648 --> 01:31:03,025
Sorry.

727
01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:07,487
- Emperor. Wait.
- Go. No, listen. All right?

728
01:31:07,487 --> 01:31:10,323
This is for your country.
That's what this is, all right?

729
01:31:10,824 --> 01:31:11,908
Now say it.

730
01:31:13,368 --> 01:31:14,578
Say it.

731
01:31:21,293 --> 01:31:24,338
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

732
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,884
Agreeing to the dissolution
of our marriage,

733
01:31:29,509 --> 01:31:31,970
as I must, does not change my feelings.

734
01:31:38,185 --> 01:31:44,524
The emperor will have in me
always his truest friend."

735
01:32:18,642 --> 01:32:19,726
Emperor,

736
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,730
you have just pronounced the word
which separates us forever.

737
01:32:25,565 --> 01:32:28,151
Your mistaken ambition has ever been

738
01:32:28,819 --> 01:32:33,031
and will continue to be the guide
of all your actions.

739
01:32:33,907 --> 01:32:35,117
Nevertheless,

740
01:32:35,909 --> 01:32:39,371
you can never doubt the sincerity
of my wishes for your happiness.

741
01:32:40,622 --> 01:32:44,209
May it at least afford me
some consolation for my sufferings.

742
01:32:45,335 --> 01:32:47,879
- Yours, Josaphine.
- Thank you.

743
01:32:48,547 --> 01:32:50,882
- Good morning, madame.
- Thank you. What's your name?

744
01:32:50,882 --> 01:32:53,135
- Fleur.
- Fleur. Pleasure.

745
01:33:55,697 --> 01:33:56,698
I miss you.

746
01:34:02,162 --> 01:34:04,164
Marital life is very agreeable now.

747
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,546
You've shown such great courage so far.

748
01:34:13,882 --> 01:34:15,384
You must maintain it.

749
01:34:16,802 --> 01:34:19,721
Do not permit yourself
to fall into melancholy.

750
01:34:25,268 --> 01:34:26,978
You look best when you're happy.

751
01:34:31,817 --> 01:34:33,402
Please take care of your health.

752
01:34:34,403 --> 01:34:35,779
It is precious to me.

753
01:34:37,114 --> 01:34:38,448
Will you write me tomorrow?

754
01:34:42,828 --> 01:34:43,954
And the next day?

755
01:34:44,663 --> 01:34:45,664
Yes.

756
01:34:46,748 --> 01:34:47,874
And the day after that?

757
01:34:51,712 --> 01:34:53,547
- And the day after that?
- Yeah.

758
01:34:56,967 --> 01:34:57,968
Good.

759
01:35:08,228 --> 01:35:12,065
Once, an English ambassador
challenged my reasons for war.

760
01:35:12,733 --> 01:35:16,194
He said,
"You French, you fight only for money,

761
01:35:16,194 --> 01:35:18,447
while we English, we fight for honor."

762
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:23,285
I replied,
"Everyone fights for what they lack."

763
01:35:26,663 --> 01:35:29,666
This is not your story.
This never happened to you, did it?

764
01:35:29,666 --> 01:35:30,709
Of course it did.

765
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:32,169
- Of course it did.
- What do you mean?

766
01:35:32,169 --> 01:35:34,296
We had the same saying
with my people and the Turks.

767
01:35:34,796 --> 01:35:35,630
Do you?

768
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:37,799
The English lack honor.
We can agree on that.

769
01:35:37,799 --> 01:35:39,134
Listen, there is--

770
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:46,391
There's nothing I think we can agree
more with than our hatred for Britain.

771
01:35:49,728 --> 01:35:54,232
I just have to say that it actually--

772
01:35:54,232 --> 01:35:57,819
It would be my absolute pleasure
and honor if I could call you my brother.

773
01:36:01,615 --> 01:36:03,617
There is a way for you to call me brother.

774
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:08,955
Last night, at dinner, I was...

775
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:13,627
charmed by your sister.

776
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:16,171
Is she spoken for?

777
01:36:17,464 --> 01:36:21,885
Sadly, yes. She's to be married
to the Duke of Oldenburg, I'm afraid.

778
01:36:22,594 --> 01:36:25,555
And what of her younger sister? Anna?

779
01:36:26,306 --> 01:36:27,974
Is there a formal offer for Anna?

780
01:36:35,857 --> 01:36:38,568
Well, you see, Anna, she's 15 years old.

781
01:36:39,778 --> 01:36:40,946
That is a detail.

782
01:36:44,366 --> 01:36:48,954
Our friendship is built on
our mutual distrust of England.

783
01:36:49,663 --> 01:36:54,042
When we hold to the Continental Blockade,
we choke them from the trade,

784
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:56,420
and we fight for our most sacred rights.

785
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,672
That is what is important between us.

786
01:36:59,339 --> 01:37:00,340
I just had a thought.

787
01:37:01,008 --> 01:37:02,300
- No.
- No, say it.

788
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:04,011
- Should I tell you?
- Please.

789
01:37:05,262 --> 01:37:08,015
Imagine an army. 50,000 men.

790
01:37:08,515 --> 01:37:11,768
Russians, Frenchmen,
perhaps even Austrians,

791
01:37:11,768 --> 01:37:14,563
marching by way of Constantinople
into Asia

792
01:37:14,563 --> 01:37:16,314
would have only to reach the Euphrates

793
01:37:16,314 --> 01:37:18,734
to make England tremble
and bring her down on her knees

794
01:37:18,734 --> 01:37:20,318
before the continent.

795
01:37:23,864 --> 01:37:25,032
It is incredible.

796
01:37:26,241 --> 01:37:27,242
Toast.

797
01:37:34,082 --> 01:37:35,584
- To you.
- To us.

798
01:37:36,793 --> 01:37:41,715
His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon,
wishes to make a formal offer to Austria

799
01:37:41,715 --> 01:37:44,009
and to His Majesty, King Francis,

800
01:37:45,218 --> 01:37:48,513
for the hand
of the archduchess, Marie-Louise.

801
01:37:50,182 --> 01:37:51,308
His eldest daughter.

802
01:37:52,642 --> 01:37:53,852
No.

803
01:37:55,145 --> 01:37:57,689
This union would bring together
Austria and France

804
01:37:57,689 --> 01:37:59,900
in an unbreakable matrimonial bond.

805
01:38:01,693 --> 01:38:03,695
Is this a joke?

806
01:38:06,073 --> 01:38:12,829
I may find it humorous...
but His Majesty does not.

807
01:38:30,722 --> 01:38:32,391
Did you have a pleasant journey?

808
01:38:32,391 --> 01:38:34,017
It was wonderful. Thank you.

809
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:41,608
You're quite petite.

810
01:38:42,651 --> 01:38:43,860
I'm not accustomed to that.

811
01:38:47,739 --> 01:38:49,032
How do I look to you?

812
01:38:50,659 --> 01:38:52,411
Do I resemble my portrait?

813
01:38:52,994 --> 01:38:57,332
Oh, yes.
And even more handsome and strong.

814
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:02,129
And you are even more handsome,
more beautiful.

815
01:39:04,297 --> 01:39:06,174
I hope you're pleased with your choice.

816
01:39:07,843 --> 01:39:11,013
I hope so too.
Would you like to see the bedroom?

817
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:13,390
Yes, thank you.

818
01:39:25,861 --> 01:39:27,988
Your Majesty, your son.

819
01:39:47,466 --> 01:39:48,467
Hello.

820
01:39:52,804 --> 01:39:53,805
Fire!

821
01:40:02,356 --> 01:40:03,565
My little king.

822
01:40:16,912 --> 01:40:18,038
Hold.

823
01:41:16,388 --> 01:41:18,140
Oh, sweet child.

824
01:41:28,692 --> 01:41:34,364
One day, you will understand
what I have sacrificed for you.

825
01:41:44,374 --> 01:41:47,252
My dear Josaphine, I'm sad today.

826
01:41:47,794 --> 01:41:51,631
Tsar Alexander has turned against me
and forced me to invade Russia.

827
01:41:52,591 --> 01:41:57,429
He's decided to open his ports to England
while taxing the French.

828
01:41:58,764 --> 01:42:02,559
I must wipe away my melancholy
and begin the march to Moscow.

829
01:42:03,602 --> 01:42:06,480
I've convinced the heads of Europe
of this resolution,

830
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:11,068
and so I command the combined forces
of France, Austria, Italy,

831
01:42:11,068 --> 01:42:12,861
Germany and Poland.

832
01:42:13,445 --> 01:42:16,114
I see nothing but success in my future.

833
01:42:16,114 --> 01:42:19,076
Keep your lines. Steady.

834
01:42:21,411 --> 01:42:23,080
To the front.

835
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,082
Keep your step.

836
01:42:31,672 --> 01:42:32,589
Take cover!

837
01:42:32,589 --> 01:42:33,507
Get down!

838
01:42:39,971 --> 01:42:41,765
Get down!

839
01:42:55,028 --> 01:42:57,072
After them!

840
01:43:15,424 --> 01:43:16,675
Whoa.

841
01:43:20,387 --> 01:43:21,388
Whoa.

842
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:41,950
- Get back! Drop back. Retreat.
- Fall back!

843
01:44:49,351 --> 01:44:51,269
My dear Josaphine.

844
01:44:52,854 --> 01:44:56,108
I'm writing to you because I have just won
a great battle today.

845
01:44:57,734 --> 01:45:00,028
Tomorrow we will resume our advance.

846
01:45:00,737 --> 01:45:03,115
Moscow is now only 200 miles away.

847
01:45:03,115 --> 01:45:06,660
And I think of you all the while.
All yours.

848
01:45:07,369 --> 01:45:09,204
Nearly there.

849
01:45:16,628 --> 01:45:17,629
Thank you, sir.

850
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:27,639
- Thank you, Admiral.
- You were the brave of Austerlitz.

851
01:46:32,662 --> 01:46:34,206
Where are you?

852
01:46:47,302 --> 01:46:49,596
300,000 souls lived in this city.

853
01:46:51,473 --> 01:46:52,849
And they've all just left?

854
01:47:12,035 --> 01:47:14,955
Little boy.

855
01:47:20,168 --> 01:47:21,712
Where are you?

856
01:47:26,174 --> 01:47:27,801
Don't be frightened.

857
01:47:28,635 --> 01:47:30,846
I'm just gonna give you a little spanking.

858
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:03,211
It's not very sporting, is it?

859
01:48:05,088 --> 01:48:06,965
For his honor and Russia's, not mine.

860
01:48:12,387 --> 01:48:14,348
There's dignity to be had in defeat.

861
01:48:58,016 --> 01:48:59,017
Who did this?

862
01:49:00,435 --> 01:49:01,436
They did.

863
01:49:02,938 --> 01:49:06,149
No, they did not. Be sensible.

864
01:49:09,069 --> 01:49:10,445
Who set these fires?

865
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:15,701
Your Majesty, they did.

866
01:49:21,331 --> 01:49:24,292
He'd rather burn his own city
than negotiate with me.

867
01:49:25,085 --> 01:49:27,129
I didn't think he had the courage.

868
01:49:32,592 --> 01:49:38,140
Well, we'll go to Saint Petersburg
and have him burn that too.

869
01:49:40,017 --> 01:49:43,562
We have let too much time slip away.

870
01:49:45,272 --> 01:49:48,650
We would be marching
into the Russian winter

871
01:49:49,609 --> 01:49:53,655
with horses that are not raised
for this weather.

872
01:49:55,198 --> 01:49:58,452
If we go back to Poland,
we can wait out the winter months.

873
01:50:13,967 --> 01:50:17,471
Napoleon, your letters are a soothing balm
to my heart.

874
01:50:18,388 --> 01:50:19,681
I fear for you.

875
01:50:20,432 --> 01:50:24,144
Remember that I alone know your health,
your fears.

876
01:50:24,936 --> 01:50:28,482
I thank you as tenderly
as I will always love you.

877
01:50:29,024 --> 01:50:30,067
Josaphine.

878
01:50:31,735 --> 01:50:33,320
My friend, Josaphine.

879
01:50:34,488 --> 01:50:35,655
"Friend."

880
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:38,909
It is strange to write that word to you.

881
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,162
You have always been so much more.

882
01:50:50,253 --> 01:50:55,050
Despite careful organization,
there have been breakdowns in supply.

883
01:50:56,635 --> 01:51:01,431
We're suffering sickness,
desertion and famine.

884
01:51:03,475 --> 01:51:04,601
We are winning.

885
01:51:16,822 --> 01:51:20,158
- Us or Cossacks?
- Us.

886
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:27,999
Josaphine. Fortune has abandoned me.

887
01:51:29,209 --> 01:51:31,878
I know that it is what fate has for me.

888
01:51:32,587 --> 01:51:34,756
Your words rattle in my head.

889
01:51:36,425 --> 01:51:38,427
I am nothing without you.

890
01:51:42,764 --> 01:51:49,396
Of the 600,000 men you sent to Russia,
only 40,000 have returned.

891
01:51:49,396 --> 01:51:55,110
Therefore, you have been exiled
in no uncertain terms.

892
01:51:56,903 --> 01:52:01,867
The allied coalition of Austria, Prussia,
Russia and England,

893
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:05,954
and with the agreement
of the French Council,

894
01:52:07,164 --> 01:52:10,917
grant you sovereignty
of the island of Elba.

895
01:52:12,669 --> 01:52:15,756
A revenue of two million francs
from the French funds,

896
01:52:16,757 --> 01:52:20,177
pensions for the Bonaparte family
and the Empress Marie-Louise.

897
01:52:21,345 --> 01:52:26,558
It also provides for Empress Josaphine
to retain all of her properties

898
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:31,897
and an allotted annual income
of one million francs.

899
01:53:01,009 --> 01:53:02,594
I love France too much.

900
01:53:07,849 --> 01:53:10,102
All I've desired was its glory.

901
01:53:12,896 --> 01:53:14,856
I would never bring her misfortune.

902
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:18,944
They want me to abdicate.

903
01:53:20,654 --> 01:53:22,197
Fine, I'll abdicate.

904
01:54:29,014 --> 01:54:30,015
Your Highness.

905
01:54:31,767 --> 01:54:32,768
Empress.

906
01:54:47,824 --> 01:54:48,825
Here.

907
01:54:53,705 --> 01:54:55,457
Josaphine, Josaphine.

908
01:54:57,584 --> 01:54:58,585
I am charmed.

909
01:55:00,671 --> 01:55:01,672
But...

910
01:55:06,218 --> 01:55:10,472
you do not have to lock yourself away
just because he's not here.

911
01:55:12,224 --> 01:55:14,601
I know what it is like
to be underestimated.

912
01:55:16,228 --> 01:55:22,234
But your eyes, your charm and your spirit,

913
01:55:23,443 --> 01:55:24,653
it is in there.

914
01:55:25,487 --> 01:55:29,032
It is yours, and you can use it.

915
01:56:13,076 --> 01:56:14,411
Dear Josaphine,

916
01:56:15,162 --> 01:56:18,248
You are mine. You will always be.

917
01:56:19,791 --> 01:56:21,793
I cannot stand it any longer.

918
01:56:22,419 --> 01:56:24,671
It has been 300 days on this rock,

919
01:56:25,339 --> 01:56:28,717
and I'm ready to come home
and reclaim what's mine:

920
01:56:29,343 --> 01:56:31,136
you and France.

921
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:51,073
I'm taking your ship.

922
01:56:51,073 --> 01:56:54,034
If you do not provoke me,
you do not have to fear me.

923
01:57:13,095 --> 01:57:14,304
Napoleon,

924
01:57:15,263 --> 01:57:19,476
I'm a flower that opens its petals
and smiles to the sunshine,

925
01:57:20,602 --> 01:57:24,106
unconscious that the storm is near
which will lay me low

926
01:57:24,106 --> 01:57:26,358
and scatter leaves to the heavens.

927
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:29,361
Come quickly, my friend.

928
01:57:59,016 --> 01:58:01,351
If you would open your mouth, please.

929
01:58:06,606 --> 01:58:07,607
Thank you.

930
01:58:12,529 --> 01:58:13,739
Thank you.

931
01:58:14,531 --> 01:58:17,868
Well, your chest is congested.
Your throat is aflame.

932
01:58:19,036 --> 01:58:20,871
My suggestion is to stay in bed.

933
01:58:23,373 --> 01:58:24,666
But Napoleon is coming.

934
01:58:25,208 --> 01:58:27,961
It would be unwise
to receive any visitors.

935
01:58:27,961 --> 01:58:29,671
But Napoleon is coming.

936
01:58:29,671 --> 01:58:30,839
I understand.

937
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,361
Just keep her comfortable.

938
01:59:12,172 --> 01:59:13,215
Whoa!

939
01:59:20,263 --> 01:59:21,348
Your Majesty.

940
01:59:26,186 --> 01:59:27,479
You may speak.

941
01:59:27,479 --> 01:59:30,732
Bonaparte, Your Majesty. He has returned.

942
01:59:30,732 --> 01:59:32,859
A ship landed on a beach
in Antibes this morning,

943
01:59:32,859 --> 01:59:33,819
and they're on the march.

944
01:59:33,819 --> 01:59:36,947
Napoleon Bonaparte is marching
towards Paris.

945
01:59:40,325 --> 01:59:41,618
More.

946
01:59:41,618 --> 01:59:42,703
Your Majesty.

947
02:00:16,111 --> 02:00:16,987
Afternoon, Colonel.

948
02:00:18,030 --> 02:00:19,239
Your Majesty.

949
02:00:19,823 --> 02:00:20,907
General Marchand,

950
02:00:20,907 --> 02:00:23,577
in defense of the royal government
of King Louis XVIII,

951
02:00:24,369 --> 02:00:27,414
requests that you surrender your weapons
and cease your march

952
02:00:28,123 --> 02:00:30,792
so that you may be arrested
and returned to your island.

953
02:00:31,835 --> 02:00:35,714
Will you please inform the general that
I shall like to come and speak with him?

954
02:00:37,424 --> 02:00:39,426
I have no fight with my own Fifth Army.

955
02:00:41,219 --> 02:00:42,220
Sir.

956
02:00:51,271 --> 02:00:52,731
He wishes to speak.

957
02:00:54,232 --> 02:00:55,233
Make ready!

958
02:00:58,987 --> 02:01:00,197
Present.

959
02:01:11,208 --> 02:01:16,171
Soldiers of the Fifth Regiment,
do you recognize me?

960
02:01:19,966 --> 02:01:22,094
Do you recognize me, soldiers?

961
02:01:24,012 --> 02:01:25,597
Yes, Emperor!

962
02:01:31,812 --> 02:01:33,021
I miss you.

963
02:01:35,774 --> 02:01:37,776
I'm melancholy for my home...

964
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,239
and for our victories together.

965
02:01:45,450 --> 02:01:46,952
I want to come home.

966
02:01:48,412 --> 02:01:49,705
Will you join me?

967
02:01:51,456 --> 02:01:53,208
Long live the emperor!

968
02:01:53,208 --> 02:02:00,716
- Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!

969
02:02:40,714 --> 02:02:45,635
On May 26th, Dr. Corvisart was called

970
02:02:46,928 --> 02:02:52,100
and found her chest congested
and her throat inflamed.

971
02:02:54,478 --> 02:02:56,980
Her illness was diphtheria.

972
02:03:00,067 --> 02:03:05,947
On May 29th, last sacrament was given,
and she died.

973
02:03:10,577 --> 02:03:12,454
And no one thought to notify me?

974
02:03:22,756 --> 02:03:23,757
Hortense.

975
02:03:26,677 --> 02:03:27,678
Do you blame--

976
02:03:29,513 --> 02:03:30,722
Do you blame me?

977
02:03:33,475 --> 02:03:34,559
I don't blame you.

978
02:03:34,559 --> 02:03:35,644
Of course not.

979
02:03:38,522 --> 02:03:41,900
I'm not to bear the burden
of responsibility

980
02:03:43,485 --> 02:03:45,404
for the misfortunes of your mother.

981
02:03:46,530 --> 02:03:48,615
I want the letters that I wrote to her.

982
02:03:48,615 --> 02:03:52,744
I'm sorry, I don't have them.
They were stolen by her valet.

983
02:03:55,539 --> 02:03:56,748
Where did she keep them?

984
02:03:59,126 --> 02:04:01,628
In the cupboard in her bedroom,
next to her bed.

985
02:04:05,257 --> 02:04:06,675
What did he do with them?

986
02:04:09,094 --> 02:04:10,679
Her valet sold them.

987
02:04:18,061 --> 02:04:19,062
I'm sorry.

988
02:04:22,024 --> 02:04:23,025
I forgive you.

989
02:04:27,821 --> 02:04:30,949
Napoleon Bonaparte has destroyed

990
02:04:30,949 --> 02:04:34,911
the only title
upon which his very existence depended.

991
02:04:36,329 --> 02:04:39,666
This congregation of allies shall form

992
02:04:39,666 --> 02:04:43,211
along the borders of France
and Belgium an army.

993
02:04:43,211 --> 02:04:45,964
70,000 troops from England,

994
02:04:47,299 --> 02:04:49,885
120,000 troops from Prussia.

995
02:04:51,970 --> 02:04:55,932
This vermin has routed
the farmyards of Europe

996
02:04:56,808 --> 02:04:58,977
while the farmers snored.

997
02:04:59,561 --> 02:05:01,772
We should have struck this blow long ago.

998
02:05:02,856 --> 02:05:07,194
He has held the world hostage
with his egotism,

999
02:05:07,194 --> 02:05:10,489
his insatiable hunger for power,

1000
02:05:10,489 --> 02:05:13,992
and his lack of simple good manners.

1001
02:05:14,951 --> 02:05:17,412
We will all sleep again without him.

1002
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:23,710
I believe I speak for all of us when I say
that the only regret we all share

1003
02:05:24,419 --> 02:05:27,839
is that we allowed this vermin
to live at all.

1004
02:05:29,007 --> 02:05:32,636
250,000 men with the traitor.

1005
02:05:33,845 --> 02:05:39,810
25,000 men, 125,000 men

1006
02:05:39,810 --> 02:05:42,562
and 100,000 men...

1007
02:05:46,066 --> 02:05:49,403
against our 125,000 men.

1008
02:05:51,863 --> 02:05:53,448
This is a fight on land.

1009
02:05:55,117 --> 02:05:58,120
This is what Britain does not know
how to do that I know.

1010
02:06:00,414 --> 02:06:04,501
Strike quickly
against Wellington and Blucher.

1011
02:06:05,293 --> 02:06:06,878
Defeat them separately.

1012
02:06:07,921 --> 02:06:11,341
Disallow them from uniting forces here.

1013
02:06:24,396 --> 02:06:26,690
Morning.

1014
02:06:27,774 --> 02:06:29,234
The Prussians are advancing.

1015
02:06:30,318 --> 02:06:31,820
We should begin the offensive.

1016
02:06:32,529 --> 02:06:34,614
We must wait for the ground to dry.

1017
02:06:37,117 --> 02:06:40,412
Blucher will never make it in time.
I'll have Wellington by lunch.

1018
02:07:03,226 --> 02:07:06,021
I never get wet if I can help it.

1019
02:08:12,129 --> 02:08:13,505
What shall I tell the men?

1020
02:08:15,549 --> 02:08:17,259
Tell them to make the rain stop.

1021
02:08:20,262 --> 02:08:24,599
- Coming through!
- In formation!

1022
02:08:26,059 --> 02:08:28,729
Now's your time, lads. Now's your time.

1023
02:08:30,063 --> 02:08:31,690
Now, listen very carefully.

1024
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:38,071
Patience is the order of the day today.
Patience shall win the day.

1025
02:08:38,822 --> 02:08:41,074
We must hold this ground.

1026
02:08:41,783 --> 02:08:43,577
Let them come to us.

1027
02:08:43,577 --> 02:08:45,495
Huzzah!

1028
02:08:50,834 --> 02:08:52,085
Go on, boys. Go on.

1029
02:08:54,254 --> 02:08:55,255
Whoa.

1030
02:08:56,048 --> 02:08:57,257
Good morning, General Blucher.

1031
02:08:57,257 --> 02:08:59,968
- Good morning.
- Estimated time of arrival, sir?

1032
02:08:59,968 --> 02:09:02,387
- Officer?
- About five hours.

1033
02:09:02,387 --> 02:09:04,056
About five hours.

1034
02:09:20,614 --> 02:09:21,990
Come on, boys.

1035
02:09:34,836 --> 02:09:35,837
There he is.

1036
02:09:36,755 --> 02:09:42,427
He appears to be just sleeping.

1037
02:09:43,887 --> 02:09:49,309
One thing you cannot resist, my friend,
is a frontal attack.

1038
02:09:52,229 --> 02:09:55,232
Let's see how this general
can attack our position.

1039
02:09:58,235 --> 02:10:03,073
Sir. I have the emperor in my sights.
Do I have permission to fire?

1040
02:10:03,073 --> 02:10:04,282
Certainly not.

1041
02:10:04,783 --> 02:10:07,077
Generals commanding armies
have better things to do with their time

1042
02:10:07,077 --> 02:10:08,203
than to shoot at one another.

1043
02:10:08,203 --> 02:10:10,747
Hold your fire, rifleman,
on pain of death.

1044
02:10:10,747 --> 02:10:12,624
Go on, boys. Come.

1045
02:10:12,624 --> 02:10:14,501
A runner coming through!

1046
02:10:16,003 --> 02:10:17,671
Blucher, 11 to 12 miles, sir.

1047
02:10:18,505 --> 02:10:20,340
Attention, follow me.

1048
02:10:20,841 --> 02:10:23,385
- Blucher at 11 to 12 miles, sir.
- Jesus Christ.

1049
02:10:23,385 --> 02:10:25,554
- I want a report every hour.
- Yes, sir.

1050
02:10:28,348 --> 02:10:32,019
Runner coming through. Make way.

1051
02:10:36,606 --> 02:10:39,526
Prussians on the roadside, 12 miles.

1052
02:10:45,782 --> 02:10:49,661
Prussian troops have been sighted
on the road, sire. Twelve miles.

1053
02:10:53,290 --> 02:10:54,499
Ready the cannons.

1054
02:10:58,128 --> 02:10:59,796
Ready the cannons!

1055
02:11:02,966 --> 02:11:05,010
Go on! Move!

1056
02:11:14,436 --> 02:11:17,022
Ready! Cannons are ready!

1057
02:11:17,022 --> 02:11:18,982
Cannons are ready!

1058
02:11:18,982 --> 02:11:20,776
The rain has stopped, sir.

1059
02:11:29,701 --> 02:11:31,411
Prepare to fire!

1060
02:11:41,046 --> 02:11:43,632
- Fire!
- Fire!

1061
02:11:49,638 --> 02:11:51,181
Take cover!

1062
02:11:53,975 --> 02:11:56,311
Straight into position. Steady.

1063
02:11:56,311 --> 02:12:00,482
Prepare for the advance. Get ready.

1064
02:12:01,817 --> 02:12:03,276
Prepare for the advance.

1065
02:12:03,276 --> 02:12:05,445
Readjust to 195!

1066
02:12:05,445 --> 02:12:07,572
Adjust 195!

1067
02:12:07,572 --> 02:12:10,325
Elevation 195.

1068
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:14,496
Adjusted!

1069
02:12:16,456 --> 02:12:19,334
Prepare to fire! Fire!

1070
02:12:19,334 --> 02:12:20,961
Fire!

1071
02:12:26,049 --> 02:12:29,177
Keep your head down. Seventh, take over.

1072
02:12:38,061 --> 02:12:40,939
- Out the way!
- Hold fast, men!

1073
02:12:44,985 --> 02:12:48,488
Infantry, advance!

1074
02:12:49,322 --> 02:12:50,949
Left company!

1075
02:12:53,326 --> 02:12:54,870
And march!

1076
02:12:54,870 --> 02:12:57,039
Get in formation. Now!

1077
02:12:59,041 --> 02:13:00,167
Keep to the line!

1078
02:13:01,418 --> 02:13:02,419
Join!

1079
02:13:11,803 --> 02:13:15,891
Second wave, advance! Over the top, men!

1080
02:13:16,892 --> 02:13:18,310
Hold the line!

1081
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:20,354
Cannons!

1082
02:13:21,063 --> 02:13:22,856
Fire!

1083
02:13:26,276 --> 02:13:27,819
Get ready.

1084
02:13:28,904 --> 02:13:30,155
Hold fast.

1085
02:13:30,947 --> 02:13:32,366
Fire!

1086
02:13:41,708 --> 02:13:43,835
You there, get on that cannon.

1087
02:13:53,970 --> 02:13:55,013
Fire!

1088
02:14:01,895 --> 02:14:03,689
Fill the gap!

1089
02:14:05,524 --> 02:14:06,942
Keep the line!

1090
02:14:14,449 --> 02:14:17,077
Skirmishers, keep advancing!

1091
02:14:17,077 --> 02:14:18,495
Get in formation.

1092
02:14:18,495 --> 02:14:20,330
Fire at will.

1093
02:14:25,627 --> 02:14:27,963
Keep them back, men. Fire.

1094
02:14:31,133 --> 02:14:34,302
Go on. Don't let them rally!

1095
02:14:40,058 --> 02:14:41,268
...the strike position.

1096
02:14:41,268 --> 02:14:43,812
Get up, boys. Go on. Go on, boys.

1097
02:14:45,397 --> 02:14:46,732
Whoa.

1098
02:14:49,276 --> 02:14:52,195
Prussians, roadside, five miles.

1099
02:14:53,905 --> 02:14:55,532
Five miles, maybe less.

1100
02:14:57,534 --> 02:14:59,202
We have to act before Blucher arrives.

1101
02:14:59,870 --> 02:15:00,871
Out.

1102
02:15:03,707 --> 02:15:04,708
Out!

1103
02:15:16,970 --> 02:15:18,388
Cavalry!

1104
02:15:19,681 --> 02:15:21,475
Charge!

1105
02:15:28,482 --> 02:15:32,527
Prepare to receive cavalry.

1106
02:15:41,203 --> 02:15:45,582
We must hold our ground.
Stand fast to the last man.

1107
02:15:45,582 --> 02:15:47,918
We must not be beat!

1108
02:15:48,710 --> 02:15:50,962
Or what will they say in England?

1109
02:15:50,962 --> 02:15:54,216
- Hold the line.
- Keep it tight.

1110
02:15:58,553 --> 02:16:02,057
Steady, men. Stay in formation.

1111
02:16:05,477 --> 02:16:07,854
Long live the emperor!

1112
02:16:10,190 --> 02:16:12,109
Company, halt!

1113
02:16:12,776 --> 02:16:16,154
Form square!

1114
02:16:31,795 --> 02:16:34,381
Long live the emperor!

1115
02:16:37,467 --> 02:16:41,138
One section, fire. Two section, fire.

1116
02:16:57,529 --> 02:17:00,449
What do we do, sir?
We can't break through.

1117
02:17:00,449 --> 02:17:02,993
Keep them running.
Get in back with the square.

1118
02:17:05,704 --> 02:17:07,289
Show them your British steel.

1119
02:17:18,967 --> 02:17:20,927
Present arms!

1120
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:25,974
Shoulder, hold!

1121
02:17:30,562 --> 02:17:32,314
They're here, the Prussians.

1122
02:17:35,691 --> 02:17:37,069
First over the rise, Emperor.

1123
02:18:03,094 --> 02:18:05,180
We need to find a way through!

1124
02:18:08,016 --> 02:18:10,018
Break the square!

1125
02:18:20,654 --> 02:18:21,947
Charge bayonets.

1126
02:18:22,823 --> 02:18:24,658
Charge bayonets!

1127
02:18:26,743 --> 02:18:31,289
Your Emperor is with you.
You are the brave of Austerlitz.

1128
02:18:32,164 --> 02:18:33,709
Never surrender.

1129
02:18:34,543 --> 02:18:37,045
For homeland and glory!

1130
02:18:43,927 --> 02:18:46,680
Shoulder to shoulder! Form lines!

1131
02:18:46,680 --> 02:18:48,432
Shoulder to shoulder.

1132
02:18:55,396 --> 02:18:56,690
Infantry, advance.

1133
02:18:57,190 --> 02:18:58,859
Battalion!

1134
02:19:00,610 --> 02:19:03,030
Advance!

1135
02:19:08,701 --> 02:19:10,078
Keep the line!

1136
02:19:12,371 --> 02:19:14,583
Footmen, fire!

1137
02:19:18,503 --> 02:19:20,589
Second line, fire.

1138
02:19:24,509 --> 02:19:25,886
Prepare to charge!

1139
02:19:28,305 --> 02:19:29,681
Charge!

1140
02:19:36,521 --> 02:19:38,231
Go on! Batter them!

1141
02:19:40,650 --> 02:19:42,819
Advance!

1142
02:19:55,082 --> 02:19:56,290
Cavalry advance, sir?

1143
02:19:57,542 --> 02:19:58,834
Cavalry advance.

1144
02:19:59,419 --> 02:20:01,838
Prepare for counterattack.

1145
02:20:01,838 --> 02:20:06,677
Men, enter. Full support.

1146
02:20:41,628 --> 02:20:45,424
No. He can't help himself.

1147
02:20:46,675 --> 02:20:48,385
Sir, Blucher.

1148
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:56,101
Thank God.

1149
02:20:56,601 --> 02:21:01,565
Your Majesty!

1150
02:21:02,899 --> 02:21:05,777
Come see how masse de la France dines!

1151
02:21:05,777 --> 02:21:06,820
Yeah!

1152
02:21:34,639 --> 02:21:36,933
Yeah!

1153
02:22:11,385 --> 02:22:15,847
The battle is mine.
There will be an end to the war.

1154
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:25,315
Senior officer, on deck!

1155
02:22:27,859 --> 02:22:29,736
Good day.

1156
02:22:32,989 --> 02:22:38,370
I am the first to admit
when I make a mistake. But I never do.

1157
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:40,288
Because it is geometry.

1158
02:22:41,748 --> 02:22:44,126
I simply know
precisely where to place a cannon.

1159
02:22:45,669 --> 02:22:50,382
But tragically I cannot transfer
this knowledge to my marshals.

1160
02:22:51,466 --> 02:22:54,678
That might be
what is most difficult in life.

1161
02:22:56,638 --> 02:22:58,306
Accepting the failures of others.

1162
02:22:59,391 --> 02:23:00,642
You must not do that.

1163
02:23:03,103 --> 02:23:04,438
Encourage greatness.

1164
02:23:09,776 --> 02:23:10,902
Mind your head, sir.

1165
02:23:13,822 --> 02:23:15,574
Mind your head, sir.

1166
02:23:22,706 --> 02:23:25,792
- What are they doing there?
- Sir, it's the midshipmen. They adore him.

1167
02:23:25,792 --> 02:23:26,960
Well, get 'em out.

1168
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:28,962
Clear the room. Quickly.

1169
02:23:45,354 --> 02:23:47,397
- Your grace--
- Good morning, General.

1170
02:23:47,397 --> 02:23:48,774
These boys are delightful.

1171
02:23:50,692 --> 02:23:51,985
May I sit down?

1172
02:23:51,985 --> 02:23:53,070
Please.

1173
02:23:54,363 --> 02:23:55,655
And this breakfast.

1174
02:23:56,656 --> 02:24:01,036
Now I know why you have
such a successful navy. Thank you.

1175
02:24:06,917 --> 02:24:09,294
I've never visited
the English countryside.

1176
02:24:09,294 --> 02:24:11,254
I imagine I'll love the Cotswolds...

1177
02:24:14,716 --> 02:24:17,803
soft flowing hills, gentle light.

1178
02:24:19,763 --> 02:24:24,142
My dear sir,
it is only by a narrow margin of opinion

1179
02:24:24,142 --> 02:24:26,436
that you have been spared the fate
of being shot.

1180
02:24:28,188 --> 02:24:30,440
Politically, I'm afraid it's impossible

1181
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:33,944
for the British government
to allow you to stay in England.

1182
02:24:36,029 --> 02:24:39,074
You are permitted three officers
and 12 servants

1183
02:24:39,074 --> 02:24:41,368
to accompany you into exile.

1184
02:24:42,202 --> 02:24:45,872
Exile will be contained to the island
of Saint Helena

1185
02:24:45,872 --> 02:24:50,544
under the watchful eye
of Governor Hudson Lowe and his family.

1186
02:24:52,879 --> 02:24:53,880
Saint...

1187
02:24:55,090 --> 02:24:58,510
Helena. It's a small island.

1188
02:24:59,469 --> 02:25:00,971
More of a rock, really.

1189
02:25:02,014 --> 02:25:04,766
A thousand miles
from the mainland of Africa.

1190
02:25:05,517 --> 02:25:10,022
I'm told it's very pretty, tranquil.
You'll have time to reflect.

1191
02:25:11,732 --> 02:25:13,900
Your correspondence will be monitored,

1192
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:17,529
your presence verified twice daily
by the orderly officer.

1193
02:25:27,789 --> 02:25:31,043
Fix that rigging line. Draw up the sails.

1194
02:25:32,627 --> 02:25:33,962
Go below deck!

1195
02:25:43,096 --> 02:25:47,434
What will you do now?
I hate to see you alone.

1196
02:25:48,810 --> 02:25:53,607
Will you come to me? Will I forgive you?

1197
02:25:55,275 --> 02:25:57,694
My sweet, stubborn Emperor.

1198
02:25:58,779 --> 02:26:01,365
I let you loose and let you come to ruin.

1199
02:26:02,699 --> 02:26:05,911
Next time, I will be Emperor,

1200
02:26:05,911 --> 02:26:07,913
and you will do as I say.

1201
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:17,881
Well, you were right.

1202
02:26:19,299 --> 02:26:21,843
Every night I beg to see you in my dreams.

1203
02:26:22,761 --> 02:26:26,056
And when I do, you turn me away.

1204
02:26:58,505 --> 02:27:00,465
Girls, what's the capital of France?

1205
02:27:03,010 --> 02:27:04,011
Paris.

1206
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:05,721
And Russia?

1207
02:27:06,430 --> 02:27:08,682
Petersburg. And Moscow before.

1208
02:27:10,642 --> 02:27:15,063
Moscow.
And who burnt Moscow to the ground?

1209
02:27:19,484 --> 02:27:20,485
I don't know, sir.

1210
02:27:21,945 --> 02:27:22,946
I did.

1211
02:27:23,739 --> 02:27:27,576
I believe, sir, the Russians burnt it
to get rid of the French.

1212
02:27:28,076 --> 02:27:29,077
Who told you that?

1213
02:27:29,870 --> 02:27:31,329
It's common knowledge, sir.

1214
02:27:35,417 --> 02:27:37,711
Go. Go play.

1215
02:27:39,296 --> 02:27:40,297
En garde.

1216
02:27:43,592 --> 02:27:46,178
Can I tell you
what I have waiting for you?

1217
02:27:48,347 --> 02:27:52,559
It is a secret.
And I will show you when you arrive.

1218
02:27:56,146 --> 02:28:01,485
Come to me, Napoleon.
And let's try this again.
