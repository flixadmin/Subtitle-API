
001
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,765
Comrade-General.

002
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,994
We are close.

003
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,663
You can see.

004
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,831
You can see our progress.

005
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,375
We just need more ti...

006
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,754
You have one year.

007
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,436
Yes, Comrade-General.

008
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,101
The silver cat feeds...

009
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,146
when blue meets yellow in the west...

010
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:33,736
A trip to China sounds nice...
If you tread lightly...

011
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,904
The week is long...

012
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,240
The silver cat feeds...

013
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,050
Beautiful,

014
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,094
isn't it?
