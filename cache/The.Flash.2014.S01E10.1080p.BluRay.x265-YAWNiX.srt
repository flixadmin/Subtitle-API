1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:06,256
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,511
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,347
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,517
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,646
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:25,526
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,155
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,157
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,202
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,412
You killed my mother. Why?

11
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,832
If you wanna know that,
you're gonna have to catch me.

12
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,919
Not fast enough, Flash.

13
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:48,674
I love you, Iris.
I couldn't lie to you anymore. I'm sorry.

14
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,389
My name is Barry Allen.

15
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,350
I am not the fastest man alive.

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,562
That title belongs
to the man who killed my mother.

17
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,902
But not for long.

18
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,362
That was too close.

19
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,992
- He told me to make it hard.
- He didn't tell you to make him dead.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,580
Remember this is just supposed to be a
training exercise to improve Barry's speed.

21
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,957
Cisco, you gonna bring it or what?

22
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,752
Bring it.

23
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,689
Why isn't he running away?

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,694
Barry, run away.

25
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:25,187
Very impressive, Mr. Allen. Your reaction to
stimuli at super speed continues to improve.

26
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,731
- It's still not enough.
- It will be.

27
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,900
Keep working like you are.
Stay focused.

28
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,070
You will be ready next time
your man in the yellow suit comes.

29
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,864
I think you mean the Reverse-Flash.

30
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,534
What? He said it, not me.

31
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:45,916
And he's right. Yellow suit, red
lightning, and evil. The reverse of Barry.

32
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,085
- Meh.
- Actually, I kind of like it.

33
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,046
I'm so ready for another round.
How many drones do you have?

34
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,384
Two, and they've got lasers.

35
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,053
No.

36
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,248
Told you it would break.

37
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,583
And the shrink says I'm crazy.

38
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,796
- What is this place?
- Customs warehouse.

39
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,757
Imported cars from Europe.

40
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,342
All worth a fortune.

41
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:42,013
Question. How do you suggest
you and I drive all these cars out of here?

42
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,475
We're not. We're not stealing anything.

43
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,353
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,565
Our entrance set off the silent alarms.

45
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:58,822
The cops will be arriving
in two minutes and 14 seconds.

46
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,866
Bring them.

47
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,705
That's not for the cops...

48
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,749
as we discussed.

49
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,420
He'll be here.

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,015
You do hear that, right?

51
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,976
He's not coming.

52
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,146
We're leaving.

53
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,942
- This better make sense real fast, buddy.
- It will. Let's go.

54
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,659
- You promised I'd get to do my thing.
- I always keep my promises.

55
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,036
Seatbelt.

56
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:01,051
- Are you sure nothing's missing?
- That's what the supervisor said.

57
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,887
I can check again.

58
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,519
- Bar.
- Hey.

59
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,687
Uh, well...

60
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,357
the breakage indicates
that the door somehow...

61
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,276
had zero viscoelasticity
when it hit the ground.

62
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,153
What does that mean
to normal people?

63
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,990
Sorry. Uh, the steel shattered like glass.

64
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,127
It was frozen, Joe.

65
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,048
- Snart.
- He's back.

66
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,093
I thought Snart was some world-class thief.

67
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:48,223
All these expensive cars, he didn't take
any of them? Doesn't make sense.

68
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,685
- Eddie, put out an APB on Snart.
- Got it.

69
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,482
Snart wasn't here to steal anything.

70
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,609
- He was setting a trap.
- For me.

71
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,987
- And by me, I mean...
- I know what you meant.

72
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,912
God, you're beautiful.

73
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,832
Mick.

74
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,170
This is a joke. How do you know
this Flash didn't skip town, hm?

75
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,299
Maybe that's why he didn't show up.
Or maybe he's dead.

76
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,634
Or maybe someone
smarter than you iced him.

77
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,928
He's not dead and he didn't leave town.

78
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,932
You will tell me what we're stealing
this time? We are partners, after all.

79
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,686
This is what we came for.

80
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,858
That's worth money?

81
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,653
It's called Fire & Ice.
An abstract modern-day masterpiece...

82
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,156
said to represent
the dichotomy of being.

83
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,911
It represents to me that people
with lots of money buy dumb stuff.

84
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,623
Osgood and Rachel Rathaway, one
of the richest couples in Central City...

85
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,542
paid 25 million for it in Paris.

86
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,921
They're flying home with it today.

87
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,757
Mm.

88
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,508
Captain Cold is back.

89
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,303
For a non-metahuman,
Leonard Snart is quite the nemesis.

90
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,390
He still has the cold gun,
the one he stole from us. The one I built.

91
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,225
What does he want this time?

92
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,895
The Flash.

93
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,940
If Snart wants a fight,
then I'll give him one.

94
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,109
- Well...
- You don't think I should?

95
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:28,615
I didn't say that. But, Barry, as fast as
you are, you cannot be everywhere at once.

96
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:33,203
And it becomes then a question of priorities.
In the last month, you have made...

97
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,040
a commitment to increasing your speed,
enhancing your reflexes.

98
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,250
It's working. You're getting faster.

99
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,004
Okay, but what am I supposed to do?
Just ignore Snart?

100
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,551
The last time you had a fight with Snart,
a train derailed.

101
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,304
You were lucky to get
all those people to safety.

102
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,266
- Now, if you don't give him that fight...
- He may just back off.

103
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,560
And there'll be no casualties.

104
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,940
Look, Barry, Cisco and I
will work with Joe and the police...

105
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,275
and devise a way to catch Cold.

106
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,195
Yes, I said it. Soon as it came
out of my mouth, I heard it.

107
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,906
We can come up with ways
to neutralize Snart.

108
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,284
Listen, Barry,
whether or not you go after Snart...

109
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,498
that's your choice. We here,
we will do whatever we can to support you.

110
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,918
But after this past Christmas...

111
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,714
after the events with
the Reverse-Flash...

112
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,677
I just think he poses
a greater threat to all of us.

113
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,266
Okay.

114
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,729
T-minus three days and counting.

115
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,358
Until the big move-in.
You know, I've never had a roommate.

116
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,944
But it did occur to me
if we ever get in a fight...

117
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:52,407
I can't just storm away and go home
because home will be with you.

118
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,368
- Are you predicting many arguments?
- Have you met me?

119
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:01,166
I remember the night we met.
I stopped a mugger who stole your bag.

120
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,418
My hero.

121
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,007
Hey.

122
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,633
Hey.

123
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,011
Eddie, you know where Joe is?

124
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:17,849
- Uh, I think he's upstairs in your lab.
- Okay. Thanks.

125
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,982
No second thoughts
about moving in together?

126
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,278
None.

127
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,618
- Joe, hey.
- Hey, I'm glad you're back.

128
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,872
- I've been going over Snart's file.
- Yeah. I need to talk to you.

129
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,293
Um, as CSI, my work on this case is done.

130
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,170
And as...

131
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:51,174
the Flash, I don't think
I can focus on Snart right now.

132
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,553
Mind telling me
what brought about this change?

133
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,974
This man in yellow,
the man that killed my mom...

134
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:05,522
he's still out there. I have to be ready to
face him, which means amping up my speed.

135
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,774
It's a question of priorities.

136
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,194
Your mom's Killer isn't the only reason
you've been doing this.

137
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,532
You told me if you could use your powers
to save someone, you would.

138
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,661
Look, Dr. Wells and S.T.A.R. Labs
are gonna work with you.

139
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,039
Cisco thinks he has a way to protect
the police against Snart's cold gun.

140
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,625
I understand if you're scared.
We talked about this.

141
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,002
Of course I'm scared, Joe.

142
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:33,049
This guy could run into the precinct and
kill everyone in seconds. He threatened Iris.

143
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,594
I won't let him hurt
the most important people in my life again.

144
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:41,266
If that means devoting every second I have
outside this place to getting faster...

145
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,103
and stopping him, that's what
I'm gonna do. I've made up my mind.

146
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,994
Aw.

147
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,372
McSnurtle the turtle. How you been?

148
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,584
When did you stop sleeping with this?
He was your favorite.

149
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,087
He was. But if I remember correctly,
you took him away from me...

150
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:15,300
after I broke your
Duke Ellington Live at the Blue Note vinyl.

151
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,635
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

152
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,265
- You can have him back.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

153
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,309
Heh.

154
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,936
Oh, Dad.

155
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,731
I'm gonna miss you, baby.

156
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,443
- Dad, I'm only 10 minutes away.
- I know.

157
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,363
Ah, don't you worry about me.
I'll be fine. Just like always.

158
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,867
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,744
Came to help her pack?

160
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:47,790
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Iris said that she had something for me?

161
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,709
Oh. Ahem.

162
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,962
I found this in my closet. Heh.

163
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,716
I haven't seen this in years.

164
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,970
Well, the nerd
survival kit is still intact.

165
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,306
Wow.

166
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,352
Heh. I thought those
might be worth something.

167
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,484
Uh, I am so late for work.

168
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,782
I promise I'll clean
this up when I get back.

169
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,911
- Bye.
- Bye. Yeah. Heh.

170
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,457
Okay.

171
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,834
You mind telling me
what's going on with you and Iris?

172
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,672
- Nothing.
- Hm.

173
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,549
That's funny because I have
these two things called eyes...

174
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,219
and it doesn't look
like you two are fine.

175
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,137
I told Iris.

176
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,515
You told Iris you're the Flash?

177
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,351
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

178
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,400
I told her how I felt about her.

179
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,902
- Oh, God.
- Mm-hm.

180
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,362
What'd she say?

181
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,992
Well, I mean, she's still
moving in with Eddie, isn't she?

182
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,664
I just wanna pretend like it never even
happened. That's what we're both doing, so...

183
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:14,502
Well, not saying how you feel is what
got you in this mess in the first place.

184
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,924
Speaking of which, we both know she's
not gonna clean this mess up anytime soon.

185
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,135
No.

186
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,682
Sure.

187
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:42,071
Uh, excuse me. If I could have
everybody's attention, please.

188
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,116
You have our attention, Mr. Ramon.

189
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,369
Okay, check it.

190
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:52,582
So Dr. Wells and I,
we took your ballistic shields and...

191
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,962
And we lined them with a pretty sweet
compacted heating ribbon...

192
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,548
designed to repel temperature attacks...

193
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:05,094
especially those reaching absolute zero,
like Captain Cold's gun.

194
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,056
That's supposed to keep us
from getting turned into popsicles?

195
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,224
Um, yeah. Yeah, they will.

196
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,312
How are we supposed to trust anything from
S.T.A.R. Labs after you nuked the city?

197
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,692
You're right.

198
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,986
You're right.
You shouldn't trust us.

199
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,491
What happened a year ago,
that was our fault.

200
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,995
And we can't change the past,
as much as we wish we could.

201
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,334
But tomorrow is a different story.
Tomorrow's a different thing.

202
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,879
We just want the chance
to make things better.

203
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,465
Observe.

204
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,997
Dummies are one thing...

205
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,792
my officers are another.

206
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,133
You seem pleased with yourself, doctor.

207
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,803
Well, I'm just happy
to help the police catch Snart, Joe.

208
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:33,349
- Barry might be able to help too.
- I think Cisco's heat shields are up to the task.

209
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,437
Joe, if Barry feels he's gonna
endanger lives by taking on Snart...

210
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:42,191
and feels he's gonna save lives
by training to take on the man in yellow...

211
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,819
that's his call.

212
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,156
You know what makes Barry so special?

213
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:52,577
He wants to help everyone he can,
however he can.

214
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,455
Always has. Until now.

215
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,249
I guess it's just a question
of priorities, then.

216
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,880
You know,
Barry said the exact same thing to me.

217
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,759
I thought, "Doesn't sound like him."
I guess because it sounds like you.

218
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,314
- Hey.
- Aah!

219
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,274
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

220
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,402
- It's okay. I was just kind of focused.
- Gotcha.

221
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,779
What's Firestorm?

222
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,783
One of the last things Ronnie
said to me before he flew away.

223
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:37,413
My dead fiancé can fly.
Haven't broke that to my parents yet.

224
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,501
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I just...

225
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,629
I told Iris how I felt about her.

226
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,342
- Bold choice.
- I knew where we stood before.

227
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,722
We're best friends and, I don't know, now I
just don't know what's normal for us anymore.

228
00:16:55,348 --> 00:17:00,728
Before I met Ronnie, I knew exactly what
was going to happen every day of my life.

229
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,189
It was predictable. I like predictable.

230
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:08,694
But when Ronnie and I started dating,
everything started to change.

231
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:14,158
He made me try Indian food
and scuba diving.

232
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,539
At first it was scary,
but then it was better.

233
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:26,170
Things weren't really normal with you pining
after Iris and her being totally unaware.

234
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,757
Whatever happens next, it will be better.

235
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,056
Wait, Caitlin.

236
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,767
- Scuba.
- What about it?

237
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,646
"Self-contained underwater
breathing apparatus.” It's an acronym.

238
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,691
What if Firestorm isn't a word?

239
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,865
"Fusion ignition research
experiment and science...

240
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,536
of transmutation originating
RNA and molecular structures."

241
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,708
It's 800 pages.

242
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,639
There's a lot of stuff in there, but it
mostly focuses on transmutation, which is...

243
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,476
the process of altering the structure
of an element by unzipping atoms...

244
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,438
And rebuilding it to create
an entirely new element.

245
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,941
Yeah. Well, the article
was co-written by Jason Rusch...

246
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,862
a grad student here at Hudson University.
If anybody knows what happened to Ronnie...

247
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,697
Maybe he does.

248
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,949
- Maybe.
- Thanks.

249
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,335
- Pleasant flight, Mrs. Rathaway?
- Yes, quite. Thank you.

250
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,088
Careful, please. It's worth a fortune.

251
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,966
- Welcome home, Mr. Rathaway.
- Thank you, Ethan.

252
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,308
Sir, your son, Hartley, he called again.

253
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,685
We don't have a son anymore.

254
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,233
Someone better call 911.

255
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,204
Move! Move!

256
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,081
Snart, freeze.

257
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,840
Mick.

258
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,009
- Aah!
- What the hell?

259
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,553
Why do they call you people "the heat"?

260
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,931
I'm the heat.

261
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,310
Forget them, Mick.

262
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,022
- Get ready for him.
- It's beautiful.

263
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,233
Mick.

264
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,693
Mick.

265
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,028
Mick.

266
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,907
We go. Now.

267
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,799
Is he all right?

268
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,928
Okay.

269
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,806
- Hey. Hey, are you okay?
- I'll call you back.

270
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,183
I'm fine.

271
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:32,189
Snart's new partner,
he's got this handheld flamethrower.

272
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,527
Almost everyone was treated on the scene,
but we got two in the Burn Unit though.

273
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,573
- I'm sorry. I should've listened to you.
- It's all good.

274
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:46,036
Next time Snart and his pyro pal show up, you
make them sorry they ever messed with you.

275
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,540
I gotta call the hospital.

276
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:58,007
The cop's bullet ruptured
the secondary internal fuel chamber.

277
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:03,053
Could have been worse. You were right to get me
to learn every part and circuit of this thing.

278
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,056
Repairing it was a snap.

279
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,268
Give me one reason
I don't kill you right now.

280
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,646
It's gonna be hard to find someone else
to listen to your speeches.

281
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:17,026
You lost it out there just like the last
job. You lost focus, became obsessed.

282
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,821
I'm obsessed? What about you?
You're usually counting the seconds.

283
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:25,242
Got the whole thing planned out.
Dotting T's, crossing I's.

284
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,495
But all you care about now is the Flash.

285
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,455
- We have to put him down.
- Why?

286
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,793
We got the finger painting. It's worth
millions. It's ours. We're rich. Job done.

287
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,545
What about the next job?
And the job after that?

288
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,883
With weapons like these, no one can
stand against us. No one except the Flash.

289
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,559
If you want out, take the painting and go.

290
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:58,150
But if you want Central City to be our home,
where we can do and take whatever we want...

291
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,778
this is our chance.

292
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,323
Your chance.

293
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,909
Mm.

294
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,043
Very motivational. How do we get him?

295
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,713
The Flash isn't so different from us.

296
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,259
- He's got partners too.
- Hm.

297
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,477
- Jason Rusch?
- Yes. Uh, Dr. Snow?

298
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,605
Please, call me Caitlin.
Uh, thank you for meeting me.

299
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,442
Happy to. Although to be totally upfront,
if this is about the résumé...

300
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,154
I mailed to S.T.A.R. Labs,
I've accepted a position at Mercury Labs.

301
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,118
Uh, no, actually.
I wanted to talk to you about FIRESTORM.

302
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,541
I'm sorry. Uh, this was a mistake.
I have to go.

303
00:22:55,749 --> 00:23:00,045
No. Look, someone I care about is in trouble,
and you're the only clue I have to help him.

304
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,257
Please.

305
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:12,099
What's the line? I never got paranoid
until they started plotting against me?

306
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,852
Why would they be plotting against you?

307
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,479
Because of our work.
Because of FIRESTORM.

308
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:21,692
Transmutation. The ability to
alter matter on a molecular level.

309
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,153
We had rudimentary success
with our stage one testing...

310
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,323
working with sand grains.
But Professor Stein said...

311
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,827
Sorry. Professor Martin Stein?
He was the co-author of the paper?

312
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:37,166
Yeah, he was our team leader. He didn't believe
in baby steps, so we skipped to stage three.

313
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,500
Which was?

314
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,129
We melted a concrete wall.

315
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,757
But the university
threatened to shut us down...

316
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:50,137
So Professor Stein published his paper
without permission. They went nuts.

317
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,932
He talked to a friend of his
to secure private backing.

318
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,685
- And who was that?
- He didn't say. He just said he'd call me later.

319
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,772
And no one has seen or heard
from Professor Stein since.

320
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,067
What do you think happened to him?

321
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,947
All I know is that the Army showed up the
next day and confiscated all of our research.

322
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,952
So tell me, Dr. Snow,
do you think I'm being too paranoid...

323
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,787
or not paranoid enough?

324
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,023
Car trouble?

325
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,669
I hope we're not enemies.

326
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,423
What? No, of course not.

327
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,467
I thought you might blame me.

328
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,264
For pushing you to pursue your training
rather than help the police.

329
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,017
Look, I'm an adult.

330
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,020
I make my own choices, my own mistakes.

331
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,940
And I'm glad you push me to be better.

332
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,447
It's so weird.
There was a time in my life that...

333
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:36,702
I would have paid money
for your autograph. And now we're...

334
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,620
Partners.

335
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,250
I was gonna say friends.

336
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:49,214
In case you doubt it,
you push me to be better too.

337
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:55,054
Guys, you have to come look at this.

338
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,766
When the heat gun was fired,
it increased the surrounding temperature...

339
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,770
of the air dramatically.
Sort of like an extreme heat wave.

340
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,813
- Heat Wave.
- Stop doing that.

341
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:09,109
Okay. I measured the temperature output
of both the cold and heat guns, right?

342
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,112
And while the cold gun
achieves absolute zero...

343
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:16,700
the heat gun reaches absolute hot, or the
hottest temperature an object can reach.

344
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,994
Planck temperature.

345
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,372
So potentially, these two guns
could cancel each other out.

346
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,667
Yeah, but to do that,
you'd have to make them cross streams.

347
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,544
You mean like Ghostbusters?

348
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,047
That film is surprisingly
scientifically accurate.

349
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,633
And really quite funny.

350
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,885
Hey, Joe. What's up?

351
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,778
- Joe. Anything?
- There's no sign of Caitlin.

352
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,614
Oh, my God.

353
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:02,037
- We're getting her back. We have to find Snart.
- Damn right we do.

354
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,705
Come on, let's go.

355
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,338
Joe. Joe. We got a hit.

356
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,383
Second pair of prints.
They belong to a Mick Rory.

357
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,218
- Who is he?
- Big-time arsonist.

358
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,929
He and Snart worked a job last year
that went bad.

359
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,391
Half of Rory's body was burned
in a fire that got out of control.

360
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,936
He escaped from an ambulance.
Hasn't been seen since.

361
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,856
Why would they kidnap
someone like Caitlin?

362
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,275
Joe. Thawne. It's on every station.

363
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,904
Greetings, citizens of Central City.

364
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:40,033
I am Leonard Snart,
but you can call me Cold.

365
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,287
I'm gonna make this
very simple for everyone.

366
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,623
That red streak
you've been hearing whispers about.

367
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,919
The one mysteriously saving people
these past few months?

368
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,965
Well, surprise, he's real.

369
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,427
He calls himself the Flash.

370
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,015
Porter and Maine. Tonight. Sundown.

371
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:10,272
Come out, come out, wherever you are,
Flash. Show the whole world you're real.

372
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,692
Or this woman dies.

373
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,987
No, don't come for me. Stay away.
He'll hurt...

374
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,792
You're a friend of his, huh? He's fast.

375
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,794
Like fire.

376
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,006
Fire, it's undefinable.

377
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,841
Heat, light, energy.

378
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,262
It's an evolution when things burn.

379
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,014
You're sick.

380
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,310
Maybe you're the sick ones.
You ever think about that?

381
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,812
- Not really.
- Mm.

382
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,149
You've got third-degree burns.

383
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,276
Why didn't you get skin grafts?

384
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,615
The fire revealed my true self.
It showed me who I really am.

385
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:06,703
I wonder what your Flash will reveal
when I burn his suit and skin off?

386
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,958
Do whatever you want to me,
but leave him alone.

387
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,167
Ooh.

388
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,127
Okay.

389
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:19,216
You and this Flash must be really close
if you're willing to die for him, hm?

390
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,555
You want me to show you who you really are?
That'd be fun. Hm?

391
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,018
Show you who you really are.

392
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,728
Mick.

393
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,314
Time to go.

394
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,905
You better pray the next people
that come through this door is us.

395
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,753
- Hey.
- Okay. You're on.

396
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,798
- Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

397
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:04,177
Barry, after tonight, everyone's
gonna know that the Flash exists.

398
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,430
Are you ready for that?

399
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,808
I'll see you soon.

400
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,427
Did you see that? That was him.

401
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,846
- That was the Flash.
- I don't believe it.

402
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,187
Believe it.

403
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,981
The scarlet speedster.

404
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,318
Any preference on how you'd like to die?

405
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,072
The flame? Or the frost?

406
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:10,494
Not in the mood for chitchat.
Gotcha. Ready when you are.

407
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,508
Cover me.

408
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,430
Run on this.

409
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:43,276
Barry? Barry, are you okay?
You know what you have to do.

410
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:47,155
Yeah. Get them to cross beams
and cancel their guns out. I know.

411
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,657
Mick.

412
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,494
Ah! Gotcha.

413
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:02,712
Yeah, not as easy as it sounds.

414
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,511
- Eddie. Eddie.
- Iris, what are you doing here?

415
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,140
- They evacuated Jitters. I saw your car.
- You can't be here. It's not safe.

416
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,982
Are you sure Caitlin's here, Cisco?

417
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:27,654
From Caitlin's car, I pieced together
surveillance footage that lead us to this area.

418
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,573
But there's over a dozen warehouses.

419
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:33,285
But only one of them has had
the heat on the last three nights.

420
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,579
And I'm betting Mick Rory likes it hot.

421
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,497
Okay.

422
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,291
Stay behind me.

423
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,801
- Caitlin.
- Mm?

424
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,596
- Caitlin, is that you?
- Mm-mm.

425
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,642
Caitlin, we're gonna get you out of here.

426
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,770
Cisco. Cisco, down!

427
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:15,869
The fight is spreading beyond the evac
area. We need to expand the perimeter.

428
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,874
We can't. We can't let this spread.

429
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,968
Oh, my God.

430
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,180
- Thawne, where you going?
- Eddie.

431
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,152
I thought I was gonna die.

432
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,406
Not while I'm around. Or him.

433
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,339
Hold on!

434
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,717
I got this. Go, go, go!

435
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,563
I can't get them to cross streams.
Speed isn't getting it done.

436
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,356
You're right.

437
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,608
Maybe the way to do this
is not by going faster.

438
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,196
- It's going slower.
- Yes.

439
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,407
Okay.

440
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,581
Thanks for playing, kid.

441
00:34:42,605 --> 00:34:50,605
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

442
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,577
I didn't see that coming.

443
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,747
Mm, I guess you win this time.

444
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,290
There won't be a next time.

445
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,921
Thank you, detective.

446
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:47,854
We'll burn every last one of you pigs!
Get your hands off me!

447
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,439
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

448
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,234
Yeah!

449
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,574
- Your partner's a real hot head.
- That's funny.

450
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,285
You know what's hilarious, Snart?
We got you.

451
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:06,122
- Congratulations.
- Get him out of here.

452
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,588
- Nice work, Eddie.
- It wasn't me.

453
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,256
It was the Flash.

454
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:20,303
We're not gonna be needing these for trial.
You'll make sure...

455
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,390
They'll never hurt anyone ever again.

456
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,231
Mr. Ramon.

457
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,193
Thank you.

458
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,034
He was like a lightning bolt through the
streets. He took them both out singlehandedly.

459
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,745
- That's amazing.
- Wonder who he is?

460
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,373
You ask me, he's a hero.

461
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,295
Okay. All right.

462
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,964
I think that's it.

463
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,299
This better be it.

464
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:02,011
Well, like you said, I'll be 10 minutes
away, so if you forget something...

465
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,097
Okay.

466
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,852
Dad... Heh.

467
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,774
I can't say it enough. I'll miss you.

468
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,654
You know you can come around any time, Joe.

469
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,489
- Just give us a heads-up.
- Heh.

470
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,200
Or not.

471
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,953
Come around whenever. You want a key?

472
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,959
I'm gonna go...

473
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,464
wait in the truck.

474
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,516
Why don't I give you two a minute?

475
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,609
Well...

476
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,862
I know things have been
really weird between us recently.

477
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,073
Yeah, they have.

478
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,537
Did you know I can see into the future?

479
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,957
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Did I forget to tell you that?

480
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,709
You did not mention it, no.

481
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,878
- Wow.
- Ha-ha.

482
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,464
So, what do you see?

483
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:27,013
I see you and Eddie
being really happy together.

484
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,934
And things aren't weird
between us anymore.

485
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:35,396
Took a little time,
but everything's back to normal...

486
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,024
and we're still best friends.

487
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,487
The future doesn't sound so bad.

488
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,282
No. And it'll be here
faster than you think.

489
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,120
The Patriots continue their...

490
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,374
Dad, um, is it okay if I...?

491
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,627
Oh. Yeah.

492
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,429
My baby girl.

493
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,356
- Bye.
- See you.

494
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,490
Well...

495
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,914
You okay?

496
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,708
Mm-hm.

497
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,587
- How about you?
- It was bound to happen sometime, right?

498
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,380
Mm-hm.

499
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,341
Want to order pizza
and watch the ball game?

500
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,926
Make it pizzas, and you're on.

501
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,849
If you ever need somebody
to come and eat your food, I'm there.

502
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,728
Besides, the laundry machines in my
building have been broken for a month.

503
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,647
I don't know why you moved
into that death trap in the first place.

504
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,025
You've got a perfectly good room here.

505
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,987
- You said you were turning it into a gym.
- We both know I'm not turning it into a gym.

506
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,451
Besides, you've got me
running around enough as it is.

507
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:18,958
It is getting hard to hide the blasting in
and out of my apartment from my neighbors.

508
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,505
I suppose it would make sense
for me to move back in.

509
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,592
I am a millennial. That is what we do.

510
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,763
Don't do it on my account.
I'll be fine on my own.

511
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,141
Oh, yeah. Me too. For sure.

512
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,858
All right, roomie.
You order the pizzas, I'll unpack.

513
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,152
Heh-heh. No way.

514
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,073
I wanna help you. I wanna enjoy this.

515
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,242
All right.

516
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,873
You know this does nothing to me.

517
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,917
- Just drink it.
- Mm-hm.

518
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:11,135
I should have burned the entire city
block down, but instead, I listened to you.

519
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,557
We had the painting. We had the guns.
We could have had everything.

520
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,060
But you had your stupid plan.

521
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,522
How's that stupid plan
working out for us now?

522
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:29,195
Everyone's seen the Flash now.
This changes things, again.

523
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,243
What the...?

524
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,288
- Snart.
- Relax, Mick.

525
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,457
What's going on?

526
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,419
The plan.

527
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,883
Hey, sis.

528
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,512
Nice.

529
00:41:54,536 --> 00:42:02,536
