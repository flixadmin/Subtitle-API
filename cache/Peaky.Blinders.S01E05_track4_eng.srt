1
00:00:02,481 --> 00:00:06,041
People keep asking me questions
that I don't know the answer to.

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,881
It's us that has the machine guns now.

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,401
And it's them that's in the mud.

4
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:14,121
Guns, Mr Shelby.

5
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:15,761
We'd pay good money.

6
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,561
- For who do you speak?
- The Irish Republican Army.

7
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,121
What are you? Copper?

8
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:27,721
You went after him because he was IRA.

9
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:30,161
I followed him because I thought
he might have information.

10
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:34,121
<i>CAMPBELL". The difficulty
with undercover work, Grace,</i>

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,241
<i>is to remember what you are.</i>

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,801
Your sister's in there giving birth,
there's one man should be here.

13
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:41,881
You're right, Pol.

14
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:43,921
On my oath. Tell Freddie it's safe.

15
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:47,481
Welcome to the world, son.

16
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:50,521
- Freddie!
- Ada!

17
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,241
Polly! Polly!

18
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:53,801
The police came
and took his father away!

19
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:56,641
You liar!

20
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:25,841
<i># Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the track</i>

21
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:31,561
<i># Where the viaduct looms
like a bird of doom</i>

22
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:34,721
<i># As it shifts and cracks</i>

23
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:40,121
<i># Where secrets lie in the border fires</i>

24
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,121
<i># In the humming wires</i>

25
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:45,441
<i># Hey man, you know
you're never coming back</i>

26
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:47,521
<i># Past the square, past the bridge</i>

27
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:50,481
<i># Past the mills, past the stacks</i>

28
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:57,081
<i># On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man</i>

29
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:01,241
<i># In a dusty black coat with
a red right hand #</i>

30
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,721
Open up, love.

31
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,881
I brought more things
for you and the baby.

32
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:33,081
Got some fresh eggs and bread.

33
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,761
Shh...

34
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:36,161
I'll leave it here.

35
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,841
Ada, think of the little one.

36
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,481
Babies don't have principles.

37
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,841
Did you speak to her?

38
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,881
She didn't speak back.

39
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,481
Did you tell her?

40
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:25,281
I'll only tell her
what I know to be true.

41
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,121
It's the last time
I'm going to say this.

42
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,961
It wasn't me who shot Freddie Thorne.

43
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:36,641
Tommy,

44
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:39,441
I'd ask you to swear on the Bible

45
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,201
but you can't swear on that, can you?

46
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:43,841
Nothing you hold sacred.

47
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,601
There's tea.

48
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,081
A new system.

49
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:05,561
Everything in the diary, eh?

50
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,081
Mmm-hmm.

51
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:13,281
Black star.

52
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,841
What does that mean?

53
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,321
Black star day...

54
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:20,201
is the day we take out Billy Kimber
and his men.

55
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:22,761
No one knows this.

56
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,521
Not even your family?

57
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:28,201
Grace...

58
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,681
Everyone in my family hates me.

59
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,161
Why would I tell them?

60
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:39,281
He's off the bloody rails
is what he is.

61
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,481
If he'll turn nose on his best mate.

62
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:45,241
Bloody neighbours, john.
Snitch behind the curtain.

63
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:49,321
Yeah, well, if you think that,
you're the only one who does.

64
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:51,161
Look at this. Look.

65
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,921
Bloody rakin' it in!

66
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,441
Who's running this carny?

67
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:57,841
Name of Marsden. Intends on wintering
in Small Heath at this ring.

68
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,521
- Does he?
- Only heard.

69
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:04,601
Nobody in Small Heath craps in a pot
without the decree of Tommy Almighty.

70
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,641
Mr Marsden, I believe!

71
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:08,281
The ring master!

72
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:10,081
Proud I am to say so.

73
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:12,161
Yeah, well, these here
are civilised parts.

74
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:16,121
Man wants to set his stall up
with fellas lampin' each other.

75
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:18,001
He needs himself a license.

76
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:19,281
A license?

77
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:21,601
For a fee.

78
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:23,961
From those in charge.

79
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:26,801
I'll tell you what.

80
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:30,561
How about I keep my money and you
shove a license up your arse crack?

81
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,601
You don't want to speak to me like that.

82
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,041
And who the bloody hell
do you think you are?

83
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,161
My name...

84
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:37,241
is Arthur Shelby!

85
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:40,201
Dad?

86
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:47,841
Jesus.

87
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:54,641
Thank you. You're a good boy.

88
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,801
Bless the father for these bounties
we're about to receive...

89
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:02,361
Jesus Christ.

90
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,601
Please, woman.

91
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,681
Let me be.

92
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:08,001
Finish your sandwich
and sling your hook.

93
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:13,881
Polly Anna, I'm a guest
of the head of this family.

94
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,161
So why don't you maybe tend to your
mangle or your scuttle?

95
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,721
The head of the family ain't here.

96
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:24,521
Tommy, Uh.

97
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:26,681
Sometimes helps me with, uh,

98
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,921
with business.

99
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,441
Aye, well, speak of the devil.

100
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,881
How are you, son?

101
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:39,761
Get out.

102
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:41,841
Come on, son.

103
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:44,241
I'm a changed man.

104
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,961
This family needed you 10 years ago.

105
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,121
And you walked out on us.

106
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:51,721
Not now.

107
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,041
Get out of this house.

108
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,321
- Tommy, he's different.
- Shut up.

109
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:00,161
It's all right, son.

110
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,081
Arthur Shelby...

111
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,961
never stays where he's not welcome.

112
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,641
Quite something you've become.

113
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,521
Bye,son.

114
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,641
He's our dad.

115
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,641
He's a selfish bastard.

116
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:41,521
You calling someone a selfish bastard?

117
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:45,241
It's a bit rich, Tommy.

118
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,601
I mean, thanks to you,

119
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,721
we're already down a bloody sister.

120
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,121
You want to see him, Arthur?

121
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:54,601
You want to see him?

122
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,641
You go with him.

123
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,281
Grace.

124
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,681
I'm taking five pounds
from petty cash, all right?

125
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,681
We don't have five pounds
in petty cash.

126
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,521
Then I'll take what we've got.

127
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:36,241
Count it and leave a receipt.

128
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:41,561
Arthur, there are things in these books
I don't understand.

129
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:42,801
Likewise.

130
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:46,561
Every week we pay one pound,
ten shilling by postal order

131
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,361
to a Daniel Owen

132
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,761
-in London.
- Danny Whizz-Bang.

133
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,761
Hangs around in the pubs
in Camden Town Wharf for us.

134
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:57,081
Keeps his ears open for business.
He's a good man.

135
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,601
I thought Danny Whizz-Bang was dead?

136
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,521
Then you thought wrong, didn't you?

137
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:02,761
But I've seen his grave. He was shot.

138
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,921
That was a show to satisfy the wops.

139
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,801
Tommy just shot
some sheep's brains at him.

140
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,641
Who's buried in his grave?

141
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,761
Now look, Grace.

142
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,721
You know what's good for you.

143
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:23,241
You don't ask questions about things
that don't concern you.

144
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,681
Never, right?

145
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:27,841
That's for you.

146
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,681
Don't tell Tommy I took this.

147
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,521
The boy needs a good hiding
if you ask me.

148
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,841
Yeah, well, I'm this close
to giving him one.

149
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,201
John and Ada too, sounds like.

150
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,481
Nah,john moans on bloody principle.

151
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,641
But if you saw his missus...

152
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:14,201
Ah...

153
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,761
You have a girl yourself, son?

154
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,681
Perhaps when it suits, Tommy, eh?

155
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,081
Yeah, well.

156
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,321
He's been different.

157
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:29,841
- You know, since the war.
- Yeah, well...

158
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,481
A war can change a man.

159
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,041
Speaking for myself, anyways.

160
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:36,201
Where did you fight, Dad?

161
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,081
Ah, all over, son.

162
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:41,881
- All over.
- Yea h, all over.

163
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:44,361
And the salvation of jesus Christ

164
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:47,441
spread his light over me.

165
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,121
And as a pilgrim,

166
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,841
I come to visit a new world.

167
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,441
America.

168
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,081
Where I beheld the future.

169
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,041
Casinos.

170
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,961
Money factories, son.

171
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,481
Look, I've been studying
the competition.

172
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,081
Their schemes,

173
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:09,801
their systems.

174
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,001
- Look at that. It's all there.
- Show me.

175
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:15,481
There's a fortune to be made here.

176
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:19,761
I'm an old man and my
heart's a battered vessel.

177
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:21,441
But within,

178
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:26,081
there still beats a fluttering
pulse of a dream.

179
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:29,801
The Shelby...

180
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:32,201
Casino and Hotel.

181
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:36,121
Gents and dames will come flocking
from all corners.

182
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:40,641
New York, Chicago, Boston,

183
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:41,881
to the Shelby.

184
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:46,321
Where I can stand proudly with
my dear children by my side.

185
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:48,841
And the women there?

186
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,521
Like fresh peaches.

187
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,521
Thou could have a dozen.

188
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:59,281
We'd all of us be kings.

189
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:01,921
How much? How much to get started?

190
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,201
The oak needs but an acorn.

191
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:08,481
Let's do it.

192
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:11,841
Let's do it. Let's bloody do it.

193
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:15,681
It would make my heart beam, but
I don't want to cause any discord

194
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:19,481
between the brothers. So please,
why don't you talk to Tommy first?

195
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,881
No, now, I'm sick of taking
orders from him.

196
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,681
Tommy's not the only one in the
family with a head for business.

197
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:28,881
And Shelby money

198
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,761
is Shelby money.

199
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:35,921
I thank God for my wonderful sons.

200
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,841
This is cause for a celebration.

201
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:41,761
<i>- Yea</i> h .
<i>- Slainte.</i>

202
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:43,201
<i>Slainte.</i>

203
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,241
On your feet, soldier.

204
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,601
On your feet.

205
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:02,681
Look, I don't wanna fight you, Dad.

206
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,041
Come on, boy!

207
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:05,881
I'm old enough to be your father.

208
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:16,601
On your feet!

209
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,121
Get up!

210
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:21,201
All right!

211
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,801
Is that all you got, boy?

212
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:42,481
Get up!

213
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:54,961
This here...

214
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:57,361
is Arthur Shelby junior!

215
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:58,761
My son!

216
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:01,601
I love him and I'm proud of him!

217
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,481
And he can fight any
one of youse in here!

218
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:14,001
You did good, son.

219
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:15,441
You did good.

220
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:17,161
I love you, Dad.

221
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:20,041
I love you!

222
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:38,841
Mr Shelby?

223
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:41,641
Who's asking?

224
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,761
My name's Burn.

225
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:48,241
I had word from your man in Camden town
you wanted a parley.

226
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:51,641
Then parley it is.

227
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:55,161
Few months ago,

228
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:58,241
a man named Ryan came to this place with
a view to buying some goods from you.

229
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:01,521
Mr Ryan met with an accident,
he was shot.

230
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,401
I heard.

231
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:06,241
He was a man with a quick mouth.
I know that.

232
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:09,161
Wondered if he made
any enemies in here?

233
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,521
None that I know of.

234
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:13,121
Not the kind of place to make enemies.

235
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:15,721
- All are welcome here, Mr Burn.
- Including Irish?

236
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,201
Oh, especially Irish.

237
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,001
Ryan told you he was a member
of the Irish Republican Army.

238
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,201
Was he still welcome?

239
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:27,961
Like I say. Any man who buys
beer is welcome.

240
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,841
Perhaps you didn't believe him?

241
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:38,081
In pubs, sometimes people say things.

242
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:39,961
Sometimes it's the whisky talking.

243
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:42,321
It's hard to tell which is which.

244
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:46,041
As a teetotal man, I find that amusing.

245
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:49,281
Except when it ends in tragedy.

246
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,161
Would you like some water
and cordial, Mr Burn?

247
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:52,721
You see, Mr Shelby,

248
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:57,441
Ryan, for all his quick mouth,
was indeed connected.

249
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:01,001
Very well connected to our brotherhood.

250
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,401
By membership in blood.

251
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,321
He was my cousin.

252
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,761
I'm from South Armagh.

253
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,281
I'm a man of influence there.

254
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,401
Cordial and water will
be grand, Mr Shelby.

255
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:22,641
Grace, bring some water and cordial.
Come this way.

256
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:23,801
Yes, Mr Shelby.

257
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,281
My cousin came to buy guns.

258
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,441
And I told him I have none.

259
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,681
Your man Danny Owen
talks a lot when he's drunk.

260
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:48,401
He says the Peaky Blinders
do have the guns,

261
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,321
brought from the factory down the road.

262
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:52,561
He boasted about a stack
of Lewis machine guns,

263
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,081
and enough belts of ammunition
to hold up God's trousers.

264
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:58,401
Yup, that sounds like our Danny.

265
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,961
He has an imagination.

266
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:05,241
Like I say, sometimes it's
the whisky does the talk.

267
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,801
He says only your brothers
know where the guns are kept.

268
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:23,681
Well, Danny also says he sees German
infantrymen on the back of mill carts.

269
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,361
And he shoots them with his broomstick.

270
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:31,241
We have men in the BSA factory.

271
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,761
They said you has 'em.

272
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:36,681
And we have men that work
in the police station.

273
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:39,681
Every finger, Mr Shelby...

274
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:43,881
Every finger in this city
points in one direction.

275
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,041
Please don't mistake me for a fool.

276
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,001
Let me get to the point.

277
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:10,961
I don't care what kind of half-arsed
tinker operation you have going here.

278
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:13,281
But I can assure you,

279
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:17,041
I represent a very different
category of organisation.

280
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:22,081
My cousin was shot.

281
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,521
I am judge, jury, and executioner.

282
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,361
I find you guilty and I pass sentence.

283
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,121
You deliver the guns to me,

284
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:36,681
or I deliver death
and hell's fury to you,

285
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,001
and your little tribe of heathens.

286
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,481
Am I making myself clear?

287
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:58,641
Let me confess something to you,
and only to you.

288
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:05,281
I have the guns, but they have
become a burden to me.

289
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,961
Perhaps it is time
to unload that burden.

290
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:14,641
For the right price.

291
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,921
Malachy Burn.

292
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:45,481
Brigade Commander
of the South Armagh IRA.

293
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:48,681
You hooked yourself a big fish there.

294
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:51,761
With these guns as bait,
who knows what we'll catch?

295
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,521
We?

296
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:57,881
Are you suggesting that you and I
could work together as a team?

297
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:00,841
Perhaps we have more in common
than you think, Inspector.

298
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:04,921
- Can you deliver him?
- With your help.

299
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:08,401
And I want word put out in Ireland
that I was not involved.

300
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,801
So I'd be solving
a problem for you.

301
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,881
And I'd be
winning you that medal.

302
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:21,241
If I get a medal, I will have
your initials engraved on my backside.

303
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:27,281
Oh. My initials on your backside.
That's quite an image.

304
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:32,561
Inspector, since we're
getting on so well...

305
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:34,961
can you answer me a question?

306
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,481
Who gave you Freddie Thorne?

307
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:42,281
Well, as everyone in the city knows...
It was you, Mr Shelby.

308
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:15,721
- Hello, son.
- It's all there.

309
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:22,601
It is indeed. We're gonna build
something with this, son.

310
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,041
- Something magnificent.
- When do we start, Dad?

311
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:28,201
- Hungry for work, are you?
- Yeah!

312
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,801
Ship sails Friday.
Meet me at the boxing ring.

313
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:33,561
- Good. Friday.
- Friday.

314
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:09,601
No, leave that open.

315
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:22,961
- No.
- Are you expecting trouble?

316
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:24,841
- Yeah.
- At this hour?

317
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:28,001
- Midnight is as good an hour as any.
- What the hell is going on?

318
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,841
When the St Andrews' bell
strikes midnight,

319
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,241
two IRA men are going
to come through that door.

320
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:36,801
When they have what they want,
they plan to kill me.

321
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,841
It's your job
to stop that happening.

322
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:40,281
Could have given me
some more warning.

323
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:43,841
I just got the message myself.
They want to meet here, alone.

324
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:47,081
- And barmaids don't count?
- No, barmaids don't count, no.

325
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,321
You're going to be in that back room.
I'm going to be sitting there.

326
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,721
When I make a toast, you're going
to come out with that thing raised.

327
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:56,601
You don't shoot, you just point.
I'll do the rest.

328
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:00,001
- Will you kill them?
- No. The police want them alive.

329
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:02,441
- The police know about this?
- Look, just hold it up.

330
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:05,121
Just Point, right?

331
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:09,041
Right, go, go! Go on, go!

332
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:36,921
We'll hold back here.

333
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:40,961
If damage is done to either side,
it's no concern of ours.

334
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:18,041
- Lost your thirst, eh?
-just show us where.

335
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,601
Give me the cash.

336
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,281
You're gonna need a shovel.

337
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:54,441
You thick fucking tinker.
Do you think we'd let you live?

338
00:24:56,081 --> 00:24:58,721
Make your peace, Mr Shelby.

339
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:03,921
I'll make my peace my own way.

340
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:12,041
To barmaids who don't count.

341
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:10,681
Why did you shoot?
Why did you shoot, Grace?

342
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:14,401
I didn't know I had it in me
like that. I didn't...

343
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:18,281
Now you've seen me.

344
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:23,481
And you've seen me.

345
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:27,481
I'm sorry.

346
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,481
You were supposed to come
on the sixth chime.

347
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:51,041
You were supposed to come
on the fucking sixth chime!

348
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:58,481
They refused to surrender.

349
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:02,921
They fought well, they were brave men.

350
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:08,761
Well, he looks like he was killed
by a wild fucking animal.

351
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:16,401
Still. This never happened.
They were never here. Who cares?

352
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,681
Get the bodies out of here.

353
00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:21,921
Ah, right. Are they making
the lady uncomfortable?

354
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,881
I'll leave you two
love birds to it, then, eh?

355
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:15,641
Thank you.

356
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:21,161
I'm sorry.

357
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,201
First of all, let me say...

358
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:05,521
I had no idea he would
involve you in this ugly business.

359
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:08,561
If I had, I never would
have let it happen.

360
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:11,841
He trusts me. I told you that.
You didn't believe me.

361
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:13,721
Fine.

362
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:18,001
Sergeant Moss made a report,
which, of course, I burnt.

363
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:22,081
He said that when he entered
the room, you were embracing.

364
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:26,681
Is that your primary
concern, now? An embrace?

365
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:32,201
- No, my concern is for your welfare.
- It was me who killed them.

366
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:39,281
- I had no control.
- You've been living with beasts.

367
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:43,081
It was the beast that tried to stop me.

368
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:53,601
I believe, last night,
something inside me changed.

369
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:56,881
I no longer feel the need
to avenge my father.

370
00:30:57,721 --> 00:31:00,081
The hatred that I brought
here with me is gone.

371
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:04,561
And therefore my reasons
for joining the Service.

372
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:06,441
You want to resign?

373
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:10,161
I think our mission has come
to a natural end.

374
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,521
I think I know where
the guns are hidden.

375
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:17,961
You do? So tell me where!

376
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,561
If I'm right and the guns are found,

377
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:22,401
you have no more business
with Thomas Shelby. Is that not so?

378
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:26,481
Our military mission will be over, and
we can leave the city as we found it.

379
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:31,961
Are you trying to do a deal with me?
Because if you are,

380
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:34,121
you must be explicit.

381
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:36,001
I want your word

382
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:39,561
that Tommy Shelby will not be
harmed if the guns are recovered.

383
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:43,281
Your word as a gentleman.
Will you give it?

384
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:45,481
Now, why would you want to save him?

385
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:51,721
- Residue of sympathy.
- Sympathy? You mean, sentiment?

386
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:56,961
Yes. In his way, he has been kind to me.

387
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:00,161
- Sentiment.
- Yes.

388
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:09,561
You're too good-hearted for this work.

389
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:12,281
Perhaps.

390
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,521
So, for my sake, will you spare him?

391
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:19,641
You have my word.

392
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:27,481
A week after the robbery, there
was a burial at St Andrews' churchyard.

393
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:31,401
I have found out that the man
supposed to be buried is alive.

394
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,161
Arthur is quite concerned.

395
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:38,081
I learned that the funeral
was attended only by the brothers,

396
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:42,041
and the grave that they dug
was far deeper than your average,

397
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:46,201
and lined with lead
to keep out the damp.

398
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,001
The guns are buried in that grave.

399
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:56,281
Then tonight we will dig up that grave.

400
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:02,321
<i>GRACE'. # When my family thinks</i>

401
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:06,041
<i># That I'm safely in my bed</i>

402
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:09,761
<i># Oh, from morn until night</i>

403
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,961
<i># I am stretched out at your head</i>

404
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:18,681
<i># Calling out unto the earth</i>

405
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:22,481
<i># With tears hot and wild</i>

406
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:27,321
<i># For the loss of a boy</i>

407
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:31,761
<i># That I loved as a child</i>

408
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:38,041
<i># So I am stretched on your grave</i>

409
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:41,801
<i># And I'll lie here forever</i>

410
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:45,561
<i># If your hands were in mine</i>

411
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:49,681
<i># I'd be sure they would not sever</i>

412
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,801
<i># My apple tree, my brightness</i>

413
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:58,481
<i># It's time we were together</i>

414
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:00,001
Well done, boys!

415
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:03,561
<i># For I smell of the earth</i>

416
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:09,041
<i># And I'm worn by the weather #</i>

417
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:20,561
All but one gun accounted for.

418
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:34,081
Then, sir, I resign my commission.

419
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:38,881
Good... Good.

420
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:45,321
So, I am no longer
your superior officer,

421
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:48,881
and you're no longer my subordinate.

422
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:52,641
And therefore...

423
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:58,241
Regulations permit me
to offer you this.

424
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:10,521
I'm a simple man, but a good man.

425
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:16,561
And my admiration for you
has turned to love.

426
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:21,361
I don't ask for love in return,

427
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:25,481
just recognition that
we are like minds,

428
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:28,441
with shared values.

429
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:30,881
Grace...

430
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:34,401
Will you marry me?

431
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:48,601
Mr Campbell...

432
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,321
You deserve better.

433
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:07,881
Is it him between us?

434
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:11,401
Is it the beast that dug that grave?

435
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:12,881
Is it him?

436
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:16,961
My resignation will be
with you in the morning.

437
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:38,041
Dad?

438
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:43,201
Hello, son.

439
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:46,481
May I ask who gave you my whereabouts?

440
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:50,641
Marsden. Said you left him last night
with a bill for your whores.

441
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:53,521
Well... At least we got
to say goodbye, son.

442
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:57,601
And bid a fond adieu to
your dear brothers, would you?

443
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:01,801
- How could you do this to us?
- Do what, son?

444
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:04,201
All that stuff you said about...

445
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:06,721
Shelby Casino...

446
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:12,001
- And Atlantic City.
- Hmm, well, if the truth be told,

447
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:16,521
I'm not so acquainted with that
promised land as I had thee believe.

448
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,401
You're a fucking liar.

449
00:37:22,521 --> 00:37:23,801
And a thief.

450
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:27,041
Now you give me back
my fucking money!

451
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:30,041
Do not despise the thief

452
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:33,641
who steals to satisfy his starvation.

453
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:36,641
That's in the Holy Bible, son.

454
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:40,681
And I have starved for so very long.

455
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:45,241
Fair thee well, son.

456
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:50,841
I waited for ya.

457
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:53,801
I waited.

458
00:37:57,561 --> 00:37:59,681
Listen to me, boy.

459
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:02,321
You're not in the prize ring now.

460
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:04,961
Never put your hands on me again

461
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:08,601
or I'll cut your fucking throat
and spread you on these tracks.

462
00:38:49,081 --> 00:38:50,601
Where's your father?

463
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,521
I'm assuming he's frittering away
the 500 you took from us

464
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:01,961
and put into his
thieving, whore-groping hands.

465
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,401
What were you thinking?

466
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:11,121
How dare you do something like that
without talking to Thomas or me?

467
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:16,201
Does Tommy know?

468
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,161
No.

469
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:28,201
But you're going to tell him.

470
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,721
You may take satisfaction

471
00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:34,281
in a great victory.

472
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:38,081
A terrible consequence has been avoided.

473
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:43,801
<i>Those guns that we dug up will never
be used to murder the innocent,</i>

474
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:46,761
<i>or usurp the status qua.</i>

475
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:49,201
<i>But even though we have solved a crime,</i>

476
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:53,081
<i>we have, as yet,
failed to punish the criminal.</i>

477
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:58,801
This man who dug this grave
has also dug his own.

478
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:03,521
He has proved a deadly menace
to the King's peace.

479
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:06,561
<i>And tonight we will strike him down.</i>

480
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:10,041
<i>We will drive our swords
through his black heart.</i>

481
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:13,961
<i>We will pursue him into
the rat holes that he infests.</i>

482
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,761
And finally,

483
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:19,561
we will rid this city of his kind.

484
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:22,361
<i>Justice will be done.</i>

485
00:40:22,441 --> 00:40:24,041
<i>And will be seen to be done.</i>

486
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:26,961
Amen.

487
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:31,601
There's going to be trouble now, Finn.

488
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:34,241
You look after yourself, do you hear me?

489
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:36,201
I'm gonna be gone away for a while.

490
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:38,361
Right. Go on.

491
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:47,441
Right!

492
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,361
Who wants to fucking fight?

493
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:51,961
Fighting's over.

494
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:54,201
We're closing up and moving on.

495
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:56,561
I said, "Who wants to fucking fight?"

496
00:40:56,801 --> 00:41:01,121
My name is Arthur fucking Shelby.

497
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,401
Who dares fight me?

498
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:10,961
Go home, lad.
Before you catch yourself a spanking.

499
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:24,161
My brother in Digbeth

500
00:41:24,241 --> 00:41:26,761
just said the police are coming down
from Deritend, in numbers.

501
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:29,041
Asking for Tommy Shelby, by name.

502
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:31,961
Shit.

503
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:44,441
- I'm gonna have to lie low for a while.
- Why?

504
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:46,441
I lost my bargaining power.

505
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:48,681
This copper, it's just me and him now.

506
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:50,641
When I get back,

507
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,281
I wanna tell you some things.

508
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:55,641
Harry said the police
are already in Digbeth.

509
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,881
- Yeah.
- You took a chance coming here.

510
00:41:57,961 --> 00:41:59,561
Why?

511
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:01,481
The police are in the lane, Tommy.

512
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:03,481
Come with me.

513
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,641
I'm looking for Thomas Shelby.

514
00:43:28,841 --> 00:43:30,121
Never heard of him.

515
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:37,441
You'll never find him.

516
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:46,721
Go home.

517
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:56,681
Perhaps I should ask
that question again.

518
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,241
On your knees.

519
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:06,801
Aye.

520
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:08,961
Understand this, barman,

521
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:11,681
I don't care if you live or die.

522
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:13,481
I don't know!

523
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,201
He left.

524
00:44:26,521 --> 00:44:27,801
With the barmaid.

525
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:30,761
He left with Grace.

526
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:35,001
I think they were going to her place.

527
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:44,201
Call it off.

528
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:47,241
I don't understand, sir,
we should find the barmaid and...

529
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:48,441
Call it off!

530
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,121
All of it.

531
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:54,761
Get in!

532
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:13,161
It's not much of a place.

533
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:15,201
It's all right.

534
00:45:15,641 --> 00:45:17,801
- Want tea?
- Tea, no.

535
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:20,161
I have rum.

536
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:22,041
Actually, tea it is.

537
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:24,641
- Trying to impress me?
- Yes.

538
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:26,401
And do you have biscuits?

539
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:28,401
No, they attract mice.

540
00:45:30,281 --> 00:45:31,921
People look different at home.

541
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:33,281
In what way?

542
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:35,561
Off guard.

543
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:40,281
Should I be on my guard?

544
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:41,401
No.

545
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:43,321
I'm a man who drinks tea.

546
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:59,201
When the trouble dies down, I'll go.

547
00:46:06,561 --> 00:46:08,561
When will it die down, do you think?

548
00:46:09,441 --> 00:46:11,081
Late, I'd say.

549
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,281
So not until the morning then.

550
00:46:18,761 --> 00:46:21,041
Yes, I'd say I'll be here till morning.

551
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:29,601
You have a gramophone.

552
00:46:29,681 --> 00:46:30,841
It's broken.

553
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,281
We could still dance.

554
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:38,241
Yes, why not?

555
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:46,361
I know you like to be asked properly.

556
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,801
Grace, can I have this dance?

557
00:49:03,601 --> 00:49:04,881
<i>GRACE'. Are you okay?</i>

558
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:08,281
<i>I don't hear
the shovels against the wall.</i>

559
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:11,601
What shovels?

560
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:17,281
Will you help me?

561
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:20,761
Help you with what?

562
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:22,121
With everything.

563
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:25,081
The whole fucking thing.

564
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:27,121
Fucking life.

565
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:29,321
Business.

566
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:33,321
I found you.

567
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:36,521
And you found me.

568
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,121
We'll help each other.

569
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:57,281
Our father,

570
00:50:58,241 --> 00:50:59,641
who art in Heaven,

571
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:02,881
hallowed be thy name...

572
00:51:57,401 --> 00:51:58,881
Hello?

573
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:03,281
Send a telegram to Mr Churchill.

574
00:52:04,201 --> 00:52:06,441
I have news, very good news.

575
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:11,921
<i>Tell him the business I came
to attend to is now complete.</i>

576
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,641
<i>I'll be leaving the city.</i>

577
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:20,121
<i>There's just one matter
I need to tidy up first.</i>

578
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:01,841
So Polly told ya.

579
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:04,521
Yup.

580
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:19,161
You should've used a gun.

581
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:23,841
Are you laughing at me, Tommy?

582
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,241
Yeah.

583
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:30,281
Just when things are
starting to go right, Arthur,

584
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:32,561
you try and do this.

585
00:53:35,361 --> 00:53:37,201
Don't you like fancy parties?

586
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,161
Or, um...

587
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:42,481
Champagne? Or fast cars?

588
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:45,761
And how about this?

589
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:53,041
Your name on a business card.

590
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:56,921
"Shelby Brothers, Limited.

591
00:53:57,521 --> 00:53:58,921
"Arthur Shelby.

592
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,681
"Associate bookmaker."

593
00:54:01,961 --> 00:54:04,281
I just had them picked up
from the printer's this morning.

594
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:07,321
You are one of three shareholders.

595
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:10,441
Me, you, john.

596
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:13,441
And according to the law,
we are equal partners.

597
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:16,681
And it is written in
the paperwork in black and white.

598
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:20,081
A third, a third, a third.

599
00:54:23,321 --> 00:54:24,721
But the thing is, uh...

600
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:28,001
Well, me and john, we quite fancy
splitting your share, so...

601
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:31,081
just next time, use a gun, man.

602
00:54:35,601 --> 00:54:38,841
Our men at the station tell me
that copper is leaving town.

603
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:41,561
We're in the clear.

604
00:54:44,841 --> 00:54:46,881
We are on our way
up in the world, brother.

605
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:50,921
Believe me.

606
00:56:57,401 --> 00:57:02,721
<i># Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the track #</i>
