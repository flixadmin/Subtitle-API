1
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:13,166
Professor!

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,875
Professor!

3
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,750
Tell me where the gold is.

4
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:19,833
I don't know.

5
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,083
Asshole.

6
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,375
I thought as much.

7
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,375
Look.

8
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,958
This is your doing.

9
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,250
Look him in the eye!

10
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,166
Tell the kid that,
on top of his endless list of crimes,

11
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,625
he'll get five dead soldiers added to it.

12
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,708
Life sentence. Tell him!

13
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,541
How old are you, boy?

14
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,041
I'm 23.

15
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,333
Those are the only years of freedom
you'll ever see.

16
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,125
Thanks to you.

17
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,291
Like Stockholm. Look at her.

18
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,375
Look at her, you piece of shit!

19
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:06,541
When she gets out,
her son will be a 45-year-old man.

20
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,708
Do you enjoy causing all this suffering,
you son of a bitch? Do you?

21
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,458
Same as Denver.
Got anything to say to him?

22
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,708
Tell him he's lost his son,
just like he lost his dad.

23
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,333
And in both instances
the same person was responsible, you!

24
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,083
Did you really love her?

25
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,500
Well, look at her.

26
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:30,500
I want you to think of this face
every day you spend in jail,

27
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,958
and that if you'd stayed away from her,

28
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:38,125
she'd still have a life,
a mother, a daughter.

29
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,916
She's got nothing now!

30
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,125
I don't care
what you plan to do with the fucking gold.

31
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,083
Because I won't even try to find it.

32
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,916
One of them will tell me.

33
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,166
Do you know why?

34
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,958
Because I'll offer a new life
to whoever tells me.

35
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:10,458
A life sentence or set for life.

36
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:17,791
One of you will make today
the happiest day of your life.

37
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,250
And mine!

38
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,583
I'm glad you're so happy,
because dark times are coming.

39
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,208
You don't get it, Tamayo.

40
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,625
What you believe to be the end of the game

41
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,458
is really just the beginning.

42
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,583
On your knees.

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,750
The Professor was playing
the biggest poker game in history.

44
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,333
But the craziest part
wasn't that he was bluffing.

45
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,666
It was that he didn't have any cards,

46
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:07,625
and the person who had to find the deck
didn't know where to start.

47
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:14,208
PALAWAN, PHILIPPINES

48
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,291
TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST HEIST

49
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,208
After the heist at the Royal Mint,

50
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,458
the Professor was haunted by the guilt
of his brother's death.

51
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,333
He felt he had pushed him away
from the Bank of Spain heist

52
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,833
to pull off his own job.

53
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,666
And now he was dead.

54
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,875
After many sleepless nights,

55
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,583
he found solace in an obsession,

56
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,750
figuring out the impossible
Bank of Spain heist.

57
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,125
Maybe Berlin and Palermo
knew how to get the gold out.

58
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,250
But what was really impossible
to figure out

59
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,833
was something else.

60
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,916
We know how to get the gold out.

61
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,208
But how do you get out?

62
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,000
And more importantly, free.

63
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,125
I've been studying this for a long time.

64
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,416
The starting point is rather simple.

65
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Step one.

66
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,541
Tell the truth

67
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,208
about how we got the gold out,
with your videos.

68
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,708
And we'll do it from Pakistan.

69
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,500
Shakir.

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,875
In eight minutes…

71
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,208
the show starts.

72
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,125
STATEMENT FROM THE GANG

73
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,666
Lovers and enthusiasts of the heist genre

74
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,000
and generally inquisitive minds, welcome.

75
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,958
We'll show you how to get the gold out
of a country's national reserve.

76
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,500
In this instance, Spain's.

77
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,166
Join us on this fascinating journey

78
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,041
to the depths
of the largest heist of all times.

79
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,041
They're broadcasting simultaneously
from hundreds of servers.

80
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,166
It's gone viral.
TV stations are streaming it live.

81
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,041
The robbers say they got the gold out
of the Bank of Spain.

82
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:29,666
They're explaining how they did it.
Spain may have lost its national reserve.

83
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,333
This changes everything.

84
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,333
…the vault would flood in minutes.
How do we fix that?

85
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,666
By welding this pipe
so a diver can get in.

86
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,791
They've made it entertaining
so everyone in Spain gets it.

87
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,875
…one of the greatest heroes of this heist.
How are you?

88
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,333
How many ingots did you take out?

89
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,541
So many. 7,258.

90
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,458
27.5 pounds each. 600,000 euros.

91
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,416
That's about 4,355 million euros.

92
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,083
-Lots of dough.
-Anything else you'd like to add?

93
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,708
-I want to say "hi" to my kids.
-Go ahead.

94
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:05,000
My dear children, Emilio in Venezuela,
Julián in Mexico City,

95
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,041
Erik in Iceland.

96
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,791
Hanna in Finland…

97
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,625
It's on CNN.

98
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,291
…Ivana in Odessa.
Dad sends you all kisses.

99
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,666
A moving story.

100
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,625
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want
to know how we got 90 tons of gold

101
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,166
out of the Bank of Spain,

102
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,416
stay tuned
and wait for our next installments.

103
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,333
NEW INSTALLMENTS COMING SOON 

104
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,291
This could be serious.

105
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,875
I know what you're doing.

106
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,458
You want to cause a financial crisis,
put the country on the ropes,

107
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,083
and blackmail me with it.

108
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,625
Bad news. I've got the support
of the European Central Bank

109
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,000
to inject cash or buy debt.

110
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,708
I can also halt stock-exchange trading.
What do we think?

111
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,750
I don't give a flying fuck
about your financial storm.

112
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,708
And step two?

113
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,958
2. THE CASINO

114
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,333
Financial markets operate
like a large betting shop.

115
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:19,041
You can gamble on anything.
On the NYSE rising, on wheat dropping,

116
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,458
or on a country collapsing.

117
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,000
You can bet and make a lot of money.
It's perfectly legal.

118
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:29,291
And what are we going to offer
those funding bodies and corporations

119
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,166
in search of a victim to profit from?

120
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,291
Assurance.

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,833
When we tell them
the gold is outside the bank,

122
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,458
betting against Spain
will be their winning horse.

123
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,750
At the same time,
that panic will drive investors

124
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,416
to sell Spanish debt and shares
in huge quantities,

125
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,416
which will make

126
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,916
the stock market tumble.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,375
And more importantly,

128
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,916
the risk premium
will skyrocket to over 800 points.

129
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,208
What does that mean?

130
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,625
Spain won't be able to get funds
from the markets,

131
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,708
will become insolvent
and therefore bankrupt.

132
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,625
Exactly.

133
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,375
And this domino effect

134
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,791
will put huge pressure on the government.

135
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,833
And we'll be the only ones
who can stop it,

136
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,541
all with a single move.

137
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,041
Giving back the gold.

138
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,208
What?

139
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,375
Wait a minute, I don't think I got it.

140
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,458
Are you telling me that my life
depends on a goddamn betting shop?

141
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,708
On the market crashing?
What if it doesn't?

142
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,125
It always does, Denver.
It happened in Greece.

143
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,958
It's the very nature of the system.

144
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,291
It's designed to react like that.

145
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,291
-And it's predictable.
-Predictable?

146
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,666
A tunnel is predictable.
You go in one side and out the other.

147
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,250
That's predictable,
but this is out of our control.

148
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,416
-Denver, please.
-Don't "Denver, please" me.

149
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,208
He can't play with our lives like that.
Listen up.

150
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,125
That won't work.

151
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,916
You came in here
to make sure nobody came out

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
so you could finish your extortion.

153
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,875
Well, now that we all know

154
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,500
that the economic conspiracy
is a bunch of fucking humbug,

155
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,000
know what I'm gonna do?

156
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,125
I'm going to interrogate you one by one.

157
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:32,250
And those who won't talk
will go through that door,

158
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,416
straight to a life sentence.

159
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,375
In front of the TV cameras and barefaced,

160
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,125
so there's no going back.

161
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,833
Each one of us you take out,

162
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:46,208
I swear, equals ten tons of gold
you'll never get back.

163
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,375
Son of a bitch.

164
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,375
I said you couldn't play that card.

165
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,958
-Shut up. The game isn't over.
-"Shut up?"

166
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,708
-Denver.
-What?

167
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,791
Shut up.

168
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,125
You want me to shut up?

169
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,458
We're all here, on our knees,

170
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:09,291
with a goddamn rifle pointed at our necks
because we listened to a nutcase!

171
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,625
Quiet, Denver!

172
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,541
-I won't shut up!
-Shut up now!

173
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,041
Separate those two
from the rest of the gang.

174
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,375
Denver.

175
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,166
You go first.

176
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,333
Denver, remember what I told you!

177
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,375
Someone stole the gold.
If anyone finds out, it's over.

178
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,000
I swear on our son's life
I'll get you out of here.

179
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,708
Denver, don't do anything.

180
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,958
Denver, listen to me.

181
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,083
Denver, remember what I told you!

182
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,666
While the gang was on the ropes…

183
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,500
This pump extracts aggregates
from the seabed.

184
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,208
They were able to send it upstream
with this pump.

185
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,000
…Ángel thought
he had discovered the truth.

186
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,375
We were searching in the wrong direction.

187
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,750
But that truth was just part
of the Tom Thumb Plan.

188
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,583
I need eight men at the door,
right now. Let's go.

189
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,541
Where the fuck would you hide
90 tons of gold, Benjamín?

190
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,250
In a forest?

191
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,916
Or a wasteland.

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,083
Or an abandoned area nobody ever goes to.

193
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,916
We need to think like an MIT engineer.

194
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,916
Minimize risk.

195
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,208
And minimizing risk means
that we have to make sure

196
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,583
no idiots will come by looking
for bottle caps with a metal detector.

197
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,000
There's only one way to do that,
by restricting access to it.

198
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,708
Private property.

199
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,291
Exactly.

200
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:47,041
Private property
relatively close to the stormwater tank.

201
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:51,791
They knew the plan very well,
but with Berlin being dead,

202
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,208
they couldn't have imagined
the heist would actually happen.

203
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,041
Fuck!

204
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,458
They took action
as soon as the heist began.

205
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,458
We have to find a plot
bought in the last five days.

206
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,750
All roads lead to the same place.

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,291
The land register.

208
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,333
We need to be armed when we go in.

209
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,125
This can be your new identity.

210
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,458
And there's more.

211
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,333
Three million euros for a fresh start
without any financial hardship.

212
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,916
You can buy a house with a hot tub,
throw some parties,

213
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,833
in the country of your choice.

214
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,000
And a lifetime allowance of 25,000 euros
a month at the expense of the government.

215
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,750
A premium retiree.

216
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,416
What do you think?

217
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,208
And what about my family?

218
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,375
We can make an exception. Two for one.

219
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,125
Tell me where the gold is

220
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,166
and Stockholm, you,
and the kid you've got out there

221
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,375
can get a fresh start.

222
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,416
Okay, but I don't know where the gold is.

223
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,375
I really don't know.

224
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,458
You know something.

225
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,583
I need an informer
to give me all the plan details.

226
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,750
You get your freedom
and I find the gold later.

227
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,416
I know it's tough,

228
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,333
but you don't even need
to say it out loud.

229
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,125
Just write down, right here,

230
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,916
what Raquel Murillo
doesn't want you to tell me.

231
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,000
Just a simple answer

232
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,375
for a life of freedom.

233
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,208
A fucking life of freedom.

234
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,333
"One, two, buckle my shoe.
Three, four, shut the door."

235
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,166
"Five, six, balls and dicks."

236
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,416
Put that in the GPS
and it'll take you straight to the gold.

237
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,541
-Get out now!
-Great.

238
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,833
Three million in cash, please.
I hate going to the ATM.

239
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,291
-Take him away.
-I want a house in the Dominican Republic.

240
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,458
Let's go! Get in there!

241
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,583
Stop moving.

242
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,250
Stop moving!

243
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,000
I love you.

244
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,041
Come on.

245
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,583
This is your future.

246
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,625
I'll give you a moment to picture it
and I'll come back for the next one.

247
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,333
MADRID, FIVE YEARS EARLIER

248
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,708
Sergio, why are you planning a heist?

249
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,958
It suits my dad, right?

250
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,125
But you, with all that knowledge…

251
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,125
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

252
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,750
Why does it suit me?

253
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,625
You're the definition of a hedonist.

254
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:22,833
You need your time
to enjoy art, love, travel…

255
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,666
I don't think
you'd have time left to work.

256
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,750
-So, enjoying life doesn't suit me?
-Wait a minute.

257
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:34,416
Robbery isn't only a job, which it is.
It's a family tradition for us.

258
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,250
It's important that you remember that.

259
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,666
There are families of doctors, right?
Families of lawyers.

260
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,916
Families who honor a profession.

261
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,708
Your grandfather started this family line.

262
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,250
How did it go in Denmark?

263
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,750
An exquisite swap.

264
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,083
Where were you when grandpa died?

265
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,333
In the kitchen.

266
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,708
The radio said
a robber had been shot down.

267
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,333
Grandma froze,

268
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,875
with the fridge door wide open.

269
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,250
Suddenly,

270
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,458
she came and hugged me…

271
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,875
and then and there, I knew it was my dad.

272
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,291
Then the fridge started to beep.

273
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,583
Did you also find out like that?

274
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,208
No.

275
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:47,166
Yes, you were there.
You had just come back from the hospital.

276
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,041
It was one of the few times
you weren't hospitalized.

277
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,583
-I was there, but I already knew.
-What?

278
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,125
That morning, a noise woke me up.

279
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,541
I jumped out of bed, in my pajamas.

280
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,833
I went to the courtyard window

281
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,333
and I saw Dad.

282
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,208
He was loading the trunk.
I thought, "Fishing gear."

283
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,375
He promised me that,
when I got out of the hospital,

284
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,250
he'd take me fishing with him.

285
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,458
So I quickly got dressed
and ran down after him.

286
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,333
I ran down the stairs.

287
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,625
Dad!

288
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,250
I missed him by three seconds.

289
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,291
By three seconds!

290
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,125
So I grabbed your bike.

291
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,375
And I pedaled as fast as I could.

292
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,458
Dad!

293
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,875
I saw the car in the distance.
I was getting closer.

294
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:57,041
He stopped at a light
and when I was about to catch up with him,

295
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,125
it turned green.

296
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,500
Dad!

297
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,625
He got away again.

298
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,541
When I saw him in the distance,

299
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,500
he switched cars.

300
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,041
And after five or six minutes…

301
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,083
I saw the car, but no one was in it.

302
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,166
And then…

303
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,083
I heard two gunshots.

304
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,458
I was scared to death.

305
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,416
And then I saw Dad coming out of the bank.

306
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,791
Don't move or I'll shoot! Get down!

307
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,875
And he saw me.

308
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,916
They started yelling at him, "Kneel down!"

309
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,333
-Kneel down!
-"Kneel down."

310
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,166
On your knees, now!

311
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,875
Get down on the ground!

312
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,541
But he didn't, Andrés.

313
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,000
Because he was looking at me.

314
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,875
And then…

315
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:54,125
BANK OF SPAIN

316
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,416
That's how I found out.

317
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,208
And what did you do?

318
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,208
Nothing. I rode home.

319
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,333
I was there when you got home.

320
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,291
Yes.

321
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,625
Why didn't you say anything?

322
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,916
Because for me, it was like a movie.

323
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,875
Your grandpa told robbery
and heist stories as if they were movies.

324
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,333
So,

325
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,458
while riding back home, I thought…

326
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,750
"This is a movie."

327
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,416
"If I don't say anything,

328
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,583
it'll always be one."

329
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,416
And it worked,

330
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,041
until it came on the radio.

331
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,875
When you ask me why I plan heists,
the answer is simple.

332
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:06,833
To talk to him.

333
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,791
He told me about his dream
to rob the Royal Mint that same night.

334
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,916
We laughed so hard.

335
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:22,416
"Can you imagine a machine
that can make money?"

336
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,666
I'm the one telling him movie stories now.

337
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,625
"Dad, what do you think about this part
of the plan? See any weak points?"

338
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,833
I talk to him often.

339
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,041
I talk more with him
than with any living creature.

340
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:12,541
-Shoot.
-Colonel.

341
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:15,625
We found the Professor's hideout.
No trace of the gold.

342
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,708
They burnt everything.

343
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,500
Fuck, give me some good news.

344
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,750
It seems they melted the gold
back into ingots

345
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,416
so they could carry it in trucks.

346
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,666
Colonel, those trucks can be traced.

347
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,000
Talk with Interpol.

348
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,541
Issue an international warrant
and activate all European satellites.

349
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,000
We're going to fucking find them.

350
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:35,916
Okay.

351
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,291
PASAJES PORT, 3:07 A.M.

352
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,583
Those trucks were part

353
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,583
of the breadcrumbs
Marseille was leaving behind.

354
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:49,625
It was a criminal trail
leading to a non-existent loot

355
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,625
that would help drive the police crazy.

356
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,416
So?

357
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,625
The European Central Bank
won't back us.

358
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,250
They're very skeptical…

359
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,333
after how we've managed the crisis.

360
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,083
And what does that mean?

361
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,000
Minister?

362
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,666
They'll let us collapse.

363
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,708
The stock market has plummeted
14% in three hours.

364
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:55,166
That will be a joke compared
to what will happen at nine

365
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,375
when the markets open.

366
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,000
You've got the brains of the operation.

367
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,583
He's on his knees,
surrendered and handcuffed.

368
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,666
What the fuck are you waiting for?

369
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,125
You, get out of here.

370
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:21,916
Son of a bitch!

371
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:23,541
No!

372
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,375
-You're wrong about me.
-Tamayo!

373
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,875
If you cross that line,
there's no turning back.

374
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,041
Look who's talking.

375
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,041
Watch this.

376
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,375
I'm smashing your face in
to make one thing clear.

377
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,250
You won't have an autopsy.

378
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,625
I'll destroy you
in front of your girlfriend,

379
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:46,833
and I won't stop

380
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:50,291
until either you tell me where the gold is
or you die.

381
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,250
Because either I win or no one does.

382
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,583
Stop!

383
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:02,833
What if you're wrong
about what winning means?

384
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,625
Picture yourself a few months from now,

385
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,250
at home,

386
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:11,625
listening to the unemployment figures,
the debt maturities.

387
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,791
The entire country
has plunged into deep bankruptcy

388
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,000
in an unprecedented crisis,
in absolute chaos.

389
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,291
Which Tamayo would have won more?

390
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,708
The one who put us in jail?

391
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:26,958
The one who killed us but lost the gold?

392
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,041
Or the one who got it back and stopped
the biggest financial collapse in history?

393
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,375
Listen to me.

394
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,041
Tamayo.

395
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:43,125
I know you'll struggle to grasp this.
Really, I do.

396
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,166
But right now, we only have one choice.

397
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:48,666
Just one.

398
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,166
Either we both win…

399
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,708
or we both lose.

400
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:08,208
I don't know where the gold is. I don't.

401
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,333
I don't. Lisbon doesn't. My people don't.

402
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,166
What did you expect?

403
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,708
Why would I come in here
if I had that information?

404
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,916
Tamayo, you bury people in the desert.

405
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,916
You would've gotten the information
out of us sooner or later.

406
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:32,500
I couldn't give that information
to anyone in the bank, not even myself.

407
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,041
That's the firewall.

408
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,666
The gold is out.

409
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:48,833
On the move.

410
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,708
So this is your last pathetic magic trick.

411
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:05,041
Ninety tons of gold out and about…

412
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,000
gracefully dancing around.

413
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,208
But you're right about one thing.

414
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,750
I don't know how I can win anymore.

415
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,416
Maybe both of us have to lose.

416
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,916
You and I are insignificant
compared to the upcoming economic tsunami.

417
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,541
Absolutely insignificant.

418
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,041
You know there's only one way out.

419
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,041
You know it.

420
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,541
LAND REGISTRY, 6:50 A.M.

421
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,375
Good morning.

422
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,875
The auction begins.

423
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,833
BACK IN 2 HOURS

424
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,708
Who's been working here
for more than 15 years?

425
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,791
More than 20?

426
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,000
Twenty-two?

427
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Sold.

428
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:44,625
Come with me.

429
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,333
Today you get to experience
something you've seen on TV,

430
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,333
collaborating with an armed group.

431
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,000
But there's no risk
because you've been coerced.

432
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,166
Thrilling, huh?

433
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,125
Yes, ma'am.

434
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:59,541
Like in a treasure hunt,
everyone was looking for the gold.

435
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:04,333
Sierra knew the gold was the only way
to keep everyone out of jail.

436
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,250
It's here.

437
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:08,833
Ángel was running,
speeding along the same glimmering trail.

438
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,416
He had swallowed the bait whole.

439
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:12,875
Hello?

440
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,208
We've tracked down the trucks.
They're heading north, along Route 1.

441
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,708
They're at Pasajes port.

442
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:21,416
The Professor won't say a word, Ángel.
Get your ass there now.

443
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,166
I'm taking a helicopter.

444
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,625
Go!

445
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,083
Sergio.

446
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Sergio.

447
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,291
Does it hurt?

448
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,291
What?

449
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,666
Your eyebrow's bleeding.

450
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,125
No. I'm fine.

451
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,583
I'm doing great.

452
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,625
I took a few punches, but…

453
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,500
You should see the other guy.

454
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,125
If he had stayed two more minutes…

455
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,083
-He'd be dead.
-He'd be dead.

456
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,708
I don't doubt it.

457
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm glad you don't.

458
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,958
The last time we talked
I think you called me a coward.

459
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,041
And you told me to shut up.

460
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,625
True.

461
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:23,333
We argue a lot during heists, don't we?

462
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,333
Maybe we should quit.

463
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,458
It's not as easy as canceling
a library card. You need money.

464
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,916
You can't be on the most-wanted list
in 130 countries…

465
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,458
You need a new identity.

466
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:42,125
And right now, my face

467
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,416
is in no condition
to take a passport photo.

468
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,500
More importantly, you don't want to stop.

469
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,708
Tell me something.

470
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,958
After you got out of the Royal Mint,

471
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,541
how long did it take you
to start thinking about this heist?

472
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,000
Forty-eight hours.

473
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,166
Perhaps 24.

474
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,708
I owed it to my brother.

475
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:24,791
Right, you and your tributes
to dead relatives.

476
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,458
Some people throw ashes in the sea,

477
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,833
others bring flowers to the cemetery.

478
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:35,791
You steal the national reserve.

479
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,291
You know what?

480
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,916
You don't do it for your father

481
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,750
or your brother.

482
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,291
You do it for yourself.

483
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:02,458
No, it's my way of talking to them.

484
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,625
How? With a Ouija board?

485
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:07,750
No.

486
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,083
That's just inside your head

487
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:15,291
because you need to hide
everything behind a mask.

488
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,833
Because you love masks.

489
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:23,625
You live life

490
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,333
pretending to have an inferiority complex,

491
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,541
with your glasses, your origami…

492
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:33,708
But the truth is…

493
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,083
The truth is…

494
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:39,250
you walk right into the bank,

495
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:42,666
confident that you're going to arm-wrestle
an entire country.

496
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:49,291
You're your own magic trick, Sergio.

497
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,125
In your Clark Kent costume.

498
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,208
But it's about time you take it off

499
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,583
and accept who you really are.

500
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,000
Will you marry me?

501
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,125
Did I say it right this time? Fuck.

502
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:12,458
I just let it slip out again,
like at the motor home.

503
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,791
-I can't believe it…
-No.

504
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,125
It was good.

505
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:22,916
And?

506
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,958
Yes.

507
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,791
Yes, I will.

508
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,208
Let's get them.

509
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,416
Despite the setbacks,
they really do love each other.

510
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,583
A total of 612 purchases
have gone through in the last five days.

511
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:12,375
Mr. Anselmo Bueno Gutiérrez
sold an urban plot--

512
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,291
No, wait. Let's keep it short.

513
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:19,083
Only read the ones purchased in cash,
without a mortgage.

514
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,125
That narrows down my search a lot.

515
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:25,291
But would you please
stop pointing the gun at me?

516
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,583
-Benjamín.
-Oops, sorry.

517
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:36,083
Here, Ms. María Flores González
purchased a plot in Robledo de Chavela.

518
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:41,000
The seller is Rosario Pineda Hernández.
The plot covers an area of 3,189…

519
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:45,416
While Alicia Sierra realized she
was running out of time to find the gold…

520
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,583
TOM THUMB PLAN

521
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,208
…the police were starting
to see the light.

522
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:53,625
Our man in the shadows will leave
lots of breadcrumbs in his path.

523
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:56,125
Marseille, go to the stormwater tank.

524
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,041
Start the Tom Thumb Plan.

525
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,041
At 11:07 the night before,

526
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:05,916
they prepared
an Oscar-winning crime scene.

527
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:09,833
The cargo on the red trucks
had been transported.

528
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,916
At 8:10 in the morning,

529
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,750
Ángel had made an amazing discovery.

530
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,750
I've got images of some guys

531
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:19,250
loading pallets from trucks
onto a fishing boat.

532
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,833
-A fishing boat?
-Breadcrumbs.

533
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:26,333
To find them, they'll have use
their satellites, NATO allies, Interpol.

534
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:30,125
They'll scan all the traffic cameras
in Spain, and all that will…

535
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:32,708
erase their doubts.

536
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:33,708
Zoom in.

537
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,291
Zoom in here, on the main screen.

538
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:40,041
Those bastards.
They're loading the gold onto a boat.

539
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:46,000
Because the harder the route is
and the more it takes to traverse it,

540
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,333
the more you believe
that what you'll find is the real deal.

541
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:01,500
That's why Tamayo didn't hesitate.

542
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:05,083
The cornerstone of the investigation
was the Virgen del Carmen IV,

543
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:09,208
an anchovy fishing boat
in the Cantabrian Sea.

544
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,208
Where did that boat go?

545
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,458
I don't know. They turned off the GPS.

546
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:18,750
And once they have no clue
what our route is,

547
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,333
they'll discover another strange event.

548
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,416
Kidnapping at sea.

549
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,583
The boat has surfaced in Cantabria.

550
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:31,208
It's 107 miles away, with the captain
and crew tied up in the cabins.

551
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,833
I'm on my way.

552
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,041
What did you say? Tied up?

553
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:40,041
Many things need to be happening at once,
so they don't have time to stop and think.

554
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,541
Tell me what happened.

555
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:47,625
Well, we sailed
for about three or four hours.

556
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:50,708
Then we heard some noises on the deck,

557
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,958
as if someone was fishing.

558
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:53,875
What noises?

559
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,541
The winch,

560
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,958
like they were emptying the hold.

561
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,666
Emptying it, where?

562
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,041
At sea. They were throwing
the bundles into the sea.

563
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:06,416
Don't fuck with me. That makes no sense.

564
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,458
They would move it to another boat,
not throw it in the sea.

565
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,958
I don't know. There must be a reason.

566
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,625
And that question…

567
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:16,541
is important.

568
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,625
It'll be answered by forensics.

569
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,250
Everything was burnt.

570
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:30,041
The few things we could rescue
were pieces of nautical cartography.

571
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:34,083
They show the Bay of Biscay,
but the radius is too big.

572
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:36,583
-How big?
-About 30 to 40 nautical miles.

573
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,791
-There's something else.
-What's that?

574
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,916
A depth-buoy diagram.

575
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,250
It says that it's 230 feet
under the surface.

576
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,125
The buoys could be marking something
anchored to the seabed.

577
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,500
And then,

578
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:02,583
with all the information spread out
on the table, what seemed crazy

579
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,041
will suddenly make sense.

580
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,458
Where is the only place

581
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:10,958
you can leave tons of gold unattended
for centuries

582
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,583
without being discovered?

583
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:18,791
Where are all the lost treasures
of Spanish galleons?

584
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,208
At the bottom of the sea?

585
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,750
At the bottom of the sea.

586
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:26,500
Here's the buoy.

587
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,958
We need to mobilize the Navy.

588
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:32,208
I want frigates, battleships,
aircraft carriers, everything!

589
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,666
Let's comb the Cantabrian Sea!

590
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,208
CANTABRIAN SEA

591
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:41,291
We're changing directions. New course,
the Bay of Biscay. Start tracking.

592
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,458
Tamayo was trying really hard

593
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:46,458
to hide the fact that the gold
had already left the bank.

594
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:50,625
He thought the best way to do so
was by pretending we were still fighting.

595
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:51,833
Fire at will!

596
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,708
We can hear shots
coming from the Bank of Spain.

597
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,416
The shooting continues,
but we're getting no information

598
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,833
about what's going on.

599
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,333
Shots?

600
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,791
Yes. Fuck yes!

601
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,458
-Do you hear that?
-Shut up!

602
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,583
-Do you know what that means?
-Get down!

603
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,083
It's a fucking smoke screen.

604
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:30,166
A smoke screen
or they just executed the Professor.

605
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,416
We have to hold out hope.

606
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,791
The Professor's here
because we're getting out.

607
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:38,916
You put the Professor on a pedestal.

608
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,375
Let's stay positive.

609
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,875
Here it comes, the positivity of fools.

610
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,500
Shit, take a look around.

611
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,583
How many clips do you have?

612
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,458
But if you want to stay positive,

613
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:54,833
we can use a kung-fu hold

614
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:57,500
and before you know it,
we're on the subway.

615
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:02,166
Positive thinking
has been the downfall of civilization.

616
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,250
I may even beat you up,
optimistic as I am.

617
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,125
And do you know why?

618
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,333
I was inside a tomb in Algeria.

619
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:13,125
All I could do was imagine
that I'd get out, and here I am.

620
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,000
You are here
because I got involved in all this.

621
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,291
And him.

622
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,625
And him over there.

623
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,208
Understood?

624
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,791
Well, I agree with Rio.

625
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,750
I've been in a war all my fucking life.

626
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,791
And I want peace.

627
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,291
So, I'll think about…

628
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,125
a positive future.

629
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:38,291
No one has ever loved me.

630
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,208
I've never had a serious relationship.

631
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,416
I think that it's time.

632
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,500
Are we in jail, properly arrested,

633
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:49,250
waiting to be judged?

634
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,083
Are you dead inside a plastic bag?
No, right?

635
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,625
Why do you think that is?

636
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,375
What do you know that I don't?

637
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,541
I'm just looking at the signs, friend.

638
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:10,333
We've been held captive for 24 hours
and we're still alive.

639
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:12,500
Denver is outside.

640
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,291
He's been arrested.

641
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,458
That's a sign.

642
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,208
It's irreversible.

643
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,166
He knows something.

644
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,083
It's just a bit
of positive thinking, friends.

645
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,250
The last thing Tamayo needed

646
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:37,625
was a video showing the world
everything he was trying to hide.

647
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:39,708
We're keeping our promise.

648
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:42,000
How did we get the gold out?

649
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:44,125
It was thanks to this baby.

650
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:49,041
This pump propelled the gold
11 miles away from here,

651
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:53,166
where our team outside received the grit,
melted it again

652
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,250
and turned it into ingots.

653
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:56,958
That's the blatant proof

654
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,916
that we don't have the gold.

655
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,291
In today's treasury auction,
we're bound to lose billions of euros,

656
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,333
week after week,

657
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:13,000
until we won't be able to get any funding.

658
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:17,125
At that exact moment,
the country will go bankrupt.

659
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:19,916
Shut it down.

660
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,875
I don't care if it's been open
for three minutes. Stop it!

661
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,375
The Professor was right.

662
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,458
Everything's going to shit.

663
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:29,833
And then, when everyone thought

664
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:33,166
the Spanish economy
couldn't be discredited any further…

665
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,000
-Hey!
-…the final image was broadcast.

666
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:38,583
We could have been lying.

667
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,416
But to see the Navy combing
the sea in search of gold

668
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,791
was the official acknowledgment
of the success of our heist.

669
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,916
Who the fuck tipped off the press?

670
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,791
Multiply everything I just said by ten.

671
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:55,708
That'll be the end of the Tom Thumb Plan.

672
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:58,416
And that's when…

673
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,041
That's when we'll be
in a position to negotiate.

674
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:10,083
No dirt has been moved in some time.
The garden is well kept.

675
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:12,500
How many left?

676
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,708
One. It's 4.3 miles away.

677
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,625
Let's go.

678
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,916
It's a country house from 1926,
built in stone.

679
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:28,041
This one is prefab, right?

680
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,125
The lawn.

681
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:53,791
What do we do now?

682
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:58,250
Should we all shoot on the count of three?

683
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,166
Perfect.

684
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,000
Nobody is listening.

685
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:27,875
-I guess you've got a plan.
-You're going to give a press conference.

686
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,125
And you'll say the police investigation

687
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:33,875
has found the gold.

688
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,166
If I do that, you leave me high and dry.

689
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,208
If I leave you high and dry,
you'll stop trusting me.

690
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,166
-That's not good for anyone.
-It's not a matter of trust.

691
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,458
It's a matter of life and death.

692
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,333
Suárez, Cañizo, go ahead.

693
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:53,875
Stand up!

694
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,333
Now.

695
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,041
What the fuck is happening, Palermo?

696
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,416
No fucking clue, Manila.

697
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:11,416
The smallest trick and I'll give the order
to have them executed.

698
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,375
-Did you hear me, Suárez?
-Yes.

699
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,958
Now you know the game we're playing,

700
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:21,208
do you really want me to go out
and talk to the press?

701
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:25,333
I told you, either we both win…

702
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,791
or we both lose.

703
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:33,041
I know the plan
to steal the Bank of Spain's gold.

704
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:35,666
And what I don't know, I figure out.

705
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,041
You want to use the gold
as a bargaining chip, right?

706
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,916
But I won't let that happen.

707
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:44,208
Because the true miracle
was getting it out.

708
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,250
And that already happened.

709
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,416
You must be the Professor's nephew.

710
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,541
Rafael.

711
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,291
Your uncle asked me to give you this.

712
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,208
Good morning.

713
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:17,166
I apologize for the short notice,
but I have an important announcement.

714
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:22,166
The police investigation has paid off.

715
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:26,125
We've intercepted two trucks
carrying the Bank of Spain's gold.

716
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,166
-What?
-Where?

717
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,166
-Please.
-And you'll say more.

718
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,000
That I came into the bank

719
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:35,375
to negotiate the gang's surrender
and stop anything worse from happening.

720
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,750
He went down to the bank's basement,

721
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,750
157 feet deep,

722
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,458
where the robbers are still entrenched,

723
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:45,666
fending off the attacks
of the State Security Forces.

724
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,291
You'll wrap it up with a message
of trust and transparency.

725
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,000
As soon as you appear on TV,
those trucks will start moving.

726
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,416
You can escort them
along the Northern Highway.

727
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,375
How can you give the order
while arrested and handcuffed?

728
00:51:58,458 --> 00:51:59,666
It won't be me.

729
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:05,291
You, on TV,
reading that statement, are the order.

730
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,708
It's part of the plan.

731
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,208
You'll have won
and everyone will see that.

732
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,125
Dramatic effect.

733
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:42,500
The gold returns to the Bank of Spain
and the stock market settles.

734
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:45,000
The government and economists agree

735
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:47,458
the debt crisis is now under control

736
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:50,958
and it may recover as fast as it fell.

737
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:53,416
Civil servants from the Bank of Spain

738
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,000
and the State Security Forces

739
00:52:56,083 --> 00:53:00,083
are now unloading the ingots
to put them all back in the vault.

740
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,583
What are those trucks?

741
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,125
It's part of the plan.

742
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:06,791
Part of the plan I don't know?

743
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:10,875
Not every secret is told in bed.

744
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,250
What does that mean?

745
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:14,000
-Relax.
-I can't relax.

746
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,916
Things I don't know about are happening.

747
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,458
It was necessary.

748
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,416
You can fool everyone but me, Sergio.

749
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,208
I don't get it.

750
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:33,541
You would never go back in there
to surrender the gold.

751
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,750
Ever.

752
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:39,041
-Of course not. I'll go in to rescue Rio.
-Sure, right. What a nice guy.

753
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,666
Why don't you tell me
that part of the plan?

754
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:47,583
None of those going into the bank
can know the last part of the plan.

755
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:48,791
I understand that.

756
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,583
But then I'm out.

757
00:53:58,541 --> 00:53:59,375
Martín.

758
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,208
What's a country's gold?

759
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,958
Its wealth?

760
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:10,875
No.

761
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,791
It's an illusion.

762
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,375
It's an illusion.

763
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,833
It's totally useless.

764
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:27,833
Spain doesn't pay for anything
with that gold. Not one transaction.

765
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,458
It's a psychological backup.

766
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:45,625
Gold for brass.

767
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:51,833
Will you do to the Bank of Spain
what Berlin did with the Viking treasure?

768
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:54,833
-How did it go in Denmark?
-An exquisite swap.

769
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:14,041
Out!

770
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:25,875
The ingots in those trucks
are made of gold-coated brass.

771
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,416
I warned you.

772
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,166
Suárez, Cañizo, aim!

773
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,083
Aim!

774
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,541
Tamayo, wait.

775
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:40,833
Those ingots have stopped
the debt catastrophe.

776
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,666
Weren't you Robin Hood?

777
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,500
And you're stealing a country's gold?

778
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:02,750
I'm a thief.

779
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:05,541
The son of a thief.

780
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:08,791
The brother of a thief.

781
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,458
Someday, I hope to be a thief's father.

782
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:24,708
We can't deny our nature, Tamayo.

783
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:27,416
I'm giving you an honorable way out.

784
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:30,375
Think about it, Colonel.

785
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:34,583
It's almost funny.

786
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,958
Don't tell me it doesn't fit in
with Spanish tradition.

787
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:42,083
What other country could have
a national reserve of brass

788
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:47,250
and still be one
of the most important world economies?

789
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:50,750
The Spanish guile.

790
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,750
Lazarillo de Tormes
wasn't written by the English,

791
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:56,375
was it?

792
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:57,958
Tamayo,

793
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,583
you'll be a hero.

794
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:02,416
A hero.

795
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,041
This tiny, metallic difference

796
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,083
will be just another state secret.

797
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:14,458
It'll pass down from president to
president for the next 50, 60 or 70 years,

798
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:15,791
and deep down…

799
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,791
it won't matter. Nothing will happen.

800
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,291
-Load your weapons.
-Load!

801
00:57:24,666 --> 00:57:26,416
No, Tamayo. Don't!

802
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:33,375
Did you think you were going to walk out
and leave me a national reserve of brass?

803
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,250
Tell me where the gold is.

804
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,458
-Ten.
-Ten!

805
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:41,625
The brass reserve
is your best option right now.

806
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:45,041
-Nine.
-You can't do it, Colonel. You can't.

807
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,250
-Eight.
-Eight!

808
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,708
If they shoot,
I'll prove what you have is junk!

809
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,583
-Seven.
-I've got videos, documents.

810
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:55,625
-Everything will instantly go public.
-Six.

811
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:56,875
Know what that means?

812
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:59,791
Debt will skyrocket.
The stock market will plummet. No funding.

813
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:01,250
-Five.
-Five!

814
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,375
It'll be bankruptcy.
You won't have a plan B!

815
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:04,666
-Four.
-Four!

816
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,791
That brass is the best of all worlds!

817
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,125
-Three.
-Three!

818
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,125
Sergio!

819
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:12,541
Accept it.

820
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:15,250
The rest of the markets did.
The rest of the world did.

821
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,083
You have to accept it.

822
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:18,291
-Two.
-Two!

823
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,958
You'll never find it, you hear me?

824
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:24,333
It's not up to me.
The plan follows its course.

825
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:28,250
The gold is to protect the gang,
the ones inside and the ones outside.

826
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,125
-It'll never be returned.
-One!

827
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:34,166
If you shoot,
you'll only have the dead and bankruptcy.

828
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,333
I've said it once and I'll say it again,

829
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:38,875
either we both win or we both lose!

830
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:43,791
Colonel,

831
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,083
it's time you accept it.

832
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,166
It's checkmate.

833
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:07,708
Good morning.

834
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:12,875
The heist is over.

835
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,875
The Army's Special Forces

836
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:19,458
have managed to take the bank's basement
with the use of explosives,

837
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,583
therefore releasing the last hostages.

838
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:31,791
HOSTAGES RELEASED FROM THE BANK OF SPAIN

839
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:47,541
During the operation,
and after strong resistance,

840
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:50,416
the following robbers were shot down.

841
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:55,208
Aníbal Cortés, AKA Rio.

842
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,833
Santiago López, AKA Bogotá.

843
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:04,583
Julia Martínez, AKA Manila.

844
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,083
POLICE TAKE DOWN ROBBERS

845
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:10,791
Matías Caño, AKA Pamplona.

846
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:15,625
Mirko Dragic, AKA Helsinki.

847
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:21,333
Mónica Gaztambide, AKA Stockholm.

848
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,750
Martín Berrotti, AKA Palermo.

849
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:37,000
Raquel Murillo, AKA Lisbon.

850
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:44,500
And Sergio Marquina, AKA the Professor.

851
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,791
The police investigation that led
to the recovery of the national reserve

852
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,916
was decisively propelled forward

853
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,625
with the cooperation
of Daniel Ramos, AKA Denver,

854
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:23,166
who will be under witness protection

855
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,333
until all legal actions have concluded.

856
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,666
No one chases a dead person, Colonel.

857
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:21,375
The real gold is our hostage.

858
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,750
If you don't want the biggest state secret
to come to light,

859
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:28,708
this chase ends here and now.

860
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,958
For good.

861
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,458
THE DREAM ISN'T OVER

862
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:38,541
What you're really wondering

863
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:40,750
is what happened to the real gold.

864
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,875
He would've wanted this.

865
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:48,666
Are you sure he'll give you your share?

866
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:50,291
Yes.

867
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,583
It's a family matter.

868
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:05,375
24 HOURS LATER

869
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,541
We're alive.

870
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,000
-You have to believe, brother.
-Always.

871
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:49,958
Thank you.

872
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,625
I almost blew it.

873
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,541
Good thing the Professor
always has a backup plan.

874
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:25,875
You bastards.

875
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,708
I didn't say a word, all right?

876
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:41,583
It didn't all turn out
the way we wanted it to.

877
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:47,666
We're not all here.

878
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:51,750
But…

879
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:56,750
We got something out of it all.

880
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:02,625
Come on.

881
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:11,666
I think you have something for me.

882
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:21,750
Lucía?

883
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:26,083
And Victoria's.

884
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,375
Where's the gold?

885
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,625
It's already in Portugal.

886
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:55,875
In a small house.

887
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:58,583
The little treasure house.

888
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:30,625
When this story began,
nobody could've imagined

889
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:36,833
that we'd end up being escorted
and hidden by an elite military team.

890
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:40,583
That the mission would be making sure
we had a new life without anyone knowing.

891
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:44,375
A new life, a free life,

892
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:47,166
loaded with gold.

893
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:52,291
So no member of the gang
had to rob a bank ever again.

894
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:52,625
OUR LEGACY CONTINUES THANKS TO ALL OF YOU,
THE REAL RESISTANCE.

895
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:06,666
