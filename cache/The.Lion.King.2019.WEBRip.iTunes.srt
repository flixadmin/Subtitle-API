understand that balance...

and respect
all the creatures...

00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,505
The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

167
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,257
I'm like, "Birds, we get it."

168
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,925
Stay low to the ground.

169
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,051
I got this.

170
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:06,013
MUFASA: Check the wind,
the shadows...

171
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,016

the perfect moment to pounce.

ZAZU: The cheetahs stole
the baboons' dinner,

173
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,393
and now the baboons
are going ape.

174
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,645
Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

175
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:14,855
That's what I say.

176
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,023
Do you get...
I'll say it again.

They're on the hunt!

00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,878
-Where's Sarabi?
-She's leading the charge.

187
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,379
Zazu, take Simba home.

188
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,215
Dad, let me come! I can help.

189
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,885
No, son.
You stay with the other cubs.

190
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,387
I am not a cub.

191
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,141
Come on.

00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,018
Let's go home.

Go back to your den, Simba.
I don't babysit.

Babysit? I'm gonna be the king

My dad showed me
the whole kingdom.

Think about it.

When I'm king,
I'll have to give you orders.

Tell you what to do.

You've no idea.

214

So, your dad showed you
the whole kingdom?

215
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,425
Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

216
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:52,679
No. He said I can't go there.
Ever.

And he's absolutely right.

An elephant graveyard is
no place for a young prince.

Oh, dear. I've said too much.

We've all been there.
And it's no place for a cub.

All those rotting bones...

and burning pools
of oozing mud.

Rotting bones?
Oozing mud?

you'll stay away, Simba.

it's our little secret...

-Watering hole.

00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,889
See? All clean. Can we go?

244
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,559
There's no hyenas.
You just chased them all off.

245
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,646
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

246
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,858
And stay downwind.

247
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,902
And one more little thing.

248
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,862
Zazu will be going with you.

00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,824
or you don't.

Let's move in a unit.

Okay, buddy system.

00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,585

You hate the water.

257
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,256
I heard
about this place, Nala.

258
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,883
The most incredible,
amazing...

259
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,760
Just tell me where.

260
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,721
An elephant graveyard.

261
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,015
Whoa. How far is it?

262
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,017
Not far. Just to the shadows.

263
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,061
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

264
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:05,562
We've never been
that far before.

265
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,606
-What if we get lost?
-Relax, Nala.

266
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:11,235
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

267
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,861
There's nothing
to worry about.

268
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,905
Well, there is one thing.

269
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,534
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

270
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,619
Oh, wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

271
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,663
How we getting rid
of the dodo?

272
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,456
Trust me, I got this.

273
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:25,958
Follow me to freedom.

274
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,253
ZAZU: Oh, how lovely it is...

275
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,631
to see the future king
with his future queen.

276
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,550
I could just molt.

277
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,343
What do you mean,
"future queen"?

278
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,346
Well, one day the two of you
will be betrothed.

279
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,307
Intended. Affianced.

280
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,518
Simba, you speak bird?

281
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,769
Married!

282
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,230
Come on.
One day you will be married.

283
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,150
To each other.

284
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,610
SIMBA: Ugh!
NALA: Ew!

285
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,571
Mmm-mmm. That's not
gonna happen, Zazu.

286
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:56,655
Never ever.

287
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,948
Nala and I are friends.

288
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,242
And besides,
she's afraid of rhinos!

289
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,451
And he's never eaten
an impala.

290
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,578
I've tried it once.

291
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,079
We are never
getting married, Zazu.

292
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,998
A monarch
who ignores tradition?

293
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,916
With an attitude like that,

294
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,294
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

295
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,838
Well, I'm not letting anyone
tell me where to go,

296
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:13,922
what to do...

297
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,299
and even who to marry.

298
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,301
There will never be a king
like me.

299
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,637
Simba, you can't escape
your destiny.

300
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,347
Just watch.

301
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,516

I'm gonna be a mighty king

302

00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,688
ZAZU: (SINGING) Well, I've
never seen a king of beasts

304
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,732
With quite so little hair

305
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:36,653
I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before

306
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,656
I'm brushing up
on looking down

307
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,450
Working on my roar

308
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,953
(LAUGHS) Thus far
a rather uninspiring thing

309

SIMBA: Oh, I just can't wait
to be king

310
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,169
You have rather a long way
to go, young master.

311
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:53,462
If you think...

312
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,796
SIMBA: No one saying "do this"

313
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,215
ZAZU: Now, when I said that...

314
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,633
NALA: No one saying "be there"

315
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:58,717
ZAZU: What I meant was...

316
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,802
SIMBA: No one saying
"stop that"

317
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,513
BOTH: No one saying "see here"

318
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,847
Now see here!

319
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,017
SIMBA: Free to run around
all day

320
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,560
ZAZU: Well,
that's definitely out.

321
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:12,189
Free to do it all my way

322
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,320
I think it's time
that you and I

323
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,197
Arranged a heart-to-heart

324
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,574
Kings don't need advice

325
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:25,202
From little hornbills
for a start

326
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:30,040
If this is where the monarchy
is headed, count me out

327

The greatest leader
the pride has ever known.

683

684

such a deep, personal loss.

who had barely begun to live.

held our future.

to endure.

to the gorge in time...

I cannot bear
this burden alone.

I don't have time

is doin' it right
