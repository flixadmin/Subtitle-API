1
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:48,723
Nowadays, the US
government can listen to anything you say.

2
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:52,143
They know where you are,
they know who you're talking to,

3
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:55,605
and trust me,
they know who you're fucking.

4
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,442
You turn on a cell phone or a computer,
and you're doomed.

5
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:04,656
But in Colombia in 1989,
it wasn't that easy.

6
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,950
First off,
there was no Internet.

7
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,451
No cells.

8
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,203
The best they had were satellite phones,

9
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:14,541
and in order to capture a satellite phone,
you had to fly directly over it.

10
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:18,920
On top of that, the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

11
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:21,381
the landowners, the politicians...

12
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:26,469
And lucky for us,
the narcos were richer than them all.

13
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:32,225
What's up, Lizard?

14
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,603
We're going out tonight.

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,944
And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.

16
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:46,614
That's why back then, the US government
developed software that could identify

17
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:49,158
the voices of our targets.

18
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:53,371
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.

19
00:01:53,454 --> 00:01:56,499
And you guessed it:
no GPS either.

20
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,960
Hammer, prepare to engage.

21
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:02,463
Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.

22
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:06,300
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

23
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:12,057
OK, he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

24
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,308
Hawkeye, how do you copy that?

25
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:17,938
Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

26
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:20,189
La Dispensaria.

27
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:22,859
I've got a table ready.

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,487
Show up around midnight.

29
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:29,616
- It's gonna be raining women.
- Poison didn't know it,

30
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,910
but he'd just made himself a date.

31
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:35,914
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

32
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,874
Hammer, disengage.

33
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,251
So who do we give this to? DEA?

34
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:43,838
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

35
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:46,007
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

36
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,470
By "the other guy," he meant me.

37
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:53,723
I'm Steve Murphy,
Drug Enforcement Agent.

38
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:58,352
And as you can see,
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

39
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,479
Hello?

40
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:02,023
Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

41
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:02,941
Got it.

42
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:05,652
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

43
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:07,070
OK.

44
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,739
I would've loved
to go after Poison myself,

45
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:13,160
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

46
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:17,246
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

47
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,498
Hola.

48
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:22,251
La Dispensaria?

49
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,377
All right.

50
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,381
Guess who that was.

51
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,717
Your partner.

52
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,512
He just gave me a great gift.

53
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:34,973
Poison.

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,063
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

55
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,315
Yeah, sure.

56
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,526
He's not a fool.

57
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,820
Gotta go.

58
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:52,907
Gonna stick me with the bill?

59
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:59,455
Cheap son of a bitch.

60
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,167
In case you're wondering,
this is the asshole.

61
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,128
Javier Peña, my partner.

62
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:08,715
And this is Colonel Carrillo,
the leader of the Search Bloc,

63
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:11,759
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

64
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:14,637
Boy, did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

65
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:22,436
Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.

66
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,355
Especially the local hitmen.

67
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:26,191
Colombians call them sicarios.

68
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:29,027
- What's up, son?
- Hey, brother.

69
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:32,530
Let's go inside and have a good time.

70
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:34,615
Now, Poison, he was one of the best.

71
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:38,619
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.

72
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,163
Probably hundreds.

73
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,040
But don't get me wrong.

74
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:45,376
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.

75
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:48,963
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

76
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,430
It's on, boys!

77
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:00,767
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

78
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,895
Riano, Trujillo,
you're in the front with me.

79
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:06,189
- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,775
You got it, boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

81
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:11,652
We're gonna kill these fuckers,
all right?

82
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:13,154
Yes, sir!

83
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:28,253
I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.

84
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,676
Yeah, I pushed the buttons.

85
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:50,191
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.

86
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,367
My fellow Americans...

87
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,785
Take Richard Nixon, for instance.

88
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:28,956
People forget,
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

89
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:31,959
We thought he was one of the good guys.

90
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:35,255
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

91
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:37,048
because he hated the commies.

92
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,717
So we helped Pinochet seize power.

93
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,934
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.

94
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:53,689
Maybe not such a good guy after all.

95
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,241
But sometimes,
bad guys do good things.

96
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:09,705
Nobody knows this, but back in '73,
Chile was on its way

97
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,709
to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

98
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:18,672
How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

99
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:22,302
They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

100
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,511
to ship the product north.

101
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:27,265
To be productive,
you can't waste money! Come on!

102
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,351
You're surrounded!

103
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:32,853
- Hands up!
- Everybody on your knees!

104
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:34,481
But Pinochet spoiled the party.

105
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,441
What the fuck is going on here?

106
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:37,525
On the ground!

107
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:41,862
He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.

108
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,994
And then, being Pinochet...

109
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,080
he had them all killed.

110
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,791
Attention!

111
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:56,419
Weapons ready!

112
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,920
Aim!

113
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,922
Ready ammunition!

114
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,883
Fire!

115
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:15,896
They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world,

116
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,900
only the cockroaches will survive.

117
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:21,694
I guess they were right.

118
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:28,951
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno,
aka Cockroach,

119
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,287
and he was smart enough to play dead.

120
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:36,501
He wasn't killed on that day.

121
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:41,922
Instead, he won the damn lottery.

122
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:49,013
Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

123
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:52,433
Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

124
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:56,020
A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

125
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:59,482
Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

126
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,443
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

127
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:07,990
- But you're not a communist.
- No, not a communist, something worse.

128
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,410
A drug trafficker.

129
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,746
- A drug trafficker?
- Yes, a drug trafficker.

130
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:20,253
Back then, we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine

131
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:23,172
on the human brain.

132
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,509
We didn't know much, but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.

133
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:28,928
This will give us better results, OK?

134
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:32,223
Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.

135
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:35,518
A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

136
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:41,441
It would choose cocaine over sleep,
over sex... over life itself.

137
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:44,652
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

138
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:48,906
unless we're talking about cocaine.

139
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:57,373
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

140
00:10:58,374 --> 00:11:00,709
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

141
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,169
Gracias.

142
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,924
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

143
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:08,134
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

144
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,348
Like Goldilocks,
he had three options.

145
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:17,685
And pay attention, because all three
are important to this story.

146
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,568
The Ochoa brothers:
Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse.

147
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,363
A typical Colombian smuggling family.

148
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,865
- They were smart and rich...
- Salud!

149
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:35,119
But Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

150
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,957
Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha,

151
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,836
nicknamed "The Mexican,"
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

152
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,714
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

153
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:57,183
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,
even by Colombian standards.

154
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:58,767
If you make it to the top...

155
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:03,230
it means you've killed your enemies.

156
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:07,360
Hey, partner. What are you doing here?

157
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:09,195
And sometimes, your partners.

158
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,037
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

159
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,671
So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.

160
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,761
Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

161
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:36,180
The man who would
change my life forever.

162
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:41,394
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

163
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:43,937
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,
you name it.

164
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:48,817
At the time,
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.

165
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:53,406
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

166
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,701
They didn't play by the same rules.

167
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,579
Good day.

168
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:01,622
Pablo Escobar?

169
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:03,123
Where's Felipo?

170
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,251
Felipo's been arrested.

171
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,127
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

172
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:10,214
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

173
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:12,717
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

174
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,927
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.

175
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,596
Show some respect.

176
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,016
Now what's the problem,
Mr. Jose Luis?

177
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:25,104
How do you know my name?

178
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,356
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

179
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:32,069
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

180
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:39,118
There's Garcia, Lopez...

181
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:41,245
- Is that Pinilla?
- Yes, Pinilla.

182
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:42,455
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

183
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:44,039
Pinilla...

184
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,958
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

185
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,127
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

186
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,754
I don't have all day.

187
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:55,551
Open it.

188
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,604
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.

189
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:09,398
Who the fuck do you think you are?

190
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,901
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

191
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,779
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.

192
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:16,572
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

193
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,449
Where are your import papers?

194
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,786
You need papers for these TV sets.

195
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:23,287
Take them.

196
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:30,085
Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

197
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,505
- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

198
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,381
It's for Carlitos.

199
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,425
Your son.

200
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:41,305
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

201
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:44,809
Hey, Pinilla!

202
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,189
Your daughter just
got her driver's license, right?

203
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:56,195
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

204
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:01,492
That friend of yours, Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

205
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:04,995
- Right? She's a fox.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,873
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.

207
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,834
What's she doing with a guy like you?

208
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,676
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?

209
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,890
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

210
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:30,479
Colonel, how is your mom doing?

211
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,733
- She just got out of the hospital, right?
- Yes, she's feeling better.

212
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,985
- Good. That makes us happy, right?
- Yes.

213
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,530
Gentlemen...

214
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:42,783
I'm going to tell you who I am.

215
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:47,162
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

216
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,541
My eyes are everywhere.

217
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,587
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

218
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,790
without me knowing about it.

219
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:58,925
Do you understand? Not a finger.

220
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:05,765
One day, I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

221
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:10,895
So look, I make deals for a living.

222
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:14,523
Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

223
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,860
or accept the consequences.

224
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,865
Silver...

225
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,076
or lead.

226
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:29,121
You decide.

227
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,711
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- All right, then.

228
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,383
Yo, Pablo!

229
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,845
- This is Pablo.
- Hello.

230
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,888
- Nice to meet you.
- Mateo Moreno.

231
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:30,474
No, no, no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

232
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,476
All right,
yesterday we were talking,

233
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,023
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

234
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:38,482
Explain.

235
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:41,610
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

236
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,737
I will handle
the chemical part of production,

237
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,323
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

238
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,826
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

239
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:52,287
Now tell him how much it costs.

240
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:56,333
In Chile, this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

241
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,170
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes, it's very good. Look...

242
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:05,467
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.

243
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:07,053
Also...

244
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,472
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

245
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,100
It's very clean, this stuff.
Want some?

246
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,812
If this is really that good
and we can make some money,

247
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,814
we can find room on our trucks.

248
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,358
We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena...

249
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,819
We're going to be rich.

250
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,655
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

251
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:30,117
Well look, Cuca...

252
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,120
you don't have any vision,
my friend.

253
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,125
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

254
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:42,379
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

255
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:47,968
I love that song.

256
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,723
Rodrigo! One more.

257
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,582
Back then, Miami was a paradise.

258
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:21,543
I signed up for the sand,
surf and women.

259
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:26,465
In '79, the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

260
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:27,716
DEA! Stop!

261
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:31,929
I was a young DEA agent,
partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady.

262
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,182
Kevin was a little slow afoot.

263
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,728
Why you running, huh?

264
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:42,815
What you got?
What is this? Huh?

265
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:43,816
What is that?

266
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:47,027
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

267
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:49,196
Let's go celebrate.

268
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:50,864
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

269
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,828
Go! Go! Go!

270
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:58,371
How you like me now?

271
00:19:58,455 --> 00:19:59,623
How much money you owe me?

272
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,458
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

273
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,169
That's right, that's right.

274
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:08,757
All right.
All right, who do we pick?

275
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,467
How 'bout her?

276
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,969
No, no, no,
we gotta fuck with him.

277
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:14,054
- Yeah, let's mess with his head.
- Um...

278
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:15,973
Oh, right there.
See her? At the bar?

279
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:18,184
- Which one?
- Blue top, blond hair. That's his type.

280
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:21,353
- Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

281
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:22,729
- All right.
- Whoo!

282
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,940
Murph! Sparrow, three o'clock.

283
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,861
Hey, while you were walking back,
she was checking your ass out.

284
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:30,487
Oh, she was checking out your ass.

285
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,989
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

286
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:35,951
Listen, she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

287
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,704
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

288
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:42,332
I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.

289
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,127
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

290
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,753
No, the other one.
Of course the blond one.

291
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:48,597
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

292
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:52,592
You dicking me around?

293
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,930
Fuck it, I'm going in.

294
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:58,182
- Go get her.
- Mm!

295
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:00,059
- Yup.
- Hey, while you're up there,

296
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:01,643
get us another pitcher, will ya?

297
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:04,855
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

298
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,366
How you doing?

299
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:18,202
Busy.

300
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:23,331
I just said, "Look, if you don't
wanna be there, you don't have to be.

301
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,626
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So, I don't know...

302
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:32,674
Yeah, those bastards got me.

303
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,094
But I couldn't let it end like that.

304
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:38,013
Excuse me.
See those guys over there?

305
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:40,599
Uh, they're fucking with me.

306
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:44,144
Telling me you were checking out my ass,
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?

307
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:45,478
You're a cop?

308
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:47,898
Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.

309
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,149
Drug Enforcement?

310
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,235
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

311
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:54,613
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?

312
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:57,283
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you, uh...

313
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:59,076
give me your phone number?

314
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,494
How about a fake number?

315
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:03,580
That'll work.

316
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:06,125
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?

317
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,391
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

318
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,894
Have a good night.

319
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:31,275
Aah...

320
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:32,525
Shot down!

321
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:36,363
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh, I...

322
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,592
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

323
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,994
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

324
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:44,537
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

325
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:46,290
How much did that cost you?

326
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:48,500
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

327
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:57,592
I figured, what the hell.

328
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,096
Worst that could happen,
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

329
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:08,687
Hello?

330
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,648
So it wasn't a fake.

331
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,193
I thought you might figure it out.

332
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:16,695
After all, you're DEA.

333
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:20,157
And just like that... she had me.

334
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:26,621
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,

335
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,498
cocaine had him.

336
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:32,919
It's been a while.

337
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:35,588
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

338
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:39,092
Would you like a little coffee?

339
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:40,802
Yeah, a coffee?

340
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:41,887
Yes, a coffee.

341
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,090
- How about you, Pablo?
- No.

342
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,681
You sure?

343
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:48,894
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

344
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:53,857
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

345
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:57,610
Little magic leaves.

346
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:01,448
The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

347
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:07,495
Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

348
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:12,667
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

349
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,755
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

350
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:18,673
Let it dry, dry, dry.

351
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,508
You use ammonia to get the paste.

352
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:26,139
And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

353
00:24:26,223 --> 00:24:28,475
Here is the prize.

354
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:30,977
It's like the kitchen in your house.

355
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:35,065
Like baking a cake.

356
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:39,069
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

357
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:43,365
Look, an old press, an antique.

358
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:50,956
Now we put it in the oven.

359
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,666
Here's one.
The other will follow.

360
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,836
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

361
00:24:57,712 --> 00:24:59,089
Well...

362
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:03,635
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

363
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:06,930
- No.
- You said a kilo.

364
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:08,432
We'll take five.

365
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:12,436
How do we get five across the border?

366
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,396
That's Gustavo's department.

367
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,112
This one has got a good engine.

368
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:24,823
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

369
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:27,117
would be under the rear wheel well.

370
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,328
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

371
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:30,745
Is this easy to take off?

372
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,540
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

373
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:36,001
All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.

374
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,045
- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.

375
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,715
All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

376
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,968
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

377
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:50,223
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

378
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:52,518
For three cars, that's 60 kilos.

379
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,937
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram, what?

380
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,564
$9,000 per kilo.

381
00:25:57,647 --> 00:26:00,192
$9,000 times 60...
The profit is $540,000.

382
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:02,486
That's it!

383
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:04,404
- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?
- Yeah.

384
00:26:04,488 --> 00:26:06,198
OK, Pablo and I drive fast.

385
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:10,160
That's half a million dollars... per trip,

386
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:13,372
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

387
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,959
Easiest money he ever made.

388
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:26,218
Back in Medellín,
Pablo didn't waste any time.

389
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:27,969
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

390
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:33,099
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

391
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,935
How are you feeling, Gustavo?

392
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,523
All this smells like shit to me.

393
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:43,151
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

394
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,571
The stinkier, the better.

395
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,489
All right.

396
00:26:48,532 --> 00:26:50,325
What about all these lights?

397
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,413
Is that to tip off the cops,
or what?

398
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:58,833
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

399
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,836
I'm the artist here, clear?

400
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,129
Clear.

401
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:05,257
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

402
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:09,719
It was a mom-and-pop operation,
so small they called it The Kitchen.

403
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:13,557
But make no mistake,
it would change Medellín forever.

404
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,101
You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

405
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,569
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

406
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:34,869
Let's build them a chimney.

407
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:41,167
There you go.

408
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:45,171
Gentlemen, the first three?

409
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:48,716
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

410
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,880
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

411
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:54,180
- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.

412
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:57,767
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

413
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,936
I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

414
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,985
Like her son, Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

415
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:11,197
Hey, Mom,
how much do you think we can fit in there?

416
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:14,701
- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

417
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:16,202
Trust me, Pablito.

418
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:18,246
I love it. Let's do it.

419
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:24,252
- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.

420
00:28:27,297 --> 00:28:28,590
It's Gustavo.

421
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:30,800
Five kilos, right?

422
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:34,429
Pablo loved his young bride Tata,
and she loved him.

423
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,931
He was a family man till the end.

424
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,185
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

425
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:42,103
- Meet my friend.
- Hello, how are you doing?

426
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,313
Hey, Pablo, this is Lion.

427
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:46,525
He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

428
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:48,943
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich, right?

429
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,029
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

430
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:52,656
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.

431
00:28:52,739 --> 00:28:53,990
Here's three.

432
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:56,702
We're going to need two more,
right, Mom?

433
00:28:56,784 --> 00:28:58,578
- That's right.
- Pablito...

434
00:28:58,662 --> 00:29:01,080
make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

435
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:04,417
Look, my love...
it won't fit me.

436
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:06,252
Try it on.

437
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:07,546
Come here.

438
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,422
That's it.

439
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:10,923
Good, right?

440
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:14,511
One...

441
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:17,889
- two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!

442
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,432
Three.

443
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,269
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

444
00:29:23,353 --> 00:29:25,021
He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?

445
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:27,982
Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

446
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:31,653
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

447
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,238
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

448
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:35,407
He looks very handsome, son.

449
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,825
Like a fag model, isn't that right?

450
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,830
The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

451
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,252
Welcome to the United States.

452
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:50,004
Thank you.
Have a great day.

453
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:50,963
Next, please.

454
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:54,842
His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder,

455
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:59,806
half Colombian, half German,
and 100 percent playboy.

456
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:03,184
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

457
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,061
Go figure.

458
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:09,065
Back in '79, this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

459
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:10,734
on a fleet of small planes.

460
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:12,736
- What's up?
- What's up, son?

461
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,862
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

462
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,466
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

463
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:18,157
Whoo! It's so hot.

464
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:20,118
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

465
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,578
You like my jacket, brother?

466
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:24,790
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

467
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,419
I was in jail for a while, remember?

468
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,548
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

469
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:36,426
What you got there
is the perfect product.

470
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,970
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

471
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,889
It's gonna fuck up their brains,
that's for sure.

472
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,015
Yes, sir.

473
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:47,895
Here you go.

474
00:30:49,355 --> 00:30:51,483
Go on. There are five kilos.

475
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:53,318
Where are you going?

476
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:55,987
I'm gonna get another jacket,
brother.

477
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,406
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

478
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,288
The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.

479
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:07,666
Drugs in, cash out.

480
00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:11,002
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

481
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:14,547
And in no time,
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

482
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:18,217
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes,

483
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:20,679
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

484
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:23,765
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

485
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,393
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

486
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:29,937
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

487
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,817
Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,
going back and forth every day...

488
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,987
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

489
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,448
Pretty soon,
the Lion had to come up with new ways

490
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,617
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

491
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,328
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

492
00:31:45,411 --> 00:31:47,914
You guys are pilots,

493
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:51,376
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

494
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,298
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

495
00:31:58,925 --> 00:32:00,343
We'll take four.

496
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:01,887
All right, much better.

497
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:06,683
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

498
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:09,811
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

499
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,437
- See you later.
- Later.

500
00:32:12,856 --> 00:32:14,148
Come in, please.

501
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:22,031
Look, here are the packets.

502
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:25,702
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

503
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:27,078
Easy, right?

504
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:29,706
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

505
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:30,874
All right?

506
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:33,042
But with you two,
we have a problem.

507
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,044
You girls are pregnant, right?

508
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:39,758
That's good, because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

509
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:44,679
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

510
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,891
And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

511
00:32:47,974 --> 00:32:50,435
All right? All right. Perfect.

512
00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:54,355
During the early '80s,
most flights out of Bogotá

513
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,274
had several mules on them.

514
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:58,443
They didn't even know about each other.

515
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:00,111
And you know what?

516
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:04,323
Getting in was easy, because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

517
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,367
All we cared about was grass.

518
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:13,959
Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

519
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:18,087
Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...
anything.

520
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:37,148
But even that didn't do it.

521
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:42,487
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

522
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,700
Do you trust this guy?

523
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:50,369
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

524
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:53,539
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.

525
00:33:53,623 --> 00:33:55,249
But he's got good routes.

526
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,964
- Amigos!
- Hello, Carlos.

527
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:02,423
Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.

528
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,758
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

529
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,682
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

530
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,763
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

531
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,348
Smooth.

532
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:11,683
Let's get down to business.

533
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:15,645
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

534
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:18,982
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

535
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:21,776
- How far?
- Miami.

536
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:28,240
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- 1000 kilos?

537
00:34:28,324 --> 00:34:30,076
Counting the gasoline.

538
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,003
Carlos...

539
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,005
Yes?

540
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:49,428
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

541
00:34:49,512 --> 00:34:53,307
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

542
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,142
We'll leave the engine, right?

543
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:57,937
How much more?

544
00:34:58,021 --> 00:35:00,439
About... 300 more.

545
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,486
All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

546
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:09,908
Within months after meeting Cockroach,

547
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:15,080
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

548
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,751
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics, folks.

549
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,922
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

550
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,506
in the middle of the jungle.

551
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:30,553
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest,

552
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:35,641
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

553
00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:41,940
We brought you a little present.

554
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,317
Brazilians.

555
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:50,197
Best asses in the world,
believe me.

556
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,784
No, I'm not feeling well.

557
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,410
- What's up, Cuca?
- Hello.

558
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,370
Hey, Gustavo.

559
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:59,832
What the fuck is up with you guys?

560
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:02,585
You're flying around in planes...

561
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:04,963
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look, Cuca...

562
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:07,715
Look, let us explain what we have to...

563
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,467
Wait.

564
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,845
From now on,
in all of my labs...

565
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:17,516
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning, with a pool...

566
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,019
- And whores from Brazil.
- And whores from Brazil.

567
00:36:20,103 --> 00:36:22,521
- Just for you.
- One problem.

568
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:26,525
These are my labs. Mm?

569
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:36,619
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

570
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:39,122
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

571
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:42,458
Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

572
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:46,212
They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.

573
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:49,507
Guys used to getting what they want,
one way or another.

574
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:53,302
How something like this
can make so much money!

575
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:57,556
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

576
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,600
What do you think, Pablo?

577
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,061
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

578
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:03,813
I wouldn't get involved.

579
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:07,150
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

580
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,485
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

581
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:13,948
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

582
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,951
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

583
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,746
the Peruvians will raise the price.

584
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:24,750
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

585
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:28,254
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

586
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:33,092
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

587
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,555
You need a lot of creativity for that.

588
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:41,809
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

589
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:45,688
You deliver the product to me, labeled.

590
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:49,316
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

591
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,986
Better yet, Lehder will do it.

592
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,156
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,

593
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,744
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

594
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:01,662
The potato business is ours.
We don't need...

595
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:03,497
Deal?

596
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:07,919
Deal.

597
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:10,213
Sounds good to me.

598
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:15,676
All right,
I will create my own routes

599
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,305
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

600
00:38:19,388 --> 00:38:21,266
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.

601
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:23,726
Partners?

602
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:30,608
We know your policy toward partners.

603
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:33,861
Let's just call us...

604
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,696
"friendly associates."

605
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:38,991
To Miami.

606
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,160
To Miami!

607
00:38:51,337 --> 00:38:55,841
When I started, a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

608
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:05,768
And before long,
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

609
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,316
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

610
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:20,325
Truth is,
we weren't even making a dent.

611
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:24,578
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

612
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,007
Pablo's coke flooded in.

613
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:39,551
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

614
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:41,095
And I mean that.

615
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:45,350
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

616
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,353
And with the money...

617
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:51,314
came the violence.

618
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,484
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians,

619
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:58,237
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

620
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,223
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

621
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:29,143
Use 'em once,
then throw 'em away.

622
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,648
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.

623
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,609
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

624
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:39,653
to hold all the extra corpses.

625
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:43,699
That was the first person I ever shot.

626
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,161
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

627
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:09,975
Hey... it was self-defense.

628
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:13,145
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

629
00:41:14,063 --> 00:41:16,148
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

630
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:18,776
He sells drugs, right?

631
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:22,071
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then fuck him.

632
00:41:29,078 --> 00:41:30,371
What happened?

633
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,210
- Coming through!
- I was about to finish my shift

634
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,545
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

635
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,964
Stay with me.

636
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:41,692
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

637
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,719
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

638
00:41:45,928 --> 00:41:49,265
By the time she got to us,
she was barely breathing.

639
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:53,102
- Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils, rapid pulse.

640
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:55,646
I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...

641
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:59,442
but she had no residue on her nostrils,
no injection marks.

642
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,654
We did everything we could.

643
00:42:04,738 --> 00:42:06,365
She died in the ER.

644
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:10,536
We tried to save the baby...

645
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:18,085
The baby died in my hands.

646
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,340
I'm so sorry.

647
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,093
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

648
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,720
Two of the pellets split open.

649
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:34,268
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

650
00:42:36,562 --> 00:42:38,272
No one survives that.

651
00:42:45,904 --> 00:42:49,325
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

652
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:53,120
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

653
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,373
Tell me something, Cockroach.

654
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:58,083
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

655
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:01,670
Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

656
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:06,717
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

657
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,594
Let me give you a piece of advice.

658
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:12,056
Never say that to Pablo.

659
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:15,142
He's not as forgiving as I am.

660
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:23,234
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.

661
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:26,695
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

662
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:30,616
Instead, he found another way
to get his fair share.

663
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:36,038
Stop!

664
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:48,509
What do you have in the spare tires?

665
00:43:51,303 --> 00:43:54,681
390 kilos, Pablo.
We lost it.

666
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,019
Gustavo, what do you mean
"we lost it"?

667
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,979
Just what I said, we lost it.

668
00:44:02,064 --> 00:44:07,194
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

669
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:10,322
Don't mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.

670
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:13,700
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

671
00:44:14,993 --> 00:44:16,120
Look...

672
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:22,418
we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

673
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:26,422
So how did we lose a load, brother?

674
00:44:26,505 --> 00:44:29,883
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

675
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,469
Know what I mean?

676
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,809
And how much is he asking?

677
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:41,395
Too much.

678
00:44:47,443 --> 00:44:48,944
What are you going to do?

679
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:51,656
Come back, Pablo.

680
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,076
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

681
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,828
Where are you going, Pablo?

682
00:44:58,537 --> 00:44:59,788
Pablo?

683
00:45:50,506 --> 00:45:51,923
What's going on, brother?

684
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,260
Mr. Escobar...

685
00:45:56,637 --> 00:45:59,640
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

686
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:07,272
Eat. Shit.

687
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,860
What if I shot you in the head?

688
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,961
Are you sure about this, Colonel?

689
00:46:32,464 --> 00:46:35,426
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

690
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:39,846
We're DAS, Ibarra.

691
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,890
What's that faggot gonna do?

692
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:46,895
There we are.

693
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:48,773
No, lower, lower.

694
00:46:48,855 --> 00:46:50,190
No that low.

695
00:46:52,735 --> 00:46:54,361
Ready.

696
00:46:58,824 --> 00:47:00,826
Another one, another one.
I'm ready.

697
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:07,499
Pablo didn't know it then...

698
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:11,336
but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

699
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:17,301
Remove the handcuffs.

700
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,141
You can go now, officer.

701
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:27,144
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.

702
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:36,278
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

703
00:47:38,196 --> 00:47:43,201
That's a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.

704
00:47:43,952 --> 00:47:46,371
And you only gave us $150,000.

705
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:50,501
Well, that's what we agreed upon.

706
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,545
You know something?

707
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:56,674
I make deals for a living.

708
00:47:56,757 --> 00:48:01,804
Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

709
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:08,686
Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

710
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:11,313
and everyone goes home happy.

711
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:14,983
Deal?

712
00:48:23,158 --> 00:48:25,536
I'll give you one million dollars...

713
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,122
under one condition.

714
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:32,042
What is it?

715
00:48:34,127 --> 00:48:38,006
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

716
00:48:39,174 --> 00:48:41,385
Otherwise, how would you know?

717
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,307
Give me a name...

718
00:48:49,518 --> 00:48:52,688
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

719
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:59,820
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

720
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:03,073
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities,

721
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:06,827
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami, too.

722
00:49:08,871 --> 00:49:14,125
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata,
a Colombian with a plumbing business

723
00:49:14,209 --> 00:49:16,921
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

724
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:22,843
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

725
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,723
The plan was to trade vehicles,

726
00:49:27,806 --> 00:49:30,893
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

727
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:35,105
1200 kilos.

728
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:38,024
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

729
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,612
OK, gringos.

730
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:43,697
How's the plumbing business?

731
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:45,115
Fine.

732
00:49:48,577 --> 00:49:51,580
- How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

733
00:49:53,373 --> 00:49:55,500
Come on, amigo.
I'll show you.

734
00:49:57,085 --> 00:49:58,629
Everything was going perfect.

735
00:49:58,837 --> 00:50:03,717
Like I said, amigo...
100 percent pure.

736
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,719
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

737
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:08,472
Got a full load here, Murph...

738
00:50:16,062 --> 00:50:18,690
Don't move! Don't move.

739
00:50:18,774 --> 00:50:21,902
Don't move! Don't move.

740
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:23,278
Get down!

741
00:50:26,698 --> 00:50:29,034
Hands! Down!

742
00:50:29,117 --> 00:50:30,201
Don't look at me.

743
00:50:33,705 --> 00:50:34,915
Fucking...

744
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:59,064
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz,

745
00:50:59,147 --> 00:51:02,275
after taking into account
all due considerations,

746
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:07,572
bail has been set at two million dollars,
or a bond of $200,000.

747
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:12,243
I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

748
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:15,413
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

749
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:21,086
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars,

750
00:51:21,169 --> 00:51:25,883
paid by a wire transfer from, well...
why don't you take a guess?

751
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:30,428
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.

752
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:39,563
From '79 to '84,
there were 3,245 murders in Miami.

753
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:42,858
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops,

754
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:45,360
no one much cared about that.

755
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:49,907
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

756
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:54,536
Billions of dollars a year,
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

757
00:51:55,537 --> 00:51:58,623
And that... America couldn't take.

758
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:04,462
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

759
00:52:04,671 --> 00:52:08,717
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

760
00:52:09,634 --> 00:52:14,098
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

761
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:17,601
Whatever it was, the businessmen
came at just the right time.

762
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:20,520
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

763
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:23,982
It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

764
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:27,235
Drugs are menacing our society.

765
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:30,864
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

766
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:33,033
They're killing our children.

767
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:34,910
It was classic Reagan.

768
00:52:34,993 --> 00:52:37,913
Folksy, direct and tough.

769
00:52:37,996 --> 00:52:41,249
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

770
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,668
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

771
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:47,965
So to my young friends out there,
life can be great.

772
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:50,175
But not when you can't see it.

773
00:52:50,258 --> 00:52:55,472
So open your eyes to life, to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

774
00:52:55,555 --> 00:52:57,849
as a precious gift to His children.

775
00:52:57,933 --> 00:52:59,935
Say yes to your life.

776
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:04,314
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

777
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:06,858
No, no, no!
No, Pablo, no, no!

778
00:53:06,942 --> 00:53:08,026
No, no!

779
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:16,034
They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world,

780
00:53:16,118 --> 00:53:18,120
only the cockroaches will survive.

781
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:20,330
Leave that piece of shit there.

782
00:53:20,413 --> 00:53:22,290
I guess they were wrong.

783
00:53:24,126 --> 00:53:27,337
During his career,
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

784
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:30,132
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

785
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:39,933
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

786
00:53:40,142 --> 00:53:42,186
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

787
00:53:43,145 --> 00:53:44,604
No way.

788
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:49,818
He was a West Virginia farm boy,
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

789
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:53,613
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

790
00:53:54,656 --> 00:53:56,158
It was his duty.

791
00:53:57,826 --> 00:53:59,953
Cocaine in Miami?

792
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:01,955
Kilos from Colombia?

793
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,333
This was my war.

794
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:07,919
This was my duty.

795
00:54:08,003 --> 00:54:09,796
And I was ready to fight it.

796
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,465
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me, too.

797
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,758
Your ticket, please.

798
00:54:15,135 --> 00:54:16,302
OK.

799
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,389
We had no idea
what we were in for.

800
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:25,062
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

801
00:54:25,145 --> 00:54:26,813
OK, man, what do we got?

802
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:30,025
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

803
00:54:30,108 --> 00:54:31,442
We got Lizard.

804
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,320
Uh...

805
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,822
We got, we got...

806
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,536
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

807
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:44,289
- Thank you for the gift, agent.
- No problem.

808
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,975
If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world,

809
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:07,062
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

810
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:11,775
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

811
00:55:13,068 --> 00:55:16,947
In the world of drug dealers,
you do what you think is right...

812
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:19,908
and hope for the best.

813
00:55:21,034 --> 00:55:23,620
Look at what happened, boss.

814
00:55:23,703 --> 00:55:26,039
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

815
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:31,920
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

816
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:35,132
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

817
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:41,888
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo, sir?

818
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:47,769
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

819
00:55:47,852 --> 00:55:49,313
Half a million?

820
00:55:49,395 --> 00:55:50,605
Do it.

821
00:55:50,688 --> 00:55:52,190
As you wish, sir.

822
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,447
Fucking gringos.
