Oliver, where have you been?

-I've been busy. What's wrong?

-It's your mother.
-She'll do fine.

No, she won't.

335

She's not using this event to rally the troops.
She's using it...

00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,197
It's a motorcycle accident. It was stupid.

in as many weeks...

-Mark says you're dropping out of the race.

on repairing our relationship.

345

What's happening with Thea now isn't because
you weren't spending enough time with her.

346
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,347
Well, maybe not. But I have to do something,
and I'm not sure what else to do.

347

Thea hates you right now

write up at dossier on you.

against a fraudulent claim of paternity.

Well, the baby is Oliver's.
