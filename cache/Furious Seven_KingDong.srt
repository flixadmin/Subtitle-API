1
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,977
They say if you want to glimpse
the future, just look behind you.

2
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,432
I used to think that was bollocks.

3
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:03,612
But now I realize...

4
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:11,403
...you can't outrun the past.

5
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:22,073
When we were kids, you'd start fights
with the toughest bastards in the yard.

6
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,297
But I was the one who had to step in 
and finish them.

7
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,366
You'd steal from the corner shop,

8
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,972
but it was me 
who'd brave the old man's belt.

9
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:42,809
I'd hoped you'd outgrown it.

10
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:51,501
That playing the gangster
made you harder, smarter, better.

11
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:56,057
But deep down, I guess I always
knew you'd end up like this,

12
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:58,974
despite everything I did teach you.

13
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,784
Still, you're my flesh and blood.

14
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:08,174
So you remain my cross to bear.

15
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,737
Rest now, little brother,
while I settle your one last score.

16
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,174
You take care of my brother.

17
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:39,619
Anything happens to him,
I will come by looking for you.

18
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,326
Here. Hold this.

19
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,811
Grenade!

20
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,587
Come on, Dom.
So where are you taking me?

21
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:57,771
They say an open road helps you think about
where you have been, where you're going.

22
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,164
So you don't remember any of this yet?

23
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:03,891
That's not fair.

24
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:06,360
You know I don't.

25
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:13,149
So what is it exactly that
you're trying to show me?

26
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:15,444
That.

27
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,068
Race Wars.

28
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:24,915
We used to come here?

29
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,091
"Come here"?

30
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,922
We invented it.

31
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:12,069
Keep it under 9,000 RPMs.

32
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:14,954
Kid's going to fry his pistons
after the first 200.

33
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,110
You know that's not my style.
I got to ride or die, right?

34
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,040
How about you just ride on this one?

35
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:42,776
Are you ready?

36
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,696
I know you're ready!

37
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:01,979
Go!

38
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,132
Hey, nice job.

39
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,611
Hey!

40
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,212
That's the girl I heard so much about.

41
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:57,578
Where you been at, ghost girl?

42
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,087
Ghost girl.

43
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:16,326
Letty, what the hell?

44
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:17,537
Huh?

45
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,578
Damn, dawg!
Girl's still got that swing, homie.

46
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,428
You never could take a punch.

47
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:32,591
Right, right.

48
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:35,570
Hey, man. I am glad you're back, man.
It's good to see you!

49
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,326
Good to see you, Hector.

50
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:58,709
All right. We made it, Jack.

51
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:01,270
- Yeah, we made it!
- Yeah, we made it.

52
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:03,350
Now I just got to find that door button.

53
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:05,580
Buddy, where's the door button at?
Do you know?

54
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:06,463
Hi.

55
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:07,438
Hey.

56
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,867
Yeah, of course. I am new to this.

57
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:12,381
Yeah, you don't seem like the minivan type.

58
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:13,531
No, not exactly.

59
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,680
Hey, buddy, 
you going to give me a high five?

60
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:17,676
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, high five!
All right. Yeah, buddy.

61
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,101
Appreciate it. Thank you.

62
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:21,068
Don't worry.
You will get used to this in no time.

63
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,819
Yeah, that's what I am afraid of.

64
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,818
First time I saw this,

65
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:02,504
I thought it was kind of funny.

66
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,737
I guess now the joke's on me.

67
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,561
What are you doing?

68
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:15,709
What I should have done a long time ago.

69
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,094
Stop it!

70
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:20,998
Look at it.

71
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,008
It's the truth.

72
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:27,358
That's the date that I lost my memory.

73
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:32,983
That's the date that Letty died...
and I was born.

74
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,568
No. You never died.

75
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,222
Do you know how hard it is for me 
when you look at me

76
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,040
and you see me through
15 years of memories?

77
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:44,784
Every beautiful moment we have ever had.

78
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,052
I see it in your eyes.

79
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,610
I can't give that to you.

80
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,915
I got nothing.

81
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:53,415
You got me.

82
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:56,904
And you have got only a piece of me.

83
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,592
I have to find myself.

84
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,149
For me.

85
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,776
Goodbye, Dom.

86
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:42,224
You're disappointed, aren't you?

87
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,460
What are you talking about?

88
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:45,961
The last arrest.

89
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,828
He was too easy. Target didn't even run.

90
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:50,056
Ah, it's okay.

91
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:55,813
Gives me a chance to hit the iron.
Also lets me work on my stamping skills.

92
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,453
You're a terrible liar.

93
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,812
See you tomorrow, boss.

94
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,835
- I will see you then.
- Don't stay too late.

95
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,684
I will stay as long as I want, woman.

96
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:07,477
I knew you would say that.

97
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,971
Elena?

98
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,149
What's this?

99
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:32,059
It's the letter of recommendation 
you asked for.

100
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,266
Just know I meant every word in there.

101
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,938
Thanks, Hobbs. Thanks for everything.

102
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:46,438
Come on, way too sentimental right now.

103
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:49,555
- Get home. Good night.
- Okay. Good night.

104
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:25,851
Just one sec.

105
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,153
You sure as hell ain't the IT guy.

106
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,815
So you better start talking before
I break that finger six different ways

107
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,256
and stick it right 
where the sun doesn't shine.

108
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,512
Agent Hobbs, right?

109
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,536
That's right.

110
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,899
I am also the last man on Earth 
whose computer you want to be hacking into.

111
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,394
You just earned yourself
a dance with the devil, boy.

112
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,731
You're under arrest.

113
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:56,012
I don't care about your computer.

114
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:59,043
I am here for the team
that crippled my brother.

115
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,970
There ain't no goddamn team. 
It was just one man,

116
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,669
and he's standing right in front of you.

117
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,660
The lady was right.

118
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,957
You are a terrible liar.

119
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:21,501
Goddamn IT guys.

120
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,418
Hobbs!

121
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,574
On me!

122
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:49,564
Elena!

123
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,439
Hobbs?

124
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:15,251
Hobbs!

125
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,243
All right, buddy. We got to go.
We're going to be late.

126
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,737
Come on.

127
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:53,939
Okay, what do you think?
Parking brake slide right up to the school?

128
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:55,351
Where's Mommy?

129
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:58,486
I don't know. She's up there.
She's coming.

130
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:03,559
Here we go.

131
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:05,384
Watch your head.

132
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,239
Dom, you have a package out here!
It's from Tokyo.

133
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:11,750
Tokyo?

134
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,697
What? Is Han trying to convert me 
over to a turbocharger?

135
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:16,385
All right, you ready?

136
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,011
There we go.

137
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,584
Hey, buddy. Cars don't fly.

138
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,618
Hey, cars don't fly.

139
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,225
This one did, huh?

140
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,772
Brian in a minivan. Things have changed.

141
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,147
He's struggling, Dom.

142
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,756
He doesn't want me to see it,

143
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:35,532
but the white picket fence is like
an anchor on him. I can tell.

144
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:39,860
I tried to talk to him the other night.
You know what he said?

145
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:44,837
He doesn't miss the girls. He doesn't miss 
the cars. He misses the bullets.

146
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,461
Let him settle in. Give him time.

147
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:50,860
How does nine months sound?

148
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:55,923
I am having another baby.

149
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:03,150
And you didn't tell him, did you?

150
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,993
You got to tell him.

151
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,740
I don't want him to be disappointed 
with his life.

152
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,150
With me.

153
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,585
He will never be disappointed with you.

154
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,226
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

155
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:26,804
Thank you.

156
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:37,676
Yeah?

157
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,906
Dominic Toretto.

158
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,696
You don't know me. You're about to.

159
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:47,804
Get down!

160
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,047
Jack!

161
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:14,343
Jack!

162
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:50,152
Shattered his collarbone,
fractured his leg in two places.

163
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,289
He only regained consciousness 
this morning.

164
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:55,633
The first thing he said was, "Get me Dom."

165
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,117
He's in there.

166
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,044
Are you okay?

167
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,992
I am fine.

168
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:18,018
He's waiting. Let's go.

169
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,133
Got something for you.

170
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,216
Your files.

171
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,406
Thank you.

172
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,676
You risk life and limb to save 
the free world and what do they give you?

173
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:44,078
Jell-O and a bad '70s TV show.

174
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,374
You know, it's got its perks.

175
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:51,311
- Sponge baths ain't that bad.
- Dad!

176
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:52,496
I am sorry, baby.

177
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:53,851
"Dad"?

178
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:57,617
Honey, I want to introduce you
to somebody. He's a, uh...

179
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:00,250
He's an old friend.

180
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:01,595
Go on and say hello.

181
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:03,464
Dominic Toretto, right?

182
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,562
My dad said he kicked your ass once.

183
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:08,695
Young lady, watch your mouth.

184
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:14,010
Your dad's on heavy pain meds.

185
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,209
I can understand 
if his history is a little hazy.

186
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:17,996
I doubt it.

187
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,132
All right, honey, that's enough. I want you
to go get something to eat with Elena

188
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:23,219
while me and Toretto have a talk.
You hear me?

189
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:26,172
- Come on, lady. Let's get some cookies.
- Watch that mouth.

190
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,206
Who did this?

191
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,570
You remember Owen Shaw?

192
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,226
The one we tore half of London down
trying to get.

193
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:41,383
Well, this is his big bad brother.

194
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,263
Take a look at this.

195
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:50,916
Deckard Shaw.

196
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:53,153
British Special Forces assassin.

197
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:57,422
The kind of unique asset that no
government would ever admit to employing.

198
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:58,732
Black Ops boys.

199
00:21:58,757 --> 00:22:01,016
Worse. They created a monster.

200
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,412
They felt Shaw was a necessary evil

201
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:08,976
until eventually,
they decided he was unnecessary.

202
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:13,473
The powers that be felt that he knew
just a little bit too much.

203
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,334
The asset became a liability.

204
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,516
So they sent in 20 elite operatives 
to retire him.

205
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,039
And they missed.

206
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,913
That was six years ago,
and Shaw's been a ghost ever since.

207
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:24,095
Until now.

208
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,014
How do I find him?

209
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,031
The official answer is, you don't.

210
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,733
He killed Han. Almost killed my family.

211
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,945
He also tried to put me
in a body bag, too.

212
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,739
Which is why when I get out, I am
going to put a hurt on him so bad

213
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,725
he's going to wish his mama
had kept her legs closed.

214
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,226
But until then,
my official answer to you...

215
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:50,225
...is stand down.

216
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,332
Now, you know I can't do that.

217
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:53,733
I do know you, Dom.

218
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:57,859
Which is why now I give you
the brother-to-brother answer.

219
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,594
You do whatever it is you got to do.

220
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:05,020
When you find that sumbitch,
just do me one favor.

221
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:06,578
What's that?

222
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,625
Don't miss.

223
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:21,696
Thank you so much for letting us stay, 
Mando. I hope it's not a problem.

224
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,989
Listen, Dom needed a safe delivered
to Rio in two days. That was a problem.

225
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:29,494
Hosting his family in 
the Dominican Republic, that is vacation.

226
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:32,899
Anyone messes with you here,
they mess with the entire country.

227
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:34,281
You will be safe.

228
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:45,653
Yeah, yeah, they're here.
I picked them up myself at the airport.

229
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,625
Hold on.

230
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:47,709
Your brother.

231
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:49,305
Dom.

232
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,539
Yeah, Mia, it's me. How's it going there?

233
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,476
We're at Mando's. 
This place is like a fortress.

234
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,800
You should see Brian.
He's in full FBI mode.

235
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:01,139
He built a surveillance hub in
Mando's garage and everything.

236
00:24:01,478 --> 00:24:03,876
What about you?
Did you find out who's after us?

237
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,823
Looks like the sins of London
have followed us home.

238
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:08,491
How did Buster take the news?

239
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:12,012
I can't tell him. If he knew about
the baby, he'd stay here with us.

240
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:15,173
And with all that's going on,
you're going to need him by your side.

241
00:24:15,198 --> 00:24:18,229
Just watch out for him. Keep him safe.

242
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,387
And come home together.

243
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:23,383
Tell Brian I will see him in LA 
in two days.

244
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:24,843
Where are you going?

245
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:26,172
Tokyo.

246
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,648
I am bringing Han home.

247
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:32,033
Authorities are still trying to determine

248
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:34,776
the motive behind this daring attack 
here at the office

249
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:38,332
of the US Diplomatic Security Service 
in downtown Los Angeles

250
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:40,719
less than 36 hours ago.

251
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:42,875
Facts are still coming in,

252
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,937
but what is known is the suspect
entered the building's fourth floor...

253
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:48,693
Hey.

254
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:50,820
- You okay?
- Yeah.

255
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:54,641
This guy's just relentless.

256
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,576
That's why Dom needs you.

257
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:01,534
You two need to find this guy
and you need to stop him

258
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,375
before he does any more damage
to our family.

259
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,562
You know, I just...

260
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,297
I have screwed up so many things.

261
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:15,004
I couldn't live with myself
if I screw this up, too.

262
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:16,704
You won't.

263
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,733
I believe in you.

264
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:23,099
I believe in us.
That's all that matters.

265
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,139
I love you, Brian.

266
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,256
I love you, baby.

267
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:45,180
Just promise me, after this, we're done.
No more jobs, no more enemies.

268
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,269
Come back to us.

269
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:49,219
I won't let you down, Mia.

270
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,211
I know.

271
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,031
Hey, yo, Sean!

272
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,461
Hey, check this out, man.

273
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,959
This dude over here
want to race the new DK.

274
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:14,687
Not tonight, Twinkie.

275
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,031
Said he knew Han.

276
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:28,500
Han said you was fast,
but not that damn fast.

277
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:31,906
Who said American muscle can't drift?

278
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,328
Han mentioned he left his enemies
in his rearview.

279
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:39,750
He never talked about it much.

280
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:43,328
Always playing it close to the vest.

281
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,969
We found a couple things by the crash.

282
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:53,419
Wasn't much left.

283
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:01,809
Gisele.

284
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,559
Oh, yeah.

285
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,014
There's one more thing.

286
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,317
I found this.

287
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:19,879
Must have meant something to him.

288
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,492
When you find the guy that killed Han,

289
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,488
what are you going to do?

290
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,160
Words ain't even been invented yet.

291
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,177
They say to live in the hearts
of those we leave behind....

292
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,772
...is not to die.

293
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:00,395
But he put you in this grave.

294
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,161
So now I will do the same to him.

295
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,848
I can't do no more funerals.

296
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,469
First, Han.

297
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:19,341
Now Hobbs is laid up, of all people.

298
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,455
We're being hunted.

299
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,416
You know he's out there
somewhere watching, right?

300
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:37,496
I hope so.

301
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,260
Means he's close.

302
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:42,551
Just promise me, Brian,

303
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,875
no more funerals.

304
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,581
Just one more.

305
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:51,544
His.

306
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,132
You never should have messed 
with a man's family.

307
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:42,543
I told your brother the same thing.

308
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,395
Reinforced your chassis.

309
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,574
It's like going into a ring
with weighted gloves.

310
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,918
Your mistake.

311
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,332
I am not here to play games.

312
00:31:54,357 --> 00:31:58,356
See, you and me,
we're from different worlds.

313
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,100
Trust me, I have seen a lot meaner streets
than the ones you're used to.

314
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:03,754
Stick around.

315
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,028
It's going to get a lot meaner.

316
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,684
You thought 
this was going to be a street fight?

317
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,215
On the ground.

318
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,911
Now!

319
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,880
Drop him or I will drop you!

320
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,996
Whoa, whoa. Easy, guys.
We're on the same team here.

321
00:32:43,185 --> 00:32:47,555
Mr. Toretto, I am here on the
recommendation of a mutual friend of ours.

322
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,414
- Mr. Hobbs.
- Who the hell are you?

323
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:51,219
Me? I am just a guy.

324
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:53,280
I am Mr. Nobody.

325
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,932
It's a big entrance for a nobody.

326
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,292
And the guy that put our mutual friend 
in the hospital?

327
00:32:59,772 --> 00:33:01,305
You just let him get away.

328
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,777
I think I might have just
saved your ass there, Dom.

329
00:33:04,802 --> 00:33:07,131
Listen, you think you could
let go of my guy there?

330
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:09,556
He's beginning to turn a little blue.

331
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,519
I appreciate that.

332
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,910
Ah, here they come.

333
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:22,137
Listen, Dom. There's a war going on
between shadows and ghosts like me.

334
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:26,454
You and your team unwittingly walked
into the middle of it in London,

335
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:29,058
and it appears it's now followed you home.

336
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,215
It's up to you.

337
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:35,206
I am going to have a beer.

338
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,191
You're welcome to join me.

339
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,113
By the way, I can get you Deckard Shaw.

340
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:54,269
Belgian ale.

341
00:33:57,025 --> 00:33:59,596
Oh, man, those monks got it right.

342
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,613
I mean, I don't know about
the whole celibacy thing,

343
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:03,692
but when it comes to beer...

344
00:34:04,734 --> 00:34:05,902
Would you like one?

345
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:08,064
I am more of a Corona man myself.

346
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:09,171
Ah...

347
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:19,256
Your file's not only detailed,
it's, uh, extremely entertaining.

348
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:28,114
Look, Shaw's power is that he's a shadow.

349
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,483
He's really good at getting in and
out of places without being seen

350
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,615
and leaving nothing 
but a body count in his wake.

351
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:37,032
I mean, he's a legitimate English badass.

352
00:34:37,057 --> 00:34:40,814
But to be honest with you, Dom,
I don't give two shits about Deckard Shaw.

353
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:42,255
It's you I want.

354
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,607
Because you and I can help each other
get what we both need.

355
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:48,996
I am listening.

356
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,661
Just recently a private military company

357
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:54,320
led by a wanted terrorist
named Mose Jakande

358
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,207
kidnapped a hacker known only 
by the name "Ramsey".

359
00:34:57,232 --> 00:35:00,179
Now, Lady Liberty's got her panties
in a bunch over this, but rightfully so,

360
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:03,318
because this Ramsey has created
something interesting.

361
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,967
- Bring it up.
- Yes, sir.

362
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:08,396
Say hello to God's Eye.

363
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:11,335
Now, this little bastard hacks into
anything that's on the digital network.

364
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,377
That means every cell phone, satellite,
ATM machine and computer. Simultaneously.

365
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:20,160
If it's got a microphone or a lens,
God's Eye can find you.

366
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,576
So you invited me here to
show me a tracking device.

367
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:24,698
On steroids. Lots of them.

368
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,374
Let me put it to you this way.

369
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,061
It took us nearly a decade
to find Osama bin Laden.

370
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:33,131
With this, we'd have located him anywhere
on the planet in a couple of hours.

371
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,736
Now, that's a serious piece of machinery

372
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:38,065
that could be catastrophic
in the wrong hands.

373
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,248
But for some very nauseating 
political reasons,

374
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:44,645
any rescue plans involving 
any US government forces or entity

375
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:46,579
has been strictly ruled out.

376
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,037
And that's why I need you.

377
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:52,491
But why do I need you?

378
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:56,967
I mean, I could go back outside,
enjoy the rest of the Coronas,

379
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:58,954
let Shaw come to me.

380
00:35:58,979 --> 00:36:01,781
You could do that.
How's that working out for you so far?

381
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:04,325
You got one friend in the ground,
another one in the hospital.

382
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,615
And then, of course, there's that little
issue of the bomb that destroyed your home.

383
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,115
Shaw lives in a world 
that doesn't play by your rules.

384
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,982
Like it or not,
you live in that world now, too.

385
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:20,073
You want to know how to kill a shadow?

386
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,303
You just shine a little light on it.

387
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:24,235
If you get the God's Eye for me,

388
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,338
I have already got authorization
for you to use it until you get Shaw.

389
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:30,298
You go from the hunted to the hunter.

390
00:36:30,323 --> 00:36:32,803
And there's no place on Earth
Shaw can hide from you.

391
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:40,555
More importantly, you and your family
don't go to any more funerals.

392
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,266
You get Ramsey, you get the God's Eye,

393
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:45,711
you get Shaw.

394
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:49,461
Well, that's the wind-up and the pitch.

395
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,811
Now that I have given you
this incredibly sensitive

396
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,336
and highly classified information,

397
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,180
what do you think, Toretto?

398
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,664
I think you already know
what I am going to do.

399
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:00,929
Good.

400
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,731
But it will be my way. And my crew.

401
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,883
I assumed you might say that.

402
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,657
Which is why I have taken the liberty 
of gathering your team.

403
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:25,852
This is crazy.

404
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,774
What the hell is going on in here?

405
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,375
Our intelligence suggests that Ramsey
will be transported by an armed motorcade

406
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,858
through the Caucasus mountain range.

407
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:40,911
If they clear this range and reach their
destination, Ramsey is as good as gone.

408
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:42,245
So let me get this straight.

409
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,778
There's only one road that leads in or out,
sheer drops on every side,

410
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:51,372
a motorcade from hell protected by a small
army from one mile in either direction?

411
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,732
Yeah, that's about it.

412
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:56,028
- You done?
- No, I am not done.

413
00:37:56,545 --> 00:38:00,289
So you all wanted me to break into
a police station. Fine.

414
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:02,073
Then you asked me to stop a tank.

415
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,065
I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.

416
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,257
Then you came up with this brilliant idea

417
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,581
to shoot down 
one of the largest airplanes ever.

418
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:13,903
I shot that shit out of the sky.
Mmm. It's nothing.

419
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,338
But this right here, my friend,

420
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:20,398
happens to be the stupidest idea
I have ever heard of in my life.

421
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,097
I forgot that you were the only one 
to bring the plane down.

422
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:26,571
No, no. The only thing I have ever seen him
take down was "No Knees" Denise.

423
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,459
Remember, at prom?

424
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,894
Really, Brian?
You're going to do that right here?

425
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,216
See, you all trying to get me off my point.

426
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:38,547
All I am saying is, I am tired of everybody
around me making all the decisions.

427
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,140
This time, I lead.

428
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,631
Seriously. If I don't start
making decisions, I am out.

429
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:45,238
All right, Roman.

430
00:38:45,913 --> 00:38:47,183
What do you got?

431
00:38:48,831 --> 00:38:52,870
I mean, I wasn't trying to get into
the whole leadership thing, like, now.

432
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:56,238
You know what I am saying? I was just, kind
of, talking about, like, at some point.

433
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:57,659
Like, you know, when we...

434
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,589
Whatever. I mean, I think...

435
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:03,735
Let's hit it from here.

436
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,957
- I don't think that that's-
- No, no, no, don't think.

437
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,550
That's my job.

438
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,488
Okay.

439
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:15,066
It is impossible to hit it there.

440
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:18,974
That is literally the most
secure spot on the mountain. Why?

441
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,505
Because you cannot physically access it.

442
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,595
See, that's what makes it so sweet.

443
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,256
Because it's the place that 
they least expect us to hit them from.

444
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,533
As much as I hate to admit it,
he's onto something there.

445
00:39:29,558 --> 00:39:30,808
What do you think, Dom?

446
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,335
- Here?
- Yeah.

447
00:39:35,145 --> 00:39:36,351
I think we got a plan.

448
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,230
Completely wrong thinking.

449
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:40,519
And I like it.

450
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,172
You see? I am good at this.

451
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,956
"Good"? Okay.

452
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,214
How are you planning on 
getting on that road?

453
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,219
Well, Tej?

454
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,769
I think I may actually have a plan 
for that.

455
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,597
What? I delegated.
That's what good leaders do.

456
00:40:01,105 --> 00:40:02,371
Leader!

457
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:04,498
You know, when I was reading your files,

458
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:06,811
I was impressed with what you have
accomplished with your team.

459
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:10,167
But meeting them now,
I have got to say, Dom,

460
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,904
you have truly got a gift.

461
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,689
Consider my workshop your new playhouse.

462
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:23,456
I think you will find our cars 
extremely appealing.

463
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,579
And your team is now complete.

464
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,097
I went to the house.

465
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,993
I was looking for you everywhere.

466
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,118
You scared the shit out of me.

467
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,932
You will never be alone.
Wherever you go...

468
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:54,266
Tell no one.

469
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,001
Where did you find that?

470
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,540
Found in Han's car.

471
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,641
It was left as a message.

472
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:05,962
A message I plan on returning.

473
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,676
Can you ride?

474
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:12,759
Yeah, of course I can. 
Han was my family, too.

475
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:18,476
Brian!

476
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:22,858
We're going to need long-travel suspension,
limited-slip differentials on all of them.

477
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:24,156
How you doing?

478
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:29,258
Tej! I want the demon love child 
between that...

479
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,780
...and that.

480
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:34,270
That's a lot of armor.

481
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:37,421
It's just going to add more weight.
Slow you down.

482
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,821
This time, it ain't just about being fast.

483
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,465
Yeah, I am good.

484
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:55,079
From the streets.
You know what I am saying?

485
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:56,641
It's nothing.

486
00:42:02,465 --> 00:42:04,832
Hey, Roman, you're freaking out, ain't you?

487
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:05,685
No.

488
00:42:05,709 --> 00:42:06,919
Yeah, you are.

489
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,079
I said no.

490
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:11,673
Listen, man, it takes a grown man 
to embrace his feelings.

491
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,329
If you need to cry, just go ahead and cry.

492
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:17,719
As your friend, you know I am concerned
about your well-being,

493
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,245
which is why I took the precaution

494
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:21,635
of putting some adult diapers
in your glove compartment.

495
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:23,392
Yo, can you just chill out, man?

496
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:27,805
I have seen some crazy shit, Dom,
but this really could make some waves.

497
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:31,331
So let's just try to keep it
as low-key as possible, huh?

498
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:32,650
Don't I always?

499
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,587
I will tell you what, you knock it down 
a couple of notches this time

500
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:39,300
and I will swap out my Belgian
for a keg of Corona.

501
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,939
You'd be doing yourself a favor, there.

502
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,011
Can somebody just walk me through
what we're supposed to be doing?

503
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:47,136
Come on, Rom, this is your plan.
You got to embrace it.

504
00:42:47,136 --> 00:42:48,855
No, this was not my plan.

505
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,486
Oh, yeah, here we go. Game time.

506
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:09,554
Roman, you need some fresh air?

507
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:11,494
Because you're about to
get a whole lot of it.

508
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,939
Okay, here we go!

509
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,892
Just when you didn't think
it could get any better, huh?

510
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,525
Oh, shit!

511
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:58,486
Whoo!

512
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,603
Now we're moving.

513
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,773
Everybody good? Everybody make it out?

514
00:44:15,465 --> 00:44:19,056
You just didn't tell them that this is
not for you! This is not your mission!

515
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:22,064
Hey, Rom? Hey, what's up, man?
Talk to me, come on!

516
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,219
- I can't do it.
- The hell you can't!

517
00:44:24,219 --> 00:44:27,534
Come on, man! You throw that thing
in reverse and get your ass out here now!

518
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:29,897
Look, I can't do it, okay?
Listen to what I am saying.

519
00:44:29,897 --> 00:44:31,051
Now isn't the time!

520
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:32,785
I am going to stay up here with the pilot.

521
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,814
We going to circle around and make sure
we holding it down from up here!

522
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,584
You're running out of time!

523
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,739
The chute is guided by GPS!
You don't have to do anything!

524
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:43,485
- Tej!
- I am already on it.

525
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:46,910
Hey, man, listen.
I am sorry to let you all down, okay?

526
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,547
I am going to go ahead and stay up here.

527
00:44:48,572 --> 00:44:50,751
No, brother. I am sorry to let you down.

528
00:44:50,776 --> 00:44:51,396
What?

529
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,158
What do you mean you-

530
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,532
Tej! What are you doing?

531
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,179
Oh, shit!

532
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:09,697
Tej!

533
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,014
I hate you, Tej!

534
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,783
Get ready! Ground's coming fast!

535
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,532
Come on, baby. Come on.

536
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,336
Oh, yeah!

537
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,251
Touchdown, baby!

538
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:23,170
Car check. Call it in.

539
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:24,341
- Check. 
- Check.

540
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,634
I am good. Let's do this.

541
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,145
Hello? Please, man.
Get me out of here, somebody!

542
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,408
No! The trees!

543
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,017
Oh, shit.

544
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,901
Sit tight, Roman.
We will come back for you.

545
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:38,486
This is not the plan!

546
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,915
All right, you got one chance
to hit them here, Dom.

547
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,654
You miss, 
they will make it to their black site

548
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,133
and they will squeeze whatever
information they need out of Ramsey.

549
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:08,054
The device and your chance of ever
getting Shaw will be gone for good.

550
00:47:08,187 --> 00:47:09,540
That ain't going to happen.

551
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,540
I will see you at the pickup.

552
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:17,577
Ramsey will be in the bus.

553
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,851
Then let's do this.

554
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,298
Captain, we have company.
Four cars, inbound.

555
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:45,759
Oh, shit!

556
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,220
- Tej, shield!
- I am on the way.

557
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,306
All right, formation.

558
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,327
Bulletproof, baby.

559
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:14,728
Can't touch this

560
00:48:19,261 --> 00:48:20,262
Punch it!

561
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,054
Strike!

562
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,821
Guns free.

563
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,780
No...

564
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:09,608
Get out of the way!

565
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,715
Those aren't guns,
those are goddamn cannons!

566
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,171
Armor-piercing rounds!

567
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:51,515
Hook them up.

568
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,858
Brian, Tej, blow it!

569
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,931
Lock it up.

570
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,011
Huh?

571
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,358
Brian, you're up.

572
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,225
Little closer, Tej!

573
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:18,538
Ramsey?

574
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:21,263
Stay away from me! Stay back!
Don't you touch me!

575
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,916
My name's Brian.
I am going to get you out of here

576
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:24,541
but I am going to need you
to settle down, all right?

577
00:51:24,568 --> 00:51:26,179
I am going to cut those things off of you.

578
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:42,607
Sir?

579
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,891
Sir, we have 
an unidentified vehicle approaching.

580
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:49,036
Come on! Closer!

581
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:50,105
You're going to have to jump.

582
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,013
- No! No! No!
- We don't have time! Come on!

583
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,364
- We got to get out of here. 
- Come on.

584
00:51:54,396 --> 00:51:56,060
- I am not jumping! 
- Look at me! Look at me!

585
00:51:56,085 --> 00:51:58,886
You don't jump, we're going to die.
Okay?

586
00:51:59,537 --> 00:52:00,737
You're jumping. Come on!

587
00:52:00,737 --> 00:52:01,833
One.

588
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,013
Two!

589
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,335
Well, well, well.

590
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:20,818
Take my hand!

591
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:39,084
Welcome to the party, Mr. Shaw.

592
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,058
Letty, stay with Brian.

593
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:55,604
Oh, shit....

594
00:53:59,585 --> 00:54:01,587
What are you doing? This is crazy!

595
00:54:01,612 --> 00:54:03,042
Keeping you alive.

596
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,622
There's a cliff. Cliff!

597
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:52,438
Cliff! There's a cliff!

598
00:55:29,362 --> 00:55:30,411
Shit....

599
00:56:23,995 --> 00:56:24,964
Too slow.

600
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,050
Yeah!

601
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,378
I am back, bitches!

602
00:58:45,464 --> 00:58:46,572
You good?

603
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,695
Thank you.

604
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,093
- Roman, get back to the others.
- What about you?

605
00:59:07,118 --> 00:59:08,606
Don't worry about me.

606
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,651
I have to say, I am impressed.

607
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:16,206
I would very much like to know the name of
the man who is causing me so much trouble.

608
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:20,731
There's no way out of there.
What is he doing?

609
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,831
He's frozen like a damn deer in headlights.

610
01:00:22,855 --> 01:00:24,735
Toretto ain't no deer.

611
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,375
Come on, Dominic.

612
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:29,659
Give us the girl, and I will let you live.

613
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:31,854
What are you going to do?

614
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,518
You might want to put on your helmet 
for this one.

615
01:00:39,487 --> 01:00:40,488
Helm...

616
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,940
Target the driver.

617
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:55,918
Damn it! What is he thinking?

618
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,655
You're insane!

619
01:01:06,722 --> 01:01:08,659
You're pointing the wrong way.

620
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:10,145
Am I now?

621
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,893
Fire on my mark.

622
01:01:19,736 --> 01:01:20,796
Interesting.

623
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:21,792
Three!

624
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:23,729
Two!

625
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:24,738
Hold on.

626
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:25,831
One!

627
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:28,256
Fire!

628
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,432
Looks like our demon love child worked.

629
01:02:25,457 --> 01:02:27,294
That's one way down a mountain.

630
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,575
Where's Ramsey?

631
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,900
Hello Kitty is awake.

632
01:02:48,573 --> 01:02:50,556
She don't look like a hacker to me.

633
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:53,018
Oh, yeah?
And what do hackers look like?

634
01:02:53,094 --> 01:02:55,181
They don't supposed to look like that.

635
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:57,854
I am just saying, like,

636
01:02:57,879 --> 01:03:01,515
you know how they normally wear them
little, weird glasses that's all crooked,

637
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:04,145
and pimples all over their face
from drinking soda?

638
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,366
I mean, trust me, with a body like that,

639
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:09,323
you ain't going to park it 
behind a computer.

640
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:11,370
How are you feeling?

641
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,150
Did you hit your head?

642
01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:17,483
Feeling nauseous? Ears ringing? No?

643
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,379
Where's my shoe?

644
01:03:19,404 --> 01:03:21,214
Oh, it flew off when you crashed.

645
01:03:21,587 --> 01:03:24,487
If you start experiencing any of
those things, let me know, okay?

646
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:27,209
I don't know whether to
thank you for rescuing me

647
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:29,698
or kick your ass for
throwing me off a cliff.

648
01:03:30,275 --> 01:03:32,401
Thank us or kick our ass, huh?

649
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:36,867
How about you tell us where that device is?

650
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:42,151
I mailed it to a friend. In Abu Dhabi.

651
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:44,380
That was pretty easy.

652
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,131
That other team would have tortured you
for that information.

653
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,487
I didn't trust them. I trust you.

654
01:03:51,425 --> 01:03:54,907
Now, why would you trust us?
You barely know us.

655
01:03:55,253 --> 01:03:56,815
I know enough.

656
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:01,454
Ex-cop. Military, something like that.

657
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:04,859
The way you took out them guys
shows training.

658
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:08,856
Tech guy, offended by the hacker remark, 
naturally.

659
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,015
Alpha.

660
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,460
Mrs. Alpha.

661
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,308
Joker.

662
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:17,651
Wrong.

663
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:21,065
Double alpha.

664
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:23,301
Man candy. You know what I am saying?

665
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,274
Man, sit your candy ass down.

666
01:04:27,259 --> 01:04:29,351
The disrespect is real around here.

667
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:32,055
Life is binary. Zeroes and ones.

668
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,313
Only two things keep a group like this 
together.

669
01:04:34,342 --> 01:04:36,149
Fear or loyalty.

670
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:38,666
And I don't see a drop of fear 
among you guys.

671
01:04:38,681 --> 01:04:40,069
Very impressive.

672
01:04:40,093 --> 01:04:42,884
Just one thing. They're not married.

673
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:45,501
She's so off, it's crazy.
You just going to roll with it?

674
01:04:45,526 --> 01:04:47,948
You're telling me there can't be
a double alpha in one group?

675
01:04:47,973 --> 01:04:49,417
You work for US government?

676
01:04:51,496 --> 01:04:53,100
We got similar interests.

677
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,909
Tej, call it in.

678
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,112
We're going to the Middle East!

679
01:05:09,584 --> 01:05:10,585
Hey.

680
01:05:22,236 --> 01:05:24,791
Hey, Dom. It was pretty wild 
on that mountain, huh?

681
01:05:24,816 --> 01:05:28,792
No, it was too close.
But we got the job done.

682
01:05:31,016 --> 01:05:33,098
You know what the crazy thing is, is...

683
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:35,609
You miss the bullets.

684
01:05:37,246 --> 01:05:39,087
Yeah, that's messed up, huh?

685
01:05:39,112 --> 01:05:42,634
Brian, I have seen you jump
from trains, dive from planes.

686
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:45,784
Hell, I saw your courage
the day I met you.

687
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:47,073
Right.

688
01:05:47,262 --> 01:05:50,292
Want to know the bravest thing 
I ever saw you do?

689
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:53,709
Be a good man to Mia.

690
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:58,026
Being a great father to my nephew, Jack.

691
01:05:59,137 --> 01:06:04,933
Everyone's looking for the thrill,
but what's real is family.

692
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:07,055
Your family.

693
01:06:07,537 --> 01:06:09,346
Hold on to that, Brian.

694
01:07:15,034 --> 01:07:16,589
It's hotter than I thought it would be.

695
01:07:16,614 --> 01:07:19,700
Yeah, well, we are in the desert, 
so it would be hot.

696
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,995
Oh, no, I ain't talking about the weather.

697
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,237
- My, my, my.
- Hmm.

698
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:40,906
Now, that is a woman
that's worth falling out a plane for.

699
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:43,892
Get out of there, man, I got dibs on that.
You have seen me looking at that.

700
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,900
Did you just say "dibs"?
What are you, in the fourth grade?

701
01:07:46,925 --> 01:07:48,340
Man, can you just get out of there?

702
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,667
I mean, it's a free market.

703
01:07:49,692 --> 01:07:51,901
What are you talking about? 
Get out of there.

704
01:07:52,164 --> 01:07:53,878
Rock, paper, scissors for her.

705
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,393
Are you guys for real right now?

706
01:07:56,988 --> 01:07:58,274
Look at you.

707
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:01,284
You both look whupped already.
You got stalker eyes.

708
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,945
I tried to call dibs on Ramsey 
two years ago.

709
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:06,505
Her knee, my balls.

710
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,925
Trust me, you don't want to do that.

711
01:08:09,782 --> 01:08:12,103
Hey! Ramsey!

712
01:08:12,962 --> 01:08:14,787
Hello, Safar.

713
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:18,913
I see you make some new friends.

714
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,976
Yeah, some short-tempered new friends.

715
01:08:20,987 --> 01:08:23,215
I need the speed drive I sent you.
Where is it?

716
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:25,987
Oh, good.
You will be pleased to know I sold it.

717
01:08:26,526 --> 01:08:27,761
You sold it?

718
01:08:27,913 --> 01:08:29,010
You hear that?

719
01:08:29,127 --> 01:08:32,073
I asked you to take care of it.
Why on earth would you sell it?

720
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:33,745
We're going to need it back.

721
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:35,845
Impossible.

722
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:39,003
Safar, I stashed something inside it.
It's important.

723
01:08:39,036 --> 01:08:43,081
Okay, okay. Uh. Good news. It is safe.

724
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:45,215
And the bad news?

725
01:08:45,925 --> 01:08:47,440
It is very safe.

726
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:51,215
I sold it to a Jordanian prince 
living up there.

727
01:08:51,222 --> 01:08:55,101
Trust fund billionaire.
Said he wanted to use it for his supercar.

728
01:08:55,823 --> 01:08:56,962
Now, see, this?

729
01:08:56,987 --> 01:08:59,836
This, I like. Billionaire, supercar...

730
01:08:59,861 --> 01:09:01,663
What makes it so super?

731
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:06,960
242 miles per hour, top speed.
And it's bulletproof.

732
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,745
242...

733
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,858
Am I the only one aroused right now?
It's, like, you know what I am saying?

734
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:16,532
Whatever.

735
01:09:16,571 --> 01:09:18,120
Where does he keep it?

736
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:21,893
In his penthouse. Tower number one.

737
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:25,131
Now, why in the hell would he
keep his car in his penthouse?

738
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,581
He's a billionaire, my friend.
He can do whatever he wants.

739
01:09:28,845 --> 01:09:31,516
Now, tomorrow happens to be
the longest day of the year.

740
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:34,699
The prince wants to celebrate it
and host a party tomorrow afternoon.

741
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:36,491
So you can get us up there, right?

742
01:09:36,515 --> 01:09:38,386
Sure. But, uh....

743
01:09:39,063 --> 01:09:40,729
....not dressed like that.

744
01:10:10,309 --> 01:10:11,310
What?

745
01:10:11,505 --> 01:10:12,950
Is something wrong?

746
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:14,625
There's a billion things wrong.

747
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:17,987
But not in this moment.

748
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:20,041
You look handsome.

749
01:10:20,785 --> 01:10:22,116
I feel awkward.

750
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,309
You and me both.

751
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:29,149
Just seeing you dressed like this
just reminds me of something.

752
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:31,496
Of what?

753
01:10:34,553 --> 01:10:35,714
Old times.

754
01:10:48,622 --> 01:10:49,862
You okay?

755
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:52,109
Yeah. I am fine.

756
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,883
Showtime.

757
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:33,138
No, no, no. Listen, man. They're
telling me they party like this every day.

758
01:11:33,172 --> 01:11:35,014
On this level, they party every day.

759
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:37,102
This is crazy.
I might have to move out here.

760
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,294
I think I am going to start a new culture.

761
01:11:39,318 --> 01:11:41,735
It's called Blarab. 
You know, like "black Arab".

762
01:11:41,735 --> 01:11:43,300
How are we looking, Tej?

763
01:11:43,329 --> 01:11:44,647
We're almost in position.

764
01:11:44,672 --> 01:11:46,499
Okay, so this is how it works.

765
01:11:46,499 --> 01:11:48,405
We got to move in sync
if we're going to pull this off.

766
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:52,250
So let's go over it to make sure
everyone clearly understands their roles.

767
01:11:52,368 --> 01:11:53,647
Roman, that means you.

768
01:11:53,672 --> 01:11:56,190
You know what, you're being real
unprofessional right now, Tej.

769
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:59,891
The God's Eye chip is hidden in a speed
drive installed in the prince's car,

770
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:01,669
which he keeps in a safe room vault.

771
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:03,428
I make 8 to 10 plainclothes security.

772
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:05,618
Not to mention the prince....

773
01:12:06,345 --> 01:12:08,268
...and his personal bodyguards.

774
01:12:08,335 --> 01:12:11,110
Security cameras are clustered by the
north wall. That's where the vault is.

775
01:12:11,135 --> 01:12:14,100
We got to get in that vault, we got
to tap into the security system,

776
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,899
which can be accessed
in the prince's bedroom.

777
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:17,250
All right, guys, I am going in.

778
01:12:20,367 --> 01:12:21,528
Excuse me.

779
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:24,434
Oh, I was just looking for the...

780
01:12:24,459 --> 01:12:26,008
- The party is that way.
- What?

781
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:27,368
This room is off-limit-

782
01:12:33,399 --> 01:12:34,577
Now, once we're tapped in,

783
01:12:34,577 --> 01:12:37,096
Ramsey and I can hack into
the network and pop the door

784
01:12:37,096 --> 01:12:38,615
so you can get in and get that shit.

785
01:12:38,615 --> 01:12:40,340
Wait, wait, wait. You missed a step.

786
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,572
What about my steps?
What am I supposed to be doing?

787
01:12:42,572 --> 01:12:44,175
No, we didn't miss anything.

788
01:12:44,175 --> 01:12:47,736
You're special teams.
So when we need you, do what you do best.

789
01:12:48,024 --> 01:12:49,227
And that is?

790
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:54,000
Shine brightly like 
only Roman Pearce can do.

791
01:12:55,414 --> 01:12:57,098
See? Now we talking.

792
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,493
All right, Tej, I am in.

793
01:12:58,532 --> 01:13:01,215
All right, find the phone jack.
The tap always runs behind that.

794
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:04,419
It's going to be a
350-megahertz CAT5e cable.

795
01:13:04,419 --> 01:13:06,092
They probably got
a couple dozen back there,

796
01:13:06,092 --> 01:13:08,524
but this will be the bonded pair 
with the plenum coat.

797
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,145
English, Tej.

798
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:11,579
It will be the orange wire.

799
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:16,641
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the pilot seat.

800
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,032
All right, Roman.

801
01:13:22,214 --> 01:13:24,430
Do whatever it is you do.

802
01:13:25,065 --> 01:13:26,930
It's your birthday, right?

803
01:13:27,193 --> 01:13:28,296
Are you Jasmine?

804
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,411
Oh, God, no. Not the birthday routine.

805
01:13:30,435 --> 01:13:33,496
Take my hand. Happy birthday to you. 
This way, this way.

806
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:35,652
Excuse me, so sorry.
I am coming through, sorry.

807
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:38,235
Right this way.
Listen, excuse me one second.

808
01:13:38,836 --> 01:13:41,079
- My brother, my brother. 
- Man, you ain't supposed to...

809
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,670
Sir, thank you so much.

810
01:13:42,695 --> 01:13:45,979
All right, listen, people.
Please, everybody, gather around.

811
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:49,865
Understand something, right now.
Listen to what I am telling you all.

812
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:53,975
We are here to celebrate
Jasmine's 18th birthday.

813
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:55,973
Happy birthday, my dear.

814
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:08,844
Oh, I wish I didn't see that.

815
01:14:13,188 --> 01:14:14,694
Ramsey, open it up for us.

816
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,969
Copy that. You're in.

817
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:32,422
Do you realize what this is?

818
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:35,054
Lykan HyperSport.

819
01:14:35,257 --> 01:14:38,735
$3.4 million.
Zero-to-60 in less than three seconds.

820
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:41,790
There's seven of these things in the world,
and this guy keeps it locked up in a vault.

821
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:45,895
Nothing's sadder than
locking a beast in a cage.

822
01:14:46,471 --> 01:14:48,439
And now I really want
to punch him in the face.

823
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:49,925
Okay.

824
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:52,219
Let's get to work.

825
01:15:00,098 --> 01:15:01,411
You got this, right?

826
01:15:01,435 --> 01:15:02,407
Go.

827
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:23,141
Would you believe I knocked him out 
with my charm?

828
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:25,672
You ain't that charming, bitch.

829
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,094
No, no, no.....

830
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,488
Tej, your magic trick is failing.
We're losing systems.

831
01:15:41,513 --> 01:15:42,558
I know.

832
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:45,136
I see it.

833
01:15:45,157 --> 01:15:46,290
Tej, talk to me.

834
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:48,850
I am trying, but their security system 
is locking us out.

835
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:50,610
All right, listen, ladies and gentlemen...

836
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:52,738
Oh, there he is. These are your dancers?

837
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:54,016
This is a party, baby!

838
01:15:58,265 --> 01:16:00,467
Some of you all probably went
to the bathroom and noticed

839
01:16:00,492 --> 01:16:02,727
that all the hairspray was missing.

840
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:04,899
Yep. She did it.

841
01:16:05,658 --> 01:16:06,586
Thank you.

842
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:14,020
And we're so happy for you to be here.

843
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,014
You look like you got some missiles
underneath that dress. No?

844
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,434
He did not just...

845
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:19,743
Did you just say that?

846
01:16:31,764 --> 01:16:33,789
Oh, shit! Not the gate! Not the gate!

847
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,524
Brian, faster!

848
01:16:37,914 --> 01:16:39,396
We're playing all the defense 
we can up here,

849
01:16:39,421 --> 01:16:41,414
but we're going to lose.
You got to hurry up.

850
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:46,125
Thank God you showed up.

851
01:16:48,505 --> 01:16:50,314
These parties bore me to death.

852
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:54,785
Guys, get out of there right now.
You have got an army heading your way.

853
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,460
Brian, get out! Forget it!

854
01:17:58,330 --> 01:17:59,680
Tej, we're taking the car.

855
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,125
This is what I do. You know
what I am saying? As far as I am-

856
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:06,875
My man, what's...

857
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:16,333
Letty? Letty, talk to me. Are you okay?

858
01:18:17,104 --> 01:18:18,230
Guys, I can't hold it.

859
01:18:18,255 --> 01:18:20,258
I am losing the final gate.
You got to get out of there.

860
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:22,071
Tear out the dash!

861
01:18:22,555 --> 01:18:23,829
Go through it.

862
01:18:29,254 --> 01:18:31,297
Wait, wait, wait.
Now, just hold on, man.

863
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:45,019
Time to unleash the beast.

864
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:07,411
Let's go!

865
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:12,303
Stay with me, I got you.

866
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,467
Let's get the hell out of here.

867
01:19:55,145 --> 01:19:56,785
Dom, cars don't fly!

868
01:19:58,505 --> 01:19:59,717
Cars don't fly!

869
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,171
Holy shit!

870
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,623
No brakes!

871
01:20:31,643 --> 01:20:32,560
What?

872
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:34,592
No brakes!

873
01:20:34,878 --> 01:20:35,920
Shit!

874
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:51,902
No, no, no!

875
01:20:52,274 --> 01:20:53,644
No!

876
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:33,021
- Got it!
- Get out!

877
01:22:12,907 --> 01:22:14,633
Still miss the bullets, Brian?

878
01:22:53,721 --> 01:22:55,921
Ah! There they are. Disaster.

879
01:22:55,945 --> 01:22:56,736
I am sorry.

880
01:22:56,761 --> 01:23:01,106
I get you an invite to 
the most exclusive party in Abu Dhabi.

881
01:23:01,128 --> 01:23:01,944
Safar...

882
01:23:01,968 --> 01:23:06,694
No, no, no. You steal the host's car,
and you jump it between two buildings.

883
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:07,980
Actually, it was three buildings.

884
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:10,522
Oh! Two, insult. Three, honor.

885
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:11,825
My bad.

886
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:15,201
Well, well, well. I have to say,

887
01:23:15,226 --> 01:23:20,164
you have got an interesting interpretation
there of "low-key", Mr. Toretto.

888
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:23,693
You know, Dom, I thought
we had an understanding.

889
01:23:24,462 --> 01:23:26,745
Sometimes you have to play
the hand you're dealt.

890
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:28,932
That's why I prefer to be the dealer.

891
01:23:30,431 --> 01:23:31,432
Good night.

892
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:35,891
Ah...

893
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,242
I am being kicked out of my own garage.
This is great.

894
01:23:41,575 --> 01:23:42,742
Uh, may I?

895
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:45,919
Brian....

896
01:23:47,276 --> 01:23:48,402
...give it to him.

897
01:24:05,487 --> 01:24:07,888
All that trouble for this little...

898
01:24:08,993 --> 01:24:10,040
...thing.

899
01:24:10,163 --> 01:24:13,891
With all due respect, Dom,
you really did great work back there.

900
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:15,056
All of you.

901
01:24:15,242 --> 01:24:20,344
All of my men are now standing by
and are fully at your disposal.

902
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:26,654
Your call.

903
01:24:28,468 --> 01:24:29,469
Ramsey.

904
01:24:33,081 --> 01:24:36,403
Fire it up and find me Shaw.

905
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,226
Oh, damn, this is crazy.

906
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:45,172
Thank you.

907
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:48,430
All right, give me a second.

908
01:24:51,977 --> 01:24:53,504
What is it doing now?

909
01:24:53,528 --> 01:24:54,748
It's hunting.

910
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,745
Hacking into the security cameras 
at Etihad Towers.

911
01:24:57,770 --> 01:25:00,148
That's the last place you saw Shaw,
so that's where we will start.

912
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:04,019
That's him, right there.

913
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:06,601
Wait, wait.
What are these numbers right here for?

914
01:25:06,843 --> 01:25:08,844
It's bio-mapping Shaw's face.

915
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:14,187
It will run it against every camera.

916
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,937
Every audio device in this hemisphere.

917
01:25:30,655 --> 01:25:32,945
Bingo. Looks like he's holed up here.

918
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:34,731
That's perfect.

919
01:25:34,756 --> 01:25:37,425
Automated factory, no people,
lots of places to hide.

920
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:39,992
You just changed the face of manhunts 
forever.

921
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:43,020
Congratulations.

922
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:47,023
Hey, can I check my email real quick?

923
01:25:47,426 --> 01:25:49,372
Dawn's up in two hours.

924
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:56,172
We're going to go take down Shaw then.
Go get changed.

925
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,055
We should go now.

926
01:26:02,732 --> 01:26:05,555
Just you, your team, and me.

927
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,417
I thought you said at dawn.

928
01:26:07,411 --> 01:26:10,340
My guys are racers,
the best drivers in the world.

929
01:26:10,664 --> 01:26:12,199
But they ain't killers.

930
01:26:12,223 --> 01:26:13,480
Told you he'd say that.

931
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,012
I know you too well, Dom,
and I am going with you.

932
01:26:16,144 --> 01:26:19,336
Well, looks like we got
a nice little hunting party.

933
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:21,601
Let's go bag a shadow.

934
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,568
Ten klicks out, boys.
Get ready to rock and roll.

935
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,499
Here we go. Weapons hot.

936
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:02,617
You ready for this?

937
01:27:02,641 --> 01:27:03,698
Yeah.

938
01:27:33,732 --> 01:27:35,581
I hope you're enjoying your last meal.

939
01:27:43,031 --> 01:27:44,032
This is it?

940
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:46,099
This is all I warrant?

941
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:48,331
A dozen men?

942
01:27:48,601 --> 01:27:51,105
I think you will find 
it's more than enough.

943
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:07,012
I am ready to meet my maker.

944
01:28:07,331 --> 01:28:08,456
Are you?

945
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:11,972
What were you expecting, Toretto?
To catch me off guard?

946
01:28:13,049 --> 01:28:15,058
Me standing here, waving a white flag?

947
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,089
You ever heard the saying,

948
01:28:17,121 --> 01:28:20,495
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend"?

949
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:24,800
I don't have friends. I got family.

950
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:28,496
Well, I got a lot of friends.

951
01:28:41,405 --> 01:28:43,563
Two-two formation! Sheppard, peel one!

952
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:13,096
Brian, leave it!

953
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:36,211
Get down!

954
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:49,150
I got you.

955
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:13,964
God's Eye.

956
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:36,402
You didn't really think I was going
to walk in there naked, did you?

957
01:31:38,441 --> 01:31:40,097
You got hit bad.

958
01:31:40,637 --> 01:31:42,127
Look, Toretto.

959
01:31:42,909 --> 01:31:45,116
I know you won't listen to me.

960
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:48,168
You're not going to want to hear 
what I have to say.

961
01:31:48,699 --> 01:31:52,780
But the truth is, you really ought to....

962
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:55,566
...try that Belgian ale, man.

963
01:31:55,894 --> 01:31:57,808
It's something special.

964
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,979
Belgian ale, huh?

965
01:32:01,886 --> 01:32:04,111
Hey, we got to get you to a hospital.

966
01:32:04,136 --> 01:32:05,475
No, you're not.

967
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:08,918
I carry my own health insurance.

968
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:13,495
SOCM medics on standby.
They're already inbound.

969
01:32:14,548 --> 01:32:16,144
Pull over, kid.

970
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:32,653
Dom, you got to protect Ramsey.

971
01:32:32,678 --> 01:32:34,678
As long as she's alive,

972
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:37,738
she can lock them out of God's Eye, 
and they know that.

973
01:32:37,771 --> 01:32:41,139
That means they're not going to stop
coming until they have got her.

974
01:32:41,609 --> 01:32:43,379
And this time, when they come

975
01:32:43,404 --> 01:32:46,079
they're going to come with
everything they have got.

976
01:32:46,104 --> 01:32:48,587
- I am not leaving you.
- You're not.

977
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:51,009
I am leaving you.

978
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:55,134
Go now, Dom.

979
01:33:08,937 --> 01:33:11,806
A war is coming to us,
whether we like it or not.

980
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:14,525
If a war is coming,

981
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:19,900
we're going to face them on the streets 
we know best.

982
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:28,054
I am all for winging it, 
but this is crazy, man.

983
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:31,235
We got mercenaries with
some real heat on us.

984
01:33:31,871 --> 01:33:35,548
I mean, I ain't scared or nothing, but...
Man, I don't even have a gun!

985
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:38,170
Gun?

986
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,179
We got a whole city.

987
01:33:41,204 --> 01:33:42,779
And we may have more than that.

988
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:46,293
If they use God's Eye, it will tap the
cameras around town to find our location.

989
01:33:46,318 --> 01:33:48,872
Which means we could plant a virus.

990
01:33:48,896 --> 01:33:50,960
And then break in when they access it.

991
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:55,191
So you're talking about hacking 
my hacking device. It's brilliant.

992
01:33:55,216 --> 01:33:58,336
Yeah, but there's one problem.
The signal strength.

993
01:33:58,421 --> 01:34:01,708
We can't start a hack on them until
they're within a two-mile range.

994
01:34:01,733 --> 01:34:03,083
That's really close.

995
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:05,270
Close? These guys are military.

996
01:34:05,275 --> 01:34:07,697
If they're within two miles of us, 
we're already dead.

997
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:12,274
I don't know about you all,
but I didn't really plan on dying today.

998
01:34:12,299 --> 01:34:14,418
Only one way to stay alive.

999
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,878
We play keep-away with Ramsey.

1000
01:34:16,912 --> 01:34:17,681
What?

1001
01:34:17,706 --> 01:34:19,536
They can't hit us if we keep moving.

1002
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,343
And I will take Shaw.

1003
01:34:21,532 --> 01:34:24,384
So, basically, we're just gearing up 
for a big game of hot potato, huh?

1004
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:27,042
- Which car is the potato?
- Girl, you're the potato.

1005
01:34:27,067 --> 01:34:29,566
Why does it feel like
I am not going to see you again?

1006
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:44,899
I will come back for that.

1007
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:47,450
Promise?

1008
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:51,175
Promise.

1009
01:35:10,856 --> 01:35:13,157
- Brian, are you okay?
- Mia, listen to me.

1010
01:35:13,945 --> 01:35:15,788
Something's about to go down.

1011
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,345
And if you don't hear from me in 24 hours,

1012
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:22,853
I need you to take Jack and move on.

1013
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:27,021
You understand?

1014
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:29,794
You understand what I am saying?

1015
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:31,735
No, I can't do that, Brian.

1016
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:33,212
<i>No, I can't.</i>

1017
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:38,941
We're going to have another baby.
It's a little girl.

1018
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,476
And she's going to need her father.

1019
01:35:43,501 --> 01:35:47,134
So you have to finish what you're doing
and you have to come home to her.

1020
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:50,282
You have to come home to us.

1021
01:35:51,881 --> 01:35:54,181
I am sorry I didn't tell you before.

1022
01:35:54,610 --> 01:35:58,087
I was scared you'd be disappointed 
with domestic life.

1023
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:03,915
You know, the best decision I ever made 
was stepping into the store and...

1024
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:06,341
....buying that first sandwich.

1025
01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:11,097
It was such a bad sandwich.

1026
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:14,493
I know, right? But I ate a lot of them.

1027
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:17,838
Uh...

1028
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:25,574
I love you, Mia.

1029
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:29,673
Don't do that.

1030
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:30,936
What?

1031
01:36:31,124 --> 01:36:33,806
The way you said it. It's like goodbye. 
Say something else.

1032
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:37,619
Okay. Kiss Jack for me.

1033
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:41,250
I will.

1034
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:49,739
I love you, Brian.

1035
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:54,535
I love you, Mia.

1036
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:27,570
One last ride.

1037
01:38:35,773 --> 01:38:38,131
Boot up God's Eye. Find them.

1038
01:38:52,381 --> 01:38:53,577
I am getting something.

1039
01:38:56,867 --> 01:38:58,960
I got a positive ID. It's Toretto.

1040
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,818
God's Eye is placing him 
at Hill and Seventh.

1041
01:39:06,665 --> 01:39:07,792
Should we follow him?

1042
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:09,914
No. Let Shaw take care of him.

1043
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,319
Find Ramsey.

1044
01:39:11,344 --> 01:39:12,406
Yes, sir.

1045
01:39:19,025 --> 01:39:21,392
I don't know why we got to
keep driving around like this.

1046
01:39:21,417 --> 01:39:24,698
Why can't we just pull over somewhere,
park, gather our thoughts in,

1047
01:39:24,722 --> 01:39:25,976
like, a bunker somewhere?

1048
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:27,825
Because it does not work like that.

1049
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:29,579
We got to stick close enough 
to the bad guys

1050
01:39:29,579 --> 01:39:31,928
in order to get in range for Ramsey 
to hack them.

1051
01:39:31,953 --> 01:39:34,694
But we got to be mobile enough 
not to get shot like fish in a barrel.

1052
01:39:34,694 --> 01:39:37,741
So, do me a favor, focus on the mission
and keep us from getting killed.

1053
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:43,219
Got her. Target acquired.
She's riding shotgun in a blue GT-R.

1054
01:39:51,654 --> 01:39:52,764
Guys, they're here.

1055
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:54,051
How many cars?

1056
01:39:54,077 --> 01:39:56,974
Uh, none. And that's kind of the problem.

1057
01:40:04,194 --> 01:40:07,038
Okay, let's give them the tour.
Break on my mark.

1058
01:40:07,063 --> 01:40:09,526
Three, two, one.

1059
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:10,569
Go!

1060
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:17,574
Splitting up won't work.
Can't hide from God's Eye.

1061
01:40:21,576 --> 01:40:22,825
They're in range.

1062
01:40:22,936 --> 01:40:24,295
Ramsey, start the hack.

1063
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,806
Initiating.

1064
01:40:26,885 --> 01:40:27,886
Now.

1065
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:32,710
Sir, I think someone's trying to 
hack the system.

1066
01:40:32,970 --> 01:40:34,131
It's Ramsey.

1067
01:40:34,243 --> 01:40:36,798
Send in the Predator! Take her out!

1068
01:40:36,983 --> 01:40:38,655
Releasing Predator.

1069
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:11,730
I think we lost the chopper.

1070
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:19,578
I think we got
bigger problems than that!

1071
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:22,895
Oh, my God.

1072
01:41:25,202 --> 01:41:26,203
What are you doing?

1073
01:41:26,228 --> 01:41:27,434
We're going old school!

1074
01:41:33,841 --> 01:41:35,001
Watch out!

1075
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:50,479
It's coming back around!

1076
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:04,745
Predator's back on him.

1077
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:06,534
- Ready missiles!
- Roger that.

1078
01:43:08,385 --> 01:43:09,418
Fire!

1079
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:11,691
Oh, shit!

1080
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:23,015
Football's hot! I need to lateral!

1081
01:43:23,015 --> 01:43:24,296
Rom, where are you?

1082
01:43:24,321 --> 01:43:25,760
Running back charging in!

1083
01:43:44,486 --> 01:43:45,959
Meet me on Third and Spring.

1084
01:43:45,983 --> 01:43:46,962
You got it!

1085
01:43:53,986 --> 01:43:55,235
I am halfway there.

1086
01:43:55,271 --> 01:43:56,904
- Grab your computer! Get in the window!
- Why?

1087
01:43:56,931 --> 01:43:58,203
Do it! Now!

1088
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:04,384
You got to go! Right now!

1089
01:44:08,853 --> 01:44:10,101
Fire!

1090
01:44:20,650 --> 01:44:22,048
Come on!

1091
01:44:40,658 --> 01:44:41,697
Hit!

1092
01:44:45,345 --> 01:44:48,380
He made it!
I can't believe we pulled that off.

1093
01:44:55,704 --> 01:44:56,615
Wait, wait, wait.

1094
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:57,849
- We're still being hacked.
- What?

1095
01:44:57,873 --> 01:44:59,613
God's Eye is still tracking Ramsey.

1096
01:44:59,613 --> 01:45:03,245
Keep the drone in pursuit of her. The
signal has to be coming from somewhere.

1097
01:45:39,644 --> 01:45:42,655
Back to throw.
Here comes the blitz. Number 94 sacks him!

1098
01:45:42,655 --> 01:45:45,097
Breaking news out of Los Angeles tonight.

1099
01:45:45,097 --> 01:45:48,094
In what can only be described
as vehicular warfare,

1100
01:45:48,094 --> 01:45:50,379
police are engaged in
a high-speed pursuit...

1101
01:45:52,683 --> 01:45:56,119
I got it. They're piggybacking the hack
off that satellite tower right there.

1102
01:45:56,144 --> 01:45:57,347
Take it out!

1103
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:10,177
Toretto.

1104
01:46:19,265 --> 01:46:21,696
Wait. What happened? We were almost there.

1105
01:46:21,882 --> 01:46:23,870
They have cut the signal!
I can't finish the hack!

1106
01:46:23,895 --> 01:46:25,141
What do you mean?

1107
01:46:26,761 --> 01:46:28,492
Brian, they took out the tower!

1108
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:35,727
Dad, what's going on?

1109
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:38,460
Daddy's got to go to work.

1110
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,594
All right, baby girl.
Elena's going to be here in a little bit.

1111
01:46:59,619 --> 01:47:02,821
You know our drill.
Give me three for the road.

1112
01:47:21,309 --> 01:47:23,357
You thought 
this was going to be a street fight?

1113
01:47:37,998 --> 01:47:39,807
You're goddamn right it is.

1114
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:27,007
There has to be another way.

1115
01:48:27,007 --> 01:48:30,518
Wait. I am seeing half a dozen
cell towers between Sixth and State.

1116
01:48:30,518 --> 01:48:33,674
Brian, if you can get to the top of
any one of those buildings around there,

1117
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:36,272
we can reroute the signal manually
and finish the job.

1118
01:48:36,297 --> 01:48:37,365
I am on it.

1119
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:43,774
Sir, did you hear that? O'Conner
is on foot, heading for a repeater.

1120
01:48:43,803 --> 01:48:45,307
He's going to try to reinitiate the hack.

1121
01:48:45,331 --> 01:48:46,787
Keep the drone on the girl.

1122
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:51,162
Kiet, O'Conner's on foot somewhere
between Sixth and State.

1123
01:48:51,281 --> 01:48:52,864
Don't let him make it there.

1124
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:09,190
Them boys is on us!

1125
01:49:09,214 --> 01:49:10,834
Man, them boys ain't ready for this!

1126
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:16,736
Shit!

1127
01:49:35,225 --> 01:49:38,551
First the tank, then the plane.
Now we got a spaceship?

1128
01:49:38,576 --> 01:49:40,055
That's not a spaceship, that's a drone!

1129
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:40,916
Oh, it's a drone?

1130
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:42,773
Now, you going to break it down
and be articulate

1131
01:49:42,773 --> 01:49:44,739
like you already know
what the hell is going on?

1132
01:49:44,764 --> 01:49:46,722
Shut your ass up and drive the car!

1133
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:56,097
Letty, the football's on fire!
We need help!

1134
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:58,737
Hang on! I am coming!

1135
01:50:34,439 --> 01:50:35,850
Ramsey, get ready to go again!

1136
01:50:38,831 --> 01:50:40,211
Drone has missile lock.

1137
01:50:40,235 --> 01:50:41,261
Fire!

1138
01:50:50,591 --> 01:50:52,191
Target destroyed.

1139
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:57,699
Let's see if we have a connection. 
If I can get back in...

1140
01:50:57,734 --> 01:50:59,326
Wait, wait, wait! God's Eye still has her.

1141
01:50:59,351 --> 01:51:00,746
How can that be?

1142
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:16,833
Get up. Come on!

1143
01:51:17,886 --> 01:51:19,387
Let's go! Let's go!

1144
01:51:22,715 --> 01:51:24,427
They switched her under the bridge.

1145
01:51:24,451 --> 01:51:25,454
What?

1146
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:30,511
Got to get out of here.
It's on your trail and it's coming fast.

1147
01:51:30,536 --> 01:51:31,329
Got it.

1148
01:51:31,351 --> 01:51:34,361
So, if this car goes down,
who's coming to save us?

1149
01:51:34,375 --> 01:51:36,789
Save us, honey? We're it.

1150
01:51:36,814 --> 01:51:37,894
Where are they now?

1151
01:51:37,919 --> 01:51:39,869
Six blocks east, hauling ass.

1152
01:51:40,505 --> 01:51:41,666
Where are we headed, Tej?

1153
01:51:41,691 --> 01:51:44,017
There's a service elevator
past the maintenance sector.

1154
01:51:44,017 --> 01:51:46,286
It will take you
directly up to the repeater.

1155
01:51:46,311 --> 01:51:47,828
Brian, you got to hurry!

1156
01:53:48,624 --> 01:53:49,750
Too slow!

1157
01:54:05,461 --> 01:54:06,462
It's coming back!

1158
01:54:06,487 --> 01:54:07,850
We will lose them in the tunnel.

1159
01:54:08,850 --> 01:54:09,565
Got it.

1160
01:54:09,589 --> 01:54:10,436
Fire!

1161
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:28,575
I can't shake this thing!

1162
01:54:31,705 --> 01:54:33,548
Predator has missile lock.

1163
01:54:33,666 --> 01:54:34,882
Take it out!

1164
01:55:01,514 --> 01:55:02,732
No way.

1165
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:15,545
Wait! What happened?

1166
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:18,290
Sir, someone just double-tapped our drone.

1167
01:55:18,314 --> 01:55:19,332
What?

1168
01:55:20,653 --> 01:55:22,774
Hey, did you bring the cavalry?

1169
01:55:23,648 --> 01:55:26,184
Woman, I am the cavalry.

1170
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:28,332
Of course you are.

1171
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:30,536
Who is that?

1172
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:34,871
That's Hobbs.

1173
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,116
I am at the repeater.

1174
01:55:45,141 --> 01:55:46,705
The access cable's in the base.

1175
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:49,629
Just plug it into your phone
and Ramsey will be back online.

1176
01:55:51,484 --> 01:55:52,785
Ramsey, go!

1177
01:55:56,705 --> 01:55:58,699
Brian did it. We're back in!

1178
01:56:03,776 --> 01:56:05,176
We have got God's Eye back.

1179
01:56:12,610 --> 01:56:13,798
We lost the God's Eye!

1180
01:56:13,823 --> 01:56:15,393
What? Shit!

1181
01:56:20,355 --> 01:56:22,579
Military's inbound.
Three minutes and closing.

1182
01:56:22,611 --> 01:56:24,153
We need to get the hell out of here.

1183
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:28,425
Tej, Roman, I am on my way!

1184
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:29,910
All right, homie, I will see you there.

1185
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,964
I have eyes on Toretto.

1186
01:57:39,423 --> 01:57:40,790
Shaw is in the way.

1187
01:57:40,814 --> 01:57:43,110
Then it seems our friendship is at an end.

1188
01:57:43,850 --> 01:57:44,851
Do it!

1189
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:02,465
Thing about street fights....

1190
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:06,613
...the street always wins.

1191
01:58:34,610 --> 01:58:36,453
Goodbye, Toretto.

1192
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:46,972
Take him out! Take down the bastard!

1193
01:58:57,031 --> 01:58:58,032
This son of a...

1194
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:13,767
No!

1195
01:59:14,814 --> 01:59:16,073
Duck!

1196
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:19,219
I need some help over here!
We're getting nailed!

1197
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:21,299
I need some backup!

1198
01:59:29,463 --> 01:59:32,158
No! No! Son of a bitch!

1199
01:59:34,225 --> 01:59:35,590
He's getting away!

1200
01:59:35,615 --> 01:59:37,215
No! Stop him!

1201
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:34,127
Don't miss.

1202
02:01:07,728 --> 02:01:08,729
Dom!

1203
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:55,728
Come on, buddy.

1204
02:02:01,505 --> 02:02:02,552
Is he breathing?

1205
02:02:02,577 --> 02:02:06,341
I want you to keep his head tilted up,
all right? Keep it back like this.

1206
02:02:06,366 --> 02:02:09,064
Pinch his nose, keep his head tilted.
Breathe into him, now. Go.

1207
02:02:09,930 --> 02:02:11,392
Good. Come on, Dom.

1208
02:02:11,619 --> 02:02:13,259
Come on, Dom. Come on!

1209
02:02:13,259 --> 02:02:16,701
God damn it! You come on! You breathe!
Go, go! Breathe.

1210
02:02:16,701 --> 02:02:17,897
Come on. Damn it. Let's go.

1211
02:02:17,897 --> 02:02:21,770
Come on, Dom, I need you to breathe.
Come on! Come on, Dom!

1212
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:23,061
- Come back! Come on, buddy.
- Stop it.

1213
02:02:23,061 --> 02:02:24,510
Dom, come on! Come on!

1214
02:02:24,546 --> 02:02:25,804
Back off!

1215
02:02:25,835 --> 02:02:27,116
Will you stop? Breathe into him.

1216
02:02:27,141 --> 02:02:29,133
- Get off of him!
- You breathe into him!

1217
02:02:29,133 --> 02:02:30,934
- Back off!
- You breathe into him!

1218
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:32,260
Back off!

1219
02:02:33,055 --> 02:02:34,377
Please.

1220
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:36,963
Dom.

1221
02:02:37,135 --> 02:02:39,941
Dom, baby.
I know you're hurting right now.

1222
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:43,525
But I want you to listen.
Stay awake.....

1223
02:02:44,210 --> 02:02:45,735
....and focus on me.

1224
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:53,976
I remember everything.

1225
02:02:54,816 --> 02:02:56,580
It came to me like a flood.

1226
02:02:58,591 --> 02:03:02,213
I remember that night
in the Dominican Republic.

1227
02:03:03,484 --> 02:03:05,127
The night we got married.

1228
02:03:11,436 --> 02:03:12,642
Oh, my...

1229
02:03:17,753 --> 02:03:18,914
Will this do?

1230
02:03:22,936 --> 02:03:24,994
We have eternity in this moment.

1231
02:03:25,985 --> 02:03:28,556
You will never be alone again.

1232
02:03:28,838 --> 02:03:31,256
I vow wherever you go, I go.

1233
02:03:31,256 --> 02:03:32,855
You ride, I ride.

1234
02:03:32,855 --> 02:03:34,774
You fight, I fight.

1235
02:03:34,799 --> 02:03:37,377
And if you ever die on me, Dominic Toretto,

1236
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:39,345
I am going to die with you.

1237
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:45,377
I love you, Letty. I will always love you.

1238
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:48,661
If you die, I die.

1239
02:03:51,324 --> 02:03:53,892
And I am not ready to leave this place yet.

1240
02:03:54,438 --> 02:03:57,494
This moment is still ours.

1241
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:04,612
I remember everything.

1242
02:04:05,290 --> 02:04:06,974
I remember it all.

1243
02:04:08,970 --> 02:04:10,728
It's about time.

1244
02:04:25,777 --> 02:04:28,421
Why didn't you tell me we were married?

1245
02:04:36,732 --> 02:04:39,398
Because you can't tell someone 
they love you.

1246
02:04:49,811 --> 02:04:51,261
Holy shit.

1247
02:05:17,230 --> 02:05:20,163
You sure you brought enough backup 
with you, Hobbs?

1248
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:22,366
Oh, they ain't mine.

1249
02:05:23,210 --> 02:05:24,860
They're here to protect you...

1250
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:27,693
...from me killing your ass.

1251
02:05:43,905 --> 02:05:46,645
You do know none of this
will keep me, right?

1252
02:05:50,989 --> 02:05:53,979
Well, once you dig through
38 feet of concrete and steel,

1253
02:05:53,979 --> 02:05:57,896
my fist and a body bag will be
waiting for you on the other side.

1254
02:05:58,570 --> 02:06:00,732
So I suggest you get to digging, boy.

1255
02:06:35,348 --> 02:06:36,749
Whoo-hoo....

1256
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:39,610
Daddy! Come play.

1257
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:40,697
Yeah.

1258
02:06:40,697 --> 02:06:42,454
Look at him. Look at him.

1259
02:06:45,293 --> 02:06:46,294
Yeah, buddy.

1260
02:06:47,810 --> 02:06:50,371
- Duty calls. It does.
- Hey, babe, come on.

1261
02:06:50,985 --> 02:06:52,942
Let's get Mama. Yeah!

1262
02:06:53,052 --> 02:06:53,851
Here we go.

1263
02:06:53,851 --> 02:06:57,577
Because the sun is out,
I am kind of medium rare,

1264
02:06:57,577 --> 02:07:01,336
but I can get, like, well done.
Like, really dark.

1265
02:07:02,847 --> 02:07:03,848
What you nudging me for?

1266
02:07:03,873 --> 02:07:05,522
Close your mouth for two seconds.

1267
02:07:07,169 --> 02:07:08,981
Just open your eyes, man.

1268
02:07:12,850 --> 02:07:13,976
Beautiful.

1269
02:07:15,650 --> 02:07:17,520
That's where he belongs.

1270
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:19,442
Home.

1271
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:22,900
Where he's always belonged.

1272
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:30,653
Things are going to be different now.

1273
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:55,137
One more time.

1274
02:07:57,536 --> 02:07:59,538
You aren't going to say goodbye?

1275
02:08:10,764 --> 02:08:12,817
It's never goodbye.

1276
02:09:22,054 --> 02:09:24,821
Hey. You thought you could leave 
without saying goodbye?

1277
02:09:32,139 --> 02:09:35,145
<i>I used to say I live my life 
a quarter-mile at a time.</i>

1278
02:09:37,067 --> 02:09:39,798
<i>And I think that's why we were brothers.</i>

1279
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:42,334
<i>Because you did, too.</i>

1280
02:09:44,110 --> 02:09:45,462
This is your car.

1281
02:09:45,486 --> 02:09:46,528
My car?

1282
02:09:52,598 --> 02:09:54,945
It's official. You're all free.

1283
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:57,052
Home sweet home.

1284
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:01,032
What's happening, dude?

1285
02:10:01,056 --> 02:10:02,192
Thanks for the invite.

1286
02:10:06,650 --> 02:10:08,137
Want to go for a drive?

1287
02:10:09,850 --> 02:10:11,450
<i>No matter where you are,</i>

1288
02:10:12,522 --> 02:10:14,809
<i>whether it's a quarter-mile away...</i>

1289
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:18,501
<i>...or halfway across the world,</i>

1290
02:10:24,410 --> 02:10:28,172
the most important thing in life
will always be the people in this room.

1291
02:10:28,172 --> 02:10:30,716
Right here, right now.

1292
02:10:30,825 --> 02:10:32,156
Salud mi familia.

1293
02:10:32,181 --> 02:10:33,491
Salud.

1294
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:43,552
<i>You will always be with me.</i>

1295
02:10:45,730 --> 02:10:48,176
<i>And you will always be my brother.</i>
