- Bad day?
- Goddamn it.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,220
Hey, I'm with you.
But there's a way to handle it.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,300
I owe you.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,970
Thanks to the Church of the Collective,
I now know the kind of man I want to be.

- No. I am not ridiculous.

Okay, then you are high.

22
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,360
Well, beside the point.

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,610
Point is,

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,990
I learned everything I know
from those girls.

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,330
The Golden Girls.

26
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,000
I was alone in New York, you know?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Turning tricks, begging for the scraps.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,000
Who do you think kept me company?

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,920
The Golden Girls. 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,720
They lit up that shelter's shitty TV.

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,100
And you're not talking about porn?
The Golden Shower Girls?

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,430
That's disrespectful.

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,060
AW, he's so sensitive.

34
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,440
No. Those saucy ladies,
they made their own family.

35
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,400
So I did what they did.

36
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,490
You are my Blanche.

37
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,030
- Blanche?
- And Jay.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,530
You are...

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,580
my Dorothy.

40
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,200
I guess you're a little gay. Yeah.

41
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,660
So you're Betty White?

42
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,960
What a fucking question.

43
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,670
Of course I'm Betty White.

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Now...

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,260
Who wants to rob a bank?

46
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,640
Fuck yeah.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,940
Will it get through my skin?

48
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,360
If it can't, nothing can.

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,740
Okay, I feel like I need to say something.
I don't think this is a good idea.

50
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,610
Stormfront knows I leaked the V.

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,860
Yeah, but she hasn't come after you.

52
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,490
But that makes it so much worse.

53
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,040
That means that she has
some fucked-up plan for me.

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,870
I need this chip out now.

55
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,620
I understand, Petit Hughie.

56
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,960
And though you've been covered
with entrails of many a person,

57
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,880
even a sea mammal, it's always harder
when it's someone you love.

58
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,420
- What?
- L'amour.

59
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,340
No, no. No, I don't.

60
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,760
I mean, I do, of course.

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,680
It's just... It's a platen...
We're just friends.

62
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,600
Okay. Can we just do this already
before I change my mind? Please?

63
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,230
Okay, this is happening.

64
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,900
Okay.

65
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,320
- This might sting a little.
- Okay.

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,280
My God.

67
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,120
My God. My God. Okay.

68
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,710
Okay.

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,760
Bonjour, my little spy.

70
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,370
Howdy ho, buckaroo.

71
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,910
Shit! I think you broke my hand.

72
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,880
What do you want to do with him?

73
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,300
Hand him over
to the police, of course.

74
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,010
Well, of course. We are heroes.
That's what heroes do.

75
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,390
Absolutely.

76
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,220
But he'll probably just be released
tomorrow.

77
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,690
- Please, just take me to the hospital.
- Yeah.

78
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,230
- Please.
- That's a really good point.

79
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,150
You know, sometimes it feels like...

80
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,240
Like the justice system
just doesn't work anymore.

81

Everyone always recording
on their phone all the time.

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,540
It's like you can't even
do your job anymore.

83
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,250
Please just take me in.
Just take me in, please.

84
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,890
It really speaks to the deterioration
of good God-fearing American values.

- This is where you're living?

Yeah, you know, it has its charms.

I know what you're gonna say, but we
took out her chip. Everything's fine.

Starlight,
don't you just light up a room?

114
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,220
You're looking well.

115
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,980
Yeah, no thanks to the 50-caliber round
that you pumped into my chest.

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,440
Well, what don't kill you

118
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,320
She has a lead on Stormfront.

119
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,910
I broke into her laptop,
and I got a look at the inbox.

120
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,240
Dozens of e-mails from Stan Edgar.

And what does Vought's Big Slapper
have to say?

123
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,920
How they're close to a breakthrough
at the Sage Grove Center.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,590
It's a psychiatric hospital
in Pennsylvania.

125
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,300
- Wait, what kind of breakthrough?
- She came in before I could see any more.

126
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,520
Well, we better have us a little dekko

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,980
Starlight, would you be amenable
to joining us on this little caper?

128
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,190
You want her to come?

129
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,690
Most definitely.

130
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,900
If shit goes sideways,
who do you think Vought's gonna go after?

Us or their
billion-dollar-baby-turned-traitor

- Did you find it?
- No, sorry. No black box.

But I told a couple of my contacts

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,870
to keep an eye
on the North Atlantic Current.

00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,840
Well, this is just the demo, of course.

161
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,760
We're going out to Lil Nas X
for the official version.

162
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,140
Maybe you could bust out
Prince's guitar for the video?

163
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,560
I had to sell Prince's guitar.

164
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,600
- I'm going 10-1.
- Okay.

165
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,110
- Ashley.
- What?

166
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,690
- I can't find her.
- Where the fuck is Starlight?

167
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,400
Back to one, everyone.
We 're going again.

168
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,830
Yo! Here comes the A—Train!

169
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,250
What, what?

170
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,330
I'm right here, buddy. Over here.

171
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,830
- Yeah.
- What's up, buddy?

172
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,880
Good to see you.

173
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,670
- What are you doing here, man?
- Not much. Just here to see...

174
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,800
No reason, really.

175
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,010
But, hey, bro, I've been thinking
about you lately.

176
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,220
Yeah, I'm sorry.

177
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,970
I see what they're trying to do to you.

178
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,560
Yeah. Talk about getting ass-fucked
with a soup can. Am I right?

179
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,610
- What do you mean?
- I mean, come on.

180
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,070
If anyone knows
what it's like to get bounced, it's me.

181
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,240
Yeah. Did some shit I'm not too proud of.

182
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,110
Some weird shit.

183
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,280
I'm good, man.

184
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,660
Nike and Under Armour
are already talking to my people,

185
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,330
so, you know, this is actually gonna
work out to be really fantastic for me.

186
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,960
- That's great. Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,090
Well, then I guess
you don't need his help.

188
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,510
Or... Never mind.
Forget I even said anything.

189
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,130
But hey, it's great
to see you, man. Always.

190
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
All right.

191
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,390
Whose?

192
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Whose help?

193
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,020
Would you like a Fresca?

194
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,620
Sage Grove, a proud
subsidiary of Global Wellness Services,

195
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,500
- which is a subsidiary of...
- I can guess.

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Thanks.

197
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,340
This is what you bought
with your blood money?

198
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,010
No one will believe
you're an orderly with that, you know.

199
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,860
I should go in with them.

200
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,070
They can manage
without one bony blond Supe.

201
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,820
You just get them in
and get the fuck back, yeah?

202
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,030
Okay, just...

203
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,160
If anybody recognizes your face
in there, I mean...

204
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,340
Hey, Frenchie.

205
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,170
Don't get caught.

206
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
I never do.

207
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,850
Weaponized Xanax.

208
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,280
The grenades you used on Behemoth
during the bank heist.

209
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,530
You got a Supe activated by rage,

210
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,160
so you simply take away his rage,
turn him into a cupcake.

211
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,320
Clever.

212
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,620
I don't know what you are talking about.

213
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,540
And Cold Snap two months ago?

214
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,460
Malchemical a month before that?
You don't know about those, either?

215
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,920
What is this about?

216
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,800
Armed robbery, breaking and entering,
aggravated assault on a Supe.

217
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,220
You're looking at 20 to 25, minimum.

218
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,020
Or you can come work for me.

219
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,770
I could use someone with your imagination.

220
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,480
Madame... fuck you.

221
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,320
That's a pity, for you...

222
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,240
but even more so for Cherie and Jay,
I believe?

223
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,580
ADX Florence is a supermax in Colorado.

224
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,790
They've got the Unabomber,

225
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,840
head of the Aryan Brotherhood,
all the greats.

226
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,840
And your friends too. Maybe.

227
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,670
Or they go free.

228
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,970
But that depends on you.

229
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,970
Right now.

230
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,970
You can't do that.

231
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,770
Wait.

232
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,200
What kind of work do you do?

233
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Hey.

234
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,660
Um...

235
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,250
Come into my trailer for a second.

236
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,630
I have a surprise for you.

237
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,300
I have to stop by Vought Tower,
see my social guys.

238
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,550
No. Come on, blow them off. Come.

239
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,810
I will be back in 20 minutes.

240
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,930
And then...

241
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,850
I'll let you surprise me
wherever you want.

242
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,980
Ooh.

243
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,820
Yeah, okay.

244
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,080
- You see them?
- Yeah. I see them.

245
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Get in.

246
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,860
Here.

247
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,450
Seriously?

248
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,370
What is your problem with me?

249
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,750
I ain't got no problem with you.

250
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,960
Really? That's why
you won't even touch my hand?

251
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,250
Guys, come on. Not the time.

252
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,630
You know what? No.
I think it's exactly the right time.

253
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,970
I think the time is long overdue.

254
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,720
You know that I hate Vought
as much as you do.

255
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
You know that.
But it doesn't even matter to you

256
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,970
because what you can't stand
is in my blood.

257
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm sub-human to you.

258
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,850
Only good Supe is a dead Supe, right?

259
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,810
Your words, not mine.

260
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,940
- That's enough.
- You know what?

261
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,860
Underneath all that swagger,
you're just a bigot and a bully.

262
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,990
I know another guy just like that.
He's got a flag for a cape.

263
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,700
Annie, stop.

264
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,680
Fuck me.

265
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,430
Hughie, call them. Now.

266
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,310
Open the door. We need help.

267
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,900
I have a patient that needs help.
Hurry up. Please!

268
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,820
- What's wrong with him?
- Just open the door.

269
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,490
He's swallowing his fucking tongue!

270
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
- What's wrong with him?
- Easy.

271
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,850
Holy fuck.

272
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,360
What the fuck is all of this?

273
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,030
Vought is making more Supe Terrorists?

274
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,160
Who the fuck knows.

275
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,580
Goddamn. Brother's got a love sausage.

276
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,820
Stormfront is here?

277
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,070
How you doing today?

278
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,280
Good.

279
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,830
Do you want to show us
a little of What you've been working on?

280
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,870
Hey. Hey.

281
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,790
You're okay.

282
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,630
You're all right.

283
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,710
It's okay.

284
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,260
That is very impressive, Tim.

285
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,760
That orderly Stormfront's with,
he look familiar to you?

286
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,230
—What about headaches? Nausea?
- No.

287
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,980
Well, that's promising.

288
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,570
I think we are getting close.

289
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,690
Ma'am.

290
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,070
Can I go home now?

291
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,120
I want to see my family.

292
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,250
Tim, you were admitted
to Sage Grove because you're suicidal.

293
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,790
You could be a danger to yourself.

294
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,790
I'm not doing any more
of these pet tricks

295
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,340
until I talk to my sister.

296
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,300
Okay. Okay. We'll work something out.

297
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,700
Lamplighter. That's fucking Lamplighter!

298
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,330
I didn't recognise him
without the mask and hood.

299
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,380
Fucking Lamplighter.
We have to kill him for...

300
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,340
- No, no. No, we can't.
- For Madame Mallory.

301
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,420
- For her grandchildren.
- No, not right now.

302
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,680
First we got to find out
what the fuck all this shit is.

303
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,550
- Come on.
- Listen, listen.

304
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,140
Stick to the plan, Frenchie.

305
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,110
- Hughie.
- You guys okay?

306
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,360
- Stormfront's in there.
- That ain't all who's here.

307
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,700
Okay, okay. She just left.
Get the hell out. Now.

308
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,000
All right, let's get out of here.

309
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,420
Hey, Cindy.

310
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,470
Let's be cool. Okay?

311
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,550
You remember that extra helping
of Kraft Shells & Cheese

312
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,890
that I snuck you?

313
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,230
I like you. You know that, right?

314
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,320
Who are your friends?

315
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,860
We ain't his friends.

316
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,990
Go ahead, fuck his ass up.

317
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,490
You're dressed like his friends.

318
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,320
I don't like liars.

319
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,630
Shit.

320
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,260
Let's get out of here!

321
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,730
Hey, let go!

322
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,530
Stay the fuck back,
or I will burn your skin off, asshole!

323
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,490
You won't get the chance.

324
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,040
Someone help me!

325
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,300
All right, listen up, man.

326
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,970
You can burn us, but she's a Supe.

327
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,310
All you're gonna do is piss her off.

328
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,310
So why don't we all calm down
and live through this motherfucker?

329
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,700
What's going on here?

330
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,950
It's a lockdown.
No one's getting out of here.

331
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,780
- Gotta be an access code.
- At the front door.

332
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,250
And there is no fucking way
I am telling you or taking you with me.

333
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,750
You realise an army of Supes

334
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,370
on the other side of that door
want to tear you apart, right?

335
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,960
She can help.

336
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,630
I'm gonna take my chances.

337
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,000
Okay, you guys can come.

338
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,300
What the fuck?

339
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,810
Come on, M.M., pick up, damn you.

340
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,890
Your call has been forwarded
to an automated voice messaging system.

341
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,480
- Marvin.
- Hello.

342
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,730
Easy does it, lad.

343
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,240
No trouble from us.
You just stroll on by, yeah?

344
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,240
I don't want them to hurt me again.

345
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,580
No. No, no.
No one's gonna hurt you, son.

346
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,750
We're all friends here, aren't we?

347
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Hughie.

348
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,210
Hughie.

349
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,090
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

350
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,760
- Shit.
- Hughie. Hughie.

351
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,810
Hughie! No, no, no. No.

352
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,680
Can you cauterize it?

353
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,060
Fuck.
The kid must've fried everything.

354
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,150
I need power.

355
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,940
Well, you got a pretty shite
superpower then, don't you?

356
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,190
- We got to get him to a doctor.
- Okay. How?

357
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,950
I'm not gonna just sit here
and watch him bleed out. All right?

358
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,320
- Okay! Okay, okay. Come on.
- Come on.

359
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,830
- What about the others?
- They're on their own.

360
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,780
Ashley? My God. Are you okay?

361
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,530
Don't you dare tell me
you haven't found Starlight yet.

362
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,680
I've been searching everywhere for you.

363
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,550
What happened to your trailer?

364
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,680
Electrical fire.

365
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,810
How was your meeting?

366
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,770
Sorry, it ran long.

367
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,360
No need to apologise.

368
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,950
All right, well,
I gotta go run lines with Noir.

369
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,620
Scene 48 tonight. Real megillah.

370
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,330
- Something wrong?
- No. Nothing.

371
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,460
You sure?

372
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,960
Why would anything be wrong?

373
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,420
By the way, I went to the Tower,
and you weren't there.

374
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,090
No one had seen you.

375
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,010
So you're checking on me?

376
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,850
Wanted to see how your meeting went.

377
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,100
- Hold on. Let me...
- Explain?

378
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,030
Come on, now.

379
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,280
Why would you need to explain
anything to me?

380
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:14,020
Deep, your numbers among women
have been ticking up quite nicely.

381
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,060
Did you catch Malala Yousafzai's tweet?

382
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,350
Called you a sweetheart.

383
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,690
Well, she's the sweetheart.

384
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,610
So what's on your mind, A-Train'?

385
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,820
Um...

386
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,200
Deep invited me here, so you know.

387
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,200
Yeah, I don't know.

388
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,330
Just having a really nice lunch,
I guess, here.

389
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,500
And, Deep, what's on your mind?

390
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,710
Well, I think A-Train sabotaged me
my entire career.

391
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,210
- What?
- Well, you do think you're better than me.

392
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,380
And I fantasize about drowning you,
over and over again.

393
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,390
But, man, I don't want to feel that way
anymore. I want to be clean.

394
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,810
Boy.

395
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,100
Looks like we got ourselves
a good old Truth Exchange.

396
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,900
Hell, no.

397
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
- Please sit down.
- No. Look, man.

398
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,190
I've seen that documentary about you guys.
It's not my type of shit.

399
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,650
For a man in seven-figure debt,
a heart condition and in heavy withdrawal,

400
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,240
do you really think you have the luxury
to get up and leave?

401
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,500
Who told you that?
Did he fucking tell you that shit?

402
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,800
No. The Church knows all kinds of things.

403
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,130
But don't worry, we also know
how to be discreet,

404
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,140
especially for our members.

405
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,520
They're gonna give Shockwave
your uniform, you know that?

406
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,850
- Call him the next A-Train.
- No, they can't do that.

407
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,100
Why not? A—Train is a trademark.

408
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,730
You are just another nobody
from the south side of Chicago.

409
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,650
- Man, fuck you, man.
- I can help.

410
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,570
I can get you back in.

411
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,530
But first...

412
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
sit down.

413
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,210
Let Deep tell you his truths.

414
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,350
Come on, in here.

415
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,820
It's beautiful.

416
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,870
Hey. What the hell is going on here?

417
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,290
You'll are juicing people
with motherfucking Compound V,

418
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,540
only to burn them alive? Why?

419
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,630
Maybe I just like watching people burn.

420
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,840
I remember you, you know.

421
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,220
You were tailing me the night
that I torched those kids.

422
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,440
So why didn't you stop me?

423
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,610
Maybe you like watching people burn too.

424
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,610
[{speaking in French]
- No, no, no!

425
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,530
- Come on! Come on!
- Easy, easy. Breathe.

426
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,330
Easy. Come on, man.

427
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,690
And I don't want to hear
I'mma get tired of the pussy.

428
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,350
I love this girl.

429
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,360
Like, this is the one.

430
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,700
All right, brother. All right.

431
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,370
Congratulations, Marvin.

432
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,870
Thank you, colonel. Check it out.

433
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,080
It's beautiful.

434
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,040
The bachelor party I will throw you.

435
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,120
What's your thoughts about
transgender strippers?

436
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,790
Strippers ain't really
my kind of Hershey's,

437
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,920
with or without nuts.

438
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,920
But you golf?

439
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,670
Thinking about doing a golf trip.

440
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,930
Oi.

441
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,330
What?

442
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,960
What the fuck are you laughing at?

443
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,920
Sorry, mate.

444
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,010
You just look like one of them
poncy baton twirlers.

445
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,180
- A majorette.
- That's right, a fucking majorette.

446
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,690
You look good in these.

447
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,320
So here's what happens now.

448
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,990
You're gonna tell us every single thing
you see and hear at the Tower.

449
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,200
Especially when it comes to Homelander.

450
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,590
Please don't pretend
like you have a choice.

451
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,880
I look forward to your call.

452
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,730
Easy peasy.

453
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,280
I don't like it.

454
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,860
You don't back an animal like that
into a corner.

455
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,160
Fuck him.

456
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,120
We own the cunt.

457
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,120
Frenchie.

458
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,000
Don't let him out of your sight.

459
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,340
Hey, what's the trouble, miss?

460
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,390
Sir, I need you to get out of your car.

461
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,310
What are you talking about?

462
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,280
FBI. I need to commandeer your vehicle.
Bit of an emergency.

463
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,530
- Jesus, what happened to him?
- Long story, that.

464
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,070
Can I see some ID?

465
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,410
Left it in my other pants,
too busy saving this one,

466
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,620
but you can call my boss.

467
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,870
Yeah, okay.

468
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,040
Look, I'll... I can get you guys
to the hospital,

469
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,250
but we're in the middle of nowhere here.
I'm not gonna give you my car.

470
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,590
Have it your way.

471
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,800
Butcher.

472
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,920
Butcher.

473
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,090
Don't.

474
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,600
- Stay back.
- Whoa, okay.

475
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,390
- Stay back!
- That's not necessary. Let's talk.

476
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,810
FBI? Get real.
You're not even American.

477
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,190
What, is he even hurt?

478
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,070
What is this, some kind of a scam?

479
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,610
If I wanted to boost some wheels,
it wouldn't be a fucking Hyundai,

480
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,620
you daft cunt.

481
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,080
This is a "stand your ground" state.
You stay back.

482
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,200
You can stand
wherever the fuck you want.

483
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,620
I'm taking your keys.

484
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,000
Butcher, stop.
Buddy, just put the gun down.

485
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,920
- I said, stay back.
- I said, put it down!

486
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,580
You couldn't just listen to me
and stay back?

487
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,670
Come on. Cauterize him.

488
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,610
All right. It won't hold long. Come on.

489
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,640
Is this the right time to go shopping?

490
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:24,320
One, why not?
And deux... this is good news.

491
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,480
What do you mean by that?

492
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,740
Some aerated propofol,

493
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,330
some other odds and ends,
I'll make a knockout bomb.

494
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,580
Even for Supes.

495
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,370
Okay.

496
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,170
Why are we still alive?

497
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,760
- Dumb luck.
- Non. I mean, that night.

498
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,310
We went underground for months...

499
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,900
but you never came for us.

500
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,820
Not you, not Homelander.

501
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,570
...Why?
- You're disappointed we didn't kill you?

502
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,780
I thought The Seven always retaliates, no?

503
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,160
You're nobody.

504
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,570
Not worth it.

505
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,540
You didn't told them, did you?

506
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,170
Why wouldn't you told them?

507
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,630
Who says I didn't?

508
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,550
I figured
you'd boast about it to Homelander.

509
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,510
Must've been thrilling for you.

510
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,390
I'm not a fucking animal.

511
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,560
Only a fucking animal
would do what you did.

512
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,480
Drop it.

513
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,690
- You murdered innocent children.
- Shut the fuck up.

514
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,980
You watched them burn alive,
crying for their mama.

515
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,150
If that's not an animal,
then what is?

516
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,780
I didn't know!

517
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,160
I didn't know they were gonna be
in that bed.

518
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,250
It was supposed to be your boss.

519
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,720
Then they started screaming.

520
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,730
But it was too late.

521
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,690
So, what, are we supposed
to feel bad for you now?

522
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,730
Fuck you.

523
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,740
I don't want anything from you.

524
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,530
But you...

525
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,870
I saw you following me that night.

526
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,410
And then you disappeared.

527
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,540
I keep asking myself, why...

528
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,210
Why didn't you stop me?

529
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,380
Why didn't you?

530
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,300
Good question.

531
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,030
All right, all right.

532
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,250
- Cherie, this is not...
- He's dying.

533
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,040
- Quoi?
- Jay, he's OD'ing.

534
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,670
I don't... I don't know what he took.

535
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,880
- Take him to the hospital.
- Please come now! Come.

536
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,140
Serge, you fucking come right now.

537
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:43,970
Cher...

538
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Fuck.

539
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,490
Come on.

540
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,490
Come on, mon ami.

541
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,580
...Okay. Look at me.

542
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,840
You went out. Okay. Can you sit?

543
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,880
Come on. Come on, mon ami.
Come on.

544
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,260
- My God.
- He's okay.

545
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,600
Okay. You stay with him.

546
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,600
- You keep him talking. Okay?
- What?

547
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,350
- Where are you going?
- Don't let him fall asleep.

548
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,980
- What?
- I told you, I have something.

549
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,650
Something more important than this?
More important than us?

550
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:37,190
- Cherie, I cannot do this right now. Okay?
- Okay, fine.

551
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,570
Please, stay with him.

552
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,830
Fine, you want to go. Go.

553
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,740
We don't give a shit.

554
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,830
Serge?

555
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,380
I'll be back.

556
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,440
- He's burning up.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

557
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,570
- I appreciate what you done back there.
- Thanks.

558
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,570
Your approval means everything to me.

559
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,660
And some sarcasm to stick the landing.
Nice one.

560
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,710
You didn't have a choice.

561
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,170
You know what I was thinking
when I was looking at him?

562
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,510
"Why did you pull the gun,
you stupid fuck?"

563
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,100
That's all.

564
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,480
Maybe once
I would've cried over him, but...

565
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,190
now he was just another person in our way.

566
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,990
- No.
- No what?

567
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:11,450
No to that fucking look of quiet respect
or approval or whatever that is.

568
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,710
I don't want it.

569
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,960
We're nothing alike. Nothing.

570
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,610
You really think that's gonna work?

571
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,400
I think so.

572
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,870
You know, they're not trying
to make Supes here.

573
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,210
These people are test subjects.
They're trying to stabilize the V.

574
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,420
- Explain.
- Infants handle it best.

575
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,250
But adults? I mean, you saw what happens.

576
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,510
Sometimes you get powers,
sometimes you get a freak,

577
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,380
sometimes you just explode.

578
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,380
Vought is trying to stabilize it,

579
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:09,890
so that you put the V
in any adult arm, anywhere, anytime,

580
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,760
you get a solid Supe, solid powers.

581
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,140
Okay, so...

582
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,850
a thousand more Supes?

583
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,650
Hundred thousand? Why?
Why would Vought do that?

584
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,990
It's gonna fuck up their movies,
their merchandising...

585
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,150
Look, they don't tell me.

586
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,820
They just make me burn the evidence.

587
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,240
Okay?

588
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,380
My...

589
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,680
My best friend OD'd...

590
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,720
and I left to save him that night.

591
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,310
Why I didn't stop you.

592
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,190
You were at the party.

593
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:02,230
I was away for 30 minutes.

594
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,820
Came back, you were gone.

595
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,700
Did he live?

596
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,740
Your friend?

597
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
But I never saw him again, and...

598
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,130
Then he died a few months later.
Another overdose.

599
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,720
Are you serious? Frenchie, wh...?

600
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,590
Why didn't you ever tell us?

601
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,800
What difference would it make?

602
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,810
After all these years, man?

603
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,980
We would've let you off the hook.

604
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,190
What makes you think
I want to be let off the hook?

605
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,340
Get it off me!

606
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,880
Get this thing off of me!

607
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,650
Was that...?

608
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,410
It's okay.

609
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,200
That's his fucking dick.

610
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,040
Don't be so closed-minded.

611
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,530
- I thought you said that's gonna work.
- I said I thought it would.

612
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,090
Lamplighter?

613
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,470
Lamplighter!

614
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,440
I'm here.

615
00:49:55,610 --> 00:50:00,620
I just killed six subjects out there,
like a fucking Teddy Bear picnic.

616
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,120
What the hell happened?

617
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:12,420
Dr Carlton got the propofol dose
wrong again.

618
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,340
So Cindy got loose,
freed some of the others.

619
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,470
I'm sure some of them got out
before lockdown.

620
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,640
Where is Dr Carlton?

621
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,520
He was in the cafeteria,
and the hallway, and...

622
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,060
some of the walls.

623
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,240
Clean up this mess. I'm gonna go see
if anyone else got loose.

624
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,910
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,670
We need help!

626
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:06,810
What'd they say?

627
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,770
Just needs a couple of days
for the cefazolin to kick in,

628
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,610
but he should be all right.

629
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,280
- We don't have a couple of days.
- Well, we're gonna have to risk it.

630
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,830
Jesus.

631
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,840
- What?
- Just... It's the kids' shampoo he uses.

632
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,460
I can smell it.

633
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:41,890
L'Oreal for Kids "Strawberry Smoothie."
I've seen the bottle.

634
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,720
Hateful shit.

635
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,640
And his Axe body spray?

636
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,060
I mean, that's how Vin Diesel must smell.

637
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:58,490
You know, every morning, he slathers
his burn with Creamy Desitin.

638
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,150
- No.
- I fucking swear to God.

639
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,610
He's got rashes down there.

640
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,370
I don't want to know that!

641
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,290
Fucking mental, that's all I'm saying.

642
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,920
But he really just
never gives up on you, does he?

643
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,130
Aye.

644
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:23,090
And he follows you around
like a right little pup.

645
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,350
He's too good for either of us.

646
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,400
Yeah.

647
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:40,940
- I'm gonna Postmate Sugarfish.
- What?

648
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,160
I'm gonna Postmate Sugarfish.
Where's your phone?

649
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,910
- I can't hear you.
- Where is...

650
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,140
Homelander and Queen Maeve.
My God, they're leaving us.

651
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,110
- What's gonna happen?
- It's okay, everybody.

652
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:18,270
Hey, did you say Sugarfish?

653
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,610
Please save us!

654
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,280
- Take these two. Just these two, please!
- No, no. No!

655
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,450
What, so they can tell the world
we left the rest of them to fucking die?

656
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,250
- No, Maeve.
- Elena.

657
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,000
Take my daughters!

658
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,330
- Help us! You got to help us!
- Don't leave us!

659
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
I love you.

660
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,550
Tell the boys I love them.

661
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:45,970
I'm gonna show that to Homelander.

662
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:55,310
And he's either gonna leave us alone,
or I'm gonna put it on CNN.

663
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,610
Elena.

664
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,950
Elena. This is our out.

665
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,450
I was scared. I...

666
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,670
I know I should've stood up to him.
I know that.

667
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,300
Elena, I watched a plane
full of people die.

668
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,850
Why are you looking at me like that?

669
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,020
Yeah. Right.

670
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:41,400
Yo. Close stitch, but Hughie's okay.

671
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,480
Bien.

672
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,950
Hey, tell Butcher
about that thick penis around your neck.

673
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,030
Fuck you.

674
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,700
It's just Frenchie being Frenchie.

675
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,710
I am sorry.

676
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:13,100
For a long time,
I was trying to save you.

677
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,310
I thought if I did,
somehow that would make up

678
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,610
for the things I've done.

679
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,940
You never asked to be saved.

680
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,540
You cannot absolve my sins, no one can.

681
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,120
I know this now.

682
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,290
So...

683
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,250
I leave you alone.

684
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,600
Got to go.

685
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,700
- Colonel.
- Marvin.

686
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,250
- Where is he?
- This way.

687
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,130
Madame Mallory.

688
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,380
I know I wasn't welcome at the funeral,

689
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,300
so all these years,
I couldn't offer my condolences...

690
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,430
Where is he?

691
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,190
Why isn't this man restrained?

692
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,600
No need. I wanted to come.

693
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:46,230
I don't want to hear a single
goddamn word from you.

694
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,160
I thought this was behind me,
but it's not.

695
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,410
It never is.

696
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,920
Then let's both be done with it.

697
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,960
I know what you have to do.

698
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,340
Do it.

699
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,300
You'd be doing me a favour. Do it.

700
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:21,480
Madame, please, if I may?

701
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:27,520
Besides you, no one wanted him dead
more than me,

702
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,570
but I am begging you for his life.

703
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:38,240
I have no choice.

704
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,450
It won't help you.

705
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,960
All you'd be doing is ending his torment.

706
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,970
You cannot punish him
as much as he punishes himself.

707
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,390
Trust me.

708
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,640
So...

709
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:11,110
what exactly are you proposing
we do with him?

710
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,120
Hey.

711
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,080
I'm so glad you're here.
I want to apologise.

712
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,500
Please, just let me explain.

713
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:31,420
Flap, flap, flap
goes that little mouth of yours.

714
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,050
You remember you told me
that you don't break easily?

715
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,180
Well, I've been thinking about that.

716
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:45,770
A lot.

717
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,270
I will never lie to you again.

718
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,900
I will tell you everything.

719
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,320
Starting with this.

720
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,310
Your grandmother?

721
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,810
My daughter.

722
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:36,190
Chloe. She died of Alzheimer's
a few years ago.

723
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,490
How old are you?

724
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,370
I was born in 1919.

725
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,280
In Berlin.

726
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,930
- Is that you with...?
- Heinrich Himmler.

727
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,430
He was a lovely dancer.

728
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,810
And that's Goebbels.

729
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:09,850
And the most important man in the room...

730
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,660
Frederick Vought.

731
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,540
He gave me the first successful
V injection.

732
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,210
He taught me everything.

733
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,920
And then we fell in love,
and he gave me a daughter.

734
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:43,470
He made me, and his genius made you.

735
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:57,770
Frederick didn't care about
all the fans or stardom

736
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,610
or any of that shallow bullshit.

737
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:03,950
We are in a war for the culture.

738
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,330
The other races are grinding us down
and taking what is rightfully ours,

739
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:11,040
but we can fight back.

740
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,540
With an army of supermen, millions strong.

741
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,010
Because that is Vought's true destiny.

742
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:24,510
And you will be the man who will lead us.

743
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:34,390
You are everything that we dreamed of.

744
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:40,400
So I love you with all of my heart.

745
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,030
How could I not?

746
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,080
Everyone I have ever loved
is in the ground.

747
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,920
And then I found you.

748
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,960
We found each other...

749
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:05,760
and now neither of us
has to be alone ever again.

750
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,970
And that is the truth.

751
