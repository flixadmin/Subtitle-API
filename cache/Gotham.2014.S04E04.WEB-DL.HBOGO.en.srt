1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,360
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,560
Jim. Meet my daughter, Sofia.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,080
Do you ever think about walking
away from it all?

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,160
Sometimes.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,120
This drawing depicts a man being
healed by water.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,880
That's Ra's Al Ghul.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,000
He wants the knife.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,520
Opening bid will begin
at 50,000 dollars.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,640
A hundred thousand dollars.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,760
Two million dollars.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,560
Sold! To Mr. Bruce Wayne!

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,040
I guess you could say
I'm your number-one fan.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,320
What's black and white,
and read all over?

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,240
Zebra. With a gaping hole.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,720
I think something is wrong
with your brain, Ed.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,720
Gordon. You got a visitor.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
You shouldn't have come back here.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,040
I'm a Falcone.

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,840
You came looking for a gangster.
That's exactly what you found.

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,400
That knife is the key to everything.

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,520
Well. Not everything.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,640
Beautiful.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
And you bought this at auction?

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,120
Supposedly, it was the embalming

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,640
knife of the first-century
Mesopotamian king. Balahsi.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,880
And what is it that you want
of me, Mr. Wayne?

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,360
Anything you can tell me,
Doctor Winthrop.

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,520
I want to know
exactly what it is I bought.

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,680
Perhaps you should've considered
that before you shopped

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,600
2 million dollars on it,
shouldn't you?

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,120
Leave it with me overnight.

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm back.

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,320
Man. You really need to clean
that room.

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,720
My delightful grandson.

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,320
I have access to the very clean
Historical Records Room

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,440
at Gotham Central Library.

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,480
And he uses it for his homework.

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,880
Oh, Alex, let me introduce to you
Mr. Bruce Wayne and his guardian,

39
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,440
Alfred Pennyworth.

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
What's up?

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,480
Where'd that come from?

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,280
That Cuneiform's definitely
pre-Phoenician.

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,880
Alex is an avid student of History,
and sometimes assists me.

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,760
A word, Master Bruce.

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,240
Now it's all very well
involving that old geezer.

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,480
But a young man?

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,320
Just so you remember
who's after that knife.

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,800
What's so important about it
that Ra's Al Ghul wants it so badly?

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
We need to know.

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,560
Doctor Winthrop.

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Alex.

52
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,240
I have to ask you to keep
this matter between us.

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Of course.

54
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,280
Yeah. Cool.

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,320
I mean, yes, Mr. Wayne.

56
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
I'll check back tomorrow.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Until then.

58
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
Come on, Ed. Come on.

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
You can do it.

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,200
This has to be...

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,160
the perfect riddle.

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
No!

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Yes.

64
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Yes.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,440
Yes! Yes!

66
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,960
Tomorrow night, Oswald,
is the night you die.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Alex.

68
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,000
Bring me the Palmerian Codex.

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
What is it?

70
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,080
"He who rises from the waters,

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,000
whom death shall not touch,

72
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:11,120
with this sacred blade his final,
savage destiny shall be fulfilled.

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
The Earth will quake.

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,360
Blood will flow.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,880
All tremble...

76
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,800
before the demon's head."

77
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,080
What's "the demon's head?"

78
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,680
Not, "what," my boy. "Who?"

79
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,400
There is a legend in the time of this
knife of a man who could not die.

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,560
Or who died, but was reborn.

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,880
Have you ever in your reading come
across the name, "Ra's Al Ghul?"

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,040
He was a warlord.

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,400
But those guys always had
stories invented about them.

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,680
They're just stories.

85
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,320
My boy, people believe
in these stories.

86
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,800
They kill for them.

87
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,360
I think Bruce Wayne has stumbled
across something

88
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,200
much more complex than he imagined.

89
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,680
And infinitely more dangerous.

90
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,920
No one should be here.

91
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,960
Here.

92
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,400
Take this into my office.
Stay quiet. Quickly.

93
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,040
Doctor Niles Winthrop.
What a pleasure.

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Who are you?

95
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,800
Museum's closed.

96
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,600
How did you get past the guard?

97
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,000
My apologies.

98
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,480
But my business is pressing.

99
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,200
"Greek vase. Second century."

100
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,840
This was made by a forger in
Marrakesh in the 15th century.

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,560
He had some talent,
but told the most obscene jokes.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,400
Tell me who you are,
or I shall call the police.

103
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,880
I am looking for a knife Bruce Wayne
brought you earlier today.

104
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,920
I don't know what you mean.

105
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,760
The best liar I ever met
ran a brothel in Shanghai.

106
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,640
Her quite considerable gift was
that you knew she was lying,

107
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,600
but didn't care you so
badly wanted to believe her.

108
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,800
You, Doctor Winthrop,
are a terrible liar.

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,280
Where's the knife?

110
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,280
No, the police, they're coming.

111
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,800
I imagine they are.

112
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,160
"End of crime," my ass.

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Harper?

114
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
{\an5}Where's Bullock?

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,080
He asked me to fill in.

116
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,840
{\an5}He took a sabbatical for a few days.

117
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,480
{\an5}You babysitting me?

118
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,760
{\an5}Do you need babysitting?

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,120
{\an5}- What do we got?
- Doctor Niles Winthrop.

120
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,880
{\an5}Curator of Antiquities...

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,080
{\an5}Looks like somebody snapped his neck.

122
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,600
{\an5}No witnesses, of course.

123
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,360
{\an5}Fire alarm triggered security.

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,840
{\an5}Maybe the dead guy pulled
it right before the...

125
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
{\an5}Yeah. Thanks. Anything else?

126
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
{\an5}Yes, actually.

127
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,640
According to Professor Von Dead's
log book,

128
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,960
{\an5}the last person who visited him,

129
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,720
{\an5}I'm talking just yesterday
afternoon...

130
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
{\an5}Bruce Wayne.

131
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,920
{\an5}It's a crime scene.
Get him out of here.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,520
{\an5}It's all right. Let him in.

133
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Detective Gordon.

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
{\an5}What happened?

135
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,680
{\an5}We were thinking we would ask you
the same thing.

136
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,760
{\an5}You met with Doctor Winthrop
just yesterday, correct?

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
{\an5}I, I, I bought an old knife
at auction.

138
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,480
{\an5}Doctor Winthrop agreed to examine it
for me.

139
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,000
{\an5}I was coming by
to check on his progress.

140
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,920
{\an5}When was he killed?

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
{\an5}According to the fire alarm,
just past midnight.

142
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,000
{\an5}Whoever did it
must've slipped past security.

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,400
{\an5}His grandson. Alex.
He's my age, little bit younger.

144
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
{\an5}Have you talked to him?

145
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
{\an5}No one's seen any kid.
I'll get on it.

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
{\an5}Where's the knife?

147
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
Alfred was right.
I shouldn't have left it.

148
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,840
{\an5}Bruce. Slow down.

149
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,320
What's this knife?

150
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,920
You think someone would actually kill
for it?

151
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,280
{\an5}Detective Gordon,
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

152
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,520
{\an5}But all I ask
is that you let me come along.

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
{\an5}If this is because of the knife,
then I'm responsible.

154
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,840
Bruce, a man is dead.

155
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,600
A child is potentially missing.

156
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,120
This is no time to play detective.

157
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
What do you know?

158
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,080
What's so special about this knife?

159
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,280
As far as I know,
it was just an old knife.

160
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,120
But I paid a great deal for it.

161
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
And there was another bidder.

162
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,320
A very aggressive one.

163
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Barbara Kean.

164
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Right.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,560
Well, Harper will track down
the grandson.

166
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,440
I'll deal with Barbara.

167
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,000
You go home.
I'll call you when I need you.

168
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,600
You're here. Finally.

169
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,000
I've kept you waiting. Apologies.

170
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,480
I see my guests have arrived.

171
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Oh, yeah.

172
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Got to say...

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,360
they don't do much
for the vibe of the place.

174
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,560
If you had acquired the knife
when I first requested it,

175
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,240
it wouldn't be necessary.

176
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,720
What's so special about this knife,
anyway?

177
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,240
Sentimental value?

178
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,520
Only a destiny,
borne of blood and magic,

179
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,800
2,000 years in the making.

180
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,880
Now dog-boy here is gonna fetch it.

181
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,560
His name is "Anubis."

182
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,360
And, yes...

183
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,800
Bring me the knife.

184
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,160
And you can kill the boy.

185
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Boss.

186
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,000
Knocking, Victor. We discussed this.

187
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
She's here.

188
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,120
Show her in.

189
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,480
Ms. Falcone! Welcome to Gotham!

190
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,800
Mr. Cobblepot,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

191
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,200
Call me Oswald.

192
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,080
Please, have a seat.

193
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,240
Thank you for coming to see me.

194
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,840
I learned from my father,

195
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,080
"When the king of Gotham
summons you, you come."

196
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,480
And how is Carmine?

197
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,160
Can we hope to see him sometime soon?

198
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,040
Shall we just address the elephant
in the room?

199
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,080
By all means.

200
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,320
My father's illegal businesses
hold no interest for me.

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm here because the Falcone family

202
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,720
has a number of charities
that need my attention.

203
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,160
And you can only provide
that attention

204
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,560
by being here personally.

205
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,680
In my city.

206
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,840
- I understand your concern...
- Oh, do you?

207
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,360
But I assure you...

208
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
it's unfounded.

209
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,560
You know, your father taught me
many things.

210
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,840
Among them was,
"To nurture a healthy paranoia."

211
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,720
For example, when I took over,

212
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,200
some of his old cappos
went underground.

213
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,360
Now, perhaps
they've vanished for good.

214
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Or perhaps they're waiting

215
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,600
for a Falcone to return
to lead the rebellion.

216
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,440
Who knows?

217
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,160
But...

218
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,960
I hear your father's voice
whispering in my ear...

219
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,520
"Be careful."

220
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,600
Now, I need to know that you
are not on some fool's errand

221
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,560
to rebuild your father's empire.

222
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,800
Otherwise...

223
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm gonna stab you.

224
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,680
I was 13 when my father first
sent me away.

225
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
He said that Gotham
was too dangerous.

226
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
This is my home.

227
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,600
I wanted to come home,
that's why I'm here.

228
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,040
Is that enough?

229
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,280
Gotham. Mother to us all.

230
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,680
I think we have nothing
to worry about.

231
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,120
Give your father my best, will you?

232
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Jim.

233
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,640
What a lovely surprise.

234
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Barbara.

235
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
I heard you popped up.

236
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,000
Seems like you landed
on your feet, as usual.

237
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,520
A woman has to stay busy.

238
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
You seem different.

239
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,200
You like this "me" better?

240
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,720
You recently bet on a knife
at auction.

241
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,480
So much for catching up.

242
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,800
The knife is now missing,
and the person who had it is dead.

243
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,840
What were you doing last night
around midnight?

244
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,080
I was here. With witnesses.

245
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,240
We done?

246
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
No.

247
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,640
This place.

248
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,120
The money you used
to bet on the knife.

249
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,680
Who's bankrolling you?

250
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
A client.

251
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
And, no.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,960
Though tempting,
I can't give you the name.

253
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,120
Is it Ra's Al Ghul?

254
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,720
If it is Ra's Al Ghul,

255
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,280
you don't know
who you're dealing with.

256
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,720
I don't know who
or what you're talking about.

257
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,640
Now should I call my lawyer?

258
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,320
I'll be in touch. Come on.

259
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,400
You followed me?
After I told you to stay away?

260
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
What the hell were you thinking?

261
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,840
I told you I'm responsible.

262
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,160
You should've let me come with you.

263
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,400
It's clear she's lying.

264
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,120
I can help you find the killer,
find Alex.

265
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,320
That's my job. You wanna help?

266
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,800
Who is Ra's Al Ghul?

267
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
And why didn't you mention him
before?

268
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,560
I wasn't certain he was involved.

269
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,960
- The way she talked...
- You're lying. Again.

270
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,160
Ra's Al Ghul is the real leader
of the Court of Owls.

271
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,840
He's the one responsible for
the virus and having me kidnapped.

272
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,520
And you didn't think
to mention any of this before?

273
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,480
Why would he want the knife?

274
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,760
What's so important about it?

275
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
I have no clue.

276
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,840
That's what
I've been trying to find out.

277
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,000
- Yeah?
<i>- Gordon, the kid's not at home.</i>

278
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,480
<i>Apparently, granddad
was looking after him</i>

279
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,600
<i>while the parents were traveling.</i>

280
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,400
<i>He's not at school.
No one's seen him.</i>

281
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,120
Great. Listen, I need all
the info you can get on a man

282
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,800
named Ra's Al Ghul.

283
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,000
He could be connected.

284
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,840
<i>Sure. But, how do you spell...</i>

285
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,160
No one's seen the boy.
He's either hiding.

286
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,200
Or the man who killed his grandfather
has him.

287
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,520
Police were triggered
by a fire alarm at the museum.

288
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,880
Alex could've pulled it.

289
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,920
Taken the knife.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,720
If so, he'd be hiding. Scared.

291
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,720
Where could he be? Think.

292
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
I only met him for a second.

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,080
You wanna play detective?

294
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Now is your chance.

295
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,320
What was he wearing?
What did he say? Give me anything.

296
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,000
He had on his school uniform.

297
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,920
He just came from studying at...

298
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,240
Gotham Central Library.

299
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,360
His grandfather had a room there.
Alex has a key.

300
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,280
If he's hiding, he's made a choice
not to trust the cops.

301
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,400
If I show up, he might run.

302
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,920
He needs to see a face he knows.
Come on.

303
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,520
Ed Nygma sent you?
The Edward Nygma?

304
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Do it again.

305
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,200
<i>My once friend Oswald, now my foe</i>

306
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,400
<i>It's me, Ed, just so you know</i>

307
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,560
<i>It's time we meet,
I think you'll agree</i>

308
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,800
<i>You'll find me where
The Earth meets the sky</i>

309
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,080
<i>Where water flows, and birds fly by</i>

310
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,280
<i>At dusk we'll meet,
I'll see you there</i>

311
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,880
<i>We'll settle things,
Unless you're scared</i>

312
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,520
What the hell was that?

313
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,640
We should torture them.

314
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,920
Just get them to tell us
where Nygma is.

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,480
No, he just found us on the street.

316
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, that's exactly
what you would say.

317
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Leave!

318
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,520
That barmaid who kidnapped Ed
said he lost a step.

319
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,760
Clearly, she was mistaken.

320
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,320
He's up to all of his old tricks.

321
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,480
So I'll meet him.

322
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,280
You and your men will hide nearby.

323
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,640
Attack when I say.

324
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,200
Do not kill Ed, though.

325
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,880
I want Victor to freeze him again.

326
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,400
- Huh?
- Not you! The other Victor.

327
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,400
"Earth meets sky.
Water flows, birds fly."

328
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,400
Obviously, he means the pier.

329
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,400
Gather your men.

330
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,840
I want Ed Nygma.

331
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,640
Historical Records room?

332
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's in the back.

333
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,960
Alex. It's me. Bruce Wayne.

334
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,360
You can come out. It's safe.

335
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,680
Alex, please,
I, I just wanna help you.

336
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Alex.

337
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,320
This is Detective Gordon.
You can trust him.

338
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,080
Okay. Okay, all right.

339
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,120
I'm so sorry.

340
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,760
That, that, that man.

341
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,680
He killed him.
He killed my grandfather.

342
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200
It was a man? You saw his face?

343
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,160
I only saw him from behind.

344
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,840
It was the knife.
Did you know it was dangerous?

345
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
No.

346
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
I had no idea.

347
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,640
Alex, we need to get you down
to the station.

348
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
I can't.

349
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,440
That man, he'll think I saw him.
He'll come after me.

350
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,000
I will protect you. I promise.

351
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,000
He'll keep coming till
he gets the knife.

352
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
Alex, do you have the knife with you?

353
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,680
No. I hid it.

354
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,440
Take Alex, and meet me
at the station. Go.

355
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,920
- Who sent you?
- (Foreign language)

356
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,400
Thanks for clearing that up.

357
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,080
Bruce! Run!

358
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,400
- Bruce Wayne call in?
- No.

359
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,960
We released a city-wide BOLO.

360
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,240
What about that name I gave you?

361
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,920
Zip. I tried Richard Ghul,
Ralph Ghul...

362
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,040
Detective Gordon.

363
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,160
Ra's Al Ghul.

364
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,960
Minister of Antiquities attached
to the Consulate of Nanda Parbat.

365
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,240
Yes. Thanks for coming in.

366
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,720
Nanda Parbat,
that's in the Himalayas, right?

367
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,000
Well done, detective.

368
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,600
Few in your country have even
heard of our tiny nation.

369
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,200
Why don't we speak
in my captain's office?

370
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,640
Bit more private.

371
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,760
Of course.

372
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,120
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- Thank you.

373
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,480
I don't get it. This is the guy
that you're looking at for murder?

374
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,680
Why does he just walk in?

375
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,400
Barbara must have told him
we were looking for him.

376
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,560
- Yeah. But...
- Two thugs at the library.

377
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,200
If they're working for him,

378
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,680
they would've told him
that we've contacted Alex.

379
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,320
He could think
that Alex gave us the knife.

380
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,520
We can use that.

381
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,600
Call Alfred Pennyworth.

382
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
See if he's heard from Bruce Wayne.

383
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,000
And then this thing bit me.

384
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,120
I need to get you to a hospital.

385
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,960
- No. No.
- Then the police. Detective Gordon.

386
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,520
No, I can't. I can't.
They'll find me.

387
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
I'm sorry.

388
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm scared.

389
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,360
I don't know how you do it.

390
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,320
You fought those men, and I...

391
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,400
I just froze.

392
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,880
Same as when that man killed
my grandfather.

393
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,800
Fear is normal.

394
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,000
In the alley,
when my parents were killed,

395
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,880
I was terrified.

396
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,680
I just stood there.

397
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,200
There's nothing wrong
with being afraid.

398
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,680
Once you realize it's normal,
then you can put it in its place.

399
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,640
Then you can act.

400
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Fight back.

401
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,280
I felt bad for you.

402
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,000
When that happened to your parents.

403
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,120
You were all
the kids at school talked about.

404
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
What did they say?

405
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,320
That you live alone in a mansion,
don't go to school,

406
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,440
fly around in jets.

407
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,400
They make you sound weird.

408
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Maybe I am.

409
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,480
No! You're, you're cool.

410
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
I'm weird.

411
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,760
And, you're a little weird, too,
I guess, but...

412
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,200
you're weirdly cool.

413
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,240
I'll take you to the knife.

414
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,520
Can I get you anything? Coffee?

415
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,120
That won't be necessary.
I think you know why I'm here.

416
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,640
Enlighten me, Minister.

417
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,920
Barbara Kean, with whom you spoke,

418
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
is acting on behalf of my government

419
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,080
to procure a certain property.

420
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,240
Said property is the cultural
patrimony of my people.

421
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,480
Why not bid on the knife yourself?

422
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,760
There were competing claims.

423
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,880
And if we bid officially,
alarms may have sound.

424
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,040
So it seemed better to do it quietly.

425
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,040
But Miss Kean failed.

426
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,480
And now, regrettably,
I understand there's been a murder?

427
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,000
Doctor Niles Winthrop.

428
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,440
Curator at the Gotham Natural
History Museum.

429
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
That's awful.

430
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,880
But the reason I'm here, Detective,
is to press my claim on behalf

431
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,600
of my government and entreat
you to return the knife to me.

432
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,320
You say this knife is important
to your country. Please explain.

433
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,920
There is an ancient story amongst
my people of a man...

434
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,880
who could not die.

435
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,400
In his time,
he committed terrible acts,

436
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
raised a great kingdom,

437
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,600
and then vanished.

438
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
What happened to him?

439
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,600
If the legend is to be believed,

440
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,720
he walked away from his throne vowing
that one day he would return

441
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,920
and complete his destiny,

442
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,680
but that would require
a particular knife.

443
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,800
This knife.

444
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,240
A story, as I said.

445
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,360
But to my people, very meaningful.

446
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,200
I hope that satisfies your curiosity.

447
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Some.

448
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,080
But you see, Minister...

449
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,920
my chief concern...

450
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,040
is there's a boy,

451
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,600
the grandson of the curator.

452
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,280
He's being hunted.

453
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
Now perhaps that's because
of the knife,

454
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,200
or perhaps the killer thinks
he saw something.

455
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Did he?

456
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
No.

457
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,640
Well, then he's safe.

458
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,200
Yes, but you see, I would have
to know that for certain

459
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,840
before I would do anything
that might affect the case.

460
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,720
Such as release the knife.

461
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,160
May I see the knife, Detective?

462
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,440
It would so set my mind at ease.

463
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Hey!

464
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,120
Where the bloody hell is Gordon!

465
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,560
Gordon! Incoming!

466
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,600
Gordon! Where the hell is Bruce?

467
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,360
- You!
- Alfred!

468
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,640
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Back off!

469
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,400
Get your hands off me!
You don't know what you got in there.

470
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,200
Yeah, I am starting to,
but you are not helping.

471
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,720
I need you to calm down.
Let me finish talking to him.

472
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Gordon!

473
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,320
- Not now!
- Gordon!

474
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,400
He's bloody vanished.

475
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,360
He knows we don't have the knife.

476
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,600
We have to find Bruce.

477
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,880
- Donna Falcone.
- Do not call me that.

478
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,120
You got to hear us out.

479
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,480
No, I don't.
I didn't invite you here.

480
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,880
We're not having this meeting.

481
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,320
Now I'm gonna ask you,
please, politely, to leave.

482
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,960
We served your father for years.

483
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,520
When Penguin took over,
we had to go underground.

484
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,160
Then we heard a Falcone
was back in Gotham.

485
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,760
We knew it was time.

486
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,480
Did you ignore my father
like you're ignoring me?

487
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,480
I just told you to leave.

488
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,280
Just tell us when your
father's coming back

489
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,720
to put that Penguin in his place.

490
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,640
Please understand me.
My father is not coming back.

491
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,840
This is Penguin's city.

492
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,080
And I want you to leave
before he finds out you're here...

493
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,080
Too late, I'm afraid.

494
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,680
Victor, how many graves did you dig?

495
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Two.

496
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
But they're roomy.

497
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,800
And there we are.
My paranoia is put to rest.

498
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,560
You used me.

499
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,920
You had me come to your club.

500
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,240
You knew word would get out that
my father's loyalists would find me.

501
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,000
I was a worm on your hook.

502
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,120
With one difference, my dear.

503
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,240
The worm is usually eaten.

504
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,840
So you trust me now?

505
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,440
You're alive, aren't you?

506
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,080
I would plant roses.
They cover up the smell.

507
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,800
My father wouldn't
have killed those men.

508
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,200
He would have invited me
to his club as you did

509
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,600
but then gone further.

510
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,600
He would've invited me
to dinners.

511
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,480
Had us seen in public.

512
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,080
Sent the message
that the old order supports me.

513
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,120
And those men you killed
would've pledged you loyalty.

514
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,280
Now they're fertilizer.

515
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,080
See my father, he knew how to build
on the strength of others.

516
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,760
But it's your city.

517
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,120
New times, new methods.

518
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,440
There was an ancient
Sumerian jewelry box here.

519
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,080
I had just replaced it.

520
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,400
Hiding in plain sight.

521
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
Good thinking.

522
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
Bruce.

523
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,480
There's a legend about this knife.

524
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,560
That terrible things happened
because of it.

525
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,720
But, what if it's not just a legend.

526
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
My grandfather is dead.

527
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,880
The man that killed him,
he can't have this.

528
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,040
I won't let him.

529
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
I promise.

530
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,680
We have to get out of here. Run! Run!

531
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,480
The Nanda Parbat Consulate's
giving us the run around.

532
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,480
We can't get in there
without a warrant.

533
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,120
- Bruce still hasn't called you?
- No.

534
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,600
What the bloody hell were
you doing letting him tag along

535
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,600
with some murder investigation
in the first place, eh?

536
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Oh, no, no.

537
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,880
You do not get to lecture me
about a lack of honesty and openness.

538
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,000
You and Bruce have been up
to something for weeks.

539
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,440
What have you two
gotten yourselves into?

540
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,000
Damn it, Alfred, I'm on your side.

541
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,400
Well, that may be, mate.

542
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,120
But whatever Master Bruce
decides to tell you,

543
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,960
is his decision, isn't it?

544
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
You are his guardian.

545
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,040
You are allowed
to violate his privacy

546
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,840
if it is gonna
keep him out of danger.

547
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,160
Stick to the point.
What are you doing to find my boy?

548
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,040
What can I do? Huh?

549
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,360
I have every cop
in the city on alert.

550
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,840
But as long as Ra's Al Ghul
thinks he has that knife,

551
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,000
his life is in danger.

552
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,360
Yeah, right,
and what about the other boy.

553
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
Did he tell you where
he put the knife?

554
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,000
No. But I have to assume Bruce
is taking him to get it.

555
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
All right.

556
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,720
Well, there's got to be a clue
or something inside here.

557
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,400
- What? What?
- You stay here.

558
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,640
The access I gave you
depended on trust.

559
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,400
If you can't be honest with me,
there's nothing I can do.

560
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,720
Harper, if Mr. Pennyworth tries
to leave, arrest him.

561
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,280
Oi, on what charge?

562
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,400
She'll think of something.

563
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,360
I went to the pier.

564
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,440
I waited.

565
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,640
Ed didn't show.

566
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,080
He...

567
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,040
Oh, just get on with it.

568
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
Right.

569
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,480
One, two.

570
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,000
<i>I waited and waited</i>

571
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,400
<i>But you never came</i>

572
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,680
<i>You must be a coward</i>

573
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,840
<i>Or worse, a lame brain</i>

574
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,240
<i>I'll give you one chance</i>

575
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,440
<i>To make it right</i>

576
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,720
<i>Meet me again this time at midnight</i>

577
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,160
<i>I'll make this one easy</i>

578
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,400
<i>This place makes some people lie</i>

579
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,520
<i>Some people speak</i>

580
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,160
<i>And some people cry</i>

581
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,040
Honestly, that could be anything.

582
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,520
Can we please just torture them now?

583
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,760
Why not?

584
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Wait, man.

585
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
Run!

586
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Bruce!

587
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Down!

588
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,880
Let's go. Let's go.

589
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,400
Take him. Take him. Go!

590
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,200
Get off of me!

591
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
It's time you tell me
what's going on.

592
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,360
What is so important
about this knife.

593
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,480
Why are people dying for it?

594
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
Excellent question, Detective.

595
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,080
And you shall have your answer soon.

596
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,000
Just give me the knife
and I will release the boy.

597
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,560
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

598
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
Of course.

599
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,800
Bruce, hand me the knife.

600
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,840
Bruce! Hand me the knife.

601
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,040
You don't understand.

602
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,120
He killed Alfred,
and then brought him back to life.

603
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,400
And Alex's grandfather
was afraid of this knife.

604
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,560
I can't give it to him.

605
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,920
If we don't hand it over now,
Alex is dead.

606
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,480
- That is all that matters.
- No.

607
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,000
You don't know who he is.

608
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
I can't.

609
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,880
Well done, Bruce.

610
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,960
You're finally beginning
to see things clearly.

611
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,320
The question is...

612
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,840
are you strong enough?

613
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,680
- No!
- Drop the weapon!

614
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,240
Hands in the air. On your knees.

615
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
Arrest me.

616
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,080
Ra's Al Ghul is on his way
to Blackgate.

617
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
We made contact with Alex's parents.

618
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,960
It's gonna take them a couple
of days to get home.

619
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Bruce.

620
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,960
Ra's is a psychopath.

621
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,680
You're not responsible
for his actions.

622
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,280
I wanna help.

623
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,160
But everything you've said so far,

624
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,560
Alfred dying, and coming back
to life, magical waters.

625
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,440
Give me something I can believe.

626
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
Perhaps now you understand
why we held back.

627
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,080
It doesn't matter what you say,
Detective.

628
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,960
This is all my fault.

629
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,160
Alex is dead because of me.

630
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
I killed him.

631
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
Oswald!

632
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,760
I waited for you.

633
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
Again.

634
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,320
And you didn't show! Again!

635
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,120
You coward.

636
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,520
Where are you?

637
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,840
Here. And I may be many things,
but I am not a coward.

638
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Your riddles suck!

639
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,120
"This place may make some people lie,

640
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,040
some people speak,
and some people cry."

641
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,320
That could mean anything!

642
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,520
Lying! Speaking! Crying!

643
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,240
You're just describing
a range of human behavior!

644
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:58,000
No! I meant lying, as in lying de...

645
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,920
Laying down, lying down! As in dead!

646
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,920
The answer was Stoker Cemetery.

647
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
Clearly.

648
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,520
Only an idiot wouldn't see that.

649
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,160
Face it, Ed.

650
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,280
You can't make riddles
to save your ass anymore.

651
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,720
- I guess she was right.
- What? Who was right?

652
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,040
Your number one fan.

653
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,200
She said that there was something
wrong with you.

654
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,880
Took me a while to believe it, but...

655
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,880
You're not smart!

656
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,440
I am, too, smart.

657
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,800
- I'm The Riddler.
- Oh, God, that name again? Tell me.

658
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,040
How long did it take you
to come up with those riddles?

659
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,280
I don't know.

660
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,520
A minute, two minutes?

661
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Few hours.

662
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,480
Six hours.

663
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,600
- Six hours?
- Yes!

664
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,520
For two bad riddles?

665
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,880
Does that sound anything
like the old you?

666
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,200
Well, perhaps, I'm still recovering
from being frozen in a block of ice!

667
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,720
But revenge will certainly
make me feel better.

668
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,040
You will never have revenge on me.

669
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,960
Oh, yeah. I will!

670
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,080
Oh, no, you won't.

671
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Oswald!

672
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm going to shoot you.

673
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Yes.

674
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,640
You might shoot me. Kill me.

675
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,800
But only he can get revenge on me.

676
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,920
The man I froze on that pier.

677
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,520
The man who would've killed himself
before writing those idiotic riddles.

678
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,360
The man who's name
I still will not speak!

679
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,680
But he's gone.

680
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,760
You're just Ed Nygma.

681
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,240
And not even Ed Nygma.

682
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
Because Ed Nygma
would've noticed something.

683
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
What?

684
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,120
Doesn't it feel
kind of chilly in here?

685
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,560
You remember him?

686
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,920
My other Victor?

687
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,720
I'm going to put you on ice. Again.

688
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,880
You want the same pose
or something else?

689
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,360
No! Wait. Please.

690
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,720
Got it. Same pose.

691
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,840
No!

692
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,320
Okay, Oswald.

693
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,960
I'm not The Riddler.

694
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
Do it.

695
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Stop.

696
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,840
I've changed my mind.

697
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,680
I'm not gonna freeze you.

698
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,040
I would only be freezing Ed Nygma.

699
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,480
Who cares about that?

700
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
No.

701
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,280
A better revenge is having you live
knowing that you are not him.

702
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,800
And you never will be again.

703
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Goodbye, Ed.

704
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,120
Who am I?

705
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,400
I must've been seven or eight.

706
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
It was late.

707
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,920
I snuck downstairs to find my father
with a man before him on his knees,

708
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,640
begging for forgiveness.

709
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,160
My father stabbed him in his neck.

710
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,560
The next morning,
there wasn't a trace of blood,

711
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,320
and we had breakfast at that table.

712
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,200
Now you'd think I'd wanna stay far
away from Gotham but this house,

713
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,000
this city is in my veins.

714
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,560
I'm home, Jim.

715
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,360
Word on the street is three Falcone
capos have gone missing.

716
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,880
They were in hiding.

717
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,960
Penguin used me
as bait to draw them out.

718
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
And kill them.

719
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
And you let him.

720
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,280
Don't act the innocent, Jim.

721
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,240
You came to Carmine Falcone for help,
it was never gonna be bloodless.

722
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,480
So was that your plan?

723
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,080
Get close to Penguin,
gain his confidence, what then?

724
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,440
I need to know
what you're going to do.

725
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,560
No.

726
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,200
You don't.

727
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,120
You want the city back from Penguin,

728
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,520
I'll give that to you.

729
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,400
But you have to trust me.

730
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,560
Lockdown in effect.

731
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,360
Ready. Prisoner walking.

732
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,760
Stay sharp!
