1
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,570
<i>People will say I am a
monster for what I've done.</i>

2
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,243
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

3
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,509
<i>I always thought
that I'd have more...</i>

4
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,928
- time.
<i>- Dad?</i>

5
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,555
Dad!

6
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:09,036
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

7
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,914
Peter?

8
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,951
<i>He likes to sleep with
the light on at night.</i>

9
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,933
Mary, we have to go.

10
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,859
Dad.

11
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,317
Be good.

12
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:52,705
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

13
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,687
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt. All of it.

14
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,794
Just in case we...

15
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,068
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

16
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,737
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

17
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,844
Mary, we've been through this.

18
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:09,896
Our life as we know it is over.

19
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:13,692
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

20
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,862
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

21
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,626
He's just a little boy.

22
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,949
I know, I know.
But it's gonna be okay.

23
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,486
It's gonna be all right.

24
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,982
No rest for the weary, huh?

25
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,430
No, I'm afraid not.

26
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,524
Occupational hazard, I guess.

27
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,723
What is it you're working on?

28
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:55,526
Just planning ahead. Do you
think I could speak with the pilot?

29
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,649
Something you need?

30
00:03:59,029 --> 00:03:59,876
Perhaps I can help.

31
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,676
I'd just like to radio ahead
and make sure everything's in order

32
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,239
for when we land.

33
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,217
I think we both know

34
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:09,994
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

35
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,569
Richard.

36
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,051
- They say you're a genius.
- Richard!

37
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,691
Not if you thought
you could escape.

38
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,371
Richard!

39
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:34,849
Mary!

40
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,614
Mary!

41
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,522
Mare.

42
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,346
It's okay. It's okay.
That's okay. It's okay.

43
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,569
I got you. I have you, okay? Okay?

44
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,154
Just gonna make you safe.

45
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:13,103
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

46
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,743
- Roosevelt.
- What?

47
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,315
Roosevelt.

48
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,548
It's back up. It's back up.

49
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,497
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

50
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,757
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

51
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,227
What do you got for me today,
New York?

52
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,396
<i>Reporting live from
New York 1 chopper.</i>

53
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,857
<i>An Oscorp truck carrying
plutonium has been hijacked.</i>

54
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,901
<i>A police chase is in progress.</i>

55
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,758
All right. Let's get to work.

56
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,781
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

57
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,233
Spider-Man!

58
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,181
Hello, pedestrians.

59
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,027
Knock, knock.

60
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,007
Mr. Criminal?

61
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,427
Hey, my name is Spider-Man. You can call
me Web-Head, you can call me Amazing,

62
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,161
Just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it?

63
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,683
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

64
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:10,352
- I am killer!
- Okay.

65
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:13,481
<i>Warning. Plutonium-238 is
a radioactive material</i>

66
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,554
<i>and is highly explosive.</i>

67
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:19,445
Excuse me. There's more room on
the sidewalk, folks, please.

68
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,489
- Watch it, man.
- I got blueprints here.

69
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,016
A little help?

70
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,389
A little help, please.

71
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,706
You having a problem with your gun?
Let me help you out with that.

72
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,403
Coming through.

73
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,740
Too much work...

74
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,214
Oh, this is bad.

75
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,911
I'm gonna be right back.

76
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,451
Heads up. Watch out.

77
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,767
Okay. Okay. There you go.

78
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,770
- You okay? You all right?
- You're Spider-Man.

79
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,439
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

80
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,399
"Max"? How do you know my name?

81
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,818
It's written on your badge.

82
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,069
I'm a nobody.

83
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,530
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

84
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,447
Lick that.

85
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:05,032
All right. Listen to me.

86
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,352
- Now I need you.
- Really?

87
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,235
- You're my eyes and ears out here.
- Okay.

88
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,275
- All right?
- All right.

89
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,617
I'll see you out there.

90
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:15,071
<i>Warning. Violation of protocol.</i>

91
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:46,849
Hands up!

92
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,105
Get him, Spidey!

93
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,323
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

94
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,591
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

95
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,573
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

96
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,930
Get the hell out of the way!

97
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,684
Okay. Stop it! Stop it!

98
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,632
Oh, come on.

99
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,801
Hey, wait. Come back here.

100
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:21,338
Heel!

101
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,931
I got you.

102
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,791
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit
late. I got stuck in some traffic.

103
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:39,835
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

104
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:41,555
<i>- I know, I'm sorry.</i>
- Where are you?

105
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,580
<i>1st and Broadway, 2nd and
Broadway, 3rd and Broadway.</i>

106
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,257
Five minutes. Ten tops.

107
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:48,177
- Are those sirens?
<i>- No.</i>

108
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,470
- Peter?
<i>- No.</i>

109
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,305
- Peter?
<i>- No sirens.</i>

110
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,128
No...

111
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,892
<i>Peter.</i>

112
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,477
<i>What is happening?</i>

113
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,083
<i>Peter.</i>

114
00:11:58,383 --> 00:11:59,630
<i>Peter.</i>

115
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:05,973
<i>Hello?</i>

116
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:10,199
- Peter? Pe...
<i>- I'll be right there. Promise.</i>

117
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:14,907
This year's Valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

118
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,053
Good morning, esteemed faculty,

119
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,305
and families of my
fellow graduates.

120
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,879
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

121
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:43,816
Hello.

122
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,484
- Hey! Get off!
- I told you.

123
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,528
I am running a bit late.

124
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,363
It's over, Spider.

125
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,614
Really?!

126
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,825
I know we all think
that we're immortal.

127
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,702
We're supposed to feel that way.

128
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,274
We're graduating.

129
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:59,957
<i>But, like our brief four
years in high school,</i>

130
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,459
what makes life valuable

131
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:04,962
<i>is that it doesn't last forever.</i>

132
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,740
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

133
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:10,781
<i>And I know that now more than ever.</i>

134
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,834
<i>And I say it,</i>

135
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,515
<i>today of all days,</i>

136
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,464
to remind us that time is luck.

137
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,759
<i>So don't waste it
living someone else's life.</i>

138
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,611
Make yours count for something.

139
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,822
Fight for what matters to you.

140
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,490
No matter what.

141
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,189
Because even if we fall short,

142
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,991
what better way is there to live?

143
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,589
I'll take that. That's not yours.

144
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,412
Huh?

145
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,758
This is not end, Spider!

146
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,105
Michael Oates.

147
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,644
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

148
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:18,269
Alexis Ortiz.

149
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,230
Bo Parisi.

150
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:28,320
Peter Parker.

151
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:30,464
Hey, I think I know that guy.

152
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,961
Peter Park...

153
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:36,908
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,025
Wait, do that again.
Do that again.

155
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:55,072
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

156
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,512
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

157
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,494
- I am so proud of you.
- You earned it.

158
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,352
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

159
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:05,958
I know the first thing
your Uncle Ben would say.

160
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,209
Yeah, I know too.

161
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,587
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

162
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:14,925
The second thing he would say, "Don't
just follow the path, make your own trail."

163
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,426
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

164
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:18,220
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

165
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,078
Ben told me he made it up.

166
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:24,505
You really did
learn something here.

167
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:30,053
I wish your uncle
could have been here.

168
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,465
Yeah, me too.

169
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,634
And my folks.

170
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,599
Yeah. Yeah.

171
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,399
- Would've been good.
- Perfect d...

172
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,914
- All right, you can go. Go on.
- Huh?

173
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:47,166
I'll be right back.

174
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,002
- Is that your program?
- Okay, guys. Get together right now.

175
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,880
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

176
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,715
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

177
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,885
- Okay. I'll just be over here.
- Yeah, just give me two seconds.

178
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,845
- Don't go too far.
- It's good to see you.

179
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,668
- All right.
- All right.

180
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,348
Hey.

181
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:06,518
Did your traffic jam
have anything to do with

182
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,645
the Russian Mob

183
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,773
and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

184
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,053
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

185
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,986
- Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
- Yes?

186
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,070
Okay.

187
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,473
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

188
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,366
Can't keep me away.

189
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:22,826
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

190
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:24,523
- I won't be.
- Okay.

191
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,104
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

192
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,335
All night? I wanna hear
it all night long.

193
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,795
- Over and over again, all night long.
- Okay.

194
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,547
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was pretty good.

195
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:38,997
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

196
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:44,791
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

197
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,879
Hi.

198
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,467
<i>You're gonna make enemies.</i>

199
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,503
<i>People will get hurt.</i>

200
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,402
<i>So I want you to promise me
something, okay?</i>

201
00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:01,557
Leave Gwen out of it.

202
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,315
<i>Promise me that.</i>

203
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,268
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

204
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,454
Peter's outside. I'm gonna
go see if he's okay.

205
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,420
What are you doing?
What are you?

206
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:30,881
Peter.

207
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,049
What is it?

208
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,402
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

209
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,695
Are you all right?

210
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,552
I don't know what I'm doing.

211
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:45,726
It's my father, isn't it?

212
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,160
Yeah.

213
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,454
I see him everywhere I go.

214
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:54,251
I can't... I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

215
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,296
- Yeah, but we've talked about this.
- I know, but, Gwen...

216
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,653
- It's not his choice.
- Gwen.

217
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,719
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

218
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,078
And now I'm gonna come and
eat dinner with your family.

219
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,463
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

220
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,728
I don't know,
what does that make you?

221
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,586
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

222
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:22,467
- I thought that it meant you loved me.
- I do love you.

223
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:25,849
I love you.

224
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:29,307
Then why isn't that enough?

225
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,704
Huh?

226
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,914
Because what if
something happens to you

227
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:35,667
just like it happened to him
because of me?

228
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:39,087
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- Listen. No, n...

229
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,240
I cannot let that happen.

230
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,883
Listen to me.

231
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,036
You're Spider-Man...

232
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,830
and I love that.

233
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,179
But I love Peter Parker more.

234
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,009
That's worth it to me.

235
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,858
I can't lose you too.

236
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:05,014
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together,

237
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,598
who does that work out for, Peter?

238
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,027
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

239
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:18,523
Wow.

240
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,213
You have done this to me

241
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,801
again and again, Peter.

242
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,534
I can't live like this.

243
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,628
I break up with you.

244
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,133
I break up with you.

245
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,395
<i>Good morning, New Yorkers.</i>

246
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,981
<i>Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.</i>

247
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,524
<i>A few clouds to start us off...</i>

248
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,027
<i>The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate</i>

249
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,655
<i>over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.</i>

250
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:29,975
<i>How about that Spider-Man?</i>

251
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:32,534
<i>Last night on the Manhattan
Bridge, he saved a dozen lives.</i>

252
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,607
<i>We wanna hear your calls.</i>

253
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,956
<i>I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.</i>

254
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,334
<i>Who do you think pays the bills for
all the damages he causes, huh?</i>

255
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:42,694
<i>It's you and me, taxpayers.</i>

256
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,696
- You make this?
- Yeah.

257
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,590
This is a wind turbine.

258
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,468
You made this? No way.

259
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,165
This is amazing.

260
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,872
It's good as new, right?

261
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,849
I'll walk you home.

262
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,809
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

263
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,270
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

264
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,440
<i>I don't feel like my kids are
safe with him out there.</i>

265
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,764
<i>Get out of the way and let
the police do their job.</i>

266
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,651
<i>Some folks think that there might
be more than one Spider-Man.</i>

267
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:13,366
<i>What do you think?</i>

268
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:15,285
<i>One guy or many?</i>

269
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,371
<i>I'd love to know who's
behind that mask.</i>

270
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:19,623
Hey.

271
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,333
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

272
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,612
<i>We have a caller on the line named Max.
He says he knows Spider-Man.</i>

273
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:27,797
<i>Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.</i>

274
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:30,383
<i>He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.</i>

275
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:32,844
<i>He saved my life one time.</i>

276
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:34,416
<i>We sort of became best friends.</i>

277
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,432
How much?

278
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:38,892
Hey, you're that spider guy.

279
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,435
I'm Spider-Man.

280
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:41,515
Huh?

281
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,108
I'm Spider-Man.

282
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:50,237
<i>This Spider-Man... He's not the
police, he's not a fireman.</i>

283
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,516
<i>What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?</i>

284
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,632
Peter, honey?

285
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,646
Can I come in?

286
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:31,570
No!

287
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,072
Peter, the final
starts at 9, honey.

288
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,199
You said you would
take my car into the shop

289
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,909
because it keeps dying, remember?

290
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:41,109
Give me a second, Aunt May. I'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

291
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,123
Peter, please just let me in.
All right?

292
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,374
I'm trying to get my...

293
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,794
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

294
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:50,714
- No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
- What are you do...?

295
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,366
Peter! For goodness sakes.

296
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:56,595
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because it kee...!

297
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,806
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

298
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:01,224
I'm just...

299
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:03,206
I'm very naked right now.

300
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:05,674
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

301
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,772
- It is?
- Yes.

302
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:11,051
Oh, yeah, yeah, I was
cleaning the chimney.

303
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,944
We have no chimney.

304
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:14,446
What?

305
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,156
- You're late.
- I know, I'm late.

306
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,033
Downstairs, now.

307
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,266
- Can you leave? Because I'm naked here.
- All right, I'm leaving.

308
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,898
- Morning, I love you.
- I love you too. Hurry up.

309
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,999
Well, look who's here.

310
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,626
Spidey.

311
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,378
How was your morning?

312
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,588
Aces, Max, aces.

313
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:15,882
I've been out saving the world.

314
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:17,425
Protecting everybody.

315
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:20,658
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

316
00:24:22,543 --> 00:24:24,211
That's why you're here.

317
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,221
You remembered my birthday.

318
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:31,064
All the crime-fighting you've
been doing, and all of a sudden,

319
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,048
you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to...

320
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,029
But of course you would.

321
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:39,852
Why wouldn't you visit me?

322
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,934
We're best friends.

323
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,039
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

324
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,519
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

325
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,503
I know what they say
about you in the press

326
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,880
but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

327
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,716
Because you're amazing.

328
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,010
Wow. That's what the press needs.

329
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,334
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

330
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:06,420
You like that, Spidey?

331
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,435
I like it a lot, Max.

332
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,271
Good. Because today

333
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,064
is going to be

334
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:14,545
amazing.

335
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,307
Yeah. Circuit 39.

336
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:24,951
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

337
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:28,163
I just wanna know if you
can find another waitress

338
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,749
to replace me because I start
my training rounds

339
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,083
at the hospital.

340
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,878
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

341
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,421
Because he'll worry.

342
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,048
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

343
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,050
Double shift on Thursday.

344
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,827
Okay, bye.

345
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:47,332
- Who was that?
- Harvey.

346
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,394
- Doing a double shift, huh?
- Sometimes.

347
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:53,897
Got nothing else to do.
I like the girls.

348
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,734
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar.

349
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,947
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the <i>Bugle,</i> so that ought to help.

350
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:06,284
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

351
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,994
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

352
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:10,580
If it was 1961, he
pays me a fair wage.

353
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,250
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

354
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,503
- I'm doing my laundry.
- No, I do the laundry.

355
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,256
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

356
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:22,133
I understand that.
I'm in college now.

357
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:25,094
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.

358
00:26:25,374 --> 00:26:27,934
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red

359
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,287
- so no.
- That was a mistake.

360
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:32,352
Because I was washing
the American flag.

361
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,647
- My... Can I please just...?
- No one washes a flag.

362
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,967
I do, and I won't anymore.

363
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,150
- This is my machine.
- Fine. It's just underwear.

364
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,820
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

365
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,597
Back off, eat your breakfast.

366
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:48,243
All right, laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.

367
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,828
- I'll do it.
- No, forget it.

368
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,950
- Give it to me.
- I'll do it some other time.

369
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:54,499
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

370
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,071
Jerk.

371
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,191
Not gonna make it.

372
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:04,864
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

373
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,996
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

374
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,893
<i>Oscorp Industries</i>

375
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:18,648
<i>is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.</i>

376
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:23,152
<i>By converting aging power stations

377
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:26,906
<i>we are generating clean, green,

<i>and eventually the world

380
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:35,415
- Dillon. You're late.
- Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

381
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,500
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible

382
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,294
for the entire city's
energy supply?

383
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,504
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid

384
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:43,882
and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that,

385
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,865
and those power grids
were designed by me.

386
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,287
You designed them?

387
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,513
Sure you did.

388
00:27:50,793 --> 00:27:52,415
And I'm Spider-Man.

389
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,476
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

390
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:59,085
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna
rip your well-groomed head off!

391
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,303
Now, get to work.

392
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:04,611
<i>What floor, please?</i>

393
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,310
- Seventy-four.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

394
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:08,844
Oh, hold that!

395
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,075
- Can you hold that, please?
- I got it.

396
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:13,286
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

397
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,330
Most people would have
just let those close.

398
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,206
Most people
don't notice other people.

399
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:19,834
<i>- What floor, please?</i>
- Um, Sixty-three...

400
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:21,669
I got it. I got it. What is it?

401
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,196
Sixty-three.

402
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,089
<i>Sixty-three, please.</i>

403
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:26,382
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- In a hurry.

404
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:29,006
Thank you very much.

405
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:34,891
I'm Max. Max Dillon.

406
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,476
I'm Gwen.

407
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,754
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

408
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,211
Is it your birthday?

409
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:46,194
Oh, yeah. Well, I... They... Friends
of mine made this flyer up.

410
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,279
I'm having a birthday
party at a big club.

411
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,989
- A lot of celebrities.
- Wow.

412
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:53,284
Would love to invite you, it's
just that the guest list is closed.

413
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:56,704
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

414
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:58,744
- That's exciting.
<i>- ...dressed as Spider-Man</i>

415
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,166
<i>hanging out near the blaze.</i>

416
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:04,071
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

417
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,536
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

418
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:10,385
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved

419
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,866
me.

420
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,750
He said he needed me.

421
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,004
That must be a good feeling.

422
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,544
<i>Sixty-third floor.</i>

423
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,043
It was nice to meet you, Max.

424
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,756
Wait. She remembered my name.

425
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,449
Welcome home.

426
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:58,875
It's dark in there.

427
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,207
Your eyes will adjust.

428
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,377
It's better this way.

429
00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:34,744
Dad.

430
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:44,421
This is not how I
imagined I would die.

431
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:47,440
Looking at my son

432
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,843
and seeing a stranger.

433
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,764
You have such potential, Harry.

434
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:58,451
Such fierce intelligence,

435
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,536
and you're throwing it all away.

436
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:03,018
No, you threw me away.

437
00:31:05,112 --> 00:31:08,441
You kicked me off to
boarding school when I was 11.

438
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,006
On my 16th birthday,

439
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:13,966
you sent me Scotch.

440
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:16,344
Or one of your assistants did.

441
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,597
I'm pretty sure
because the card read:

442
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:24,143
"With compliments, Norman Osborn."

443
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:27,021
I don't expect forgiveness from you

444
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:28,969
anymore.

445
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,568
I don't believe in miracles.

446
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:35,530
How could you possibly understand

447
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,575
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed

448
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:41,807
for something greater?

449
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,455
And not just for me.

450
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:46,152
For you!

451
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,359
Has your hand
started to twitch yet?

452
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,906
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming,

453
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,959
hiding under your skin,

454
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:03,291
waiting to show itself.

455
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,643
To show you

456
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,892
who you really are.

457
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:15,720
Retroviral hyperplasia.

458
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,016
I never told you...

459
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,273
that it's genetic.

460
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:26,940
Our disease,

461
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,273
the Osborn curse.

462
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,659
And it began at your age.

463
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,445
Let me see it.

464
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:40,536
Your hand. Give it to me.

465
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:52,011
The greatest inheritance
I can give you

466
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,900
isn't merely money.

467
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,381
It's this.

468
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,322
The sum total of all my work.

469
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,701
Everything I did to stay alive.

470
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,370
Maybe you can succeed

471
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,727
where I failed.

472
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,692
<i>Norman Osborn, the legendary founder

00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:51,874
<i>and affected
the lives of millions.</i>

479
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:56,504
<i>I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:</i>

480
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,340
<i>"We can do better.
And we should do better."</i>

481
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,845
<i>Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."</i>

482
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:07,828
<i>But change isn't just a slogan.</i>

483
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:09,725
<i>It begins with hard work.</i>

484
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:13,630
<i>Change begins with
persistence and commitment.</i>

485
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:17,149
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

486
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:21,862
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

487
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:23,193
But not today.

488
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:25,700
Today is for mourning.

489
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,077
- Hello?
<i>- Is this Gwen Stacy?</i>

490
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,453
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

491
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:33,578
<i>I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars
Program. We have some exciting news.</i>

492
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,881
- Dillon. You stay here.
- What?

493
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:43,881
There's a current flow problem in
the lab. Why don't you take a look?

494
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,951
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

495
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,265
- Because you're special.
- Smythe.

496
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,122
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

497
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,847
Happy birthday.

498
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:03,096
<i>The generation of electricity by
living organisms to fend off...</i>

499
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,192
Let's see what's going
on with you. Hey, guys.

500
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,565
<i>The genetically manipulated...</i>

501
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,722
At least somebody's partying.

502
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:11,559
All right. Just a little sick.

503
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,146
I got your medicine, though.

504
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:19,587
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

505
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,959
Designed the grid...

506
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:23,729
<i>- Warning:</i>
- I should've stretched.

507
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:26,594
<i>- Malfunction in Sector 5A.</i>
- I know. Just a little indigestion.

508
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,347
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, huh, did you, Kari?

509
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,557
Think you can sing
"Happy Birthday" for me?

510
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:34,005
I'll just have to sing it
for myself.

511
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,269
- Gilbert?
<i>- What?</i>

512
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:39,023
It's Max. Can we shut down
power on Sector 32, please?

513
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,423
<i>Forget it. I'm out the door.</i>

514
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,479
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

515
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,266
<i>- Sorry, Max.</i>
- Hello?

516
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:50,098
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

517
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:51,952
This is crazy.

518
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:51,971
<i>System restored.</i>

519
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,828
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

520
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,558
<i>Harry,</i>

521
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,643
Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny

522
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:00,062
in the wake of
Dr. Connors' recent,

523
00:37:00,342 --> 00:37:01,397
breach of trust.

524
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,982
You mean people are pissed off

525
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:06,386
because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

526
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,655
Given that,

527
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:13,325
all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed

528
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:15,828
to restore investor confidence.

529
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,665
That is the Osborn way.

530
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:23,586
Whatever's inconvenient around
here, just get rid of it, right?

531
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,491
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

532
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,634
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

533
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:32,845
Sure, sure. I get it.

534
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,222
Twenty-year-old kid.

535
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:37,057
Two hundred billion dollar company.

536
00:37:37,337 --> 00:37:39,130
What was Dad thinking?

537
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:41,883
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

538
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:47,318
Surely, someone must've
questioned his sanity in the end.

539
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,696
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

540
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,157
It would've made this
conversation a lot easier.

541
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,935
- Harry...
- It's Mr. Osborn.

542
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,314
We're not friends.

543
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,029
Hi.

544
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,790
You were his assistant, right?

545
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,752
What's your name?

546
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,433
Felicia.

547
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:21,060
Felicia.

548
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,686
From now on,

549
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:26,966
everybody at this table
works for Felicia

550
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:30,762
because Felicia works for me.

551
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,099
Would anybody like to speak up?

552
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:39,725
Well, good. Then you can all
keep yourjobs a little longer.

553
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:44,362
Sir, there's a Peter
Parker here to see you.

554
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:55,790
Felicia, I wanna see
every file on this list.

555
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,044
Every single one.

556
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:08,094
Peter Parker.

557
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:11,465
It's like seeing a ghost.

558
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,968
Hey, Harry.

559
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,018
Random.

560
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,848
- What, 10 years.
- It's eight.

561
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,441
But you're close.

562
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,773
What's up?

563
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:26,112
I saw the news, man.

564
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,336
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and...

565
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:33,821
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

566
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:36,573
I'm with some people.

567
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:41,328
I'm in a...

568
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,891
I'm in a meeting.

569
00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:44,727
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

570
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,604
I know it's been a long time.

571
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,773
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

572
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,847
And you were so there for me
when my parents...

573
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,184
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

574
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,011
Thank you.

575
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,103
It's good to see you, man.

576
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:05,811
It's good to see you.

577
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:08,605
I'm sorry about your dad.

578
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,736
You got your braces off.

579
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,925
Now there's nothing to
distract from your unibrow.

580
00:40:24,379 --> 00:40:26,001
There he is.

581
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:28,646
There he is.

582
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,773
You still blow-dry your
hair every morning?

583
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:35,736
You know, one of my
manservants holds the hair dryer

584
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,780
but I work the comb, okay?

585
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,034
So at least I'm not
completely helpless.

586
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,516
You're stupid.

587
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,170
After graduation, I went
to Brazil, then Singapore.

588
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,570
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

589
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:56,465
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

590
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,071
I saw you.

591
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,010
What do you mean, you saw me?

592
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,450
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

593
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,390
You know what I'm talking about?

594
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,308
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

595
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:09,311
Dude, that whole model
thing is so exhausting.

596
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:10,933
I know.

597
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,764
What? You got a lady?

598
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:23,104
That's a question.

599
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:25,411
That's a question.

600
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,143
Buddy.

601
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:29,736
No, I don't.

602
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,901
Yeah.

603
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:34,365
I don't know. It's...

604
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,508
I don't know. It's complicated.

605
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,831
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

606
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,557
What's her name? Who is she?

607
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,058
Her name's Gwen.

608
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,085
Gwen Stacy.

609
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,355
- Gwen Stacy.
- She works for you.

610
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:55,065
Really? She works for me?

611
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,731
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

612
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:02,823
You know, when my
father sent me away

613
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,182
I tried to forget
everything about this place.

614
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,603
I guess that kind of included you.

615
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,233
You ain't gotta explain
anything to me, man.

616
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:19,528
We both got dumped.

617
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,534
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

618
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,268
My dad left a briefcase.

619
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:34,062
That's all I got,
briefcase full of junk.

620
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:36,648
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

621
00:42:36,928 --> 00:42:38,880
How's that working out for you?

622
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:40,924
Perfectly.

623
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,308
Dude. Nice arm.

624
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,080
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.

625
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,458
<i>You could do it too if you
just strengthened up that.</i>

626
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,155
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

627
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,910
<i>You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.</i>

628
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,245
<i>Giant lizards</i>

629
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,744
and spider guys.

630
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,431
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

631
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:13,185
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

632
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:17,545
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

633
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,650
I'm so impressed.

634
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,224
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

635
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,862
For what?

636
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:26,824
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

637
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,530
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."

638
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,790
Who was he?

639
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,023
Maxwell Dillon.
Electrical engineer.

640
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,838
No associates or friends
to speak of.

641
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,383
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

642
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,989
The guy was

643
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:47,953
invisible.

644
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:52,792
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

645
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,040
We've gotta find a way
to get him out.

646
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,230
In the meantime, if the press
gets hold of this accident,

647
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,690
our stock will crater.

648
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,016
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

649
00:44:05,725 --> 00:44:08,644
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

650
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:16,871
Hey.

651
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:45,671
Hey, moron! Get out of the street!

652
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:00,811
Hey. Hi.

653
00:46:02,884 --> 00:46:04,131
Hi.

654
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,400
You look amazing.

655
00:46:08,723 --> 00:46:12,114
I'm sorry for the spontaneous
outreach. It was kind of...

656
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,063
No. I don't... I... Spontaneous...

657
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:17,202
is all right. You know.

658
00:46:17,482 --> 00:46:20,151
Well, I just figured it was time.

659
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,249
You know?

660
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,652
Time that we try to be friends.

661
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,158
Yeah.

662
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,408
Friends, yeah. That's...

663
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,301
great.

664
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:35,804
I just don't want us
to be complicated.

665
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,390
I was just saying that
to someone. I hate complicated.

666
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,292
Keep it simple.

667
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,021
Okay, great, great. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. All right.

668
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,753
Well, I mean...

669
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:52,654
If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

670
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,823
- Some ground rules?
- Yeah, some ground rules.

671
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,783
Like that.

672
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:58,480
Like what?

673
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,747
- That laugh. That laugh.
- What?

674
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,540
That's off the table.

675
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,584
- My laugh is off the table?
- Off the table.

676
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,957
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

677
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,450
That's still adorable.

678
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,968
- That was not adorable.
- It's adorable.

679
00:47:15,248 --> 00:47:16,428
No, it's not adorable.

680
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,347
- Okay. I have a ground rule.
- Oh, good.

681
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:21,141
What is it?

682
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,965
Don't tell me that I look amazing

683
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,257
with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

684
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,306
I'm really serious about that one.

685
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,279
- Oh, no.
- What?

686
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,364
I just figured out
the next ground rule.

687
00:47:36,644 --> 00:47:37,741
What?

688
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,493
No more of this.

689
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,745
No more of this little
nose rub that you do.

690
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,545
- This?
- Don't think I haven't... Hey.

691
00:47:43,818 --> 00:47:46,500
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

692
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,168
This is killing me.

693
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,921
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

694
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,653
Come on.

695
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,660
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

696
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,508
Um, yeah. So I did that.

697
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:41,638
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

698
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,558
- Yeah. No, I know.
- Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

699
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,264
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

700
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,886
How do you know that?

701
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:56,762
How do you know I love it there?

702
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,726
Because,

703
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,601
Because you told me.

704
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:07,901
It just opened last month.

705
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,483
Have you been following me?

706
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,324
I knew it.

707
00:49:20,748 --> 00:49:22,200
How often?

708
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,058
Just once a day.

709
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:28,881
Sometimes.

710
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,965
Sometimes more.

711
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,987
Oh, boy.

712
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,593
Why?

713
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:46,686
Make sure I'm safe?

714
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:49,164
- And...
- And what?

715
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:53,069
And because it's the closest
I can get to still being with you.

716
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:07,416
I'm moving to England.

717
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,046
What?

718
00:50:17,555 --> 00:50:18,944
Yeah.

719
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:23,054
I have a... I'm up for a
scholarship to Oxford.

720
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,077
In molecular medicine. And it's
between me and this other kid.

721
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,204
There's this oral exam
that we have to do

722
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,207
and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

723
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,334
And... And it's... it could be him.

724
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,378
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

725
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:40,158
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

726
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,372
- Wow.
- Yeah.

727
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:45,374
And I'm really excited.

728
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,123
That's...

729
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,711
England.

730
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:56,878
What?

731
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,081
Station, I need a 10-85.

732
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:58,501
Send out additional units to the
south-end corner of Duffy Square.

733
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:00,462
Folks, could you step to the side?

734
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,070
Everybody get out of the
way! Get out of the way!

735
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,948
Sir, get your hands away
from the cables right now!

736
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,888
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables!

737
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,336
Let me see your hands, please!

738
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:15,143
You stay right where you are!

739
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,603
Do not move!

740
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,211
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

741
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,500
Get down on the ground, now!

742
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,751
Stop!

743
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,471
Get your ass down on
the ground! Now!

744
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:43,338
- It's not my fault!
- Sir!

745
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,923
- Stop!
- I'm gonna need for you

746
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,883
- Please!
- to get down on the ground, now!

747
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:50,382
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

748
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:54,457
Oh, my gosh.

749
00:52:55,713 --> 00:52:58,507
They see me. You see me.

750
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,011
You see me.

751
00:53:02,428 --> 00:53:04,096
They see me.

752
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,914
- No! No! Stop!
- On the ground now!

753
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:20,792
- Don't do that. Please!
- It's over, freak!

754
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,378
Wait! It's not my fault.

755
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,625
It's not my fault!

756
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,201
I said stop!

757
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:38,118
I'm glad you're not one of
those cops that rides a horse.

758
00:53:45,012 --> 00:53:47,556
All team members, hold your
fire and wait for my call.

759
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,514
<i>All units, hold your fire! I repeat,
hold your fire! Stand down!</i>

760
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,329
Stop. Stop it.

761
00:53:58,609 --> 00:53:59,935
Yo, Sparkles!

762
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:02,859
Hey, how you doing?

763
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,129
- It's you?
- Yeah, I know it's me.

764
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,485
Who are you?

765
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:10,529
You don't remember me?

766
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,911
No. Should I?

767
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,723
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

768
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,391
You saved me.

769
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:20,310
You said you needed me.

770
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,438
- You're the guy with the blueprints.
- Yes.

771
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,856
Blueprints.

772
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:29,819
Yes, I remember you. Of course I
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

773
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:32,864
- What's your name again?
- How could you forget me?

774
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,533
- I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
- It's Max.

775
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:37,577
- Is it "Max"?
- Yes.

776
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,980
I'm sorry I didn't
recognize you with the...

777
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:41,664
You look different.

778
00:54:41,944 --> 00:54:43,500
How are you?

779
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,543
I don't know what's
going on with me.

780
00:54:45,823 --> 00:54:47,991
I can see that. I can...
I believe you.

781
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:53,532
It's strange, the power
I feel. I got so much...

782
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:55,470
I got so much anger.

783
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,473
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and you're scared.

784
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,513
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

785
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,707
I can see you don't want to
hurt anybody.

786
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:05,452
- It's gonna be all right.
- Got a clear shot. Standing by.

787
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,682
- I don't want them shooting me anymore.
- They won't.

788
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,235
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

789
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,821
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

790
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:16,324
You and me, okay? It's just you
and me talking.

791
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:19,953
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

792
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,434
I just...

793
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,832
I just wanted everyone to see me.

794
00:55:25,112 --> 00:55:27,001
<i>He makes a move, take that shot.</i>

795
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:29,170
How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

796
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,214
Away from all these people, okay?

797
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,661
Yeah, yes.

798
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,255
No! No! Stop!

799
00:55:39,043 --> 00:55:40,335
Max!

800
00:55:58,729 --> 00:56:01,557
<i>Spidey, Spidey, Spidey!</i>

801
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,077
You stupid freak!

802
00:56:11,325 --> 00:56:13,152
Electro dummy!

803
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,140
Get out of here, you freak!

804
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,349
Shut up!

805
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,917
You're so selfish.

806
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,189
Stay with me, Max.

807
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:31,608
You set me up.

808
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,067
No, I didn't set you up.

809
00:56:33,347 --> 00:56:34,819
You lied to me!

810
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:36,904
No, I'm trying to help you.
Let me help you.

811
00:57:24,857 --> 00:57:25,991
Are you all right?

812
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,378
It's my birthday.

813
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,826
Now it's time for me
to light my candles.

814
00:58:53,946 --> 00:58:55,944
Do we have visual on Spider-Man?

815
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,493
Does anyone have visual
on Spider-Man?

816
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:12,894
Okay. All right, that's
enough. All right.

817
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,520
- Mike.
- Yeah.

818
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,105
- Big John.
- Nice job.

819
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:17,690
Nice work, fellas.

820
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,969
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

821
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,482
Spider-Man.

822
00:59:36,697 --> 00:59:38,149
England?

823
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,901
Really?

824
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,170
Good talk.

825
01:00:10,272 --> 01:00:11,536
<i>Our coverage</i>

826
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:14,613
<i>of this breaking story begins with New
York 1's Jessica Abo at the scene.</i>

827
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:17,006
<i>That's right. We're standing
here with two eyewitnesses</i>

828
01:00:17,286 --> 01:00:19,043
<i>who are going to tell
us what they just saw.</i>

829
01:00:19,323 --> 01:00:21,254
<i>Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?</i>

830
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,039
<i>How do you think
he beat this creature?</i>

831
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,676
<i>Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized, Spidey's suit.
That's why he didn't get electrocuted.</i>

832
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,220
<i>Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.</i>

833
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,980
<i>Thank you very much
to the two of you.</i>

834
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,683
<i>As you can tell, so many questions
remain unanswered.</i>

835
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,523
<i>We will bring you the latest
information as it becomes available.</i>

836
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:39,218
<i>For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1.
Let's send it back to you.</i>

837
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:29,674
<i>Online polls show a sudden uptick</i>

838
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,301
<i>in public sentiment in
favor of the web-crawler.</i>

839
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:36,426
<i>Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.</i>

840
01:03:07,616 --> 01:03:10,006
<i>Next-generation military body armor.</i>

<i>Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair,</i>

<i>direct nervous system interface.</i>

843
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,024
<i>So the common household spider,</i>

844
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,608
<i>um, unlike human cells,</i>

845
01:03:29,888 --> 01:03:32,445
<i>theirs contain the
power to self-heal</i>

<i>from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.</i>

<i>We've used a radioactive isotope

<i>Welcome to Dr. Jallings,
Science Investigator.</i>

849
01:03:46,488 --> 01:03:49,295
<i>Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.</i>

850
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:52,590
<i>Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.</i>

851
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,342
<i>Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.</i>

852
01:03:55,622 --> 01:03:58,763
<i>The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.</i>

853
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:02,767
<i>But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge</i>

854
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,686
<i>the battery might explode!</i>

855
01:04:05,966 --> 01:04:07,418
<i>Explode!</i>

856
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:08,964
<i>Boom!</i>

857
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,860
<i>When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.</i>

858
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,236
<i>You're not invincible.</i>

859
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:16,442
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

860
01:04:57,851 --> 01:04:59,519
- Hello.
<i>- Pete.</i>

861
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:01,283
<i>It's me.</i>

862
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:03,356
Hey, Harry. What...?

863
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,080
What time is it?

864
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,190
<i>Late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.</i>

865
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,669
<i>I need to see you.</i>

866
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,129
You all right?

867
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,964
<i>Not really, Pete.</i>

868
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,465
<i>I'm dying.</i>

869
01:05:16,745 --> 01:05:19,698
<i>But I think you can help
save my life.</i>

870
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:25,057
<i>You're looking at the world's
first human-spider hybrids.</i>

871
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:28,185
<i>The hope is to extract the
venom from their glands</i>

872
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:30,855
<i>and turn that into a cure.</i>

873
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,691
<i>An agent that heals diseased cells.</i>

874
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:39,071
<i>And if I can be cured, imagine what
this could do for other diseases</i>

875
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:41,645
<i>like Alzheimer's, even cancer.</i>

876
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:48,080
They never made it to human trials.

877
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,190
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

878
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:56,659
Except maybe this.

879
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,287
Spider-Man.

880
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:08,539
What about him?

881
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,210
He was bitten by one of
those things, and it worked.

882
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:16,464
I don't know how
and I don't know why,

883
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:20,112
but he can do everything
else a spider can,

884
01:06:20,392 --> 01:06:22,615
including self-heal.

885
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,688
I need to find him.

886
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,065
I need his blood.

887
01:06:42,372 --> 01:06:43,949
You need...

888
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:47,210
Spider-Man's blood?

889
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,837
It'll save my life.

890
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,177
It may not, Har.

891
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,524
It may not be that simple.

892
01:06:57,804 --> 01:06:59,564
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

893
01:06:59,806 --> 01:07:01,007
Connors was weak.

894
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,280
This is me, Peter.

895
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,854
I don't think you can
just set up a van

896
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:07,785
and have him donate.

897
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:13,249
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive
about people shoving needles and...

898
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,855
He's sensitive, okay.

899
01:07:15,155 --> 01:07:19,880
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is,

900
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,658
and I will go ask him myself.

901
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,156
What?

902
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,168
- You took his picture.
- So?

903
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:31,183
- You know him.
- Harry.

904
01:07:31,463 --> 01:07:34,728
I took a picture from a long
way away. I used a long lens.

905
01:07:35,008 --> 01:07:36,425
I don't know him.

906
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,223
I put together what
you said at the river.

907
01:07:42,307 --> 01:07:45,511
- What I...
- About how he gives people hope.

908
01:07:47,437 --> 01:07:48,934
Come on.

909
01:08:02,494 --> 01:08:03,741
What in the...?

910
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,247
Just say yes.

911
01:08:16,758 --> 01:08:19,086
Don't turn your back on me!

912
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:22,885
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

913
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,013
Please.

914
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,991
Peter, please.

915
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,848
I can't.

916
01:08:34,651 --> 01:08:35,898
Please.

917
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:42,405
I'm gonna try

918
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:44,911
and find Spider-Man.

919
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:56,477
Hey, what's security
doing over here?

920
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:57,728
That's so weird.

921
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,084
She's right over there.

922
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,976
Hey! Miss Stacy!

923
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:25,005
Hi.

924
01:09:25,285 --> 01:09:26,590
Hi.

925
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,367
What are you doing here?

926
01:09:28,705 --> 01:09:30,532
What are you doing here?

927
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,497
Come here.

928
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,897
She's not here.
Check another floor.

929
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:43,690
- Got it.
- Yes, sir!

930
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:44,983
You're in trouble.

931
01:09:45,263 --> 01:09:46,402
- Yeah.
- Who's that guy?

932
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,443
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

933
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,908
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

934
01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:56,328
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

935
01:09:56,608 --> 01:09:59,540
And he loved Spider-Man, by
the way. He was, like, a fanatic.

936
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,419
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a
"want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

937
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,947
That's actually kind of
what it's like to love you.

938
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,008
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

939
01:10:10,288 --> 01:10:11,648
- My God.
- He's completely erased.

940
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,007
That's Oscorp.

941
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,339
And what about you?
Why are you here?

942
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:16,390
Harry.

943
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,338
- Osborn?
- He's dying.

944
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,994
- What do you mean?
- He's dying.

945
01:10:20,173 --> 01:10:22,688
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life

946
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,482
is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

947
01:10:25,762 --> 01:10:28,193
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

948
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:30,471
Or something worse.

949
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:32,030
I know.

950
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,979
This is the maintenance
closet, Gwen.

951
01:10:35,313 --> 01:10:38,162
This is the most clichéd
hiding place you could've chosen.

952
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,402
- This is the stupidest hiding place.
- I'm sorry,

953
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:44,585
I didn't take us to the
Bahamas of hiding places.

954
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:48,820
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't...

955
01:10:58,336 --> 01:11:01,631
- You just kissed me.
- I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

956
01:11:02,382 --> 01:11:03,674
How'd you like it?

957
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:05,272
It felt a little bit rushed.

958
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,880
I know. I know, I know.

959
01:11:08,263 --> 01:11:11,653
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

960
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:12,858
Okay.

961
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:29,463
- God! Damn it!
- I'm so...

962
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,925
I just spilled a hot latte all over your...
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

963
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:35,010
And you too? I'm sorry.

964
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,762
- Miss! Stay right there!
- Sir.

965
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,264
- Just stay right...
- Wait, wait, wait.

966
01:11:39,544 --> 01:11:40,745
Hey! Stop!

967
01:11:43,006 --> 01:11:43,977
All right. On your way.

968
01:11:44,257 --> 01:11:46,710
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

969
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:53,676
- Gwen Stacy.
- Oh, my God.

970
01:11:54,434 --> 01:11:55,697
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

971
01:11:55,977 --> 01:11:57,520
No, it's okay.

972
01:11:58,146 --> 01:12:00,690
I'm... I'm Harry.

973
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,392
Yeah.

974
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:06,542
- I'm an old friend of Peter's.
- Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

975
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,418
I was kind of rushing.

976
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:11,088
No, I'm sorry he
never introduced us.

977
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,662
I thought you two had broken up.

978
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,637
Yeah. Yes, we had.

979
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,430
And it's...

980
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:22,558
- It's complicated.
- Complicated. Yeah.

981
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,019
I mean, it's Peter. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

982
01:12:26,299 --> 01:12:27,500
Yeah.

983
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,295
Yeah.

984
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,471
Yeah, you're right.

985
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,606
But that's why he needs you.

986
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,639
Right?

987
01:12:38,603 --> 01:12:41,306
To help him make his choices clear.

988
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:45,914
Nice to meet you, Harry.

989
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:49,398
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

990
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:48,340
You've been in a terrible accident.

991
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:51,592
I'm Dr. Kafka.

992
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:54,066
I'm here to help you.

993
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,139
Course you are, doc.

994
01:13:56,973 --> 01:14:01,269
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

995
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,847
High-intensity capacitors.

996
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,308
The kind they make at Oscorp.

997
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:09,247
All of this because you're
trying to help me.

998
01:14:09,527 --> 01:14:10,791
You are correct.

999
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,001
I'm here to study you.

1000
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:17,923
To understand what you are,
why you are.

1001
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,280
<i>Und</i> I will get results.

1002
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,719
I always do.

1003
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:31,674
You do realize

1004
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,090
you locked me in a prison

1005
01:14:34,427 --> 01:14:35,924
that runs

1006
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,938
on electricity?

1007
01:14:40,141 --> 01:14:42,948
I can feel it in the walls.

1008
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,305
I can feel it in my veins.

1009
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,855
No matter what you do,
doc, you can't contain it.

1010
01:14:50,151 --> 01:14:51,443
It's a force of nature.

1011
01:14:52,904 --> 01:14:54,105
Like me.

1012
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,047
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1013
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:05,345
Well, so do I.

1014
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:13,375
I'm dying to know,

1015
01:15:13,883 --> 01:15:15,209
doc.

1016
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,734
But you better make damn
sure you kill me this time.

1017
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,716
Because if you don't,

1018
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,280
I'm gonna kill the light.

1019
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,106
<i>So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.</i>

1020
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:30,579
<i>A world without power.</i>

1021
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:33,373
A world without mercy.

1022
01:15:33,653 --> 01:15:35,000
A world

1023
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,107
without Spider-Man.

1024
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:41,908
And everyone will be able to
see me for who I truly am.

1025
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,572
And who are you?

1026
01:15:44,914 --> 01:15:46,582
Don't you know?

1027
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,459
I'm Electro.

1028
01:15:53,631 --> 01:15:56,772
<i>Warning: Electrical
restraint capacity reached.</i>

1029
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,775
<i>Initiate lockdown procedure
immediately.</i>

1030
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,882
Very impressive,

1031
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,513
Electro.

1032
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,137
<i>Lockdown initiated.</i>

1033
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:21,366
Aunt May?

1034
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,094
What are you doing?

1035
01:16:28,374 --> 01:16:29,996
When did you do this?

1036
01:16:39,302 --> 01:16:41,900
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1037
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,384
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1038
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:48,729
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1039
01:16:48,978 --> 01:16:50,858
- I don't lie.
- I know you love me, but you do.

1040
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:52,641
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1041
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:55,439
You have to tell me, May.

1042
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:57,415
That's my father.

1043
01:16:57,695 --> 01:16:59,084
Yes, he was your father.

1044
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:02,192
But that didn't seem to
stop him from leaving you...

1045
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,072
here.

1046
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,205
I need the truth.

1047
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:11,763
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1048
01:17:12,043 --> 01:17:13,765
You were this little boy
whose whole world

1049
01:17:14,045 --> 01:17:16,726
was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1050
01:17:17,006 --> 01:17:21,962
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1051
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,569
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1052
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:27,153
Your father?

1053
01:17:27,433 --> 01:17:28,488
No.

1054
01:17:28,768 --> 01:17:32,868
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth,

1055
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,912
and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1056
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:40,750
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet,

1057
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,627
who has to take nursing classes

1058
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:45,755
with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1059
01:17:46,035 --> 01:17:48,091
And I don't know how
to do this without Ben.

1060
01:17:48,371 --> 01:17:49,697
I don't know how. And...

1061
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,430
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father,

1062
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,584
who was never here. No.

1063
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,102
No, I won't tell you.

1064
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:00,437
You're my boy.

1065
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:03,023
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

1066
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:04,595
And I won't hurt you.

1067
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,911
I'm your boy.

1068
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,938
You're my everything.

1069
01:18:19,068 --> 01:18:22,417
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1070
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:25,320
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1071
01:18:26,242 --> 01:18:29,195
- I love you so much.
- I know.

1072
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,418
It's okay.

1073
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:37,878
It's okay.

1074
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:42,004
May.

1075
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:47,301
I need to know.

1076
01:18:51,726 --> 01:18:53,143
All right.

1077
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:58,607
I'll tell you everything I know.

1078
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:03,070
But it will hurt you.

1079
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:05,273
Okay.

1080
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:10,173
A few days after the funeral,

1081
01:19:10,453 --> 01:19:14,408
two government men came to see us.

1082
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:19,140
<i>They said the genetics research</i>

1083
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:22,852
<i>that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable,</i>

1084
01:19:23,132 --> 01:19:25,730
<i>and that people
would pay a lot for it.</i>

1085
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:27,983
<i>And that's why he ran off with it.</i>

1086
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,943
<i>They said he was a traitor.</i>

1087
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:32,028
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1088
01:19:32,308 --> 01:19:35,240
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us,

1089
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,063
for the money.

1090
01:19:38,147 --> 01:19:39,439
I don't...

1091
01:19:41,776 --> 01:19:44,096
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.

1092
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,919
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1093
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:49,421
It doesn't make any sense.

1094
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:51,047
Peter, I don't know.

1095
01:19:51,327 --> 01:19:54,342
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1096
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:56,845
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1097
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,597
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1098
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:02,934
He wore the same ratty
lab coat for 20 years.

1099
01:20:03,214 --> 01:20:05,854
He took the D train to
work at 7 every morning.

1100
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,507
Came home at 6 every night.

1101
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,089
I don't know.

1102
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:14,885
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1103
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,430
Even from the people they love.

1104
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:25,819
Peter.

1105
01:20:28,906 --> 01:20:30,358
Peter.

1106
01:20:34,203 --> 01:20:35,905
Mr. Osborn.

1107
01:20:40,668 --> 01:20:42,085
Look up.

1108
01:20:43,087 --> 01:20:44,834
Think you're looking for me.

1109
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:49,756
I cannot believe my eyes.

1110
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,801
Spider-Man.

1111
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:02,098
Just the man I wanted to see.

1112
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:06,235
You,

1113
01:21:07,528 --> 01:21:09,150
talked to Peter?

1114
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:11,111
Yeah.

1115
01:21:16,287 --> 01:21:20,412
I wanna help you, Mr.
Osborn. I really, really do.

1116
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:24,891
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1117
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:26,497
Excuse me?

1118
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:29,208
It's too dangerous.

1119
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:32,462
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1120
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:35,719
I'm already dying.

1121
01:21:36,849 --> 01:21:39,239
Your blood can't make me die more.

1122
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,320
But it could do something worse.

1123
01:21:44,023 --> 01:21:45,395
Okay.

1124
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:48,540
All right, how much?

1125
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,084
- How much what?
- How much do you want? Name it.

1126
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:55,296
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

1127
01:21:55,576 --> 01:21:59,030
- I don't want your money.
- Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1128
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:00,865
I don't.

1129
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:04,581
I thought you...

1130
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:07,755
I thought you were
supposed to save people.

1131
01:22:08,589 --> 01:22:12,230
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1132
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,774
You're... You're just gonna
let me die.

1133
01:22:15,054 --> 01:22:18,236
- I'm trying to protect you right now.
- No. No, you are not.

1134
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:21,139
You're trying to protect yourself.

1135
01:22:21,477 --> 01:22:25,702
Look, we just need a bit more time

1136
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:28,062
- to figure out something else.
- I do not have time!

1137
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:36,783
I'm sorry.

1138
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:49,289
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

1139
01:23:02,685 --> 01:23:04,407
- Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

1140
01:23:04,687 --> 01:23:07,577
- Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
- I'm running late right now.

1141
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:10,413
- It's just gonna take a second.
- I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1142
01:23:10,693 --> 01:23:13,958
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1143
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:16,169
Everything's a mess. Everything's insane.

1144
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,630
My dad, my mom. Everything
I thought about them? Lies.

1145
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,799
Lies. Lies, lies, lies. Nothing
makes any sense anymore.

1146
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:23,959
I gotta figure out what
I'm gonna do with Harry.

1147
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,605
Of course I wanna
save him. You know?

1148
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,515
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1149
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:30,558
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1150
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:32,347
I don't know. I got no idea.

1151
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:36,814
- Oh, God.
- I got nothing. I got nothing.

1152
01:23:37,094 --> 01:23:39,855
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is...

1153
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:42,846
Ms. Stacy?

1154
01:23:43,267 --> 01:23:44,405
Shall I take you upstairs?

1155
01:23:44,685 --> 01:23:47,033
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1156
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:51,454
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1157
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:53,732
- Okay.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1158
01:23:54,987 --> 01:23:56,918
- I'm... Okay. I have to be...
- Where are we?

1159
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,775
I'm at my...

1160
01:23:59,325 --> 01:24:02,199
last interview for
Oxford right now.

1161
01:24:03,454 --> 01:24:05,301
- Oxford. I didn't know.
- Yeah.

1162
01:24:05,581 --> 01:24:07,762
Okay, well...

1163
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:10,515
I'm sorry to bother you,

1164
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,350
my fair lady... Madam.

1165
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,352
But who am I?

1166
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,145
I mean, who am I?
I'm John Hopkins.

1167
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:18,439
I'm one of the young
professors at Harvard,

1168
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,889
and I've been trying to
get her to be in my...

1169
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,612
Be a part of my team
for a while now.

1170
01:24:24,892 --> 01:24:27,782
And she's just the best person
I know and a scientific genius.

1171
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:29,033
And...

1172
01:24:29,313 --> 01:24:30,702
Anyway, God save the queen.

1173
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:32,945
- I'm sorry everything's happening...
- Can you wait?

1174
01:24:33,025 --> 01:24:34,497
Peter. Peter.

1175
01:24:34,777 --> 01:24:36,570
What do you want to say to me?

1176
01:24:37,196 --> 01:24:38,864
What's the "one thing"?

1177
01:24:42,743 --> 01:24:44,786
I have to go to England, Peter.

1178
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,158
It's important to me.

1179
01:24:52,336 --> 01:24:56,166
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

1180
01:24:56,632 --> 01:24:58,688
You know? I don't know.

1181
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:00,511
Maybe we're just

1182
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,317
going different ways. I don't...

1183
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,891
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1184
01:25:08,102 --> 01:25:09,019
Gwen.

1185
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:13,311
Good luck.

1186
01:25:16,652 --> 01:25:18,954
Hi. Sorry.

"Roosevelt's secret station."

1190

1191

under Pershing Square

1192
01:26:40,861 --> 01:26:44,460
built to transport President Franklin
Roosevelt away from the public eye,

1193
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:48,365
"to keep his polio hidden
from the American people."

1194
01:26:58,337 --> 01:26:59,834
Mr. Osborn?

1195
01:27:01,465 --> 01:27:02,478
You all right?

1196
01:27:02,758 --> 01:27:05,231
Is there anything I can get you?

1197
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:08,715
No, not unless you can bring
those spiders back to life.

1198
01:27:09,181 --> 01:27:10,194
Spiders?

1199
01:27:10,474 --> 01:27:12,642
The ones that they destroyed...

1200
01:27:13,602 --> 01:27:16,976
"to restore investor confidence."

1201
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:19,954
Go home, Felicia.

1202
01:27:20,234 --> 01:27:21,731
Take the day off.

1203
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:25,113
Harry.

1204
01:27:27,032 --> 01:27:31,032
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1205
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:37,668
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1206
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:40,542
Before they destroyed the spiders,

1207
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:43,124
they had the venom extracted.

1208
01:27:43,924 --> 01:27:46,923
What?

1209
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:50,401
What are you saying?

1210
01:27:50,681 --> 01:27:52,487
That way, they could
comply with the lawsuits,

1211
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,811
but still keep the data in
case it ever became useful.

1212
01:27:56,979 --> 01:27:58,075
Where is it?

1213
01:27:58,355 --> 01:28:00,353
It's somewhere in the building.

1214
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:05,287
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

What did you do?

1233
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,179
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1234
01:29:00,459 --> 01:29:04,475
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1235
01:29:04,755 --> 01:29:09,105
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

1236
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:13,150
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1237
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:15,319
You are experimenting
on people in there.

1238
01:29:15,599 --> 01:29:17,738
Progress has its stepping stones.

1239
01:29:18,018 --> 01:29:20,783
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been...

1240
01:29:21,063 --> 01:29:22,618
How do I put this gently?

1241
01:29:22,898 --> 01:29:24,078
Fired.

1242
01:29:24,358 --> 01:29:27,248
You are not going to bury me too.

1243
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:30,402
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1244
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:32,817
It's only a matter of time.

1245
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,590
You're going to die
a horrible death.

1246
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,743
Like your father.

1247
01:29:38,205 --> 01:29:39,927
The difference is,

1248
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:42,284
no one is going to miss you.

1249
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:46,100
Get him out.

1250
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,581
Wait. Wait.

1251
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,595
I know my way out.

1252
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:08,669
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1253
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:11,063
Tell you why, you should put
the lid on that but quick.

1254
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:12,627
I tried. Good luck.

1255
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:15,906
You should tell her to come down here

<i>And now, to eliminate
me from the picture,</i>

1267
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:14,475
<i>Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me</i>

1268
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:18,459
<i>in order to take
control of my work.</i>

1269
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:23,108
Can I help you?

1270
01:33:23,388 --> 01:33:25,528
Yeah, you can open the gate.

1271
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:27,071
I'm Harry Osborn.

1272
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:31,325
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1273
01:33:31,605 --> 01:33:34,453
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1274
01:33:34,733 --> 01:33:37,527
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1275
01:33:41,031 --> 01:33:43,654
<i>But it doesn't matter because
there's something else...</i>

1276
01:33:44,493 --> 01:33:46,491
<i>that Norman doesn't know.</i>

1277
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:49,706
<i>The human DNA</i>

1278
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:52,831
<i>that I implanted in the spiders...</i>

1279
01:33:54,503 --> 01:33:55,829
<i>was my own.</i>

1280
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,396
<i>Which means that without me,</i>

1281
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:02,549
<i>without my bloodline,</i>

1282
01:34:03,011 --> 01:34:07,361
<i>Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.</i>

1283
01:34:07,641 --> 01:34:09,989
Keep Electro incubated

1284
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:14,645
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental <i>und</i> phenobarbital.

1285
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:19,118
<i>I have destroyed as much as
possible from the archives.</i>

1286
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:22,614
<i>But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.</i>

1287
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:26,046
<i>So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.</i>

1288
01:34:26,326 --> 01:34:30,092
<i>I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.</i>

1289
01:34:30,372 --> 01:34:32,261
<i>But as a father,</i>

1290
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,639
<i>it means I may not
see my boy again.</i>

1291
01:34:35,919 --> 01:34:40,215
<i>And nothing is as important to me</i>

1292
01:34:40,757 --> 01:34:42,855
<i>as my son, Peter.</i>

1293
01:34:43,135 --> 01:34:45,087
<i>Nothing in this world.</i>

1294
01:34:45,512 --> 01:34:47,443
<i>But I have a responsibility</i>

1295
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:49,737
<i>to protect the world
from what I've created,</i>

1296
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:53,187
<i>and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.</i>

1297
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:56,432
<i>People will say I am a monster</i>

1298
01:34:57,232 --> 01:34:59,025
<i>for what I've done.</i>

1299
01:35:00,527 --> 01:35:02,229
<i>And maybe they're right.</i>

1300
01:35:04,781 --> 01:35:06,879
<i>I always thought that I'd have more</i>

1301
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:08,213
<i>time.</i>

1302
01:35:08,493 --> 01:35:10,341
<i>Dad? Dad!</i>

1303
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:12,118
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1304
01:35:30,849 --> 01:35:32,642
<i>Sedation off.</i>

1305
01:35:33,977 --> 01:35:35,224
<i>Psst.</i>

1306
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:41,497
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1307
01:35:41,777 --> 01:35:43,979
All right? But we
don't have much time.

1308
01:35:44,696 --> 01:35:45,668
Who are you?

1309
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:49,277
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1310
01:35:50,869 --> 01:35:52,091
I should kill you.

1311
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:54,289
Oh, come on.

1312
01:35:54,581 --> 01:35:56,470
Think bigger, Max.

1313
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:58,722
I'm not the one you want.

1314
01:35:59,002 --> 01:36:00,344
You want Spider-Man.

1315
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:03,602
And I can give him to you.

1316
01:36:03,882 --> 01:36:08,758
But I need something first.

1317
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:12,319
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1318
01:36:12,599 --> 01:36:14,196
Get you in?

1319
01:36:14,476 --> 01:36:15,531
You own it.

1320
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:18,158
Not anymore.

1321
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:19,660
Oscorp betrayed us both,

1322
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,986
so I can't get in there without you and
you can't get out of here without me.

1323
01:36:24,736 --> 01:36:25,416
What's happening?

1324
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:27,292
Someone pulled an
alarm in the lso Unit.

1325
01:36:27,572 --> 01:36:30,321
Get a containment
team up there now.

1326
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:32,464
You couldn't possibly
know what I want.

1327
01:36:32,744 --> 01:36:34,425
You submitted the
design for the grid,

1328
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:36,552
and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1329
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:38,595
You just wanna take
back what's yours.

1330
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:41,557
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max,

1331
01:36:41,837 --> 01:36:43,726
and it's right at your fingertips.

1332
01:36:44,006 --> 01:36:45,769
And then once you
shut down the grid,

1333
01:36:46,049 --> 01:36:50,019
Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1334
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:53,177
Break it! Break it!

1335
01:36:56,059 --> 01:36:57,614
Max, we don't have much time!

1336
01:36:57,894 --> 01:37:00,200
Go! Go, go! Go!

1337
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,494
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1338
01:37:02,774 --> 01:37:04,021
Because I need you!

1339
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:06,707
You need me?

1340
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:09,960
Yes. I need you.

1341
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:14,256
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1342
01:37:14,536 --> 01:37:15,424
You need me?

1343
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:17,827
Yes. I need you.

1344
01:37:18,707 --> 01:37:20,079
I need you. Please! Please!

1345
01:37:21,752 --> 01:37:22,848
Please!

1346
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:24,975
I know what it's like
to be thrown away!

1347
01:37:25,255 --> 01:37:26,226
Please, Max!

1348
01:37:26,506 --> 01:37:28,629
I need you! I need you!

1349
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:20,051
No!

1350
01:38:23,897 --> 01:38:25,724
You wanna be my friend?

1351
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:28,409
I thought we were already friends.

1352
01:38:29,986 --> 01:38:31,608
I had a friend once.

1353
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:34,441
It didn't work out.

1354
01:38:35,158 --> 01:38:36,655
Yeah. Me too.

1355
01:38:37,953 --> 01:38:40,247
Then let's go catch a spider.

1356
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:46,161
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

1357
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:50,253
<i>Hi, Peter, it's me.</i>

1358
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:54,565
<i>I got in to Oxford.</i>

1359
01:38:54,845 --> 01:38:59,266
<i>It's very exciting.</i>

1360
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:03,103
<i>I came by your house
a little bit ago and I,</i>

1361
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,533
<i>You weren't there,</i>

1362
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:08,162
<i>and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now,</i>

1363
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:11,081
<i>because there's this early
summer class that I found out about,</i>

1364
01:39:11,361 --> 01:39:14,543
<i>and I thought that
it would somehow</i>

1365
01:39:14,823 --> 01:39:19,028
<i>be easier, I guess, this way.</i>

1366
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:22,801
<i>I think that maybe it's time</i>

1367
01:39:23,081 --> 01:39:25,454
<i>to let this go.</i>

1368
01:39:25,917 --> 01:39:28,182
<i>And that's not because
I don't love you.</i>

1369
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:31,962
<i>It's actually because I do, so,</i>

1370
01:39:32,382 --> 01:39:33,959
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1371
01:39:48,273 --> 01:39:50,896
- We have to move, now.
- Why? What's happened?

1372
01:40:03,622 --> 01:40:05,449
Remember me?

1373
01:40:09,628 --> 01:40:10,933
Oh, my, Oh, my.

1374
01:40:11,213 --> 01:40:13,381
How the tables have turned.

1375
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:16,104
I know it's hard to admit,

1376
01:40:16,384 --> 01:40:20,930
but how spectacular a move is this?

1377
01:40:21,973 --> 01:40:24,767
- Am I right?
- Right as rain.

1378
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:28,784
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother,

1379
01:40:29,064 --> 01:40:31,828
it is time to grant me a wish.

1380
01:40:32,108 --> 01:40:36,529
- I want in to Special...
- How dare you come back in here?

1381
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:40,963
You recalcitrant,
unworthy, defective,

1382
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:43,411
urchin freaks.

1383
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:51,166
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1384
01:41:04,599 --> 01:41:05,846
Clear.

1385
01:41:07,477 --> 01:41:10,226
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1386
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:15,144
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1387
01:41:19,281 --> 01:41:22,124
The grid is all yours.

1388
01:41:54,357 --> 01:41:57,026
The spider venom.
Give it to me.

1389
01:42:02,824 --> 01:42:04,212
What is all this stuff?

1390
01:42:04,492 --> 01:42:06,194
The future.

1391
01:42:19,758 --> 01:42:21,175
Load one up.

1392
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:26,777
It won't work.

1393
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:30,697
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1394
01:42:30,977 --> 01:42:35,148
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

1395
01:42:38,985 --> 01:42:41,233
Do it. Now.

1396
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,558
You had it all this time.

1397
01:44:32,348 --> 01:44:33,774
It's Spider-Man.

1398
01:44:39,689 --> 01:44:40,827
Stop the cab.

1399
01:44:41,107 --> 01:44:43,355
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1400
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:15,512
- Hi.
- Hi.

1401
01:45:16,017 --> 01:45:17,739
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

1402
01:45:18,019 --> 01:45:20,659
- The message right there.
- Oh, that. That was you?

1403
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:22,702
- Don't do that.
- I couldn't make it out.

1404
01:45:22,982 --> 01:45:25,310
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

1405
01:45:26,778 --> 01:45:28,696
Because I love you.

1406
01:45:29,531 --> 01:45:31,920
- And no offense, but you're wrong.
- I'm wrong about what?

1407
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,040
You're wrong about us
being on different paths.

1408
01:45:34,285 --> 01:45:36,829
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1409
01:45:37,705 --> 01:45:40,078
And you're always gonna be my path.

1410
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:44,432
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1411
01:45:44,712 --> 01:45:46,585
But I'm tired of them.

1412
01:45:49,008 --> 01:45:51,506
I'm tired of every
single one of them.

1413
01:45:51,803 --> 01:45:53,926
We've all gotta make a choice.

1414
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,308
Right? Well, I choose you.

1415
01:45:59,727 --> 01:46:00,949
So

1416
01:46:01,229 --> 01:46:02,976
here's my thought.

1417
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:05,942
England.

1418
01:46:07,068 --> 01:46:08,611
Both of us.

1419
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:12,073
I'm following you now.

1420
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:14,450
I'm just gonna follow
you everywhere.

1421
01:46:14,826 --> 01:46:16,994
I'm just gonna follow
you the rest of my life.

1422
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:21,136
I mean, they got crime
there in England.

1423
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:23,096
- Yeah.
- They got tons of crime, it seems.

1424
01:46:23,334 --> 01:46:25,457
- Tons.
- They got,

1425
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,018
Jack the Ripper.

1426
01:46:28,298 --> 01:46:29,269
What?

1427
01:46:29,549 --> 01:46:32,101
They haven't caught Jack the
Ripper yet. You didn't know that?

1428
01:46:52,155 --> 01:46:53,527
What the hell is that?

1429
01:47:03,958 --> 01:47:05,705
Is that Max?

1430
01:47:06,085 --> 01:47:08,538
He must have cut the
power to the whole city.

1431
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:18,735
PNA 322, you are...

1432
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:21,029
- I'm black.
- I have nothing.

1433
01:47:21,309 --> 01:47:23,615
Hey, I need Tech Ops
up here right now.

1434
01:47:23,895 --> 01:47:26,493
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1435
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:28,536
Hey, write down what
you remember, people.

1436
01:47:28,816 --> 01:47:32,540
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1437
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:35,627
There's an emergency
reset at the power plant.

1438
01:47:35,907 --> 01:47:38,747
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1439
01:47:38,993 --> 01:47:41,754
How will I stop him? Every time I get
close, he fries my web shooters.

1440
01:47:41,913 --> 01:47:43,953
- Have you tried grounding them?
- Tried everything.

1441
01:47:44,123 --> 01:47:46,163
- Rubber, plastic...
- Did you try magnetizing them?

1442
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:48,848
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1443
01:47:49,128 --> 01:47:51,501
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1444
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:54,729
If you magnetize a nail
with a battery...

1445
01:47:55,009 --> 01:47:57,086
- It holds an electric charge.
- Yes.

1446
01:47:59,263 --> 01:48:02,445
New York Approach. This is
Pan National 273 on approach.

1447
01:48:02,725 --> 01:48:04,222
How do you hear?

1448
01:48:05,019 --> 01:48:06,324
Approach, do you copy?

1449
01:48:06,604 --> 01:48:08,772
Radio's working. It's not us.

1450
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:20,130
Do not panic. Everyone, please
return to your vehicles.

1451
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:22,465
Go back to your cars.

1452
01:48:22,745 --> 01:48:24,162
Remain calm.

1453
01:48:25,415 --> 01:48:27,971
Do not panic. Everyone
return to your vehicles.

1454
01:48:28,251 --> 01:48:29,848
- Go into your homes.
- Officer!

1455
01:48:30,128 --> 01:48:31,224
Spider-Man!-

1456
01:48:31,504 --> 01:48:33,727
My father was Captain George
Stacy of the 19th Precinct.

1457
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:36,730
- I knew who he was. What can we do?
- Jumper cables.

1458
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:39,107
- Jumper cables?
- Yes. And copper wire.

1459
01:48:39,387 --> 01:48:42,010
Am I talking louder than I
usually talk right now?!

1460
01:48:42,557 --> 01:48:44,112
- Yes.
- Ho.

1461
01:48:44,392 --> 01:48:46,712
- Your suit'll ground you.
- All right, do it.

1462
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:52,662
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1463
01:48:52,942 --> 01:48:53,913
Okay, it works, good.

1464
01:48:54,193 --> 01:48:55,873
That is why you were
number two at Midtown.

1465
01:48:56,112 --> 01:48:57,108
Rub it in. Okay.

1466
01:48:59,365 --> 01:49:00,920
- I gotta go.
- I'm coming with you.

1467
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:03,006
- You're not coming with me.
- Yes, I am.

1468
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:04,646
- It's too dangerous.
- I'm coming.

1469
01:49:04,787 --> 01:49:07,177
I've seen the grid specs and I
know how to reset the system.

1470
01:49:07,457 --> 01:49:11,389
- I'm coming with you! You need me!
- Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1471
01:49:11,669 --> 01:49:13,016
Shut the thing.

1472
01:49:13,296 --> 01:49:15,180
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

1473
01:49:16,841 --> 01:49:18,146
Peter!

1474
01:49:18,426 --> 01:49:20,231
We still don't have
backup generators.

1475
01:49:20,511 --> 01:49:21,983
Get me Engineering!

1476
01:49:22,263 --> 01:49:23,463
I need a respirator right now.

1477
01:49:23,681 --> 01:49:25,487
They're battery-operated.
I'll get it.

1478
01:49:25,767 --> 01:49:27,139
Hang on.

1479
01:49:27,685 --> 01:49:28,932
Okay.

1480
01:49:51,542 --> 01:49:53,807
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

1481
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:57,541
<i>It's time to meet our destiny.</i>

1482
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,920
Tower, we're experiencing some
kind of electrical disturbance.

1483
01:50:15,149 --> 01:50:17,831
Instruments are going
haywire. Radar is down.

1484
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:20,530
We're flying blind out
here. Do you copy?

1485
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:27,340
Tower, repeat: We are standby
only. What is happening?

1486
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:30,844
Sir? There are two inbound
flights on intersecting paths.

1487
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:32,844
- Time to impact?
- Four and a half minutes.

1488
01:50:33,084 --> 01:50:34,410
Clock it right now.

1489
01:50:48,182 --> 01:50:50,405
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1490
01:50:50,685 --> 01:50:52,323
I designed this power grid.

1491
01:50:52,603 --> 01:50:54,158
Now I'm gonna take back

1492
01:50:54,438 --> 01:50:56,244
what is rightfully mine.

1493
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,663
I will control everything.

1494
01:50:58,943 --> 01:51:02,542
And I will be like a god to them.

1495
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:04,319
A god named Sparkles?

1496
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:15,847
Not this time.

1497
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:18,045
Is that all you got?
Come on!

1498
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:39,062
Come on!

1499
01:51:43,112 --> 01:51:44,329
You ready to give up?

1500
01:51:54,957 --> 01:51:57,660
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1501
01:52:08,179 --> 01:52:09,776
Just shake it off.
It's just your bones,

1502
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:13,135
and your muscles
and your organs. Hunh!

1503
01:52:15,853 --> 01:52:17,521
Oh, boy.

1504
01:52:24,695 --> 01:52:25,896
I hate this song!

1505
01:52:46,676 --> 01:52:47,814
Spider-Man,

1506
01:52:48,094 --> 01:52:49,637
bet you never saw this coming.

1507
01:52:57,103 --> 01:52:58,950
Really? You web me to a car?

1508
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:00,493
What are you, a caveman?

1509
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:01,953
You shouldn't be here.

1510
01:53:02,233 --> 01:53:04,789
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1511
01:53:05,069 --> 01:53:07,166
- What are you doing here?!
- I know the grid specs.

1512
01:53:07,446 --> 01:53:08,710
I can reset the system!

1513
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:11,170
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1514
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:13,170
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1515
01:53:13,411 --> 01:53:16,342
Nobody makes my decisions
for me. All right? Nobody.

1516
01:53:16,622 --> 01:53:18,870
This is my choice, okay?

1517
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:21,806
My choice. This is mine.-

1518
01:53:22,086 --> 01:53:24,225
- Now, how do we stop him?
- Okay, so he's electric,

1519
01:53:24,505 --> 01:53:25,935
he's like a battery.

1520
01:53:26,215 --> 01:53:27,854
What happens if you
overcharge a battery?

1521
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:29,105
- It explodes.
- Right.

1522
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:30,985
So we use his power
against him. Perfect.

1523
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:33,180
- Okay.
- I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1524
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:34,777
But I need you to reset the system.

1525
01:53:35,057 --> 01:53:37,864
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1526
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:40,487
- No matter what. No matter what.
- Peter.

1527
01:53:45,484 --> 01:53:47,027
Go, go!

1528
01:54:38,871 --> 01:54:41,119
Sixty seconds to impact.

1529
01:55:15,533 --> 01:55:16,504
Now, Gwen, now!

1530
01:55:16,784 --> 01:55:18,110
Do it now!

1531
01:55:43,519 --> 01:55:44,891
Uni 687...

1532
01:55:55,823 --> 01:55:58,822
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1533
01:55:59,326 --> 01:56:02,300
You have incoming traffic.
I repeat: 280.

1534
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:04,077
<i>Defend immediately.</i>

1535
01:56:19,388 --> 01:56:20,589
Yes!

1536
01:56:21,015 --> 01:56:23,255
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1537
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:25,053
I'll be back in a minute.

1538
01:56:25,394 --> 01:56:27,617
Oh, thank God. All right!

1539
01:56:27,897 --> 01:56:29,948
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1540
01:57:05,935 --> 01:57:07,777
I think we can still
make your flight.

1541
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:17,896
Gwen, stay there.

1542
01:57:43,764 --> 01:57:45,386
Peter.

1543
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:49,474
When you said Spider-Man said no,

1544
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:53,786
you meant you said no.

1545
01:57:54,066 --> 01:57:56,455
Harry, what did you do?

1546
01:57:56,735 --> 01:57:58,937
What you made me do.

1547
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:00,751
You were my friend

1548
01:58:01,031 --> 01:58:03,587
and you betrayed me!

1549
01:58:03,867 --> 01:58:05,172
No.

1550
01:58:05,452 --> 01:58:07,575
I was trying to protect you.-

1551
01:58:08,122 --> 01:58:09,343
Look at me.

1552
01:58:09,623 --> 01:58:11,846
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1553
01:58:12,126 --> 01:58:13,578
You don't give people hope.

1554
01:58:14,086 --> 01:58:15,599
You take it away.

1555
01:58:15,879 --> 01:58:17,126
No, Harry.

1556
01:58:17,506 --> 01:58:19,437
I'm gonna take away yours.

1557
01:58:19,717 --> 01:58:21,230
No. Gwen, run!

1558
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:22,882
Harry!

1559
01:58:23,304 --> 01:58:24,646
Harry, put her down!

1560
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:43,336
Harry, stop this right now!

1561
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:46,535
This isn't you, Harry. This is
not you. Harry, put her down.

1562
01:58:46,910 --> 01:58:48,799
- Harry.
- Harry is dead!

1563
01:58:49,079 --> 01:58:52,011
Harry, this is between you
and me. You wanna fight?

1564
01:58:52,291 --> 01:58:54,539
Fight me! Let her go!

1565
01:58:54,877 --> 01:58:56,203
Okay.

1566
01:58:57,212 --> 01:58:58,038
No!

1567
01:59:06,138 --> 01:59:08,591
You okay?

1568
01:59:12,853 --> 01:59:15,181
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1569
02:00:35,227 --> 02:00:36,349
Peter?

1570
02:01:39,875 --> 02:01:42,294
Hey. Hey.

1571
02:01:45,339 --> 02:01:46,586
Gwen?

1572
02:01:49,051 --> 02:01:50,147
Hey.

1573
02:01:50,427 --> 02:01:51,753
Hey!

1574
02:01:56,391 --> 02:01:57,683
Gwen?

1575
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,721
Hey.

1576
02:02:04,066 --> 02:02:05,313
Breathe.

1577
02:02:06,652 --> 02:02:08,775
Hey, Gwen.

1578
02:02:09,571 --> 02:02:10,772
Hey.

1579
02:02:14,326 --> 02:02:15,573
Hey.

1580
02:02:17,788 --> 02:02:19,285
You're okay.

1581
02:02:22,835 --> 02:02:24,127
Gwen?

1582
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:31,313
Stay with me, stay with me.

1583
02:02:31,593 --> 02:02:34,171
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1584
02:02:39,726 --> 02:02:41,018
Gwen.

1585
02:02:43,522 --> 02:02:44,769
Gwen!

1586
02:02:47,568 --> 02:02:50,317
No, please, please.

1587
02:02:52,656 --> 02:02:54,233
Please.

1588
02:03:00,914 --> 02:03:03,367
I can't do this without you.

1589
02:05:05,831 --> 02:05:07,453
Leave us.

1590
02:05:11,545 --> 02:05:13,100
You've made progress.

1591
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:16,562
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1592
02:05:16,842 --> 02:05:18,897
Now that Spider-Man's gone,

1593
02:05:19,177 --> 02:05:22,192
this city will never be the same.

1594
02:05:22,472 --> 02:05:24,987
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1595
02:05:25,267 --> 02:05:26,822
Speaking of progress,

1596
02:05:27,102 --> 02:05:28,349
you're looking better.

1597
02:05:29,104 --> 02:05:31,147
It comes and goes.

1598
02:05:32,649 --> 02:05:34,317
Tell me more.

1599
02:05:34,693 --> 02:05:36,206
How many men did you have in mind?

1600
02:05:36,486 --> 02:05:38,459
I wanna keep it small.

1601
02:05:38,739 --> 02:05:42,166
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1602
02:05:44,077 --> 02:05:45,549
<i>Access granted.</i>

1603
02:05:45,829 --> 02:05:47,760
<i>Welcome, Mr. Fiers.</i>

1604
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,720
<i>Who's our first volunteer?</i>

1605
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,764
<i>Aleksei Sytsevich.</i>

1606
02:05:52,044 --> 02:05:54,183
<i>Currently serving a life sentence.</i>

1607
02:05:54,463 --> 02:05:55,642
<i>He is</i>

1608
02:05:55,922 --> 02:05:58,375
<i>most eager to join us.</i>

1609
02:05:59,009 --> 02:06:00,506
<i>Good.</i>

1610
02:06:00,969 --> 02:06:03,171
<i>Start with him.</i>

1611
02:06:03,472 --> 02:06:04,985
<i>Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich</i>

1612
02:06:05,265 --> 02:06:07,154
<i>was broken out of
a classified penitentiary</i>

1613
02:06:07,434 --> 02:06:10,574
<i>known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.</i>

1614
02:06:10,854 --> 02:06:13,243
<i>It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity</i>

1615
02:06:13,523 --> 02:06:16,663
<i>since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.</i>

1616
02:06:16,943 --> 02:06:20,167
<i>The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.</i>

1617
02:06:20,447 --> 02:06:23,003
<i>Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department</i>

1618
02:06:23,283 --> 02:06:25,255
<i>has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping</i>

1619
02:06:25,535 --> 02:06:27,591
<i>for the return
of the web-slinger.</i>

1620
02:06:27,871 --> 02:06:30,244
<i>The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:</i>

1621
02:06:30,707 --> 02:06:32,133
<i>Where is Spider-Man?</i>

1622
02:06:34,086 --> 02:06:36,709
Too bad about that spider guy.

1623
02:06:38,048 --> 02:06:41,127
Too bad he's disappeared. Seems
like everybody really needs him.

1624
02:06:42,928 --> 02:06:44,425
Where you going?

1625
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:48,237
- Eat my cereal.
- Peter.

1626
02:06:48,517 --> 02:06:50,390
Where you going?

1627
02:07:00,153 --> 02:07:01,400
I don't know.

1628
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:05,363
You know, it's so funny.
I've been...

1629
02:07:05,909 --> 02:07:08,882
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized,

1630
02:07:09,162 --> 02:07:13,583
and been putting some
of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1631
02:07:14,167 --> 02:07:18,088
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1632
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:20,644
- You're throwing his stuff away?
- No.

1633
02:07:20,924 --> 02:07:22,229
No. God, no.

1634
02:07:22,509 --> 02:07:25,838
I couldn't do that.
It's part of me.

1635
02:07:26,513 --> 02:07:29,683
I'm just finding

1636
02:07:30,433 --> 02:07:32,101
a better place for it.

1637
02:07:35,647 --> 02:07:37,770
I'm gonna take one last look,

1638
02:07:39,025 --> 02:07:40,852
and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1639
02:08:05,927 --> 02:08:10,348
<i>It's easy to feel hopeful on
a beautiful day like today.</i>

1640
02:08:11,349 --> 02:08:14,428
<i>But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.</i>

1641
02:08:15,061 --> 02:08:17,810
<i>There will be days
where you feel all alone.</i>

1642
02:08:20,150 --> 02:08:22,773
<i>And that's when hope
is needed most.</i>

1643
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:26,277
<i>No matter how buried it gets,</i>

1644
02:08:26,907 --> 02:08:28,962
<i>or how lost you feel,</i>

1645
02:08:29,242 --> 02:08:30,923
<i>you must promise me</i>

1646
02:08:31,203 --> 02:08:34,748
<i>that you will hold on to hope.</i>

1647
02:08:36,249 --> 02:08:37,701
<i>Keep it alive.</i>

1648
02:08:38,418 --> 02:08:41,016
<i>We have to be greater
than what we suffer.</i>

1649
02:08:41,296 --> 02:08:42,726
<i>My wish for you</i>

1650
02:08:43,006 --> 02:08:45,312
<i>is to become hope.</i>

1651
02:08:45,592 --> 02:08:47,260
<i>People need that.</i>

1652
02:08:48,386 --> 02:08:50,442
<i>And even if we fail,</i>

1653
02:08:50,722 --> 02:08:52,970
<i>what better way is there to live?</i>

1654
02:08:54,351 --> 02:08:56,198
<i>As we look around here today</i>

1655
02:08:56,478 --> 02:08:59,898
<i>at all of the people
who helped make us who we are,</i>

1656
02:09:00,398 --> 02:09:03,021
<i>I know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.</i>

1657
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:05,999
<i>But we will carry
a piece of each other</i>

1658
02:09:06,279 --> 02:09:09,232
<i>into everything that we do next,</i>

1659
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:13,904
<i>to remind us of who we are,</i>

1660
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:17,256
<i>and of who we're meant to be.</i>

1661
02:09:19,668 --> 02:09:21,807
<i>I've had a great
four years with you.</i>

1662
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:24,289
<i>I'll miss you all very much.</i>

1663
02:09:46,486 --> 02:09:47,778
Let's go! Move it.

1664
02:09:55,954 --> 02:09:57,622
Get down! Take cover!

1665
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:05,517
<i>I'm here live on Park Avenue and 56th
Street where it is complete chaos.</i>

1666
02:10:05,797 --> 02:10:07,978
<i>A man in some sort of
weaponized armored suit</i>

1667
02:10:08,258 --> 02:10:09,880
<i>is wreaking havoc on Midtown.</i>

1668
02:10:13,722 --> 02:10:16,319
I am the Rhino!

1669
02:10:16,599 --> 02:10:19,222
I told you I would be back!

1670
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:32,608
- No! No!
- A kid!

1671
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:38,571
Hold your fire!

1672
02:10:38,997 --> 02:10:40,824
Everybody, hold your fire.

1673
02:10:41,458 --> 02:10:44,753
<i>- Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.
- Civilian in our line of sight.</i>

1674
02:10:48,506 --> 02:10:49,753
Kid! You gotta get...

1675
02:10:51,718 --> 02:10:53,482
Look, New York!

1676
02:10:53,762 --> 02:10:55,805
Spider-Man is back.

1677
02:10:56,181 --> 02:10:57,152
Leave the kid alone!

1678
02:10:57,432 --> 02:10:59,400
That's my baby! Please.

1679
02:11:02,437 --> 02:11:04,534
Brave boy. Huh?

1680
02:11:04,814 --> 02:11:07,358
Does Aleksei scare you, little boy?

1681
02:11:24,459 --> 02:11:26,161
Hey, Spider-Man.

1682
02:11:36,388 --> 02:11:37,885
I knew you'd come back.

1683
02:11:38,181 --> 02:11:40,487
Yeah. Thanks for
stepping up for me.

1684
02:11:40,767 --> 02:11:42,823
You're the bravest kid
I've ever seen.

1685
02:11:43,103 --> 02:11:45,823
I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1686
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:48,813
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

1687
02:11:55,657 --> 02:11:56,878
You fight me?

1688
02:11:57,158 --> 02:11:59,965
You fight me now? Huh?

1689
02:12:00,245 --> 02:12:03,552
On behalf of the fine people of New
York City and real rhinos everywhere,

1690
02:12:03,832 --> 02:12:06,805
I ask you to put
your mechanized paws in the air.

1691
02:12:07,085 --> 02:12:08,056
Never!

1692
02:12:08,336 --> 02:12:11,309
I crush you! I kill you!
I destroy you!

1693
02:12:11,589 --> 02:12:13,303
You want me to come down there
so you can kill me?

1694
02:12:13,383 --> 02:12:14,354
Yes!

1695
02:12:14,634 --> 02:12:15,939
I'll be right there.

1696
02:12:16,219 --> 02:12:18,217
There's no place like home.
