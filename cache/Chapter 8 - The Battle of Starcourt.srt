1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,311
- Still nothing?
- Nothing.

2
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,725
Food court? You sure they said food court?

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,022
I'm sorry, have my translation skills
been letting you down?

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,529
We don't know it's your kids.

5
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,821
Yes, we do.

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,043
- What is that?
- There's something in there.

7
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,541
- No!
- Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,837
Keep her talking.
Keep her awake, okay?

9
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,381
Jesus Christ.

10
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,237
Hey, hey, hey. Stay awake, stay awake.
Let's get her on this side, on this side.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,131
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.
- It's, uh...

12
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,075
You know, it's not actually that bad.
There was a...

13
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,288
The goalie on my soccer team,
Beth Wildfire,

14
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,555
this other girl slid into her leg,
and the bone came out of her knee,

15
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,869
- six inches or something, it was insane.
- Robin.

16
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,286
- Yeah?
- You're not helping.

17
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,794
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,803
Okay. All right, El?

19
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,458
This is gonna hurt like hell, okay?

20
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,166
- Okay.
- Need you to stay real still.

21
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,677
Here, you're gonna want to bite down
on this, okay?

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,970
Jesus Christ.

23
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,813
Holy shit. Holy shit.

24
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,149
Do it.

25
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,229
Okay.

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,783
Oh, shit.

27
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,587
- Jonathan!
- Stop talking!

28
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,799
- Goddamn it!
- No! Stop it!

29
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,635
Stop! Stop!

30
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,637
I can do it.

31
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,348
I can do it.

32
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,653
God!

33
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,256
God!

34
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,433
The Mind Flayer,
it built this monster in Hawkins,

35
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,561
to stop El, to kill her
and pave a way into our world.

36
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,483
And it almost did.
That was just one tiny piece of it.

37
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,020
How big is this thing?

38
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,524
It's big.

39
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,017
- Thirty feet, at least.
- Yeah.

40
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,938
It sorta destroyed your cabin.

41
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,700
Sorry.

42
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,778
Okay, so, just to be clear, this...

43
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,453
this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El,

44
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,544
it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?

45
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,040
- Yes.
- But instead of, like, screws and metal,

46
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,963
the Mind Flayer made its weapon...

47
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,540
with melted people.

48
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,416
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah, okay.

49
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,883
I... Yeah, I'm just making sure.

50
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,053
Are we sure this thing is still out there,
still alive?

51
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,933
El beat the shit out of it,
but, yeah, it's still alive.

52
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,614
- But if we close the gate again...
- We cut the brain off from the body.

53
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,638
And kill it.

54
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,098
Theoretically.

55
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,142
Yoo-hoo!

56
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,772
Yoo-hoo!

57
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,027
Okay, this is what Alexei called
"the hub."

58
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,108
Now, the hub takes us to the vault room.

59
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,703
Okay, where's the gate?

60
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,948
Right here.
I don't know the scale on this,

61
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,241
but I think it's fairly close
to the vault room,

62
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,035
maybe 50 feet or so.

63
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,328
More like 500.

64
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,205
What, you're just gonna waltz in there
like it's commie Disneyland or something?

65
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm sorry, who are you?

66
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,503
Erica Sinclair. Who are you?

67
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,877
Murray...

68
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,093
Bauman.

69
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,881
Listen, Mr. Bunman,

70
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,844
I'm not trying to tell you
how to do things,

71
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,934
but I've been down in that shithole
for 24 hours.

72
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,101
And with all due respect,
you do what this man tells you,

73
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,311
you're all gonna die.

74
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,060
I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old
speaking to me?

75
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,564
Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard!

76
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,316
- Erica!
- Just the facts!

77
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,938
She's right. You're all gonna die,
but you don't have to. Excuse me.

78
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,567
- Sorry, may I?
- Please.

79
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,119
Okay, see this room here?
This is a storage facility.

80
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,251
There's a hatch in here that feeds
into their underground ventilation system.

81
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,418
That will lead you to the base
of the weapon.

82
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,919
It's a bit of a maze down there,

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,590
but between me and Erica,
we can show you the way.

84
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,209
You can show us the way?

85
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,983
Don't worry, you can do all the fighting
and the dangerous hero shit,

86
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,007
and we'll just be your...

87
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,926
navigators.

88
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
No.

89
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,889
Nope.

90
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,438
Well, that settles it.

91
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,817
He's gonna die. They're gonna die.

92
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,953
Yep, most likely.

93
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,071
You guys survived.

94
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,699
Barely.

95
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,712
We could've really used you guys
down there.

96
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,868
Could've used you up here, too.

97
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,208
Yeah, man. We missed you, dude.

98
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,634
Yeah. Big-time.

99
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,342
I missed you guys, too.

100
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,754
Big-time.

101
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,594
Please don't cry, nerds.

102
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,514
- Erica.
- Keep saying my name, see what happens.

103
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,223
Hey, heads up. You can navigate,
just from someplace safe.

104
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,158
- It's not that simple.
- The signal won't reach.

105
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,786
Not with this. You need something
with a high enough frequency band

106
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,371
to relay with the Russians' radio tower.

107
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,124
But for that to work, you need someone
who has both seen their comms room

108
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,898
and has access to a super-powered
handcrafted radio tower,

109
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,244
one preferably already situated
at the highest point in Hawkins.

110
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Oh, wait.

111
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,655
That's me.

112
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,466
If you want us to navigate, you got us.

113
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,741
But we need a head start.

114
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,794
And a car.

115
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,205
Oh, man, now this...

116
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,126
this is what I'm talkin' about!

117
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,434
- "Toddfather"?
- Oh, screw Todd!

118
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,838
Steve's her daddy now.

119
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,386
Did you just talk about yourself
in the third person?

120
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,221
- Did he just call himself daddy?
- All right, where are we going?

121
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,597
- Weathertop.
- Weather-what?

122
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,483
- Just drive.
- Okay. Jesus!

123
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,319
Bottom lock,

124
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,621
second-to-top lock,

125
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,580
third-to-top lock,

126
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,541
top lock.

127
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,711
Listen to me, I need to end this,

128
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,249
but I will be back before you know it,
okay?

129
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,714
- I don't know, Mom.
- No, listen. You're gonna be safe there.

130
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,795
It's... It's far away from all this.

131
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,549
You just stick close to your brother
and... and do whatever he says.

132
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,885
No matter what. Okay?

133
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,809
I'm not worried about me, Mom,
I'm worried about you.

134
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,679
Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine.

135
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,772
Okay? I'm gonna be fine.

136
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,858
Okay, Mom.

137
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,979
Okay, Mom. That's enough.

138
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,686
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Okay.

139
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,403
Mom, I can't breathe.

140
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,781
- My battery's low, but...
- You're suffocating me.

141
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,947
...it will recharge.

142
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,371
I know it will, kid.

143
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,786
I know.

144
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,210
I can fight.

145
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,873
Better than any of us.

146
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,089
But right now,

147
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,960
I need you safe.

148
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,465
This thing is after you.

149
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,843
It's not after me.

150
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,970
Do you understand?

151
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,722
Hey...

152
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,562
I need you to understand.

153
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,028
Okay?

154
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,109
Hey.

155
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,739
We should probably go.

156
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,049
Mike?

157
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,098
Be careful.

158
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,319
What?

159
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,195
It's a two-man operation. Two!

160
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,913
- Yeah, well, change of plans.
- Change of plans?

161
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,084
- Yeah. Will you explain it to him, please?
- We have two options here, Jim.

162
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,174
We can turn the machine off,
or we can explode it.

163
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,289
- Oh, yeah, says who?
- Says the man who built it!

164
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,086
- Yeah, and we wanna explode it!
- Or else our heroic efforts

165
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,011
will be for naught!

166
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,298
This is a three-man operation, Jim,
not two.

167
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,052
Yeah, three.

168
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,307
El, you're bleeding.

169
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,428
Are you okay?

170
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,973
Yeah.

171
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,176
- Here.
- Okay.

172
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,849
Here.

173
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,595
Lay down.

174
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,573
- What's wrong?
- I don't...

175
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,364
I don't know.

176
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,951
You can't be serious. Come on!

177
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,446
Didn't your mom just buy this car?

178
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,157
Yes. I'm sure it's fine.

179
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,827
- Did you leave the lights on?
- No.

180
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,536
- Do we have gas?
- Yes!

181
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,131
- Come on!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just stop, stop!

182
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,089
Pop the hood.

183
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,548
- What the hell?
- What?

184
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,118
The ignition cable's gone.

185
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,365
Back in the mall!

186
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,030
Back in the mall!

187
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,198
- Go! Go, go, go!
- Be careful!

188
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,076
Go! Go!

189
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,373
Go, go, go!

190
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,093
So then I yank those cables
like I'm pulling weeds.

191
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,404
- And that'll set off the alarm...
- According to Alexei,

192
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,888
may his soul rest in peace.

193
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,684
Which should give you two an opening
to retrieve the keys from the vault.

194
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,016
And then we just follow the map
to the observation room, turn the key...

195
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,403
- Kaboom, we blow this sucker sky-high.
- Yeah.

196
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,280
And then, once the rift is closed,
we escape back through the vents.

197
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,738
Right under their commie noses.

198
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,818
Then home free.

199
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,861
Uh...

200
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,992
Oh, God, just because it wasn't your plan
doesn't mean it was a bad plan.

201
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,581
I didn't say it was a bad plan.

202
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,778
You made a noise.

203
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,448
- I did not make a noise.
- You did too.

204
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,286
- I really think it's disrespectful...
- What is up with you and noises?

205
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,463
Children! Children!

206
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,088
It is a good plan.

207
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,259
A solid B, which is laudable,
given the situation and time constraints.

208
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,380
Dare I say, if it all goes right...

209
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,139
...they'll never even know we were here.

210
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,075
Stop right there!

211
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,769
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

212
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,310
Documents, important documents...

213
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,685
for the Lieutenant-Comrade!

214
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,477
He called us, last minute.

215
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,106
Pardon our sloppy appearance.

216
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,114
Lieutenant? What Lieutenant?

217
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,664
Lieutenant...

218
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,783
Molotov?

219
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,922
Oh, shit.

220
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,337
Jim...

221
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,126
This is crazy.

222
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,298
- Oh, my God.
- Jim, I... This...

223
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,014
I had it under control.

224
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,305
Yeah, sure you did.

225
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,973
What are you doing?

226
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,980
I'm improvising.

227
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,268
Jesus, how far is this place, man?

228
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,067
Relax, we're almost there.

229
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,779
Suzie must be pretty special, huh?

230
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,130
I mean, if you built this thing

231
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,954
and lugged it all the way to the middle
of nowhere just to talk to her?

232
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,034
I mean, nobody's scientifically perfect,

233
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,037
but Suzie's about as close
to being perfect

234
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,659
as any human could possibly be.

235
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,793
She sound made-up to me.

236
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,383
She sound made-up to you?

237
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,876
- Why are you hesitating, Steve?
- I'm... I'm... I'm not! I'm not!

238
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,053
I think she sounds real.
You know, totally, absolutely real.

239
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,933
Left. Turn left.

240
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,849
- There's not a road here.
- Turn left now!

241
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,968
Jesus! Hang on!

242
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,139
Whoa! Henderson, where are we going?!

243
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,136
Up!

244
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,227
Whoa!

245
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,436
- Oh, Jesus!
- We're not gonna make it!

246
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,696
Yes, we are. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby!

247
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,201
Come on!

248
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,952
Come on. Come on.

249
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,868
Come on!

250
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,076
Guess the Toddfather has its limitations.

251
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,184
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

252
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,755
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

253
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,848
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

254
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,024
Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy?

255
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,274
We're trapped in the mall
and in need of emergency transportation.

256
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,070
Scoops Troop, do you copy?
Billy has found us.

257
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,863
He has disabled our car
and we are trapped in the mall.

258
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,697
Repeat: Billy has disabled our car
and we are trapped in the mall.

259
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,904
- Scoops Troop...
- You're gonna kill him, aren't you?

260
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,872
This is just a precaution, okay?

261
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,535
And not just against Billy.

262
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,924
If he knows we're here,
so does the Mind Flayer.

263
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,501
Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need
of emergency transportation.

264
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,258
Do you copy?

265
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,970
Scoops Troop, do you copy?

266
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,262
No chance that thing'll drive, right?

267
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,584
- Steve, do you copy?
- We don't need it to drive.

268
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,011
Dustin!

269
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,931
We just need the ignition cable.

270
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,608
Push!

271
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,283
Shit!

272
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,833
Let me try.

273
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,289
El...

274
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,870
I can do it.

275
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,835
Can I help?

276
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,591
Picking up.

277
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,545
Do I know you?

278
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,511
New arrivals.

279
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,130
Landed last night.

280
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,013
Say goodbye to sunlight.

281
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,597
Who needs sunlight

282
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,482
when we have one another, comrade?

283
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,386
Indeed, comrade!

284
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,477
And a bottle of Stolichnaya.

285
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,210
Why are you talking so much?

286
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,297
He was nice.

287
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,089
- He was nice?
- He was a nice guard.

288
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,987
Yeah, I mean, we should probably
invite him over after all this is done.

289
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,488
Yeah, I can bake him a casserole.

290
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,990
Get a six-pack,
share some laughs.

291
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,104
You know, have a drink.

292
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,194
Ugh.

293
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,571
Anyone wanna trade jobs?

294
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,705
Bald Eagle, do you copy?

295
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,573
Bald Eagle, I repeat,
this is Scoops Troop, do you copy?

296
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,737
Yes, I copy.

297
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,908
Call sign?

298
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,500
Bald Eagle.

299
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,788
Please repeat.

300
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,081
- Bald Eagle. This is Bald Eagle!
- Copy that.

301
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,286
Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle.
What's your 20?

302
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,922
We reached the vent.
I'll contact you when I need you.

303
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,295
Until then, silence.

304
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,382
Roger that, Bald Eagle.

305
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,347
This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent.
10-10, over.

306
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,854
I hate children.

307
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,612
- Remember, if anyone says anything, just...
- Smile and nod.

308
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,437
Good luck.

309
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,624
Push!

310
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,664
All right, great.

311
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,340
All right, now, all the way. Ready?

312
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,552
Three, two, one... Push!

313
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,805
Told you.

314
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
Physics.

315
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:09,902
How do we get it open?

316
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,032
Uh, there should be a latch.
Check under the wheel.

317
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,850
- You see it?
- I don't know, hold on.

318
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,866
What's she doing?

319
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,846
El.

320
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,060
Are you okay?

321
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,591
- Do you see it?
- I don't know.

322
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,987
It should be right here.

323
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,616
Distributor, distributor...

324
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,303
Mike.

325
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,354
Got it.

326
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,110
Nancy!

327
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,069
Come on!

328
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,807
We just found them like this.

329
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,151
The American.

330
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,690
It's taking too long.

331
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,573
- It's fine.
- No, it's not. It is not.

332
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,821
She could've died back there.

333
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,032
She almost did.

334
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,242
Well, she's safe now.
She's on her way to Murray's.

335
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,782
That thing won't find her,

336
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,405
not before we kill it.

337
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,952
Hey. This isn't the way
this is supposed to work, all right?

338
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,036
You're supposed to say,
"Yes, I told you so.

339
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,883
That's why we needed to go back
to the kids."

340
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,352
Oh, yeah, and then
you say something like...

341
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,187
"Yeah, well, it's really hard to listen

342
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,381
when you make everything sound
like it's the end of the goddamn world."

343
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,259
You know...

344
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,385
I think, despite everything,
I mean, despite the arguing,

345
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,113
I think we make a pretty good team.

346
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,321
Well, we made it this far, didn't we?

347
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,279
Yeah.

348
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,281
We did.

349
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,489
We did.

350
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,245
So, uh...

351
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,669
did I get the job or what?

352
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,587
Ah, come on.

353
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,010
Detective Byers.

354
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,178
It has a ring, doesn't it?

355
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,863
It's kinda hard to serve in a town
where you don't live, Detective.

356
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,999
You're still moving outta here.
I mean, that is the plan, right?

357
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,113
Eh, we'll see how it goes.

358
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,442
"How it goes"? How what goes?

359
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,034
You know, if... if we actually do
make it out of here,

360
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,784
we... we deserve to celebrate, right?

361
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,867
Yeah.

362
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,453
I mean...

363
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,287
yes.

364
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,748
Absolutely.

365
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,171
I hear Enzo's is pretty good.

366
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,182
What do you say, Friday, eight o'clock?

367
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,638
Uh, El likes to watch Miami Vice
on Fridays.

368
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,358
It... It starts at 10:00,
so I... I can't be out late on a Friday.

369
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,318
Okay, well, how about 7:00, then?

370
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,732
7:00?

371
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,994
Enzo's, Friday, I meet you there?

372
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,494
No, you pick me up.

373
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,031
Picking you up, 7:00 p.m. Friday.

374
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,327
Yeah, it's a date.

375
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,382
Just for clarification, just because I...
I mean, just... If...

376
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,627
When you say "date,"
just so that we're crystal clear,

377
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,486
- so there's no confusion... Yeah?
- Yeah, Hop?

378
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,180
Stop talking or I'm gonna change my mind.

379
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,562
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

380
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,347
Okay.

381
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,752
Scoops Troop, this is...

382
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,830
Hm.

383
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,415
Bald Eagle.

384
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,059
I've reached another junction.

385
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,966
- This is what?
- The fourth junction.

386
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,606
All right, so if memory serves, this is
right after the My Little Pony thesis.

387
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,630
- We went left, so he has to go right.
- Right.

388
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,716
Fly right, Bald Eagle.

389
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,550
- Fly right.
- Roger that, flying right.

390
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,474
Little shit.

391
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,598
What's the My Little Pony thesis?

392
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,023
Don't get him started.

393
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,271
- Get him started? Just tell me...
- Hey, guys?

394
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,754
Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop!
Do you copy? Over!

395
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,540
Griswold Family, I repeat,
this is Scoops Troop. Do you...

396
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,709
Griswold Family, do you copy?

397
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,463
Do you copy?!

398
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,185
Griswold Family,
this is Scoops Troop.

399
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,522
Please confirm your safety!

400
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,976
Griswold Family, this is Scoops Troop!
Please confirm your safety!

401
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,100
Are you en route to Bald Eagle's nest?

402
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,479
Please confirm your safety!

403
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,361
Someone, please just answer.
Is anyone there?

404
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,695
Just answer!

405
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,565
Anyone, please...

406
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,805
Griswold Family, do you copy?

407
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,852
Griswold Family, do you copy?

408
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,686
Griswold Family, do you copy?

409
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,481
Do you copy?!

410
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,461
- Where are you going?!
- To get them the hell outta there!

411
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,145
Stay here, contact the others!

412
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,567
- Shit.
- Wait, Robin!

413
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,412
Stay in touch.

414
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,158
Got it.

415
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,580
Bald Eagle, this is Scoops Troop.
What's your 20?

416
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,826
I told you, radio silence!

417
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,455
Yeah, but we have a problem.

418
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,749
What kind of problem?

419
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,629
It's turned away.
If we go up the stairs now, we'll make it.

420
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,515
- No way, not with El's leg.
- We have to try.

421
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,052
There's another way...

422
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,135
to get out.

423
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,345
Through the Gap.

424
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Okay.

425
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,643
Now.

426
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,066
Bald Eagle has landed.

427
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,069
Repeat.

428
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,031
Bald Eagle

429
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,361
has landed.

430
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,199
Okay.

431
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,658
Come on, how much longer?

432
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,922
I don't know, I've never done this before!

433
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,128
Okay.

434
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,336
Okay, okay!

435
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,512
Get ready, lovebirds,
you're almost up to bat.

436
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,602
Oh, shit.

437
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,687
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry.

438
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,887
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

439
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,889
Let's go.

440
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,863
Let's go.

441
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,499
Did Mikhail send for you?

442
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,435
- All right.
- Okay.

443
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,237
- Give me the code.
- Okay.

444
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,240
Six-six-two,

445
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,572
six-oh-eight,

446
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,117
oh-oh-four.

447
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,750
Uh...

448
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,167
again?

449
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,133
Six-six-two,

450
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,170
six-oh-eight,

451
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,089
oh-oh-four.

452
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,183
Murray?

453
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,148
Your goddamn code...

454
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,104
is wrong.

455
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,817
What? Are you sure?

456
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,939
Yeah, I'm sure.

457
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,533
Well, I... I suppose it could be wrong.

458
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,323
How could it be wrong?

459
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,620
The code is a number,
a famous number.

460
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,870
Planck's constant
I... I thought I knew it.

461
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,763
Planck's constant.

462
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,787
- You know it?
- Not by heart. You?

463
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,745
I'm not a nerd, nerd.

464
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,997
He told me it was
Planck's constant, which I know.

465
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,626
Why would I need him to give me a number
I already know?

466
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,721
What are you doing?

467
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,644
Go, go, go!

468
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,228
- Shit.
- Get the car started. Go!

469
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,906
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

470
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,035
- Come on.
- We gotta go!

471
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,665
Come on!

472
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,300
We gotta go!

473
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,435
Are you okay?

474
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,234
Ask me tomorrow?

475
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,485
Oh, shit!

476
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,415
Get in!

477
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,878
- Go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

478
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,752
Suzie, do you copy?

479
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,866
Suzie, do you copy?

480
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,752
Suzie, do you copy?

481
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,090
This is Suzie. I copy.

482
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,130
- Suzie!
- Dusty-bun?

483
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,213
"Dusty-bun"?

484
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,218
Where have you been?

485
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,469
I'm so, so sorry.
I... I've been really busy...

486
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,888
uh, trying to save the world
from Russians and monsters.

487
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,852
Of course you have.

488
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,852
Get the goddamn number already!

489
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,475
Who was that?

490
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,811
It was...

491
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,066
Uh, I don't know, actually.
I think it was just some interference.

492
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,979
So, why don't we, uh, change frequency

493
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,528
to 14.158?

494
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,743
Copy that, shifting frequency. Standby.

495
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,002
- Dusty-bun, you copy?
- I copy, Suzie-poo.

496
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,795
It sounds much better now, thanks.

497
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,632
- Suzie.
- Okay, so, listen,

498
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,173
do you know Planck's constant?

499
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,006
Do you know the Earth orbits the sun?

500
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,182
Okay, so I know it starts
with two sixes, and then a...

501
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,392
W-What is it?

502
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,892
Okay, let me just be clear on this.
I haven't heard from you in a week,

503
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,345
and now you want a mathematical equation
that you should know

504
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,437
so you can... save the world?

505
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,653
Suzie-poo, I promise,

506
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,572
I will make it up to you
as soon as possible.

507
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,486
You can make it up to me now.

508
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,949
- What?
- I want to hear it.

509
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,284
- Not right now.
- Yes, now, Dusty-bun.

510
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,117
Suzie-poo, this is urgent.

511
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,252
Yes, yes, you're saving the world,
I heard you the first time,

512
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,210
but Ged is also saving Earthsea
and he's about to confront the shadow,

513
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,131
so this is Suzie, signing off.

514
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,290
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.

515
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,958
Okay. Okay.

516
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,341
Shit.

517
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:01,803
Planck's constant is 6.62607004.

518
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,022
You just saved the world.

519
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,525
Gosh, I miss you, Dusty-bun.

520
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,280
And I miss you more, Suzie-poo.

521
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,032
I miss you more,
multiplied by all the stars in our galaxy.

522
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,154
No, I miss you...

523
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,199
Enough.

524
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,599
- Shit!
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

525
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,906
It's turning around.

526
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,833
- What?
- It's turning around!

527
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,041
Maybe we wore it out.

528
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,871
I don't think so. Hold on.

529
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,365
Hey! Everybody out.

530
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:52,831
Everybody out!

531
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,345
Hey.

532
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,556
You ready to end this?

533
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,236
In here. In here.

534
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,199
Okay. Come on, come on, come on...

535
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,495
Billy.

536
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,420
Billy, you don't have to do this.

537
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,436
Billy. Your name's Billy, Billy Hargrove.

538
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,840
You live on 4819 Cherry Lane.
Billy, please, I'm Max, I'm your...

539
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,526
Murray, you all set down there?

540
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,491
All set, but I've got some company
which I'd love you to obliterate.

541
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,160
Will do. Hang tight.

542
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,123
On three.

543
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,332
On three.

544
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,667
One...

545
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:22,961
Two...

546
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,772
The Americans,

547
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,114
I've found them...

548
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,871
Don't be afraid.

549
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,248
It'll be over soon.

550
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,251
Just try and stay... very still.

551
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,083
Flay this, you ugly piece of shit!

552
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,798
Hey, asshole! Over here!

553
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,435
- We're almost out!
- I know!

554
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,322
Dustin! We're out of time!

555
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,615
Hurry! Close it now!

556
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,026
Close it!

557
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,295
Come on!

558
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:46,984
Mike...

559
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,059
Mike.

560
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,644
Mike.

561
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,481
Mike. Mike. Mike, get up.
Mike, can you hear me? Mike! Mike!

562
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,982
Hey, come on.

563
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,529
You okay?

564
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,158
Where's El?

565
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,625
- Leave me alone!
- Stop it!

566
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,486
- Mom!
- This is your new sister.

567
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,010
...at least seven feet.

568
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,681
Seven... feet.

569
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,154
You told her...

570
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,609
the wave was seven feet.

571
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,528
Woo!

572
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,821
Yeah!

573
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,827
You ran to her, on the beach.

574
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,212
There were seagulls.

575
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,390
She wore a hat...

576
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,680
...with a blue ribbon.

577
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,965
A long dress...

578
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,766
with a blue and red flower.

579
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,319
Yell... Yellow sandals,

580
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,486
covered in sand.

581
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,366
She was pretty.

582
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,383
She was really pretty.

583
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,165
And you...

584
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,717
you were happy.

585
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,046
I'll see you in hell!

586
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,434
Hit me.

587
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,397
We're out!

588
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,111
Damn it!

589
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,229
No!

590
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,378
Close it now!

591
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,302
Close it!

592
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,267
Billy!

593
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,271
- El.
- Mike!

594
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,160
Billy?

595
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,412
Billy.

596
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,452
Billy, Billy, get up, please.
Billy, get up, please, please.

597
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,536
- I'm sorry.
- Billy...

598
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,040
Billy. Billy.

599
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,876
Billy, wake up. Billy, get up.
Please, Billy...

600
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,174
Billy!

601
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,434
Billy...

602
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,929
Billy...

603
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,558
I'm sorry.

604
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,101
It's okay. It's okay.

605
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,354
It's okay. It's okay.

606
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,583
Hop.

607
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,046
Jim. Where's Jim?

608
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,225
Let's go! Go! Come on!

609
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,990
You all right?

610
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,333
Hands up!

611
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,698
Don't shoot! American!
We're Americans! Americans!

612
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,169
Hey, come on, let's go!

613
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,416
Go, go!

614
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,576
Thank God!

615
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,397
Welcome to Hawkins, Indiana,

616
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,810
a wonderful place to grow up,

617
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,032
to raise your family,

618
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,648
to walk your dog.

619
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,145
But then...

620
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,776
...on July Fourth,
everything changed.

621
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,452
A terrible tragedy struck
this small town.

622
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,618
But this was not this small town's
first brush with tragedy.

623
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,917
Mysterious deaths, government cover-ups,

624
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,250
a bizarre chemical leak.

625
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,462
Is it all linked?

626
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,006
All a vast conspiracy?

627
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,091
The fault of a disgraced,
corrupt mayor?

628
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,258
Or is something more going on
in the heartland?

629
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,886
Can a town itself be cursed?

630
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,143
Some believe a rise in Satanism
is to blame.

631
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,186
To find out,

632
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,729
tune in tonight at 8:00 p.m.
for "Horror in the Heartland"

633
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,475
on Cutting Edge.

634
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,912
You put your mom down as a reference?

635
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,740
Yeah. Why not?
She's, like, super well-respected.

636
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,541
You're such a dingus.

637
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,038
Wha...

638
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,851
Uh, just to be clear,
we weren't fired, you know.

639
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,045
The mall burned down and, like,
killed a bunch of people.

640
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,009
Thanks for sharing.
Didn't know.

641
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,724
Three favorite movies. Go.

642
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,932
Uh... The Apartment,

643
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,432
Hidden Fortress, Children of Paradise.

644
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,555
You, go.

645
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,685
- Favorite movies?
- Did I stutter?

646
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,188
Uh... Animal House, for sure.

647
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,519
Um...

648
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,436
Eyes on me, Harrington.

649
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,231
Yeah. Uh...

650
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,402
Star Wars.

651
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,485
A New Hope?

652
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,451
A new what-now?

653
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,490
Which Star Wars?

654
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,034
The one with the teddy bears. Duh.

655
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,408
No? Uh... Oh, the one that just came out.
The movie that just came out.

656
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,786
The one with the DeLorean
and Alex P. Keaton,

657
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,794
and he's trying to bang his mom.

658
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,134
The time...

659
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,646
Yeah, those are my top three. Classics.

660
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,964
You start Monday.

661
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,513
You start never.

662
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,434
Will you just, um...
Will you give us a minute?

663
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,466
Why?

664
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,557
Steve.

665
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,401
All right, you have to understand, Keith,

666
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,650
I know his taste is a bit pedestrian,

667
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,244
but the dingus has other qualities.

668
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,620
He's a douchebag of the highest order,
Robin.

669
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,578
He was a bit of a prick to us
in high school, I'll grant you that,

670
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,829
but he remains...

671
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,658
a total chick magnet.

672
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,366
Yeah, okay,
and this is relevant to me how?

673
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,627
Uh, Earth to Keith.

674
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,132
The ladies will come in just to see him.

675
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,552
They'll come in in droves.

676
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,173
Droves, Keith.

677
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,966
We sold so much ice cream,

678
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,180
they had to get a second shipment in
from Michigan.

679
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,430
Goddamn Michigan, Keith.

680
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,103
And these ladies...

681
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,971
These ladies are hot.

682
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,980
They're so very hot.

683
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,651
And there are too many of them
for little Steve.

684
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,324
He needs assistance.

685
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,239
He needs your assistance, Keith.

686
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,067
What's in it for you?
You got a thing for him or something?

687
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,367
Goddammit. This is...

688
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,244
Hm.

689
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,036
We're just, um...

690
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,165
We're just friends.

691
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,583
Oh!

692
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,843
Fast Times. Fast Times. Ever heard of it?

693
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,381
Top three for me, Keith.

694
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,759
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down.
- Sorry. Sorry.

695
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,052
- Still got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

696
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,014
Wait, did we get that verse right?
It's "unfold behind the clouds"?

697
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,618
Yeah, but you're butchering it,
so could you please stop?

698
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,748
So then join in, Dusty-bun.

699
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,915
Yeah, come on, Dusty-bun,
why don't you join us?

700
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,344
You guys are so funny,
you should be on Carson.

701
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,303
- Can't we just hear your rendition?
- No.

702
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,473
Please? Just one verse?

703
00:59:56,551 --> 01:00:00,721
No. No way. It's reserved for Suzie's ears
and Suzie's ears alone.

704
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,817
Shut up, you guys.

705
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,328
Stop! You guys, please, shut up.

706
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,827
Whoa, dude. That's the donation box.

707
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,212
I know.
I'll just use yours when I come back.

708
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,787
I mean, if we still wanna play.

709
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,799
Yeah, but what if you want to join
another party?

710
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,668
Not possible.

711
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,306
Is that...

712
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,192
everything?

713
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,851
I guess so.

714
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,577
Seventeen years of my life...

715
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,874
packed up in one day.

716
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,638
What if I just...

717
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,968
don't let you go?

718
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,850
I think...

719
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,021
the new owners might kick us out.

720
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,404
You could stay in our basement.

721
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,111
Your dad'd love that.

722
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,778
We could hide you in a tent,

723
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,526
like El.

724
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,121
Hey.

725
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,826
It's gonna be okay.

726
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,466
As a wise man once said...

727
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,852
we've got shared trauma.

728
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,976
So what's a little more, right?

729
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,241
What's a little more?

730
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:14,995
They'll come back.

731
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,828
I know they will.

732
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,214
Thanks.

733
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,223
- You packed your walkie, right?
- Yes.

734
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,640
Because you know that I'm gonna
steal Cerebro from Dustin

735
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,219
and call you so much,
you're gonna have to turn it off, right?

736
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,678
Did you talk to your mom?

737
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,520
About Thanksgiving?

738
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,863
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got the okay. I'll be there.

739
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,443
And then I was thinking maybe
you could come up here for Christmas.

740
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,606
And Will, too.

741
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,453
You can come before or after Christmas,
or whatever Mrs. Byers wants,

742
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,910
but I was thinking Christmas Day
could be super fun,

743
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,700
because we'd all have cool new presents
to play with and, uh...

744
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,330
Sorry, that made me sound like
a seven-year-old.

745
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,082
I like presents, too.

746
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,707
Yeah, cool. Yeah.

747
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,169
I like... I like presents, too.

748
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,464
Cool.

749
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,350
Mike?

750
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:16,893
Yeah?

751
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,773
Remember that day...

752
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,071
at the cabin, you were talking to Max?

753
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,194
Um...

754
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,699
I don't think I follow.

755
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,910
You talked about your... your feelings,

756
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:31,449
your heart.

757
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,332
Oh.

758
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,710
Oh, yeah, that.
Man, that was so long ago. Um...

759
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:40,497
That was really heat of the moment stuff,
and we were arguing and...

760
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,420
I don't really remember...

761
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,048
What did I say, exactly?

762
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,173
Mike...

763
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:54,387
I love you, too.

764
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,630
Donation box?

765
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,470
Uh, yeah, sure.

766
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,684
What is that?

767
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:36,556
Uh...

768
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,061
It... It's the speech Hop wrote
for you and Mike.

769
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,605
Speech?

770
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,191
Yeah. You know, the heart-to-heart.

771
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,322
He never talked to you, did he?

772
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,246
Can I read?

773
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,551
"There's something I've been
wanting to talk to you both about.

774
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,389
I know this is a difficult conversation,

775
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,233
but I care about you both very much.

776
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,435
And I know that you care about each other
very much.

777
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,191
And that's why it's important that
we set these boundaries moving forward,

778
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,364
so we can build an environment...

779
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,865
where we all feel...

780
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,872
comfortable...

781
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:40,748
trusted...

782
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,583
and open...

783
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,165
to sharing our feelings."

784
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,639
Feelings.

785
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,819
Feelings.

786
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,653
Jesus.

787
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:13,606
The truth is,

788
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:18,407
for so long,
I'd forgotten what those even were.

789
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,004
I've been stuck in one place,

790
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,208
in a cave, you might say.

791
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,462
A deep, dark cave.

792
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,500
And then,
I left some Eggos out in the woods,

793
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,668
and you came into my life and...

794
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,586
for the first time in a long time,

795
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,058
I started to feel things again.

796
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,103
I started to feel happy.

797
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,284
But, lately, I guess I've been feeling...

798
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,399
distant from you.

799
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,820
Like you're...

800
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,122
you're pulling away from me or something.

801
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,410
I miss playing board games every night,

802
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:09,092
making triple-decker Eggo extravaganzas
at sunrise,

803
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:12,378
watching westerns together
before we doze off.

804
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,803
But I know you're getting older.

805
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,429
Growing.

806
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,350
Changing.

807
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,182
And I guess...

808
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,935
if I'm being really honest,

809
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,306
that's what scares me.

810
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,361
I don't want things to change.

811
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,819
So, I think maybe that's why
I came in here,

812
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:42,076
to try to maybe... stop that change.

813
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,501
To turn back the clock.

814
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,667
To make things go back
to how they were.

815
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,168
But I know that's naive.

816
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,133
It's just...

817
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,680
not how life works.

818
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,762
It's moving.

819
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,056
Always moving, whether you like it or not.

820
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,227
And, yeah, sometimes it's painful.

821
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,863
Sometimes it's sad.

822
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,901
And sometimes...

823
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,448
it's surprising.

824
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:21,948
Happy.

825
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,406
So, you know what?

826
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,747
Keep on growing up, kid.

827
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,464
Don't let me stop you.

828
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,037
Make mistakes, learn from 'em,

829
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:37,972
and when life hurts you,
because it will,

830
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,376
remember the hurt.

831
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:44,095
The hurt is good.

832
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:47,215
It means you're out of that cave.

833
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,150
But, please,

834
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,609
if you don't mind,

835
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:57,105
for the sake of your poor old dad,

836
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:01,863
keep the door open three inches.

837
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,336
Are you okay?

838
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:26,846
Yeah.

839
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:32,061
Time to go?

840
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:34,694
Yeah.

841
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,396
I'll be out in a minute.

842
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:39,824
Okay.

843
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,950
No. Not the American.

844
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,833
No, I'm begging you...
No! Don't!

845
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:02,706
No! Please! No! Don't!

846
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:05,670
No, don't!

847
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,801
Don't do this!

848
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,219
Let me go!

849
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,102
Let me go!

850
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,026
Don't leave me in here.

851
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,743
Let me out,

852
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:33,950
I'm innocent.

853
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,493
I'm innocent!

854
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:36,701
I'm begging you, please!
