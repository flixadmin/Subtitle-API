<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,430
Astra. This place, it's twisted you.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,000
It's made me more like you.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,393
When you took on the wand's power,
you also took on its charge.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,800
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,958
Go find John and help him
rescue Ray from Hell.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,355
Gary, you dick.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,193
I have created a simple app.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,000
<i>You will be able to share
monster sightings.</i>

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,992
"In exchange for this service,
the user agrees

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,640
to forfeit their eternal soul
to the demon Neron."

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,160
He may be planning a monster attack.

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,456
Get every single one of those monsters
out of the Time Bureau.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,836
- It's a bloody jailbreak!
- No.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
What kind of egg is that?

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,636
It's a dragon egg.

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,120
My name is Zari.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,919
Oh, Sa...

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,993
Hey! You haven't happened to see
an ogre wandering around,

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,754
about yea high,
likes to grunt, drink beer?

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Ask Rory.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,598
Ah. Ogre wins again.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,195
Cheating bastard.
No one out-drinks Mick Rory.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,436
Hey, fellas!

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,159
Sorry to break up all the fun,

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,152
but, uh, technically,
I wasn't supposed to allow

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,471
any magical creatures
out of the lab, so...

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,600
On second thought,
why don't you two finish up here,

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,757
and I'll go, uh,
track down the Minotaur?

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,997
You're not a horrible mother.
You just had a lot on your mind.

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,198
I left our dragon egg in the care
of nine-year-old me.

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,113
Has anybody seen Gary?

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,429
Wait, what did you just say?

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,670
I was distracted.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,456
I just found out the EYES app
is stealing people's souls,

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,711
and then baby me comes home and I...

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,712
You two need to grab that egg
before it hatches.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,000
We can't risk Ne-Ray getting his hands
on a baby dragon.

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,736
It's already bad enough
that he has Charlie.

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,160
- Okay.
- Fair.

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,350
Get up. Time's a-wasting.

42
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,319
There are souls just waiting to be sold.

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,880
You're off your rocker, you old nag.

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,910
This here shapeshifter
don't take requests.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,232
Shapeshifter?
Is that all you think you are?

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,117
You may have
your human friends fooled, dearie,

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,989
but you and I both know
what you're truly capable of.

48
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,560
- You don't know me!
- Don't I?

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,597
This shape you're wearing,
though lovely, is a costume.

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,956
It's not who you really are.

51
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,960
You aren't meant to hide, my pet.

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,398
You are meant to show humans
their greatest fears.

53
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,153
And lucky for you,

54
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,790
helping monsters
fulfill their potential...

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,397
is what I do.

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Yes.

57
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,035
Damn it, Gary.

58
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Oh.

59
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:51,839
Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me...

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,317
Hi, pardon me, I just...
I don't belong here.

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,232
No, and I'm...

62
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,757
I'm a Fairy Godmother
sent to find John Constantine!

63
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,840
Really?

64
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,873
What, are the King and Queen of Hell
making their grand debut?

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,917
Not our debut, dearie.

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,073
No, no, no.

67
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,277
Stop! What are you doing?

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,273
As much as I'd like to pontificate
about my grander plan...

69
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,314
I've taught him better than that.

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,440
Ah.

71
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:32,669
Who the hell are you?

72
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,240
Really? The dress doesn't sell it?

73
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,176
You didn't tell me
you had a Fairy Godmother, John.

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,873
Not his. Gary's.

75
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,856
And I thought
I was the one being tortured.

76
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,314
Look, princess.

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,629
We got rules here in Hell.

78
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,154
All right, you can't just...

79
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Let's go.

80
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,670
What are you doing?

81
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,558
Going to find Ray
the same way I found you.

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,916
The only difference is,
Ray doesn't have a body.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,878
So, let's go find his soul.

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,189
His soul token.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,117
That's the currency in Hell.

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,714
While his soul is being tortured,

87
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,474
then his token is traded around town
like money.

88
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,710
As long as you have it,

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,598
then you'll always
have access to the soul.

90
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,393
But since Neron is still topside,

91
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,958
then his token's likely locked
in his vault.

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,191
Then let's go find it.

93
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,394
Why isn't this working?

94
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm sorry, love, you can't just go

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
poofing yourself
into the vaults of Hell.

96
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,836
We'll have to find someone
to help us break in.

97
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,834
And I think I know just the person.

98
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,520
I don't see her.

99
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,797
How do you know
what nine-year-old me looks like?

100
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,512
I'm just looking for
the coolest kid in school.

101
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,519
Yeah, there's a lot I haven't told you
about my childhood.

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,476
There. That's the spot where
kids used to gang up on me and say,

103
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,274
"Zari, Zari,
why are your clothes so sorry?"

104
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Bah.

105
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,076
I would have said,
"Zari, Zari, you smell like calamari."

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,352
Bullying is bad. It's...

107
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,160
All right, let's break this up
and find out where I stashed the egg.

108
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,355
- He's so cool.
- Aw. Look how cute he is.

109
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,035
- I want a dragon.
- He's so adorable.

110
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,720
I wanna take him home with me.

111
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,790
Oh, my God. He hatched.

112
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,520
And I brought him to school.

113
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
- Okay, so, we gotta get him before...
- Wait, wait, wait, look.

114
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,914
Mithra, dance.

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,439
- Awesome, Zari.
- Thank you.

116
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Mmm.

117
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,270
Come on.

118
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,872
What's going on, children?

119
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,000
It's okay. He's my pet, Mithra.
I named him after the...

120
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,515
Run, children! It's a monster.

121
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,352
Wait, Zari, Zari. Wait! Wait.

122
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,516
Don't hurt him!

123
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Hmph.

124
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,519
Oh, my God, I lost him again.

125
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,830
Captain, I've located Neron.

126
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,311
<i>Now, live to Capitol Hill,
where the Palmer ex-CEO</i>

127
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,136
<i>is testifying before
the Senate subcommittee.</i>

128
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,391
<i>Look, I know
Senator Wellington doesn't believe</i>

129
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,951
that it's up to the private sector
to intervene in such an

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,838
unprecedented crisis.

131
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,072
But I should mention, not a single one
of my subscribers has been harmed

132
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
in a monster attack.

133
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,560
Senator, do you care to respond?

134
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,432
This bloke is just trying to scare folks

135
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,274
into downloading his evil,
soul-sucking app.

136
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,673
There ain't no such thing as...

137
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,870
This isn't me!

138
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,633
- Senator!
- I'm not doing this!

139
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,838
Like I said,
they could be hiding anywhere.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,912
And only you can stop them.

141
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,549
Wait. He might be Charlie.

142
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,756
Who am I supposed to shoot?

143
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,795
There.

144
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,434
Damn pigs! I'm trying to help you out!

145
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Stay there.

146
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
We gotta go!

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,150
Come on.

148
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,394
Let her go. She's served her purpose.

149
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,673
Astra Logue.

150
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,673
The name's Neron.
I hear good things about you.

151
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,070
Now, that I'm taking over
for your former employers, I...

152
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,879
Give it a rest, John.

153
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,714
You think I can't see through
your cheap little parlor trick?

154
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,680
How'd you get out of
the torture pits, anyway?

155
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Nice sparkles.

156
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,240
Nice shoulder pads.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,275
What do you want, John?

158
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,920
And please tell me you're not here
to make some sad, sappy plea

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,559
for me to remember who I really am.

160
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,280
I know exactly who you are.

161
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,874
You're someone I can work with.

162
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,556
The triumvirate, they were
too short-sighted to take my deal,

163
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,717
and now,
they are roasting rats for supper.

164
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,280
But you're smarter than that, Astra.

165
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,514
All I need is access to one measly soul,

166
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,640
and in exchange, I'll go kill Neron,
and your boys will be back on top.

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,194
So, this soul you're after...

168
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,514
Must be pretty special.

169
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,800
He is.

170
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,672
I was special to you too, John.

171
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,430
Once.

172
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,513
And yet you left me down here
to rot all those years.

173
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,557
- Astra, you can't just...
- I'm over it.

174
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,551
I made the best of a bad situation,
and guess what?

175
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,710
I flourished.

176
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,996
Down here, I had prospects.

177
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,675
Until Neron wiped his ass with them.

178
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,439
So, do we have a deal?

179
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,114
Let's go rob the King.

180
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,856
<i>Today's attack at the US Capitol</i>

181
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,271
<i>has sparked worldwide panic and paranoia
over the threat of magical creatures.</i>

182
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,198
Enough, Gideon.

183
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,549
Where is Neron in all this?

184
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,776
Why isn't he responding
to his magical creature alerts?

185
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,190
What alerts? All the creatures
are here on the ship.

186
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,736
You know what? It doesn't even matter.

187
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,696
Neron's shown the world
that anyone can be a monster.

188
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,880
People are turning on each other,
everyone's terrified.

189
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,416
I thought Neron wanted to collect souls.

190
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,016
How does hacking the app,
only to let it fail,

191
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,394
get him what he wants?

192
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,119
It's not about souls anymore.

193
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,475
It's something worse.

194
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,233
They didn't share their endgame,

195
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,640
but from what I could figure out,

196
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,136
they don't give a fart
about ruling Hell.

197
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,595
- It's actually fear that they're after.
- Why?

198
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,791
Fear is power. It's energy.

199
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,800
And thanks to me, they have
a wallop of it to muck about with.

200
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,395
That might explain
the strange meteorological event

201
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,352
forming over Washington DC.

202
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,149
Right above the Time Bureau.

203
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,674
Gideon, do you have a visual?

204
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,439
You're welcome, world.

205
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,872
The air is thick
with human fear.

206
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,237
The hour of our coronation
draws near, my pet.

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,677
It's time to send your message
to your legions below.

208
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,558
The bank's right around the corner.

209
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,353
What's happening?

210
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,960
<i>Denizens of Hell,</i>

211
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,872
<i>for far too long, we have been forced</i>

212
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,317
<i>to live like insects
underneath the Earth.</i>

213
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,631
<i>Soon, a door will open.</i>

214
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,599
<i>Look to the sky, and await my signal.</i>

215
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,520
<i>With me as your king,</i>

216
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,479
<i>we will make Earth Hell again.</i>

217
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,555
So, that's been his play all along.

218
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,393
We best keep moving, loves.

219
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,392
Before all Hell literally breaks loose.

220
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,995
Stay calm. They smell fear.

221
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,472
What if fear's my natural scent?

222
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,591
Good afternoon, everyone.

223
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,114
We have your favorites.

224
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,952
I know it's a bit crowded in here,

225
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,793
but we're making the best of it.

226
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,997
Anybody want a sammy-whammy?

227
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,870
Put that in your whammy, you dick!

228
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,280
Okay... Uh...

229
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Bon appetit.

230
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,991
They are savages.

231
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,753
Oh, calm down, Gary.

232
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,270
The longer we keep
the magical creatures locked up,

233
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,636
the more
they're gonna act like actual monsters.

234
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,638
They are monsters, you twit.

235
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,559
And so are you. We all are.

236
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,991
How are we supposed
to defeat fear itself?

237
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,639
I mean, people afraid of metas,

238
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,757
magical creatures
afraid of people and...

239
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,757
Monsters hated by everyone.

240
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,880
Not everyone.

241
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,519
Gideon, play the...

242
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
The dancing dragon
sneeze video?

243
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,875
- Yep, that.
<i>- Mithra, dance.</i>

244
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,792
- What is this?
- Wicksty.

245
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,869
- Aw.
- Aw.

246
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,630
Yeah, this innocent moment
where kids aren't afraid,

247
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,757
it's resonating with people.

248
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,520
They don't see a monster,
they see something amazing.

249
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
So do I.

250
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Me on that playground,

251
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,797
surrounded by people
who wanna be my friend.

252
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,075
Even if it was just for a day,

253
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,436
that little baby dragon
changed my world.

254
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
You sound like my dad's pitch for...

255
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,280
Heyworld!

256
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,714
Oh, my God, guys, that's it.

257
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,154
What... What's... What?

258
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,038
My dad had a dream to build a theme park

259
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
that people would come to see
because of magic.

260
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,216
That's what the world needs right now.

261
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,551
A place for people to come and see
the wonder of these creatures in person.

262
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,757
What, so, they can
just shoot us all in one place?

263
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,056
Yeah, that's bloody brilliant, that.

264
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,720
No, so, they can see creatures

265
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,918
the way that you helped us
see creatures, Charlie.

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,313
Not as monsters, but as misfits
just trying to find their place.

267
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,800
Look, if we can learn that lesson,
then so can the rest of the world.

268
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,157
We just need to bring people
and creatures together.

269
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,110
Think of it like a magical version
of Woodstock.

270
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,719
If we build it...

271
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,234
They will come.

272
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,835
How long until
we can get it up and running?

273
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,709
Uh, if Mikey T and the boys
work weekends, quick math in my head,

274
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,269
two, maybe three years.

275
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Oh.

276
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,751
- He's not a coin.
- Observant.

277
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,832
No flesh bags, just souls.

278
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,592
That's why they call it
the Soul Exchange.

279
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,115
All right, then.
I'll be on me way, then.

280
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,238
This is John Constantine.

281
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,480
Oh.

282
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:31,473
And me without my autograph book.

283
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,520
No worries, love. Next time, yeah?

284
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,519
Look, if you would like
to convert his soul into cash, you...

285
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,273
Maybe you don't get it.

286
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,955
Neron owns the marker on his soul.

287
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,357
And Neron wants to torture him
as soon as he gets here.

288
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,359
But, hey,
if you want to tell the new boss

289
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,911
why his prize victim
isn't waiting in his vault...

290
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
This way.

291
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Not so rough.

292
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,554
FYI, there's no bathroom in here,
and I'm not feeding him.

293
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,597
I'm a bank teller, not a zoo...

294
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,791
Pretty cool for a grown woman
wearing taffeta and a tiara.

295
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,599
How does this work?

296
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,796
We find a coin?

297
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,200
There are thousands.

298
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,758
Some of history's worst.

299
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,514
Yeah, I'd wager
he's keeping it somewhere special.

300
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,478
Hey, what are you doing?

301
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,155
What? Revolution's in the air.

302
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,038
I've got to look out for number one.

303
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,716
You were a golden opportunity
to bank roll my future.

304
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,280
I took it.

305
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,798
What about Brigid's diary?

306
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,317
If we put it in Nate's hands,
he could just dream us up a theme park.

307
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,517
Z! You are a genius!

308
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,516
Oh. It's in the Time Bureau.

309
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,557
It's okay. So, we just break in.

310
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,240
But it's not gonna be easy.
Even if it isn't demon central,

311
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,736
the vault that it's being held in
is practically impenetrable.

312
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,955
Oh, it's penetrable.

313
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,353
Oh, my God!

314
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,280
- I love you, Rory.
- Mmm-hmm.

315
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Give it back when you're done.

316
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:08,197
Buck and Garima's sexual odyssey
is far from over.

317
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,313
All right, team. Nate,
you have a theme park to dream up.

318
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,551
Gary, help Mona
<i>Pretty Woman</i> our creatures

319
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,176
into something
a little more kid-friendly.

320
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
And the rest of us...

321
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,238
It's time to come up
with a marketing plan

322
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,233
for the happiest place on the planet.

323
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,516
Ms. Tomaz,
your simulation program

324
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,520
has detected a change

325
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,353
in your presently predicted future.

326
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,760
A good change or bad change?

327
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,559
In one potential 2042,

328
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,390
building Heyworld leads to an era
of understanding and tolerance.

329
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,598
The Anti-Meta-Human Act of 2029
never passes,

330
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,400
your parents live out their lives
peacefully in Seattle.

331
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,672
The future, as you know it,
would be completely changed.

332
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,440
My parents... Behrad...

333
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,160
That means a piece of this crazy plan
actually works.

334
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,594
This is great news, right?

335
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,110
God, I have been running
that stupid program for so long,

336
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,590
I had given up hope
of it actually working.

337
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,198
If this works, my brother survives,

338
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,190
I never steal his totem back from ARGUS,
I never join the Legends.

339
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,437
The last two years
wouldn't have happened.

340
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,474
Who knows where I'll be or who I'll be?

341
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,194
You'll be you.

342
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,955
Because while we're at Heyworld,
you'll be here on the ship,

343
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,874
in the temporal zone,
and you'll be safe.

344
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,031
Sara, I can't, I can't sit this one out.

345
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,629
Look, I'm not gonna lose another Legend.

346
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,110
And who said
we're not putting you to work?

347
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,637
Look, we need to make sure what happens
at Heyworld is seen globally.

348
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,839
I can use the EYES app as a backdoor
into the phones that downloaded it.

349
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,877
Thank you.

350
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,754
I found it. I found it. Ray's coin.

351
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,431
So long, then, John Boy. For now.

352
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,749
Oh, hold on a minute.

353
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,560
Our deal was for his soul,
not a bleeding coin.

354
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,234
Fine. A promise is a promise.

355
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,496
What are they doing to him in there?

356
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,749
Prepare yourself, love.

357
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,877
What's behind this door,
it won't be pretty.

358
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,518
Down here, they twist a man's soul
until he's no longer human.

359
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,056
After what they've done to the big man,
he might not even be...

360
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,515
- No!
- Ray! Ray!

361
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,395
Nora! John!

362
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,600
We're just about to start another game
of giant Jenga.

363
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,736
You gotta meet my old friend.

364
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,559
Well, technically, my new friend.
We used to be mortal enemies.

365
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,077
Oh, hi, guys.
You're just in time for the next round.

366
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,877
<i>When the world
needs heroes, they answer the call.</i>

367
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,519
We'll be at Heyworld,

368
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,991
the new adventure capital
of Eastern Maryland.

369
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,434
Where we will hit fun...

370
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,036
in the bull's-eye.

371
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,759
And we'll give your children a...

372
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,639
flash of excitement.

373
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,918
And... cut!

374
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,536
- That was good, guys.
- That was a good take.

375
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,517
- Yeah.
- That was a great take.

376
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Uh, guys, I feel like

377
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,896
that would have worked
a little bit better

378
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,559
with the real trinity.

379
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,077
Yeah, well, I asked,
and they said, "Hard pass."

380
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,776
- We should have done the crossover.
- Yeah.

381
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,272
Who needs the trinity anyway, right?
I mean, the Legends are super enough!

382
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,238
But Heyworld isn't a superhero park.

383
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,551
Promising them something
and giving them something else

384
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,472
feels wrong, doesn't it?

385
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,031
People aren't going to go to a park
filled with things they're terrified of.

386
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,080
People need franchise superheroes
to feel safe,

387
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,040
so, that's how we're gonna
get them in the door.

388
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,591
Okay, everyone,

389
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,037
let's just go around the room one by one

390
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,511
and say what talent you can contribute
to the Heyworld review.

391
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,591
Oh, Minotaur, let's start with you.

392
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,558
I hear you like guitar.

393
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,518
Don't tell her nothin', Bullface.

394
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,638
- Let us out of here.
- We can't do that, Mr. Ogre.

395
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,154
It's not safe out there.

396
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,754
Well, we ain't helping you,

397
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,311
what with you moving us around
from one prison to another.

398
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,710
So, why should we trust you?

399
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,474
Listen up, if you lot don't want
to go back to a real prison,

400
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
then this is your chance.

401
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,120
This is your chance to change the way
that humans see you.

402
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,955
Show them that
just because you look scary...

403
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,960
doesn't mean you are scary.

404
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,997
That's right, Wolfie.

405
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,879
Look, I know how infuriating
humans can be.

406
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,759
They have a hard time seeing past
their own noses, don't they?

407
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,719
But they can change.

408
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,439
If you help them to look deeper.

409
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,358
And if they see the amount of good
that you lot are capable of,

410
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,559
then maybe, maybe they'll believe in you
even when you doubt yourself.

411
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,432
Now, I know there's more to all of you
than meets the eye.

412
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,914
Like you, Ogre.

413
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,238
My name is Frederick.
But what's the point?

414
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,677
Every time I try
to show a human who I really am,

415
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,274
they run away or try to kill me.

416
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,960
And that must really hurt your feelings.

417
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,035
Yeah, it does.
All I ever wanted to do was sing.

418
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,032
It looks like
we found ourselves a double act.

419
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,839
Now, who else has a hidden talent?

420
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,111
Brilliant. Beautiful.

421
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,799
I think we've got ourselves a show.

422
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,216
Wait. What are you doing here?

423
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,311
Are you dead?
Oh, please tell me you're not dead.

424
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,000
What are you doing in that dress?
Not that I don't like it, but...

425
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Wow.

426
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Idiot!

427
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,995
What were you thinking,
selling your soul to a demon? Ray?

428
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,311
- I...
- You doomed the whole planet.

429
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,536
Look, I didn't have a choice.

430
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,600
He was going to kill Nate.

431
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,456
And it was the only way I could
make sure my best friend would be safe.

432
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,631
So, that was the deal you made.

433
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
His life for your body.

434
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,791
Oh, Raymond, you sweet,
dumb, son-of-a-softie.

435
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,951
Yeah, right? What a guy.

436
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,800
I was sent here to torture him,
but then we got to talking.

437
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,552
Oh, it got really deep, man.

438
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,676
It really did.

439
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,278
What were we even fighting about
all those years ago?

440
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,432
Your compulsion for world domination
and inability to accept rejection.

441
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Ah.

442
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,754
Translation, it was about a girl.

443
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,030
A girl? What girl?

444
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,395
Doesn't matter. We should go.

445
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,834
Wait.

446
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Something's happening.

447
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,951
I think I fulfilled Gary's wish.
Ray, take my hand. John.

448
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,998
Oh, all right. Ciao for now.

449
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,751
Say hi to the Legends for me, will you?

450
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,430
Oh, I love those groovy guys.

451
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,909
Jenga time!

452
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,560
Oh.

453
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:14,793
Almost forgot, extra hot sauce
for the Chupacabra.

454
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
What in the hell?

455
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,720
More like, out of it, mate.

456
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,395
- It worked! You got Constantine.
- All right.

457
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,915
- Okay, just be cool. Simmer down.
- Okay.

458
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Where's Ray?

459
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,480
He was just here, he...

460
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,635
Yeah, that's the only way he can travel
as long as Neron's using his body.

461
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,278
Fairy Godmother, I wish for Ray
to get his body back.

462
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,598
All magic has its limitations, you know,

463
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,320
stroke of midnight and all that,
but don't worry.

464
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,631
I'm sure the Legends have
something up their sleeves.

465
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,519
This isn't playtime, you twits.

466
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,232
Neron is using fear
to open up the gates of Hell.

467
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,576
Well, that's why we have to fight fear
with something wonderful.

468
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,520
We have to show the world

469
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,671
that these magical creatures
are just that.

470
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,680
They're magical.

471
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:03,353
And everyone else is
on board with this?

472
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,749
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Pretty much.

473
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,136
- Bloody hell.
- All right. Great.

474
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,231
Now, that you're all on board,
we have work to do.

475
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,714
There is another way.

476
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,519
Whilst in Hell, we learnt that

477
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,873
Neron's possession of Ray's body
is contingent on Nate not being killed.

478
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,829
Is that why Ne-Ray didn't strangle me
when he had the chance?

479
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah.

480
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,601
That demon is only as good as his word.

481
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,816
If Neron breaks that deal,
he'd be ejected from Ray's body.

482
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
I could kill him.

483
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,630
And once I do,

484
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,474
all the souls he's nabbed
will be released.

485
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,676
And all Neron has to do is...

486
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:42,881
me?

487
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,033
No. Absolutely not.
Look, there is no plan B.

488
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,157
Only plan A. Got it?

489
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,396
Yeah. Got it.

490
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,156
Look, I meant what I said earlier.
I am not losing another Legend.

491
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,190
So, forget what you heard back there
because we are all in on Heyworld.

492
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,030
Now, I believe in you.

493
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,190
And if I'm not mistaken,

494
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,034
someone has a theme park to build.

495
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Yeah.

496
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,114
I can't believe
it all comes down to this.

497
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,311
After years of anxiety of whether or not

498
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,279
I could live up
to my dad's expectations.

499
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,397
I'm about to
bring his crazy dream to life.

500
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,278
Knowing what it could cost me.

501
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,033
Nate, I'm not going anywhere.

502
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
You got this.

503
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Okay.

504
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,592
Let's do this.

505
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,754
I'm standing in front of Heyworld,
a new superhero-inspired theme park

506
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,878
that seems to have sprung up overnight,
like magic.

507
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,877
Welcome to Heyworld,
the happiest place on the globe.

508
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,350
Hey, kid, welcome to Heyworld.
Try the churros.

509
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,955
And not just because
the real money is in the concessions.

510
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,110
They're also delicious.

511
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,918
Z, um, you and your mom are here.

512
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,435
I see them. I mean, us.

513
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,876
All right, stream's up.
You look great, by the way.

514
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,031
Ah, thank you for noticing, I showered.

515
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,680
How's the clickety-clackety-hackety
coming along?

516
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,160
Once Ava hits record,

517
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,120
this will stream out to about,
you know, three billion people or so.

518
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
No pressure.

519
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,470
Come one, come all,
to our thrilling stage spectacular,

520
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,840
superheroes versus monsters.

521
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,116
Okay. You got the choreography down?

522
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,715
Everyone, follow her lead. Uh...

523
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,314
Oh, Baba Yaga, remember,

524
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,393
those kids are audience members,
not appetizers.

525
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,995
Mike, watch your language out there.
All right?

526
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,456
We don't want those gormless wankers

527
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,597
from standards and practices
up our you-know-whats.

528
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,150
Everyone, they're gonna love you guys.

529
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,074
All right, gang. It's showtime.

530
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,519
Ladies and gentlemen,
please don't call them heroes,

531
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,193
call them Legends.

532
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:01,278
Now, let's see what derring-do
the Legends of Tomorrow get into today.

533
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,959
And that'll teach those bad guys
that crime doesn't pay.

534
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,475
<i>Thanks for the assist, Green Arrow!</i>

535
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,438
<i>See you later, Supergirl.</i>

536
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,954
Whoa. Did you see that?

537
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,475
That's The Flash,
and he wants to hang out.

538
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,199
Should we go hang out?

539
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,200
Break a leg, guys.

540
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,189
Wait a second! Shh.

541
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,637
I think that I hear something.

542
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Monsters!

543
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,760
What do you think, White Canary?
Should we show 'em what we got?

544
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,513
Wait. Hold on.

545
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,594
What if, instead of showing 'em
what we got,

546
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,152
we ask them what they have?

547
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,276
Hmm?

548
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,949
You mean, get to know them?

549
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,240
What if, getting to know them,
we realize that we have nothing to fear?

550
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,119
Minotaur, your passion is music.

551
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,840
Why don't you show us what you got?

552
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,680
They said this was a superhero show.

553
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,558
These brats don't respect art.

554
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,509
Hey, hey, I think we're losing them.

555
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
What was that?

556
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,600
Bloody hell. I know that sound.

557
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,640
Finally, a real life dragon.

558
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,595
Oh, no, is that...

559
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Wicksty?

560
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,478
Now, this is a show!

561
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,032
You really thought you could stop us?

562
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,115
These fools you brought here
will only serve our hellish end.

563
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,272
Everyone remain calm!

564
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,398
This is all just a, a part of the show.

565
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,117
Damn it, Gary. Now, I'm powerless.

566
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,798
Enough, filling your heads
with this silly, little morality play.

567
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,511
Now, all of you will bear witness
to the birth of a new era.

568
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,790
She wants these people scared.
They'll open up the portal right here.

569
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,876
This way.

570
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,189
Go, go!

571
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,680
We gotta get that staff.

572
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,960
We gotta get these kids out of here. Go!

573
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Follow them!

574
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,237
Everybody go back inside, back inside!

575
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,520
It's all right. It's all right.

576
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,033
Burn her! Burn them all!

577
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Stop!

578
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Stop.

579
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,474
Burn the child!

580
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,279
Do it, now!

581
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,599
Kid, you gotta run.

582
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,514
Mithra, dance!

583
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
No!

584
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Tabitha!

585
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Mithra, wait.

586
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,035
Rise, my demon brethren!
The door is open!

587
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,634
Rise!

588
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,074
It's gonna take
more than a musical number to stop this.

589
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,716
Neron!

590
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,670
This fight is between me and you.

591
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,315
So, let's settle it once and for all.

592
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,749
Gladly.

593
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,680
I've already won.

594
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,320
Killing you is just a bonus.

595
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,830
You might take me, Neron,

596
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,151
but the Legends will always win.

597
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,760
What's happening?

598
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,479
Looks like the deal's off, mate.

599
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
No.

600
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,716
Nate.

601
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
No.

602
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,070
Gideon, take us to Heyworld.

603
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,470
I must advise
against that course of action.

604
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,876
The change to your future
is still in progress.

605
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,920
If you leave the Temporal Zone,
your current memories won't be safe.

606
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
You didn't...

607
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,136
I'm sorry, love.

608
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,355
It was his choice.

609
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,675
Finish it off, John.

610
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,955
Gladly.

611
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Come on, Ray.

612
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,230
Raymond Palmer,
I return your soul to your body.

613
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,797
What is happening? Where am I?

614
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm in Heyworld?

615
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,674
Everybody's here.

616
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,629
Nate. No. No.

617
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,837
- Ray. Ray.
- No, no, no.

618
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,997
- Ray, I'm so sorry.
- But, but...

619
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,479
- You can't be here.
- Come on, hey.

620
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,949
Nate, you can't be dead. Come on.

621
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,039
Okay. Hey, come on.
Come on. You can't be...

622
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,634
Bring him back to life, weasel!

623
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,313
Sure I wish I could, Rory.

624
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,074
But that requires magic
beyond my means, mate.

625
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,877
Not a bad show, if you ask me.

626
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Dad?

627
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Hello, Nate.

628
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,919
I missed you so much, Dad.

629
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,591
I haven't been far.

630
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,360
Ah...

631
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:47,353
I guess, um... I guess it sucks,

632
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,676
dying before you're ready? Huh?

633
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,558
It sure does.

634
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,296
Believe me,
I went through all the emotions.

635
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,438
I mean, uh, anger, worry, uh...

636
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,514
I had so many regrets, I almost missed
my ticket to the happy place.

637
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
What changed?

638
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,190
I had faith.

639
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,656
You're saying there's actually a...

640
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,909
In you, Nate.

641
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,232
And I was right to believe
that my boy and all his freaky buddies

642
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,834
would see this thing through.

643
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,996
But you know, the only thing missing
from that big show of yours?

644
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Music.

645
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,120
<i>There is a young cowboy</i>

646
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,920
<i>Who lives on the range</i>

647
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,872
<i>His horse and his cattle
are his only companions</i>

648
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,552
Do I have something on my face?

649
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,960
Did you just sing?

650
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,355
James Taylor?

651
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,920
I don't sing.

652
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,634
I think someone from beyond
is trying to help us out.

653
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,874
You gotta be kidding me.

654
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,591
<i>He works in the saddle</i>

655
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,280
<i>And sleeps in the canyons</i>

656
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,556
<i>Waiting for summer</i>

657
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,360
<i>His pastures to change</i>

658
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,878
<i>And as the moon rises</i>

659
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,316
<i>He sits by his fire</i>

660
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,117
<i>Thinking about women and glasses of beer</i>

661
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,356
Look.

662
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,840
<i>And closing his eyes</i>

663
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,036
Keep singing.

664
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,197
<i>As the doggies retire</i>

665
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,080
<i>He sings out a song</i>

666
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Of course.

667
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,119
If fear could be energy,

668
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,715
it only stands to reason
that love can be energy, too.

669
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,633
Everyone, you wanna see Nate
up and kicking?

670
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,673
He needs to hear your voices right now!

671
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,956
We need everyone to hold hands.

672
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,000
And we mean everyone.

673
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,753
Are we really doing this?

674
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,160
It couldn't hurt.

675
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,560
Didn't we do this last year?

676
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,393
At least we're part
of the circle this time.

677
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
<i>Deep greens and blues</i>

678
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,354
Dad, you hear that?

679
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,636
It's for you, son.

680
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,237
<i>Won't you let me go down in my dreams?</i>

681
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,789
<i>And rockabye sweet baby, James</i>

682
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,136
Oh, come on, people.

683
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,040
Do you want him to stay dead?
Come on, sing!

684
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,956
<i>Good night, you moonlight ladies</i>

685
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,919
<i>Rockabye sweet baby James</i>

686
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,116
It's working.

687
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,073
<i>Deep greens and blues
are the colors I choose</i>

688
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,800
I love you, Nate.

689
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,395
<i>Down in my dreams</i>

690
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,520
<i>And rockabye sweet baby James</i>

691
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Yes!

692
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,877
No. No, no, no.

693
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,816
You're not in the Temporal Zone.

694
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,752
We changed history,
we changed everything.

695
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,593
I couldn't let you die.

696
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,270
Dude, you just came back to life.

697
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,075
Something's wrong.

698
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,896
Uh, there's more pelvis in that hug
than usual.

699
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,752
It's all good Nate Dog.

700
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,956
Love you too, bro.

701
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,315
Yeah, my bad, Behrad.

702
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,199
It feels like...
It's like something's missing.

703
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,039
Ray. Oh, buddy.

704
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,593
I can't believe you went all the way
to Hell to stop Neron from killing me.

705
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,336
You would've
done the same thing.

706
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,158
I kinda just did.

707
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
Yeah, you did.

708
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,994
All right, Time Bros.

709
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,275
And Time Ladies.

710
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,919
And Time Monsters.

711
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,480
And Gary?

712
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,554
As I was saying,

713
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,634
Legends, our work here is done.

714
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,394
Gideon, fire up the ship.

715
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,914
It's time to hit it.

716
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,833
I'm here to make a withdrawal.

717
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Whoa.

718
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,597
These are some truly serious sinners.

719
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,275
Cut down too soon, all of them.

720
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,358
It's a real shame when someone
doesn't get to fulfill their destiny,

721
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,840
don't you think?

722
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,354
Everyone deserves a second act.
