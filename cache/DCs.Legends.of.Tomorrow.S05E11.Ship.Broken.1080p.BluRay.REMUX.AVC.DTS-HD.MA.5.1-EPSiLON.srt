1
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:11,972
- Hey.
- I have Mace, jackass.

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,641
Oh, it's you.

3
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:18,437
Listen, uh, sorry I didn't make
your thing last week.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,563
I was stuck in Hell.

5
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,565
Don't sweat it, I didn't miss you.

6
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,567
Right.

7
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:25,319
Your mom said I could have the weekend.

8
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:27,946
Maybe we could bond, do stuff.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,158
Come on, I'm trying.

10
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:37,915
All right, what is our father-daughter
weekend gonna look like?

11
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:41,752
I got tickets to the roller derby.
Should be lots of blood and cleavage.

12
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:45,380
I... I just remembered I actually
have a big history test on Monday,

13
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:47,132
so I can't. I gotta study.

14
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:50,135
Study. Mmm.

15
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,096
Very important, study. Yes.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,473
Right.

17
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,439
What's that?

18
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:04,316
- That's a time machine.
- Is this...

19
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:08,195
Can I see it?

20
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:10,030
I thought you had to study.

21
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,908
Uh, well, it could be useful
for a history test.

22
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,966
Basically, this bucket of bolts
can travel anywhere in history.

23
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,303
We can catch a show
with The Ramones or Sabbath.

24
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:36,181
- Some Lita Ford of The Runaways?
- That, too.

25
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:40,686
You know, I have been fighting so hard
to get you out of Hell

26
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:41,895
and you are finally here.

27
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,398
I bet you're the only one on this ship
who's happy to see me.

28
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:47,025
Oh, nonsense.
As far as this sorry lot are concerned,

29
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,695
as soon as anyone stops
trying to murder them on a weekly basis,

30
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:50,778
they're best friends.

31
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:53,573
Either way, I am gone
the second Charlie uses that Loom

32
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,367
- to bring my mom back.
- Yeah.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,496
What's she doing?

34
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,999
She said she wanted to get
into the right headspace, so...

35
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:03,893
- Huh.
- I totally get that.

36
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,628
There's nothing like a 20-second
meditation micro-sesh to zen out.

37
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,032
Did we miss the weaving?
I hope we didn't miss the weaving.

38
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:12,509
- Whoa! Gary, what... You have a dog?
- What?

39
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,312
We don't have dogs.
This is not a dog place.

40
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:16,346
I have a letter from my therapist.

41
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,848
We don't have therapists either.

42
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,641
Well, we should.

43
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:22,394
Going to Hell
generated a lot of anxiety.

44
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:27,232
Well, this says
this is his emotional support animal.

45
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:28,793
- It's signed and everything.
- I don't have time for this.

46
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,610
I've named him Gary Junior.

47
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:33,613
- Oh! He's made a tiny tinkle.
- Ew.

48
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:34,906
He isn't ship-broken.

49
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:38,827
Junior!

50
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,663
He's usually a very good boy.
Everyone, watch your step.

51
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:43,456
Oh!

52
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,626
Chasing tail now, are we, Gary?
That's a first.

53
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,171
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, don't...
- Ah, bollocks.

54
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,547
Gary!

55
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,717
All right, almost ready.

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,886
I think. It's been a few millennia.

57
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:58,305
Okay, so, who's gonna
get the first weave?

58
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,108
- Her mother.
- Behrad.

59
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:01,767
Behrad first, John.

60
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,602
Yeah, look, uh...

61
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:05,562
Well, I, uh...

62
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:08,023
I made a promise to Astra, love.

63
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,151
I'm with Zari.

64
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,111
Behrad.

65
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,654
Who's Behrad?

66
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:17,324
I did not come back from Hell
to take a number and wait my turn.

67
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,761
He is my brother and he's part
of the team that found the rings.

68
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:20,887
We're getting him back first.

69
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:23,246
Okay, stop, stop.
Everybody, stop arguing.

70
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,539
You're all gonna get a chance.

71
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,642
But Sara's in a coma.
Charlie's gonna weave her out first.

72
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,546
All right, enough! Come on, guys.

73
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,549
This is exactly why I should have
left the damn thing broken.

74
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:37,302
Okay, I'm gonna choose. It's Behrad.

75
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:39,513
Now, goggles on, and let's get going.

76
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:50,982
Okay.

77
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:02,327
The ring of Clotho,
the maker of threads.

78
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,037
And extremely rad dresser.

79
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,960
The ring of Lachesis,

80
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:12,170
the weaver of destinies,

81
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:14,089
and a manipulative control freak.

82
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,260
And the ring of Atropos,

83
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:19,636
the cutter of threads,

84
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,471
and a heartless psychopath.

85
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:35,170
I see Behrad's thread.

86
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:38,673
But it's a bit of a tangled mess.

87
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,550
It's probably
because of all the time travel,

88
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:41,927
but I think it'll be all right.

89
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:36,147
All right.

90
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,651
Gideon, status.

91
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:42,319
Gideon?

92
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,239
Still assessing the damage,
Ms. Sharpe.

93
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,116
Running on backup power.

94
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:51,580
I'm sorry, Z.

95
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,874
- What happened?
- It didn't work.

96
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,210
- Okay, so we try again.
- I said it didn't work.

97
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,815
I've never tried to use the Loom
without my sisters.

98
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,132
I guess I need them.

99
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,216
Then let me try it.

100
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:07,053
Lachesis said she was preparing me
to be a Fate. Maybe I can...

101
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:09,264
Yeah, go ahead if you wanna
burn up from the inside.

102
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,391
Okay, what are we supposed to do?

103
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,869
Right now, we're just gonna sit tight
and try to fix the ship.

104
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:16,438
Well, that's great.

105
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:18,982
I could do some research
back at the house,

106
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:21,276
see if there isn't another way
to harness the rings.

107
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,069
I could use another set of eyes.

108
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,031
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere
until Behrad's back.

109
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:29,784
Wait. So, I left an empire in Hell
for "sit tight,"

110
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:31,202
for "do some research"?

111
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,705
Not good enough.

112
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,668
Apologies,
but no one's going anywhere.

113
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:38,460
The energy burst
created an anti-chronotomic field.

114
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,420
Time travel functions are offline.

115
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,756
So, no Jumpships, no Time Couriers?

116
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,674
- All out of commission.
- Great.

117
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:46,051
We're stuck.

118
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,304
Why are the lights out?

119
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,514
The ship better not be broken.

120
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:53,183
Unfortunately, I am.

121
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,977
I was damaged in an explosion
caused by the Loom of Fate.

122
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:57,729
You're kidding me.

123
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,898
I promised the kid we'd time travel.

124
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,608
Now she's gonna fail her exam.

125
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,068
Nope, it's fine. I'll be okay.

126
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,362
We have to find you a room to study in.

127
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:09,616
Um, did the computer
just say "Loom of Fate"?

128
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:17,832
Things are really bad, baby.

129
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,543
Ship's broken.

130
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:25,131
The Loom backfired and almost
killed Charlie. Everybody's bickering.

131
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:29,094
The chances of getting Behrad back
have never felt more slim.

132
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,348
We could really use your vision.

133
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,518
I could really use you.

134
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:46,611
Oh, my God, Sara, you're awake.

135
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:52,492
Ava?

136
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,829
I can't see anything.

137
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:57,312
Gideon, what's wrong with her eyes?

138
00:08:57,372 --> 00:09:00,083
Unfortunately, Ms. Sharpe,
at my current power levels,

139
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,461
I am unable to offer a prognosis.
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,714
You're sorry? What are you
talking about? She's blind.

141
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:07,549
Reroute some power, Gideon.
Do something.

142
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:08,883
Ava, shh. It's okay, all right?

143
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,468
It's probably just temporary.

144
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:11,678
What if it's not? Lay back.

145
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,556
Who knows what else
is wrong with you.

146
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,026
Sara?

147
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,918
You were startled when we touched.
What happened?

148
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:45,128
Nothing.

149
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:47,797
Are you hiding something from me?

150
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,048
Always.

151
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:50,133
Come on, Sara.

152
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:53,803
Babe, it was just a weird reaction
to waking up from a coma.

153
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,074
Whoa, no, no, no, no, no. Where do you
think you're going? You can't see.

154
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:59,768
I trained in a blindfold for weeks
in the League of Assassins.

155
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,270
And nobody knows
how to fix the ship like I do.

156
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:03,813
Except for maybe Ray and Jax.

157
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:06,733
And Rip and Stein.

158
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,109
I guess Behrad's not bad either.

159
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:10,171
But you know what? None of them
are walking through that door,

160
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:11,488
so let's go.

161
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:16,201
So, what did I miss?

162
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,745
Oh, nothing much, actually. Just, uh...

163
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,371
Hey, Mick.

164
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:21,873
Hi.

165
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:25,668
Oh, uh, Lita, this is Sara Lance,
the captain.

166
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:27,921
Sara, this is Lita, my kid.

167
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,964
Oh! Uh...

168
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:31,257
Nice to meet you.

169
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,621
<i>It's really cool
that there's a woman in charge here.</i>

170
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,476
Uh, what, sorry?

171
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,354
I just said that it's really cool
that there's a woman in charge here.

172
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:47,941
- Uh-huh. Uh, yes.
- Good... Good to see you.

173
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:49,317
- Yes, it is.
- Come on.

174
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,321
What are you not telling me?

175
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,573
What are you not telling me?
There's a kid on the ship?

176
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:56,573
I...

177
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,702
And a dog? Ava?

178
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:02,497
Gary has an emotional support animal.

179
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,207
He had a signed letter.

180
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,543
- That's not a thing.
- I don't know, baby. Come here.

181
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:18,513
Is that Behrad?

182
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,432
He sounds like a pretty nice guy.
Were you two close?

183
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,980
No. But we were starting to be.

184
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:32,652
I only just learned about
this big life he was living

185
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,404
and then I lost him.

186
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,657
But I'm getting him back, so...

187
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,534
Yeah, about that.

188
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,620
I think I might have a way to do it.

189
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,415
I'm listening.

190
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,960
You know, I think I'm probably good
for my test tomorrow.

191
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,879
I'd kind of just like to
look around the ship.

192
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,089
Uh, you got to hit the books.

193
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,090
Punched him.

194
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:56,550
Elbowed him.

195
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:57,551
Ooh.

196
00:11:58,428 --> 00:11:59,971
Made out with her.

197
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,931
Okay, smart guy.

198
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,766
We're studying the French Revolution.

199
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:05,517
I've heard of it.

200
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:10,106
So, I have to compare and contrast
the American Declaration of Independence

201
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,526
and the French Declaration
of Rights of Man and Citizen.

202
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:15,528
Right.

203
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,198
So, does anybody on the ship
know history?

204
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:22,785
I know a guy.

205
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,123
Did I hear someone say the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and Citizen?

206
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,791
Hi. Dr. Nathaniel Heywood.

207
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,502
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

208
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,838
Now, while technically I am a doctor,

209
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:35,423
you can call me Professor.

210
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:38,426
Or Steel because...

211
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:41,137
I turn into it.

212
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:43,932
Whoa.

213
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:46,768
You're the coolest professor
I've ever met.

214
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:48,227
Most likely, yeah.

215
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:49,436
All right.

216
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:50,438
Let's study.

217
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:53,358
Well, we can't study
without snacks, right?

218
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,401
Gideon makes the best snacks.

219
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:56,945
Really? Can we have Ants on a Log?

220
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,071
Okay, Ants on...

221
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:01,449
Mick, can you be an absolute peach
and run to the Fabricator for us?

222
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:15,046
Now, what's happening with your sight
is a mystery, love.

223
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,548
Are you experiencing any more effects?

224
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:26,057
No, nothing.

225
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:28,410
Oh, well, we'll just have to
wait and see then.

226
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:31,437
And there is one other matter
to discuss.

227
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,356
Astra Logue is on the ship.

228
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,149
What?

229
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,442
Ava?

230
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,280
Uh, sorry, babe, but there was just
never a good time to tell you.

231
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:42,841
She was only supposed to
be here temporarily

232
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:43,926
and then the Loom didn't work.

233
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,952
She cannot be on the ship.

234
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:49,580
I mean, what if...
What if she goes on a stabbing spree?

235
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:52,250
A stabbing spree? Well, that seems
a little excessive, honey.

236
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,919
Look, she's made her choice.
She decided to throw in with us.

237
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:58,423
- Now, why would you doubt her word?
- Look, I don't know, okay? It's just...

238
00:13:58,506 --> 00:13:59,549
It's a feeling.

239
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:03,261
John, I need you by her side 24/7.

240
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:05,263
Fine.

241
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:10,309
What if Charlie just wasn't warmed up?

242
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:14,981
She tried to reweave the most
complicated thread right out the gate.

243
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:18,359
What if she tries with an easier thread?

244
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:23,489
One that hasn't been complicated
by, well, time travel.

245
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,992
Like your mother's?

246
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,535
Exactly.

247
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:31,539
If she succeeds
on an easy thread like hers,

248
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,583
she might be ready
to try Behrad's again.

249
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,586
The thing is,

250
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:38,796
if it comes from me,
they might not buy it.

251
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:41,507
But if it comes from me...

252
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,344
they just might.

253
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,601
Again, I do apologize

254
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:54,145
that the Fabricator
is not functioning, Mr. Rory.

255
00:14:56,856 --> 00:15:00,068
Oh, man. Must have been damaged
in the explosion.

256
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,864
Oh! Ants on a Log?

257
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,327
Are those for sharesies?

258
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:11,370
My kid.

259
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:12,454
Oh.

260
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,457
I see what's happening here.

261
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,292
You're new
to this whole parenting thing.

262
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,877
You know what?

263
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,839
I think you need some advice
from the Papa Gare.

264
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,551
Parenting is about doing the crap work.

265
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:26,969
No matter how degrading,

266
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,180
and never, ever once
hearing a word of thanks.

267
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:32,016
But you'll know in your heart
that they appreciate it.

268
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,477
Even if the thought
never crosses their mind.

269
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,813
Isn't that right, Gary Junior?

270
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:37,896
Oh.

271
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,775
Duty calls, as they say.

272
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:42,777
Crap work.

273
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:55,581
What is that?

274
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,212
Okay.

275
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,091
I've removed panel 16-QW45G.

276
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,217
Mmm.

277
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,345
No, I'm pretty sure I said 16-QW45T.

278
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,513
No, you said "G."

279
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,266
- No, 16...
- Okay. Yep. Finding T.

280
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:14,976
Sara?

281
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,103
Caught a case of blindness, I hear.

282
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:20,690
Yeah, and while Gideon's down,

283
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,650
I'm stuck like this,
but it's no big deal.

284
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:24,318
No big deal?

285
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:26,863
Right, you're the first mortal
to ever see a god's true form

286
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:29,323
and live to tell the tale,
and that is no big deal.

287
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:31,117
It's no big deal.

288
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,620
So nothing else
has been happening, right?

289
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:37,206
There's no other side effects?

290
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,877
Look, I know you're not
being honest with me, Sara.

291
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,211
I just wanna help.

292
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,088
What is she talking about, babe?

293
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:48,217
Look, it's nothing, okay?
I just...

294
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:51,095
I didn't wanna upset anyone.

295
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,306
What's so upsetting?

296
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:59,604
When I touch somebody,
I see people stabbed to death.

297
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,857
But it's probably
just some subconscious fear

298
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,419
that's being kicked up by the coma.
It's like a... It's a nightmare.

299
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:07,862
You've lost one kind of vision,
and you've gained another.

300
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,173
Sara, you're seeing the future.

301
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:11,741
Look, they're just nightmares, Charlie.

302
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:16,996
This can't be the future, all right?

303
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,040
- It's not possible.
- Why?

304
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,834
You're a Paragon of Destiny
who got radiated by godly light.

305
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:24,229
Why is it so impossible that you've
gained the gift of foresight?

306
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:25,880
Because we don't all die.

307
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:29,008
"We"? What do you mean, like,

308
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,552
we die in, like, 50 years,

309
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:35,097
or we die with me
wearing this exact outfit?

310
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,685
Option two.

311
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,955
- It's got to be Astra.
- Charlie.

312
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,773
Would you stop with the Astra thing?

313
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,650
She saved our lives in Hell, okay?

314
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,193
I'm not gonna just assume the worst.

315
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,111
What, that she's
some manipulative psychopath?

316
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:51,989
Well, she just tried to manipulate me
into coming in here

317
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:54,158
and begging Charlie
to use the Loom again, so...

318
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:55,534
Okay, well, that's not a crime.

319
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:56,994
Guys, the rings.

320
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,746
They're gone.

321
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,082
I found this in the trash chute.

322
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,875
Okay, that is a crime.

323
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:06,295
Gidget, play back internal monitoring
of the parlor, please.

324
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:09,548
My internal monitoring
subsystems have been disabled.

325
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:11,467
I'm afraid we have a saboteur on board.

326
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,720
Okay. Now I'm starting
to assume the worst.

327
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,145
Well, this was inevitable, wasn't it?

328
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,443
First thing that goes wrong,
and you all point the finger at me.

329
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,028
You know what, Astra? Slow your roll.

330
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,839
You wanted the rings
and now they're missing, so...

331
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,533
You're the only person
who doesn't belong on this ship.

332
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:36,867
Happily.

333
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,831
Look, I was with her the whole time,
all right? She never took the rings.

334
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:42,557
And besides, how is she supposed
to have sabotaged Gideon, eh?

335
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,666
We have no idea, John.

336
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,876
That's why she's here
and not out the airlock, okay?

337
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:48,296
- Come on, babe.
- Sorry, Astra.

338
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:50,840
You just spent too much time
with my sisters to be trusted.

339
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:56,053
I was shown more hospitality
in the deepest pits of Hell

340
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:57,263
than on this ship of fools.

341
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,223
Yeah, just sit tight, all right?

342
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,684
I got just the spell
to track this saboteur.

343
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,185
I never should have trusted you.

344
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,897
Did you really, though?

345
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,818
Or did you just run out of
other options?

346
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,909
Then there's Zari.
She's from the future.

347
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:21,412
She's supes cute,
and she can control air.

348
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,872
- What?
- Yep.

349
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,540
Ants on a Log.

350
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,626
Everybody here has a superpower.

351
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:29,003
Do you have a superpower?

352
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:31,756
I have this.

353
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,257
Your gun?

354
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,009
Uh, yes.

355
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,553
Your superpower is that you shoot a gun?

356
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,555
It shoots fire.

357
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:40,866
No, I know. I don't like any guns.

358
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,806
Why not?

359
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:45,436
I marched in protest of them.
Do you know how dangerous that thing is?

360
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,645
Well, that's the point.

361
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,856
Lita...

362
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:51,400
You know,
if it wasn't for your pops here,

363
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:53,319
we wouldn't be able
to travel through time.

364
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:54,862
Mick keeps the lights on.

365
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,280
Lights are off.

366
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:59,867
Oh, it's an unfortunate coincidence.

367
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,289
However, Mick funds this whole operation
through the simple act of stealing.

368
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,334
Oh, didn't you go to prison
for stealing?

369
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,044
Isn't that why you missed my childhood?

370
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:12,797
Damn it, Mick.

371
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:14,842
Sometimes they're just souvenirs.

372
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:20,346
Like, Mick, did you happen to steal
any French Revolution souvenirs

373
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,514
from Marie Antoinette?

374
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,642
Say yes.

375
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:27,395
Yes. Yes. Yes, I did.

376
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,647
Really? Can I see them?

377
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,981
Really?

378
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,443
Come with me.

379
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:41,158
Not bad, Nate. Not bad at all.

380
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,244
Mmm.

381
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,414
Not bad, Mick. Not bad at all.

382
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:53,295
Well?

383
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:55,047
Yeah, definitely sabotage.

384
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:56,173
Yeah, thought so.

385
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,093
Ooh. What happened here?

386
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,137
Hmm, we have a saboteur.

387
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:03,514
Hmm. I think I know who it is.

388
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:05,975
Oh, come on!

389
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,522
Oh, hello, Zari.

390
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,982
Hello, Astra.

391
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,986
Look, I'm sorry you are locked up.

392
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,613
Well, at least we have that in common.

393
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:25,161
We also both lost a relative
who we want back,

394
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:28,664
and got screwed when the Loom failed.

395
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,417
One of us
more than the other.

396
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:39,675
Okay, I know John is out there
trying to prove your innocence,

397
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,761
but we both know
how much you wanted those rings,

398
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,055
so why not just give them back?

399
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:48,851
Oh, wait. I see now.

400
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:51,312
You think you're here to interrogate me,

401
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,023
but that's not why you're really here.

402
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:56,066
No, that's literally why I'm here.

403
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,820
You're here because you've got Nate
wrapped around your finger,

404
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:03,741
and you thought you had John
wrapped around your finger, too...

405
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,535
but you don't.

406
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:09,747
What are you talking about?

407
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:13,292
When we were choosing
who to weave first,

408
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,002
he picked my mother.

409
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,297
Not Behrad.

410
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:21,342
You think you clocked something
between John and I,

411
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:24,136
and now you're using it
to manipulate me.

412
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:25,386
Wow.

413
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,388
You are devious.

414
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:28,224
So are you.

415
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:31,977
So why don't you use
that devious little brain of yours

416
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:35,272
and figure out
who really took the rings?

417
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:40,069
You think you can repair
the security cameras to find our thief?

418
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,512
Maybe, but...

419
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,282
whoever did this left a lot of damage
and not a lot of clues.

420
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:50,120
Ah, it seems we've all arrived
at the scene of the crime.

421
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,122
Well, this crime, anyway.

422
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,791
You know, we could, um...

423
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,585
We could just work together
to find our ring thief.

424
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:00,881
And how can I hope to defend Astra
by teaming up with her accusers?

425
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,841
We're all looking for the truth, John.

426
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,927
Yeah, well, some of us
can just see the situation

427
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,370
a little more clearly than others.

428
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:21,610
You okay?

429
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,238
- What's wrong?
- I...

430
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,364
It was me.

431
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,075
I kill everyone.

432
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,475
Baby,
you are an amazing assassin, okay?

433
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,209
But you're blind
and now you've warned us.

434
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,919
The idea of you killing everyone is...

435
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:40,963
Arrogant? Delusional? Just plain rude.

436
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,646
Yeah, and you're not
that kind of person.

437
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:44,883
Something is going on with me,
all right?

438
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,529
I went from seeing you all dead
to being the one responsible for it,

439
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:48,887
and I don't know why.

440
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:51,849
Look, you have to figure out
what is going on.

441
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,143
And until then,
I cannot be trusted, all right?

442
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,979
So promise me, no matter what I say,

443
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,355
you will not let me out of here.

444
00:23:58,439 --> 00:24:00,274
Okay, I promise, honey.
I love you, all right?

445
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,917
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
Just please take a breath.

446
00:24:07,448 --> 00:24:10,409
And what exactly
are we getting to the bottom of?

447
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,911
I have no idea.
She has lost her damn mind.

448
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,711
- Don't touch anything.
- Copy that.

449
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:26,841
Whoa.

450
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,099
You really like to steal.

451
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,268
Don't tell your mom. Here.

452
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,229
This belonged to the headless lady.

453
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:47,446
So, I really dig the whole
Scrooge McDuck aesthetic,

454
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,490
but why not put your money in a bank?

455
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:50,824
Bank?

456
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,326
Too easy to rob.

457
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,120
Hold on, all of your money is here?

458
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,456
What if somebody robs this?

459
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,874
Let them try.

460
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,209
What about compound interest?

461
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,920
Okay, how much money is in here?

462
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:05,923
Uh, million? Billion.

463
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,384
And in ten years,
how much is that gonna be worth?

464
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,970
The same. It's gonna be worth the same.

465
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:15,015
If you invest it,
it'll be worth way more.

466
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:16,975
Sounds complicated.

467
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,813
What if you take the time machine

468
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:24,316
back to the start of the New York
Stock Exchange and invest it all then?

469
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:28,404
We could go and buy Manhattan
in the 1600s.

470
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,072
We can invent Bitcoin.

471
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:33,909
We can become partners
in getting freaking rich.

472
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,620
What the hell?

473
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:39,498
Room's off-limits.

474
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,792
So we're finally connecting,
and you're shutting me out?

475
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,211
You're a terrible father.

476
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,675
What are you doing?

477
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,719
Looking for footage of you
stealing the rings.

478
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:53,137
It doesn't exist.

479
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,931
Besides, I thought
the cameras were sabotaged.

480
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,808
I'm hacking the backup feed.

481
00:25:58,726 --> 00:25:59,768
You hack?

482
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,603
Mmm, not so much me,

483
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,689
but a version of me that used to exist.

484
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:07,609
Do you think I could talk
to this other version of you?

485
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:08,693
Maybe she'd trust me.

486
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,071
Shush. She wouldn't.

487
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:16,076
You know, you could gain trust
the normal way by being trustworthy.

488
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,080
Well, things are getting crazy
out there. Sara just locked herself up.

489
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:22,541
Is locking someone up
her solution to everything?

490
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,710
She had a vision that she killed us all.

491
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:25,793
Oh.

492
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,713
Great. So I'm exonerated? I can go?

493
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:31,759
Mmm, no, you're staying in time-out
until we find out where these rings are.

494
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,969
Huh. Speaking of which,

495
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,096
backup feed is up.

496
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,228
Oh, my God!

497
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:44,897
Charlie, why'd you take the rings?

498
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,315
Mate, that wasn't me.

499
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,692
I mean, it was. But it wasn't.

500
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:51,195
Ooh. That does not look good for me.

501
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,494
You disabled the cameras?

502
00:26:58,577 --> 00:26:59,577
Are you two in cahoots?

503
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,246
- No.
- No, obviously not.

504
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,041
Why would I hack into footage
that incriminates myself?

505
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,542
I don't know.

506
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,964
I just destroyed the Food Fabricator.

507
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:12,674
Which makes no sense 'cause I love food.

508
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,838
And let me guess,
you don't remember that either, eh?

509
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:15,885
No.

510
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:20,556
Oh!

511
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,101
I am guessing
you also don't remember that.

512
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:25,229
I can't believe that
I flushed the Loom of Fate.

513
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,207
Well, it's all right there
in the surveillance footage

514
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:29,608
Gideon apparently records
of our bathroom.

515
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,108
Ew.

516
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,487
Well, clearly you're all the culprits,

517
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,865
which, obviously, exonerates me.

518
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,283
No. Still no.

519
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,327
Yeah, this could all be mind control.

520
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,538
You think I'm behind it?

521
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:44,665
Yeah.

522
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,422
Who's there?

523
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,596
It's Papa Gare to the rescue.

524
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,974
Damn it, Gary,
what are you doing in here?

525
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:04,285
Oh, don't worry, I'm not gonna
let you out. I'm not a crazy person.

526
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,687
No, I'm serious.
You cannot be in here, it is not safe.

527
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,731
Well, neither is solitary confinement.

528
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:12,150
Gary, what are...

529
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:14,653
- What?
- Which is why,

530
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,030
after careful consideration,
I decided...

531
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:21,201
...you need my emotional support dog
more than I do.

532
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:24,621
I mean... I guess...

533
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,291
I guess it is kind of comforting.

534
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:30,586
Just promise me you'll treat him
like the little angel he is.

535
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,129
<i>Kill him.</i>

536
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,213
Wait.

537
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,466
Who... Who said that?

538
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,303
Said what? Gary Junior, stop barking.

539
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,096
<i>Gary can't hear me.</i>

540
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,724
<i>Now, kill him.</i>

541
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,899
<i>Good girl. Now, kill them all.</i>

542
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,539
Which is why...

543
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,116
...after careful consideration,

544
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,952
I've decided you need
my emotional support dog more...

545
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:05,037
Wait, wait.

546
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,373
Oh, my God, it's the dog!

547
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,210
Your dog... Your dog is a demon,

548
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:13,771
and it's gonna tell me to kill everyone.

549
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,672
But you know what?
I am not gonna listen.

550
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,007
I'm not gonna listen, dog.

551
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,885
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't raise your voice.

552
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:23,639
Gary Junior's a very nervous pee-er.

553
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:33,106
Hey!

554
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,193
- Hey, where is everyone?
- Sara, Sara, Sara, hey, hey.

555
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,378
Oh, bollocks. How did you escape?

556
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,029
Hey, look, I figured it out.

557
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:42,491
It's Gary's dog.
He's gonna make me kill everyone.

558
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:43,951
Okay, babe, just calm down.

559
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:45,845
You told us not to listen
to anything you say. The dog?

560
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:46,971
Look, I know, but just listen.

561
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,973
I can prove to you
that I am telling the truth, all right?

562
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,750
I had a vision that I killed Gary,

563
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,585
and then, in real-time, I saved him.

564
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:57,631
And the fact that he is alive right now
proves that I am not lying.

565
00:29:58,215 --> 00:29:59,776
You were right
to lock yourself up, love.

566
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,802
Listen, I know that I sound crazy,

567
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:05,180
but you just take me to that dog
and you will see that I am not.

568
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,440
Gary, where is Gary Junior?

569
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,150
No idea.

570
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:19,861
He ran off shortly
after she screamed at him.

571
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,738
What? I was saving your life.

572
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,240
- From who?
- From me!

573
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,825
Okay, enough.

574
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,910
John, stay with Sara.
Gary, let's go find the dog.

575
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:29,579
Yes. Teaming up like old times.

576
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:32,082
Ew. Whoa. Gross. Can you wash
your hands first, please?

577
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:34,793
Okay.

578
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,047
Hmm, that's weird.

579
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,509
What the hell
is Gary Junior doing there?

580
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,469
Wait, go back to the other footage.

581
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,141
There. Zoom out.

582
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,526
Look, he's there every bloody time.

583
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,027
Oh.

584
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,238
Junior, here, boy.

585
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,825
Where are you?

586
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,345
He's not ship-broken,
he doesn't come when called.

587
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,121
Where the hell did you get him?

588
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,414
I don't wanna say.

589
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:15,375
Gary, my girlfriend's gone crazy,
and I'm looking for a dog to prove it.

590
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,710
I am beyond mad.

591
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:18,670
- Fine.
- Hmm.

592
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:20,505
I rescued him.

593
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:21,589
Oh.

594
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:23,550
From Hell.

595
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,427
You adopted a Hell Hound?

596
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,821
Well, when you say it like that...

597
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,890
I saw him when we got Astra.
He was all alone, I felt bad for him.

598
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,475
Oh, my God.

599
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,810
Sara was right.
This dog is making us go crazy.

600
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,187
This is absurd.

601
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,814
This is more absurd than
that StabCast I did on the Son of Sam.

602
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,150
Uh, wait, uh...

603
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:43,528
What does "Son of Sam" mean? 'Cause I...

604
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:47,491
I feel like Gary Junior
kept saying that to me in his barks.

605
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:50,303
What? No. It was a guy in the '70s
in New York. He killed a bunch of people

606
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,454
and later said
that a dog made him do it. Oh, my God!

607
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:56,458
You adopted Son of Sam's demon dog.

608
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,335
Oh, my God.

609
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,379
At least I didn't buy from a breeder.

610
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,013
Whatever he says, don't listen to him.

611
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,099
All I hear is annoying barking.

612
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,101
All I hear is
why I should murder you all.

613
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,853
And he's making some very good points.

614
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:20,440
- Nate.
- Nate.

615
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:22,192
Nate... No.

616
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,275
Whoa.

617
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,653
Hey, hey, hey!

618
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:30,325
Was I trying to murder you
with the stool?

619
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,701
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

620
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,454
I am so sorry, guys.

621
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:36,248
What the hell are you doing?

622
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,291
It's a whistle only dogs can hear.

623
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:40,627
Why are you doing this to us?

624
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,379
<i>Because I hate hats.</i>

625
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,047
<i>I hate stupid ties.</i>

626
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,549
<i>And I hate Gary.</i>

627
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,969
But I rescued you from Hell.

628
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,095
From Hell?

629
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:53,014
Wait, are you working
for my sisters?

630
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:57,561
<i>Uh, no, sweetheart.
I'm the Canine of Chaos.</i>

631
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,312
<i>I was gonna have you
murder each other,</i>

632
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:03,817
<i>but now I'm gonna kill you myself.</i>

633
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,323
Whoa.

634
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:12,552
Get to the dais.

635
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,176
Don't let me out now!

636
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,377
Where'd he go?

637
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:25,088
What's that?

638
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:38,351
Yeah, it looks like
we owe you an apology, love.

639
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:39,895
Wait, that was Junior?

640
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:42,689
Let's just say
Gary has some explaining to do.

641
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:46,818
Come on, let's go stop this bloody thing
before it kills someone.

642
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,407
Gary, your hand's on my...
Just move it.

643
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,450
Sorry.

644
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:55,119
- Ow, Gary, that hurts.
- Sorry.

645
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:58,121
Gary, your hand is still on my...

646
00:33:58,205 --> 00:33:59,664
No, I think that's me.

647
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:01,625
You can leave it if you're comfortable.

648
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,227
- It's... It really doesn't bother me.
- Can I put my hand back?

649
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:04,878
- Man, shut up, Gary!
- No.

650
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:08,423
Why are you all acting like I brought
the Son of Sam's dog here on purpose?

651
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:09,859
- That's who that demon is?
- Yeah.

652
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,928
- Let me out. I will get rid of him.
- How?

653
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,597
- You still don't trust me, do you?
- No.

654
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,140
Ava, just let her out.

655
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:18,326
If we'd listened to her
in the first place,

656
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,727
we wouldn't be in this
hot, uncomfortable mess.

657
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,395
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

658
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,272
Astra, I...

659
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:30,570
Uh, yeah. Hey, I think you accidentally
put the force field back up.

660
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:33,240
I think she knows.

661
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:36,533
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

662
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,162
Oh, come on!
You gotta be kidding!

663
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:43,250
You really shouldn't mess with someone
so comfortable with torture.

664
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:51,174
Lita. Open the door.

665
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:52,676
Go away, Becky.

666
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,887
I know what it's like
to be mad at your parents.

667
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,389
I lit mine on fire.

668
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,934
But... Let's talk about it.

669
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,645
We have nothing to talk about.

670
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,238
This is taking too damn long.

671
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:15,174
- We have to find that dog.
- Yeah, don't I know it?

672
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:17,867
And I could really use
another set of eyes. No offense.

673
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:21,997
Wait, wait, wait. What if we can use
my vision to search the ship?

674
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,832
- Yeah?
- Give me your hand.

675
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,883
Is it working?

676
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,927
- We have to get to the library.
- Come on.

677
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,223
Come on, open the door.

678
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,110
Lita!

679
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:01,244
Get away from her, you mangy mutt!

680
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,795
You idiot. I was born from fire.

681
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:32,025
What did you do?

682
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,860
I told it to attack me.

683
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:35,463
But at least I've got you
to protect me.

684
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,030
John, I'm blind.

685
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,323
But you're not deaf.

686
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:51,044
Now what?

687
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:53,441
To send the demon to Hell,
I need to know its true name.

688
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,840
Well, I'm pretty sure
it's not Gary Junior.

689
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,759
His name is Marchosias.

690
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:00,678
Astra, you dick!

691
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:13,358
No!

692
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:26,079
All right,
that should do it, Gideon.

693
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:27,455
We back online?

694
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,876
I'm happy to report
all functions are restored.

695
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:34,546
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh. You smell that?

696
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:35,839
- What...
- Ugh.

697
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,108
Gideon, what is that smell?

698
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,193
Gideon, did something die
in your ventilation system?

699
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:40,885
No. It's me.

700
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:45,306
I had to scour every inch
of the waste disposal unit,

701
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,766
but I found the rings.

702
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,766
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

703
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:48,767
Just... Just hold on.

704
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:50,937
Ugh.

705
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,272
Thanks, Gary.

706
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,357
Yeah, getting the rings was tough,

707
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:57,902
but fair punishment
for letting a Hell Hound onto the ship.

708
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:01,489
It's all right. All is forgiven.
You were obviously mind-controlled.

709
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,659
- I wasn't.
- Huh?

710
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:06,661
I just thought he was really cute.

711
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,788
- Of course you did.
- Yeah.

712
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:13,126
Well, this has been
very traumatic for me,

713
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:16,588
so, um, once the Time Couriers
came back online,

714
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,048
I, uh, got myself another
emotional support animal.

715
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,467
- You what? What?
- Oh, come on.

716
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,887
- What is it?
- It's a wittle wabbit.

717
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,764
- Oh! Babe, it's actually really cute.
- What?

718
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:29,767
I've named him Gary Junior Il.

719
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:32,037
Please tell me he's not from Hell,
though, because I'm gonna have to...

720
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,771
No, no, I wouldn't
make that mistake again.

721
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:36,024
- Okay.
- No, I got this wittle guy

722
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:37,942
from a mysterious carnie

723
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:40,612
who warned me
never to feed him past midnight.

724
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:49,329
Is one of those for me?

725
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,164
No. You're too young.

726
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:53,374
Oh, so, now you obey the law?

727
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:55,668
Never.

728
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:04,511
You're my kid, my responsibility,

729
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:06,471
and I only want what's best for you.

730
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:10,141
I was a little harsh before.

731
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,310
It's okay. You saved my life.

732
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:15,438
It's... It's no excuse. Let me explain.

733
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,399
Ah.

734
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,154
"The life of a criminal
is a life of misery.

735
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:27,200
I've spent years in jail
thanks to some red leather freak

736
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:30,078
- so fast that I couldn't..."
- It's okay, it's okay. I get it.

737
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,497
You just don't want me
to suffer in the ways that you have.

738
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,543
Should I, um, stop reading?

739
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:39,796
We have a common interest,

740
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,756
and I thought we could bond over it.

741
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,550
But I understand why we shouldn't.

742
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:48,638
Right. I'll, uh, take you home.

743
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:50,974
Why? I thought we were
spending the weekend together.

744
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:52,892
You wanna stay?

745
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:56,312
Yeah. Today wasn't so bad...

746
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:58,856
Dad.

747
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:01,483
Hmm.

748
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:05,697
- Roller derby tomorrow?
- No, absolutely not.

749
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,365
- The mall?
- Definitely no.

750
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,917
I see you're
making yourself comfortable.

751
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:21,170
You looking for John?

752
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:25,008
No. I am looking for you.

753
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,385
Why?

754
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:29,345
We're not friends.

755
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:32,724
I only saved your entire team
because it helped me.

756
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:36,436
And I only told Ava to let you out
because it helped us.

757
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:39,647
So we're even. We're the same.

758
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:44,110
No, girl, you released
Encores onto the world

759
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:45,862
just to get your own way.

760
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:47,822
So we're not even.

761
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:50,199
We'll keep using each other
till it stops suiting us.

762
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:52,118
I am comfortable with that.

763
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:55,747
Well, I'm not.

764
00:40:57,206 --> 00:41:00,084
I don't know, let's see
if we can be more than that.

765
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:04,547
Come on, let me show you around
this weirdo ship.

766
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,049
I'm good.

767
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:08,343
Not planning on staying long.

768
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:12,263
But you get points for trying.

769
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,225
Okay.

770
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:26,778
So, I was thinking maybe later
we could try...

771
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,237
Try blindfolding you?

772
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,798
Stop reading my mind
or it's gonna get...

773
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:31,908
- Awesome?
- Oh.

774
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,618
Okay, let's just fix you up.

775
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:35,370
Come on, baby.

776
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:42,377
Okay, Gideon, do your thing.

777
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:47,590
Scan complete.

778
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:51,219
I do not detect any abnormalities
in Captain Lance's ocular region.

779
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:53,304
What do you mean, no abnormalities?

780
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:55,807
- Gideon, she's still blind.
- I'm sorry,

781
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,518
but there's nothing I can do.
