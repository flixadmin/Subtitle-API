1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,446
<i>Previously on Gotham:</i>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,331
- Unh.
- Guys call him The Ogre.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,530
He's a serial killer.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,728
Whoever did this, he's a monster.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,726
- The blood of his next victim is on my hands.
- If you don't drop it, that blood could be Lee's.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,924
The Ogre retaliates against any cop
who investigates him...

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,605
kills the people they love.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
- The man who stabbed Alfred, he's in Gotham.
- And you need my help to find him.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,645
Who sent you?

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,047
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
you're onto him?

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,566
Hey.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,770
You look far from home.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,209
Get away from him.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,841
Or what?

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,163
Whatever.

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,406
Come on.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,122
- Did you go back?
- Yeah. The cops are there.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,885
And?

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,611
And? What do you think?

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,241
He fell out of a five-story window.
He's dead.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,441
Why did you do it?

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,924
He told us what we wanted,
about Bunderslaw. You didn't have to...

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,805
I did. The moment we left,
he was gonna tell his boss!

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,128
Who works for you, by the way.

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,650
He's the one who tried to kill me,
who tried to kill your butler...

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,322
who probably killed your parents.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,451
I saved your life.

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,008
Besides, you wanted to do it too,
you just didn't have the guts.

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,083
- Wait...
- Just go home.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,360
We have to find out who Bunderslaw is,
what we wants.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,640
You mean, you do.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,530
You really think this is over?

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,762
He's gonna come after us.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,241
So, what's next? Hm?

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,806
- His safe.
- What?

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,731
Every senior executive at Wayne Enterprises
has a safe.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,726
Any secrets Bunderslaw has,
that's where they'll be.

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,400
- Key or combination?
- Key.

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,761
My dad had one.

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,882
He'll probably keep it on him, then.

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,085
Figure out a way to get me close,
and I'll steal it.

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,408
- Can you do that?
- I think so.

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,965
And what happened tonight...

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,766
you tell no one.

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,088
Not your buddy, Detective Gordon.

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,203
Not your butler.

47
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,160
No one.

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,683
Punctures on test subject are consistent
with those on the victim...

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,486
indicating the killer was right-handed.

50
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,403
Yum.

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,847
Where's Thompkins?

52
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,640
Detective Gordon, Dr. Thompkins said
I was free to use this room.

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,845
- She's nice, not like the old medical examiner...
- Ed, just tell me where she is.

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,326
No riddles.

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,881
Home. She went home.

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,686
Hope you find her.

57
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,561
Jim?

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,322
Jim, is that you?

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,122
You're lucky I don't skin you.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,570
Go on.

61
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,729
- All right, slow down.
- Lee, please.

62
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,967
Start over.

63
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,607
This case you caught, the dead woman,
she was murdered by a serial killer?

64
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,531
Yes. He's killed a dozen women, maybe more.

65
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,886
- And Loeb gave you this on purpose?
- He wants to hurt me.

66
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,044
And how am I in danger?

67
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,051
He murders the loved ones
of any cop who investigates him.

68
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,567
That's how he's been
able to get away with it so far.

69
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,324
Anyone who comes after him...

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,320
he's killed someone they love,
and the investigation's been buried.

71
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,763
Bullock knows a cop
who came home and found his wife.

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,085
Her throat had been cut.

73
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,569
Oh.

74
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,127
That's why Loeb gave me the case.

75
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,721
Either I give up like everyone else...

76
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,366
and live knowing I
let a killer go free...

77
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,160
or I keep going...

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,168
and someone I love is killed.

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,970
- You're not giving up, are you?
- I can't.

80
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,491
That's why I need you
to get out of Gotham right now.

81
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,843
Tonight.

82
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,207
No.

83
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,689
You wanna protect me? Find him.

84
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,122
I'm gonna stay here and do my job.

85
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,127
But I do like that you think of me
as a loved one.

86
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,124
I do.

87
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,369
Love you.

88
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,043
It only took a serial killer
to get you to say that.

89
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,041
- Thanks.
- No problem.

90
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,165
Hi.

91
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,244
This is it.

92
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,926
Home sweet, you know?

93
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,485
This is a great space.

94
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,128
Selina.

95
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,043
- Hm. Sort of a roommate.
- Hm.

96
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,368
She comes and goes.

97
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,802
- Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball.
- Hm.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,281
Didn't you know I'm a member of society?

99
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,202
I go every year,
get my picture taken in a pretty dress.

100
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,325
Smile.

101
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,402
Aren't you scared of my being here?

102
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,882
Should I be?

103
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,844
Are you dangerous?

104
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,361
I don't know.
Is your boyfriend gonna come home?

105
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,406
I never said I had a boyfriend.

106
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,286
I assumed a woman as beautiful as you...

107
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,005
You assumed I had a boyfriend...

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,091
and you assumed I would be
the kind of woman who would cheat on him.

109
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,520
Well, I'm not.

110
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,366
And I don't have a boyfriend.

111
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,087
And if a bus hit me tomorrow...

112
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,203
no one would care.

113
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,091
- That change things?
- Yes, actually, it does.

114
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,600
Make it more illicit?

115
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,130
Or would there be less chance of us
getting attached one night and done?

116
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,086
Only that would happen anyway,
because once you saw the real me...

117
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,603
you would run screaming,
like everyone else.

118
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,690
I have to say,
you're not who I imagined you would be.

119
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,969
Surprise.

120
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,970
You can let yourself out.

121
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,648
<i>Love,</i> love

122
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,244
<i>Love</i>

123
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,569
But you promised to dance with me.

124
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,287
And I will. But first, I have
to finish with that gentleman.

125
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,481
Who knew running a nightclub
was so much work?

126
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,645
My poor darling.

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,243
<i>But the soul is not deceived</i>

128
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,481
<i>In this world...</i>

129
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,324
As I was saying...

130
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,802
you and your crew are the best
gun and knifemen in the city.

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,685
Your hit on Councilman Klien...

132
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,370
a thing of beauty.

133
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,807
- I'm a fan.
- Cheers.

134
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,680
What do you want?

135
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,680
For you to help me kill Don Maroni
and all of his lieutenants.

136
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,162
You're having a laugh.

137
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,648
I'm fairly certain I'm not.

138
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,842
And Falcone's good with this?

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,401
He will be when it's done.

140
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,445
Thank you. No thank you.

141
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,404
So you like being number two.

142
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,440
Falcone gives Victor Zsasz first dibs
on every new contract.

143
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,051
You bring him the bullet-riddled corpse
of his enemy and all of that will change.

144
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,209
This is your chance to move up.

145
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,404
You're a mad fellow, aren't you?

146
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,050
Fair enough.

147
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,441
Come by the bar tomorrow...

148
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,846
we'll talk details.

149
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,927
- What's this about, Harvey?
- Have a seat.

150
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,441
This is my partner, Jim Gordon.

151
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,244
Detective, eight years ago...

152
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,922
you investigated the murder
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

153
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.
- It was The Ogre.

154
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,649
Julie Kemble was his first victim.

155
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,564
But you dropped the investigation...

156
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,371
and because of that,
11 more women have been murdered.

157
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,240
- Seriously, guys, you know...
- Stop.

158
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,923
We also know The Ogre kills the loved ones
of the cops that hunt him down.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,445
That pattern started with you.

160
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,686
We think you found something
that spooked him.

161
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,006
Your notes from the investigation.

162
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,081
The last page,
something's been scratched out.

163
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,691
I wanna know what.

164
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,684
He killed my wife.

165
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,442
I still got a daughter, Harvey.

166
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,124
Beth Tudor.

167
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,964
Katherine Wood.

168
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,607
Jessica Parker.

169
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,125
Eleven women.

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,041
Each one was someone's daughter.

171
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,930
It has to stop.

172
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,011
Yeah. I was doing background
on the dead girl.

173
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,285
Someone told me she was a nurse
for a private medical clinic uptown.

174
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,281
It's on Grant and 80th,
some cosmetic place.

175
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,490
We'll put cops on your daughter
until this is done.

176
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,491
- So you forgive me?
- Mm.

177
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,088
<i>- I'll</i> see you tonight.
- Mm-hm.

178
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,086
- How's it hanging, Riddle Man?
- Uh, it's hanging...

179
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,924
fine.

180
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,842
Mr. Nygma, did you need something?

181
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,691
Oh, yes. Uh...

182
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,209
Detective Gordon wanted me to go through
the forensic evidence of these old murders.

183
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,200
Are those bruises?

184
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,169
Uh...

185
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,845
Did Officer Dougherty do that?

186
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,210
Um, he was upset, and he didn't mean to.
I said some things I shouldn't have.

187
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,603
- Miss Kringle, this is not right. He can't just...
- Mr. Nygma.

188
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,642
It is none of your concern.

189
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,327
Now, I need to get started
on these files, so...

190
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,131
Alfred. Should you be up?

191
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,722
Thank you, Master Bruce.
I feel... I feel much better.

192
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,411
Can I get you anything?

193
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,487
Yes, actually. I've decided to attend
the Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball tonight.

194
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,684
All the senior management will be there.

195
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,571
People should see that a Wayne
is still the head of the company.

196
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,603
I shall set your tux out for you.

197
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,324
- Alfred.
- Yes, Master Bruce?

198
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,121
When you were in the army...

199
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,286
you had to kill people, right?

200
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,366
Yes. Yes, I did.

201
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,283
And it was necessary?

202
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,129
I see. So you overheard the conversation that
Reggie and I had that was best left unsaid.

203
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,851
But in answer to your question, yes.

204
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,082
Yes, it was necessary.

205
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,965
Now, if you'll excuse me, I better find
my good cuff links if we're stepping out.

206
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,601
No, but you're still recovering.

207
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,930
What, I'm supposed to let you walk
into that nest of vipers?

208
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,886
There'll be hundreds of people there,
Alfred. I won't be in any danger.

209
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,130
- So you say, but you're not gonna go alone.
- I won't be alone.

210
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,962
I've invited Selina Kyle.

211
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,168
Selina Kyle?

212
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,085
To the Wayne Enterprises Ball?

213
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,564
I see.

214
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,606
What do you see?

215
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,644
Nothing. I mean, you know,
you're a healthy young lad...

216
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,486
and she's a pretty girl with a penchant
of wearing too much leather...

217
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,445
- Alfred, it's not like that.
- Then what's it like?

218
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,603
Well, What if it is, huh?

219
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,171
What's wrong with that?

220
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,442
Absolutely nothing.

221
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,643
So I will wait in the car outside
so you don't feel my watchful eye.

222
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,764
But I will be close by if the need's be.

223
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,842
That is the deal.

224
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,691
Fine.

225
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,801
Could you call around and send some
dresses and shoes to where she's staying?

226
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,208
This is the address.

227
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,124
It's a charity ball, Alfred.

228
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,290
I'll be fine.

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,889
Freaky, huh?

230
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,686
I wonder how they recognize
themselves after.

231
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,964
Doc Thompkins is fine.

232
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,327
No one's gonna touch her at the precinct.
Relax.

233
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,245
You do understand
it's because of me that she's in danger?

234
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,130
Anything that happens is my fault.

235
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,722
You can't hold yourself responsible
for the actions of a psychopath.

236
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,689
Sure I can.

237
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,123
Detectives. I'm Dr. Cushman.
How can I help you?

238
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,682
We're looking into the murder
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

239
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,805
- She worked here about eight years ago.
- Of course. Terrible thing.

240
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,804
Julie was a talented nurse.

241
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,486
But she'd only just started here
when it happened.

242
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,887
She'd been recommended
by one of our patients.

243
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,369
- Patient's name?
- I'm afraid I can't give you that.

244
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,891
Confidentiality.

245
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,241
Really?

246
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,528
You're gonna make us get a warrant?

247
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,320
Yes.

248
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,609
"I specialize in fake boobs,
but I got ethics, I need a warrant."

249
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,684
We'll talk to Judge Harkness. I'm sure...

250
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,206
That car was in front of the precinct.

251
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,001
Jim, wait up.

252
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,243
- You sure about this?
- It was him.

253
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,329
- You saw his face?
- No.

254
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,643
I should've been looking for a tail.
It's obvious he tracks our investigations.

255
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,884
Called in a description of the car
and a partial plate.

256
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,645
So, what's the next move?

257
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,645
Gordon. You got a call, says it's urgent.

258
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,729
- Gordon.
- Detective.

259
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,321
I didn't get to say hello
properly in the alley.

260
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,562
<i>- Listen to me.
- Don't bother tracing this.</i>

261
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,367
I'm giving you one chance
to turn yourself in.

262
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,643
You make me come after you
and I will put you down.

263
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,770
Something tells me
you've begun to buy your own press.

264
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,011
The hero cop who's gonna clean up Gotham.
The rising star of the G.C.P.D.

265
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,244
<i>- I'll</i> stop you, that's for damn sure.
- No, detective, you won't.

266
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,841
Keep on, and I will kill someone you love.

267
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,287
This is your only warning.

268
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,084
Oh, no. Tell me that wasn't him.

269
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,611
He's used to intimidating cops.
We have to show him we're not afraid.

270
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,803
And how do we do that?

271
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,010
- You're okay with this, you're sure?
- Yes.

272
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,885
It's the right thing to do.

273
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,726
I called you here today...

274
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,284
because the people of Gotham deserve to know
that there's a serial killer in their midst.

275
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,804
For years, he's killed with impunity...

276
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,402
aided by a culture of silence and fear
among the police.

277
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,130
That ends now.

278
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,002
We'll be providing the names and photos
of all of the victims.

279
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,004
Please call with any information.

280
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,686
And to the man
who committed these horrific crimes...

281
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,731
<i>your days of hiding are over.</i>

282
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,642
<i>I'm coming after you...</i>

283
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,808
<i>and I'm not gonna stop.</i>

284
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,200
What are those for?

285
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,164
The Wayne Charity Ball.

286
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,241
It's boring but good for
the gallery's business.

287
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,880
Well, I'll probably see you there.

288
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,491
What?

289
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,205
I'm going with Bruce Wayne.

290
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,046
Wait, what?

291
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,969
- Delivery for Selina Kyle.
- Oh.

292
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,600
Uh, over there.

293
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,967
Thank you. Enjoy.

294
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,607
Am I really supposed to wear these?

295
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,602
Okay. We have a lot of work to do.

296
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,923
Got it. That was the doctor.
Harkness sent over the warrant.

297
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,920
The dead girl came to the clinic
by way of a Miss Constance Van Groot.

298
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,046
Van Groot? That's one of Gotham's
oldest families. Shipping.

299
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,449
We thought The Ogre might be rich.
Could be the old lady had a son.

300
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,968
- You got an address?
- Right here.

301
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,603
<i>You're the cream in my coffee</i>

302
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,644
Well, Butch,
Connor and his crew are on board.

303
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,121
- They hate Maroni even more than I...
- Shut up.

304
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,245
Maroni and his crew are here.

305
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,287
- I couldn't turn them away.
- Of course. No matter...

306
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,244
No. She was already here.

307
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,169
Is that my buddy Oswald?

308
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,849
- Come here.
- Oh, Oswald.

309
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,767
<i>You will always be my necessity</i>

310
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,445
<i>I'd be lost without you</i>

311
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,171
There he is.

312
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,684
Mother, what are you doing?

313
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,482
- I am having a drink with Mister...
- Ah, ah, ah.

314
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,682
I told you. Sal.

315
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,921
With Sal.

316
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,441
- But we shouldn't impose any longer...
- Ah, ah, ah.

317
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,044
- You're not taking my Gertrud.
- Oh, his Gertrud. Heh-heh-heh.

318
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,009
Sit. Join us.

319
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,362
Oswald, sit.

320
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,808
Sit, Oswald.

321
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,891
Hello.

322
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,201
I'm Bruce Wayne.

323
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,169
- Barbara Kean.
- Oh.

324
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,561
Selina never said
you're who she's staying with.

325
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,210
Detective Gordon spoke of you.

326
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,641
Well, Selina can be a little guarded.

327
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,563
- Yes, I know.
- Stop talking about me.

328
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,163
Selina...

329
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,411
You look very nice.

330
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,242
The shoes hurt.

331
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,844
Have fun. Look for me at the ball.

332
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,008
It was nice meeting you.

333
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,564
Think she's here?

334
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,607
Miss Van Groot?

335
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,127
I need to say this is not exactly legal.

336
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,522
We're running out of time.

337
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,684
Over here.

338
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,371
He's good.

339
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,245
Call it in.
I'm gonna go check the rest of the house.

340
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,805
He told me...

341
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,281
but I was too slow.

342
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,086
Hello?

343
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,802
Miss Van Groot?

344
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,086
I'm a police officer.

345
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,002
Miss Van Groot?

346
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,847
Oh.

347
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,850
Gordon!

348
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,003
Jim!

349
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,523
Jim Gordon...

350
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,081
Constance Van Groot.

351
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,281
Everyone's staring at us.

352
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,769
Well, I am Bruce Wayne.

353
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,210
Well, I am.

354
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,404
I don't see Bunderslaw anywhere.

355
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,210
He's probably not coming.

356
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,641
But he's on the guest list.

357
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,286
Just keep dancing.

358
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,289
And smile, maybe.

359
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,684
Name's Jacob Skolimski.

360
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,129
He's not talking, but near as we can tell
he was the old lady's butler.

361
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,846
You think The Ogre's this guy's son,
not the dead woman's?

362
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,566
<i>Yeah. Coroner said the old bird's
been dead for years.</i>

363
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,286
My guess, Ogre killed her,
daddy pretends she's alive...

364
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,683
so his crazy serial killer son
can keep living off her money.

365
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,041
He tried to kill himself.

366
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,050
He knew you were closing in.
He has to be in contact with his son.

367
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,084
Yeah. Listen, Gordon's running pretty hot
on this one, cap.

368
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,851
Can you blame him?
Thinks Thompkins is the next victim.

369
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,441
<i>Still, watch him.</i>

370
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,880
Alvarez called.

371
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,449
Nothing on the son in the system.

372
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,768
We have to make him talk.

373
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,963
Make this simple.
Give us your son's name and address.

374
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,531
Or what?

375
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,809
I'm not afraid of you.

376
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,843
Only because you don't know me.

377
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,927
Listen, I get wanting to protect your son.

378
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,011
But how many more women will he have to kill
before you realize he needs to be locked up?

379
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,964
What are you talking about?

380
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,609
Don't play dumb with me. You were hiding
a rotting corpse upstairs for years...

381
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,325
but no, no, my son's an angel.

382
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,325
He didn't murder close to a dozen women
that we know of.

383
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,645
My son, he made one mistake. One.

384
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,081
Anything else is lies.

385
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,129
So tell us the truth.

386
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,923
Selina, what happened last night...

387
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,881
can't happen again.
- I didn't have a choice.

388
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,411
I don't accept that.

389
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,727
I knew you wouldn't be able to handle it.

390
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,890
You're right.

391
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,050
- I did wanna kill him.
- Keep your voice down.

392
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,045
But there's a line, Selina.
You can say I don't have guts...

393
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,689
but the fact is I will never cross it.
- I guess that's where we're different, then.

394
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,608
Because if I had to do it again, I would.

395
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,607
And it wouldn't bother me one bit.

396
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,726
That's Bunderslaw.

397
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,729
- Riddle Man.
- Officer Daugherty, a word.

398
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,531
I can start a war or end one.

399
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,564
I can give you the strength of heroes
or leave you powerless.

400
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,482
I might be snared with a glance,
but no force can compel me to stay.

401
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,890
What am I?

402
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,450
- You got me.
- Love.

403
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,130
Miss Kringle has given hers to you,
and in return you hurt her.

404
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,969
- I saw the bruises.
- And?

405
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,409
And you cannot do that.

406
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,120
- The next time you do that, I'll...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

407
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,441
Calm down. You'll give
yourself a girly fit.

408
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,929
Have you ever been with a woman?

409
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,924
Didn't think so.

410
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,841
They need a firm hand.

411
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,161
That goes double for Kringle.
The girl's got a tongue.

412
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,246
I won't let you hurt her.

413
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,483
Oh, yeah?

414
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,489
What are you gonna do?

415
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,443
That's what I thought.

416
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,520
Later, Riddle Man.

417
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,442
Care to dance?

418
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,601
- You.
- Me.

419
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,166
It was not a place for a boy to grow up.

420
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,650
Miss Van Groot kept herself sealed off
from the world...

421
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,844
but she doted on my son.

422
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,491
Treated him as her own.

423
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,088
Still, l... I didn't
realize how deep it went.

424
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,329
This kid's mom was out of the picture,
so he started thinking...

425
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,528
he was this Van Groot
woman's secret son.

426
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,601
I tried to tell him it wasn't true,
but he had built this fantasy...

427
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,365
and Miss Van Groot led him on.

428
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,848
She was deranged. Cruel, even.

429
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,684
So about 1O years ago, he confronts her.

430
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,204
He demands that she acknowledge him, give
him her last name, put him in the will.

431
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,805
She laughs at him.

432
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,083
Said it was all just a big joke.
So he kills her.

433
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,648
His dad feels guilty,
helps him cover it up.

434
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,366
So the old woman rejects him,
he kills her, bang.

435
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,285
You got a serial killer
with a mommy-didn't-love-me complex.

436
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,970
But there's a wrinkle.

437
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,521
I don't know where my son is.

438
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,366
He called today,
told me the police would be coming.

439
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,565
But I haven't seen him
since the day he killed Miss Van Groot.

440
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,282
My son is not a bad man.

441
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,171
Your son has been seducing and
killing women for almost a decade.

442
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,890
Why is he laughing?

443
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,129
My son? Seducing women?

444
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,685
Let me show you my son. Two pictures.
That's all I managed to save.

445
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,766
You've heard
"a face only a mother could love"?

446
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,570
Well, his mother couldn't.

447
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,728
She left us after he was born.

448
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,122
Oh, yes. My son...

449
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,243
the seducer.

450
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,445
It makes sense he scratched his
face out of those pictures.

451
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,648
But that means this can't be The Ogre.

452
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,410
We're chasing the wrong guy.

453
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,846
Jim had an idea.

454
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,202
Judge Harkness' warrant was very specific.

455
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,607
- I don't have to say anything.
- Then nod.

456
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,087
Did you operate on this man?

457
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,404
I need to know what he looks like now,
or the next woman he kills will be on you.

458
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,128
Never, never would he play
with other children.

459
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,650
He knew even then he was too good for them.

460
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,249
And now he is a respectable
man of business...

461
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,721
my Oswald.

462
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,605
Well, this has been a delight.

463
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,320
But it's late.

464
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,324
One thing...

465
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,925
Gertrud, my love.

466
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,970
- Oh.
- A question that's been bothering me.

467
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,806
Oh, no. Oh, no.

468
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,450
Is this an act?

469
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,641
Are you pretending
that he's just a nightclub owner?

470
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,249
- Or are you really that stupid?
- Stop!

471
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,329
I don't understand.

472
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,847
- Your son...
- Don Maroni, I am warning you!

473
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,287
- Is a coldblooded psychopath.
- No, no, no.

474
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,006
I can't count how many men he's killed.

475
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,091
My own friend, Frankie Carbone,
he stabbed him a dozen times.

476
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,763
What kind of person plunges a knife
into someone over and over?

477
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,724
He's a filthy liar, Mother!

478
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,526
He's just angry because I
played him for a fool.

479
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,207
You know, don't you?

480
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,522
- I can see it.
- Let go of her!

481
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,525
Did you catch him one night
washing blood from his hands?

482
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,850
When did you realize
that you had given birth to a monster?

483
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,042
You're going to pay for this.

484
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,046
Maybe.

485
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,165
Or maybe this ends with me
dumping your lifeless body into the river.

486
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,126
Either way, you and Mama Gertrude
can stop pretending.

487
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,764
The place is looking good.

488
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,361
The other night, when you saw my invitation,
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

489
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,404
I wasn't. I didn't get invited.

490
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,086
Oh, so you're crashing.

491
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,806
No, I'm on the list.

492
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,890
It's amazing
what a $10,000 donation will do.

493
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,405
You donated $10,000 to this?
Why?

494
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,927
I was hoping that would be apparent.

495
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,082
And what if I decided not to come?

496
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,080
Well, then, I'd have been making
a generous donation to charity...

497
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,766
and I would have been very disappointed.

498
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,604
The way things ended last night,
it was my fault.

499
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,883
But I felt something.

500
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,650
I couldn't let it slip away.

501
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,883
Well, that's very sweet, but...

502
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,608
You said that when people see the real you,
they run screaming.

503
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,482
Someone said the same thing to me once,
that no one would ever love me.

504
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,650
- Who?
- The woman I thought was my mother.

505
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,123
Barbara, I know what it's like...

506
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,484
to be one person on the inside
and have the world see another.

507
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,129
I lived like that...

508
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,160
and it almost destroyed me.
I can see it destroying you.

509
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,810
I don't wanna dance anymore.

510
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,162
The person that I am now...

511
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,521
I created.

512
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,010
I brought him into being.

513
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,285
I can do the same for you.

514
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,001
Aren't you tired of playing games?

515
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,645
Of hiding?

516
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,124
Yes.

517
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,728
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.

518
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,009
- Hello. I'm Bruce Wayne.
- Sid Bunderslaw.

519
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,727
I'm going around trying to get to know
everybody who works for the company.

520
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,725
- You work for Wayne Enterprises, don't you?
- I do.

521
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,048
I'm the Director of Physical Operations...

522
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,448
which I'm afraid is a bit dull.

523
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,927
There are many
much more interesting people here.

524
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,166
Well, I'm sure I'll get to meet everyone
eventually.

525
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,446
Forgive me, Bruce,
I have an early flight tomorrow.

526
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,244
It's been a pleasure.

527
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,365
It was...

528
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,491
It was nice meeting you.

529
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,730
Sorry.

530
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,881
See? Nothing to it.

531
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,250
What is it?

532
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,084
Nothing.

533
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,004
Stop right there, buster.

534
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,805
Riddle Man? What the hell are you doing
creeping around here?

535
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,284
- You need to leave Miss Kringle alone.
- What?

536
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,802
I'm not gonna let you hurt her, ever again.

537
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,567
I think you need to leave Gotham tonight.

538
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,002
I get it now.

539
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,804
You got a thing for my girl.

540
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,523
That's too funny.

541
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,011
Don't take this personal.

542
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,927
You want some more?

543
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,326
UPSY-daisy!

544
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,970
Riddle Man...

545
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,807
Oh, dear.

546
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,444
Oh, dear.

547
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,210
Oh, no.

548
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,168
Oh, dear.

549
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,041
Oh, dear.

550
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,964
Oh, dear.

551
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,405
- Oswald.
- Feeling better?

552
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,563
I made tea.

553
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,602
I'm afraid you had, well,
a little too much to drink.

554
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,847
Mr. Maroni, he has a
strange sense of humor...

555
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,405
Oswald.

556
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,328
I am not some bumpkin from the country
with hay in my brains.

557
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,484
I am your mother...

558
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,241
and I will love you no matter what.

559
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
But lie to me now...

560
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,491
and you will break my heart.

561
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,887
Oswald...

562
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,444
have you done things...

563
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,170
you should not?

564
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,048
Mother...

565
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,521
I'm a nightclub owner.

566
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,760
That's all.

567
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,090
I'm tired now.

568
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,281
I am tired.

569
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,087
Yeah, I got a delivery for Gertrude
from Sal.

570
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,408
Tip's not included.

571
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,008
You tell Sal it's over.

572
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,006
The guns are bought.
The killing room is waiting.

573
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,164
He doesn't know it, but he's a dead man.

574
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,411
On second thought, I'll tell him myself.

575
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,968
Oswald?

576
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,730
Who was that?

577
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,841
It's Mr. Yatsko from next door.

578
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,122
He needs help taking out some trash.

579
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,051
You, you... Please, you help him, then.

580
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,011
Jason Van Groot?

581
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,841
His real name is Jason Skolimski.
He used the old woman's name at the clinic.

582
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,681
But there's no Jason Van Groot or Skolimski
in Gotham. The guy's a ghost.

583
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,360
So the old woman rejects him,
he goes to the doctor...

584
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,210
gets himself a pretty new face.

585
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,124
SThat's where he runs into the nurse.

586
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,810
And we're off to the races.

587
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,721
- I don't suppose you got a picture?
- Missing from the file. No surprise there.

588
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,850
But the good doctor was kind enough
to do a sketch.

589
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,805
It's been 1O years since he last saw him,
but it's a start.

590
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,685
So we have his real name,
but not what alias he's using...

591
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,043
or what he looks like
beyond a decade-old sketch.

592
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,402
Did he say anything else
on the phone today?

593
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,565
- Anything we might have missed?
- No, just wanted me to back off.

594
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,721
Told me not to believe my own press
as the rising star of the G.C.P.D.

595
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,483
What is it?

596
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,087
The paper that said that...

597
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,363
they ran an old photo of me
from a charity gala.

598
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,247
I wasn't alone.

599
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,844
Barbara?

600
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,441
Is Barbara here?

601
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,126
- No. Why?
- Where is she?

602
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,086
- When's the last time you saw her?
- At the Wayne Ball. She left with some guy.

603
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,770
- Was this the guy?
- That's kind of a crappy drawing.

604
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,325
Was this the guy?

605
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,248
Yeah, I think so.

606
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,768
Why? Who is he?

607
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,766
What's through there?

608
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,081
See for yourself.
