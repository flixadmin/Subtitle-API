1
00:00:00,356 --> 00:00:02,107
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,264 --> 00:00:05,548
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,468
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,137
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:17,059
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:19,011
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:21,980
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:26,018
I must be something else.

9
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:28,307
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:30,058
Who's blood?
An alderman from the Glades

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,643
trying to save the city.

12
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:33,311
I'm surprised that
you wanted to meet.

13
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:34,479
I'm not your enemy.
You're not a friend.

14
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:36,148
I'm hoping
to prove otherwise.

15
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,732
You told me
to stay out of the Glades.

16
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:39,734
You told me
to get out of CNRI.

17
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:41,586
Tommy was only there
because I was too stubborn.

18
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:44,156
You were right.
I was blaming the Arrow because

19
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:46,608
it's all my fault, dad!
It's all my fault

20
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,828
that Tommy died.

21
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,496
What's going on
with this woman?

22
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:53,115
She keeps following you
around, helping you out.

23
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:54,649
We've got to find her.

24
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:55,817
To stop her, or to send her
a thank you note?

25
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:57,135
That depends.
On what?

26
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:59,654
What side she's on.

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,514
Mr. Queen's going to be late.
He's extremely sorry.

28
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:11,683
It couldn't be helped.
Where is he?

29
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:13,135
Um...

30
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:20,642
Over there!
Where, man?!

31
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:22,343
There, man!

32
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:23,080
Just got a little held up.

33
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,622
You know, tying up
some loose ends.

34
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:35,073
I'm actually in direct contact
with him now. Let me--let me check.

35
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:44,382
Where are you getting the guns?

36
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:45,834
Are you going
to kill me?

37
00:01:45,836 --> 00:01:48,553
Get it over with.

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,373
Dig.

39
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,976
Took down two more
gangbangers.

40
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:57,345
They were armed with fully
automatic M4A1 assault rifles.

41
00:01:57,347 --> 00:02:00,398
M4A1s
are military grade weapons.

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,018
Stolen, most likely.
Stolen from where?

43
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,769
Well, we can look into that
after your party.

44
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:06,438
What party?

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,523
He's here.

46
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:10,391
Sorry I'm late.

47
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:13,228
This party is to
attract investors

48
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,763
for your failing
company.

49
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:17,065
Being fashionably
late might do well

50
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,067
for the club circuit,
but it does not inspire

51
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,785
confidence
in Wall Street.

52
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:22,904
Is that blood on your face?
Hmm?

53
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:24,706
Don't worry,
it's not his blood.

54
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,675
I mean, of course
it's his blood.

55
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:29,344
Why would he have somebody
else's blood on his face?

56
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:32,230
Who taught you
to shave? Mister.

57
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:33,882
What kept you?

58
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:36,084
Was it our masked blonde
that carries that giant staff

59
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:37,552
to beat the sauce
out of attackers?

60
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:38,837
This time it was guns.
Guns?

61
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,972
We were just talking
about guns.

62
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:42,607
Hey. Oliver.

63
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:44,559
Hi.

64
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:46,444
What's your interest
in guns, Mr. Queen?

65
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:49,197
Never touched them myself.
The gun epidemic in the Glades

66
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,899
has gotten increasingly
out of control.

67
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,567
Which is why the DEA's
office has committed

68
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,380
to ending gun violence.
Well, I'm sure the police

69
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:55,498
are doing whatever they can

70
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,523
to catch whoever's bring
the weapons into the city.

71
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:02,744
Did I say
something funny?

72
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:06,631
They know who's been
arming the gangs, Oliver.

73
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:08,449
The Mayor.

74
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,035
The...

75
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:13,171
I thought the hood copycats
killed the mayor.

76
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:14,973
Well, not the actual mayor.

77
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:18,093
A local gang lord
calls himself the Mayor.

78
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:19,878
Think he's the man
to save our city.

79
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,463
But that position has
already been filled, hasn't it?

80
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,268
Now this mayor
has only one goal--

81
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,802
to create chaos

82
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:29,821
so he can rule the Glades
with the barrel of a gun.

83
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:44,819
You are noticeably unarmed, son.

84
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:46,838
Sorry, Mr. Mayor.

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,690
Um, we ran into
the Vigilante,

86
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:51,326
and, um, he ganked
our weapons.

87
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:54,179
Do you know who I was
before the quake?

88
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:56,631
I was no one.
I had no name.

89
00:03:56,633 --> 00:04:00,135
None that mattered, anyway.
I was just another weak man

90
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:03,638
waiting to get fired
or evicted or killed.

91
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,941
But then the ground shook,
and now I matter,

92
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:09,644
because I know the guy
with the biggest gun wins,

93
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:11,846
and that's why I will
rule the Glades.

94
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:15,516
But there's no room at my table
for weak ass punks like you.

95
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,852
Mr. Mayor. I want
to ask for leniency.

96
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:20,872
The kid's my cousin.
I brought him in.

97
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:23,074
Oh, you did?

98
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:34,035
Now let's hope you do
your family prouder than he did.

99
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,210
Hey.

100
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:47,315
Please do not ask me
if I'm ok,

101
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:49,734
because I am sick to death
of everyone asking me that!

102
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:51,436
I would never do that.
Good.

103
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:53,571
You ok?

104
00:04:57,244 --> 00:05:01,196
The Doll Maker was just
your garden variety

105
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:03,064
traumatic experience.

106
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:06,251
After the quake and Tommy,

107
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:07,585
I should be used
to that by now.

108
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:09,704
I've had
a few of those.

109
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:12,240
You never
get used to them.

110
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:16,344
Ahem. Excuse me, Oliver,
may I talk to you for a second?

111
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:18,413
It's urgent.
Yeah.

112
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:20,748
You can have him back
in a minute.

113
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,552
Excuse us.

114
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:27,856
I just realized
something.

115
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,224
What if our
masked friend

116
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:30,258
that keeps showing up
everywhere you go,

117
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,860
you know her?
What about her?

118
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:34,112
What if we've been going
about this the wrong way?

119
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:35,322
We thought she was
obsessed with you.

120
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:36,592
I mean, she showed up
in the D.A.'s office

121
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:37,558
when you were there...

122
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,237
And in the chemical plant where
the Doll Maker was holed up.

123
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,324
But who else was at
both those places?

124
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:50,945
What if our masked
friend isn't following you?

125
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:53,164
She's following Laurel.

126
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:43,164
Can it get any louder?

127
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,967
Why are you following
Laurel Lance?

128
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:47,852
I could ask
the same thing of you.

129
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:50,138
I guess some things
never change.

130
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,058
You and her,
always and forever.

131
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,344
Who are you?

132
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:59,147
Once you know, your life
will never be the same.

133
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:00,482
I could take it.

134
00:07:00,484 --> 00:07:01,900
Not this time.

135
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:03,651
Ollie.

136
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,669
Oh, Laurel's
going to kill me.

137
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:31,379
Sarah?

138
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:35,216
I'll give you some time
to let it sink in.

139
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:50,792

Sarah Lance?

142
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:03,037
Laurel's sister?
The detective's other daughter,

143
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,007
the one that you took
on "The Gambit" with you

144
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:06,177
even though you were
dating Laurel at the time,

145
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:07,159
which we never talked about--

146
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,409
Felicity, please.

147
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:10,194
I'm sorry, it's just...

148
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:12,914
Isn't she--isn't she dead?

149
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,049
You told everyone that she died
when "The Gambit" went down,

150
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:16,834
that she drowned.

151
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,171
You lied.

152
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:24,842
When "The Gambit"
capsized, uh...

153
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:28,546
Sarah was pulled under.

154
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:31,165
It was so dark and cold.

155
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,901
And I thought she drowned.

156
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,356
About year later,
I saw her.

157
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:39,524
You saw where,
on the island?

158
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:41,392
She drifted
to the island, too?

159
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:43,861
Not exactly.
Why didn't you tell the Lances

160
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:45,396
that she didn't die
in that boat?

161
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:47,898
Laurel and Mr. Lance,
they blame you.

162
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,235
Yeah, well,
it was my fault.

163
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:53,371
What happened was my fault.

164
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:54,905
Well, where has she been
all these years, Oliver?

165
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:57,041
I don't know!

166
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:02,263
Diggle,
I swear to God.

167
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:05,583
I was sure she was dead.

168
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:08,469
Do you have
any happy stories?

169
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:11,105
All right, so just to make sure
I understand this correctly,

170
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:14,358
after not drowning
when "The Gambit" went down,

171
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,944
Sarah didn't exactly
make it to the island

172
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:20,431
with you, where you would
see her die yet again.

173
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:22,600
Feel free to fill in the blanks.
Not right now.

174
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:24,435
You mean not ever,
don't you, Oliver?

175
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:26,287
Don't you think her family
had a right to know

176
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:27,622
that she made it
to the island, too?

177
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:29,657
These were five years!

178
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:32,460
Five years...

179
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:35,279
Where nothing
good happened.

180
00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:41,836
And they were better off
not knowing.

181
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:43,771
Do they deserve to know now?

182
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:51,929
I need to take care of some
business at the office.

183
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,931
Where are we
with the Mayor?

184
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:57,452
I'm in contact with some
of my military sources.

185
00:09:57,454 --> 00:10:00,521
Trying to get a line on how he's
getting his illegal army weaponry.

186
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:03,774
I'll keep you updated.

187
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:07,028
You know, Oliver,
somebody once told me that...

188
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,747
secrets have weight.

189
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:12,550
The more you keep,
the harder it is to keep moving.

190
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:18,155
You see how hard
I work out.

191
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:34,722
You kill two of my crew.

192
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:38,276
How many others
are with you on the island?

193
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,729
What are your weapon
capabilities?

194
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:45,566
Did you find the graves?

195
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:49,687
Two things will happen--

196
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:52,523
you will tell me
everything I want to know,

197
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,575
then I will kill you.

198
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:57,078
Or I will torture you until you
tell me everything I want to know.

199
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,714
And then I will kill you.

200
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:16,597
Go to hell.

201
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,881
Can't.

202
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:20,718
We're already there.

203
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,840
Told you.

204
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,742
The Patty Shack
on 5th and Brewer,

205
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,544
best burgers in town.

206
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:48,212
Well, Patty Shack's in
the Mayor's territory,

207
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:53,384
so I'll take a sub par
breakfast over a bullet.

208
00:11:57,422 --> 00:12:00,057
What's wrong?

209
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:02,926
Look, I know I'm skinny, but I
can eat two of these, and I will.

210
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:06,380
Just ran into an old boyfriend.

211
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:13,287
I'm just...

212
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,957
worried that he might
tell my family I'm back.

213
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,325
You have family
in Starling?

214
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:18,743
Yeah.

215
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:22,463
My father, he's a--
he's a policeman.

216
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:24,715
And my sister,
she's a lawyer.

217
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:28,452
Well, they must be real proud
of their masked delinquent.

218
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,475
Yeah, they think I'm dead.

219
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:35,977
Oh, cool.

220
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:38,262
My folks think
I'm dead, too.

221
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:40,431
That, or they wish
I'd never been born.

222
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,132
One of those.

223
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:45,302
Why...don't you
want them

224
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,321
to know that
you're still alive?

225
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:52,076
'Cause I'm not
what they remember.

226
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:54,812
Good little
daddy's girl?

227
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:57,048
Actually far from it.

228
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,785
I was a lot like you.

229
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:03,037
Is that...

230
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,456
why you saved me
from those guys that night?

231
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:11,545
No woman should ever suffer
at the hands of men.

232
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,635
We've got to stop
meeting like this.

233
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:19,169
What would your girlfriend
think, Johnny?

234
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:21,022
Lyla,
I am checking the box

235
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,673
marked "single" these days.

236
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:25,159
Sorry to hear it.
What happened?

237
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:27,361
Well, another man
came between us.

238
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:29,030
Deadshot.

239
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:31,682
You're getting
in the bad habit

240
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:32,817
of letting him ruin your life.

241
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:34,218
So I've been
repeatedly told.

242
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,287
Anything on those
stolen army weapons?

243
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:39,690
A crate of 12 M4A1s went missing
from Camp Kirby two months ago.

244
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:41,008
Yeah, I think I know
where they went.

245
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,626
Every crate was fitted
with a GPS system

246
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:44,695
so they could be
remote tracked.

247
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:46,864
I tried pulling it up but it's not
receiving. Must have been deactivated.

248
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,833
Thanks, Lyla.

249
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:50,518
And your interest
in this is what?

250
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:54,371
Lyla, you and I went
to Afghanistan to try

251
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,873
to bring law and order
to a country overrun

252
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,892
by war lords
with weapons, right?

253
00:13:57,894 --> 00:14:00,845
Should we do any less
for our own cities?

254
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,681
Thanks again.

255
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:06,350
Hey, Johnny.
Yeah?

256
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:09,603
These days, I check the box
marked single, too.

257
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,029
Mr. Blood. I see you've met
Miss Rochev.

258
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:20,998
She's my--
superior.

259
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,533
Partner.
On paper.

260
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:24,702
Is that why you asked me
to come down here, Mr. Queen,

261
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,337
to mediate your job title?

262
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,105
You and I have gotten
off on the wrong foot repeatedly.

263
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:30,541
Seems to be
your super power.

264
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:33,127
I was inspired
by what you said

265
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:36,013
the other night about
gun violence in the Glades.

266
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:37,848
And I had an idea
that might help.

267
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,873
Really? Another party
at your stately manor?

268
00:14:39,898 --> 00:14:41,219
No.

269
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
I wanted to sponsor
a cash for guns event.

270
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:45,406
I give you the money
and you get your constituents

271
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:48,142
to lay down their arms.
Everybody wins.

272
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:51,695
Especially you.

273
00:14:51,697 --> 00:14:54,115
Trying to repair
your family's tainted name

274
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:56,400
by ridding the Glades of guns.

275
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:57,868
You just get the money,
Mr. Blood.

276
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,538
I don't want
my family's name involved.

277
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,157
Mr. Queen, may I have
a word with you?

278
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,609
Let me think it over.

279
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,284
We are not
sponsoring that event.

280
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:16,787
Yes, I know. I am.

281
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,305
With what money?

282
00:15:18,307 --> 00:15:20,975
Your investment party
cost QC 50 grand,

283
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:22,476
and no one
invested a dime.

284
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:25,095
I will not continue to
authorize corporate funds

285
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:28,466
just so you can keep pretending
that you are the CEO.

286
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:31,018
Fine.

287
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,653
I'll pay for it myself.

288
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,605
Maybe you
haven't noticed,

289
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:36,774
but your personal trust isn't exactly
what it used to be,

290
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:38,659
and this company
isn't, either.

291
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:41,946
As much as I would love
to make this city safer,

292
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:45,716
my first obligation is
to Queen Consolidated.

293
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:47,868
And yours is, too.

294
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:02,833
♪ Shadows settle
on the place that you left ♪

295
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:07,488
I was going to order
some takeout, you want in?

296
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,139
I appreciate
the offer, Adam, but--

297
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:11,192
I've eaten takeout
every night this week,

298
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:12,960
I need a meal served
on an actual plate.

299
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:15,446
So do you.

300
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:18,682
I get it. It's easy to let
the job become your life.

301
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:21,368
I keep having to remind myself
to go to the gym,

302
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,871
see a movie, eat a good meal.

303
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:28,375
That sounds dangerously
like having a life.

304
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:32,362
What about you?
You can't be all about work.

305
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:35,532
I'm the best me
when I am working.

306
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:37,501
And when you're not?

307
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:41,722
You don't want to meet her.
She's not good company.

308
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:45,208
I'd be willing to risk it.

309
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:50,097
Excuse me.

310
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:52,182
I have to go.

311
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:54,401
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:56,237
No, it's ok.

313
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:59,189
It's fine.
I just have to go.

314

320
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:25,766
Crap.

321
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:30,420
License
and registration?

322
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:32,723
Is there a problem, Officer?

323
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:34,642
Have you had anything
to drink tonight, ma'am?

324
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:39,446
I'm Laurel Lance.

325
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:41,765
I'm an assistant
district attorney.

326
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,067
I'm sorry, Miss Lance,
but I'm going to have

327
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:45,069
to ask you to step out
of the car, please.

328
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:50,273
I need some good news.

329
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:52,543
The bad news first.

330
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:54,277
Somehow the Mayor
did get his hands

331
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,279
on a crate of
military-grade weapons

332
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:58,281
from Camp Kirby.

333
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:59,416
The good news?

334
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:01,001
If he kept the crate,

335
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:02,553
might be able to find
where he's hiding.

336
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:05,139
This is the same make and model
of a tracking system

337
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:06,790
the army installs
on all of its weapons crates.

338
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,426
If they lose a crate,
they send out a remote signal

339
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:12,012
that activates the beacon.
The Mayor's clever.

340
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:14,765
He deactivated his beacon. Send
a signal, nothing comes back.

341
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:17,935
You both need to work
on your definition of good news.

342
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,687
Ok. How's this--

343
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:22,606
guess which company designed
the tracking system the army uses?

344
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:26,143
I'll give you a hint--
your CEO? Always late.

345
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:28,445
Nice.

346
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:30,931
I pulled up the original plans
from the QC mainframe.

347
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,399
Turns out
there's a design flaw.

348
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:35,152
The beacon is still susceptible
to a subform wave

349
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,420
even if it's been deactivated.

350
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:37,705
The Mayor
turned it off, Oliver.

351
00:18:37,707 --> 00:18:39,173
We can turn it back on.

352
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:48,882
I believe you ordered the crate
of stolen military weapons, Mr. Queen.

353
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:01,311
I thought you deactivated
the tracker!

354
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:16,493
Go, go!

355
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:34,928
Weapons are secure.

356
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,347
And the Mayor?

357
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:40,283
Still in office.

358
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:49,108
Thanks for the heads up,
Officer Daily.

359
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,577
Just fyi--

360
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:53,897
she blew .6 past
the legal limit.

361
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:57,166
Thank you.

362
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:00,786
He didn't need to call you.

363
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,255
No.

364
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:04,807
But you're lucky he did.

365
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,676
You could have
lost your job.

366
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:08,978
You could have lost your life, and
you could have killed somebody!

367
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,464
I had a few too many glasses
of wine at dinner.

368
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,566
It was an accident!

369
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:16,085
An accident.
Well, I guess those happen.

370
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:18,204
Was I not supposed
to notice that tone?

371
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:20,306
The two of us...

372
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:22,725
You got a lot
from me, Laurel.

373
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,527
Maybe you got
this, too.

374
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:28,097
You can hardly compare my one
mistake to your drinking problem.

375
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,984
So long as it is
only one mistake.

376
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:33,670
I don't know
if you've noticed...

377
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,656
But I've had a little bit
of a hard time lately.

378
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:40,376
I was kidnapped, nearly murdered
by a psychopath,

379
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:42,161
and my boyfriend died.

380
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:45,498
So, I don't know,
maybe...cut me some slack.

381
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,333
You know, when I started
having a hard time,

382
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:50,169
I wish people
had not cut me slack.

383
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:53,189
Leave your car here,
I'm driving you home.

384
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:55,007
I'll take a cab.
Laurel...

385
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,644
Laurel!

386
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,901
Did you tell my family
that I'm alive?

387
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:41,437
No.

388
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:47,727
Sara.

389
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:50,079
I saw you die.

390
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:52,365
Not the first time
that's happened, right?

391
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:54,901
And I thought
you were dead, too.

392
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:57,420
What happened to Slade?

393
00:21:57,422 --> 00:21:59,739
Where have you been?

394
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:02,859
Everywhere.
That's not an answer.

395
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:04,594
Well, it's the one
you're getting.

396
00:22:08,882 --> 00:22:11,684
About a year ago,

397
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:14,086
I started
hearing tales

398
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:16,222
of the Starling City
vigilante.

399
00:22:16,224 --> 00:22:19,792
The man
in the green hood.

400
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:21,227
I knew it was you.

401
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:23,429
I had never known you
as much of a fighter.

402
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:26,399
Where did you pick that up?
I met some rough people.

403
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:27,900
Thought I should get
rougher, too.

404
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:29,986
Sara.

405
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:33,072
Why did you come back?

406
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:37,443
The earthquake.

407
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:40,396
Because you wanted
to make sure your family was safe.

408
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:43,216
But now you're still here,

409
00:22:43,218 --> 00:22:46,118
watching over them.

410
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,287
Protecting them.

411
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:53,893
So, did you come here
to make sure I didn't tell them?

412
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:56,763
Or because you were
hoping I had?

413
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:03,352
I'll get rid of them.

414
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:14,313
Mr. Lance?
Hi.

415
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,619
Something I can help you with?

416
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:23,840
I'm here about
my daughter.

417
00:23:25,676 --> 00:23:27,493
Laurel.

418
00:23:27,495 --> 00:23:29,011
Is she ok?

419
00:23:29,013 --> 00:23:30,963
Yeah. Well, no,
she's not.

420
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:33,850
She got pulled over
for a DUI last night.

421
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:36,602
I tried talking to
her about it, but...

422
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:38,221
She wasn't
hearing me.

423
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:40,673
I--I saw her the other night.

424
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:42,191
She...

425
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:44,277
Didn't seem like herself.

426
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,979
No, I know.
She seems like me.

427
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,821
I don't know if you know, but
when you and Sara disappeared,

428
00:23:54,823 --> 00:23:57,824
I hit the bottle
pretty hard.

429
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:01,661
I know the two
of you are friends.

430
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:03,830
And she needs
a friend.

431
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:07,199
Maybe talk to her.

432
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:09,051
Sure.

433
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:14,173
Anyhow.

434
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:16,375
Mr. Lance.
Yeah?

435
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:23,266
Um...

436
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:26,218
I'd be happy to talk to Laurel.

437
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:30,222
Thanks.

438
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:56,248
Why'd they do this?
Aahh.

439
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,634
They make all of us do this.

440
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:04,140
Supposed to show prochnost.

441
00:25:05,392 --> 00:25:08,227
It's Russian.

442
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:09,812
For strength.

443
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:15,701
They--they did it
to see if I'm strong?!

444
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:19,288
They're doing this
to see if you survive.

445
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,741
Living...

446
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:24,443
is not for the weak.

447
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:33,302
Aahh.

448
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,786
Oliver. Hi.

449
00:26:17,787 --> 00:26:20,120
What are you doing here?
Is everything ok?

450
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,489
I don't know.
Is everything ok?

451
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:25,993
You've got
to be kidding me.

452
00:26:25,995 --> 00:26:27,594
My dad went to you?

453
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:29,763
He spent the last
six years cursing your name,

454
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:31,882
and now you're what, gossip buddies?
Laurel.

455
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,500
He's worried about you.

456
00:26:33,502 --> 00:26:35,853
Perfect.

457
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:38,806
A recovering alcoholic
and recovering party boy

458
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:40,941
trying to tell me
how to live my life.

459
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:42,526
Don't you see
the hypocrisy there?

460
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:46,313
What I see is somebody
that both of us care for

461
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:48,282
having a rough go of it.

462
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:49,615
Do you know how many

463
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,784
times I've had to pull
my dad out of a bar?

464
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:54,822
Or how many nights
I've had to drive him home

465
00:26:54,824 --> 00:26:56,824
where he's passed out
in my backseat?

466
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:59,376
He's the one
with the problem.

467
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:01,495
Not me.

468
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,998
Just because he can't
cope with losing Sara

469
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,199
doesn't mean I can't
handle my life.

470
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:10,004
Feel free to tell him that
during the next chit chat.

471
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:30,741
Sewing is not
your strong suit.

472
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:39,066
Now we can talk.

473
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,086
For two years...

474
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:46,056
my crew and I have
been looking for grave site.

475
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,912
Did you find the graves?

476
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:55,616
Were the bodies...

477
00:27:55,618 --> 00:27:57,968
Odd?

478
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,438
The bones misshapen?

479
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:13,984
This is
the right island.

480
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,926
Looks like we got
a Colt 1911,

481
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:25,112
Jennings .32,

482
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:28,415
and a K-frame revolver.

483
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,667
Um...

484
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,253
We'll give you 250 for the lot.

485
00:28:33,255 --> 00:28:34,788
Keep it.

486
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,290
Do I even want to know where
you got those guns?

487
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:39,760
They're from the old days.
I told you.

488
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:41,628
Look, no more
being a criminal.

489
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,314
No more being a hero.
Just Roy Harper.

490
00:28:44,316 --> 00:28:45,966
Bus boy and boyfriend.

491
00:28:45,968 --> 00:28:47,968
Yo, Abercrombie.

492
00:28:51,406 --> 00:28:54,658
Where's your manners?
Sin.

493
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,111
This is Thea.
Thea, this is Sin.

494
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:58,579
Thea Queen?

495
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,281
Look at you,
rolling with royalty.

496
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:03,316
By the way, the salad fork's
the small one.

497
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:05,318
It was good to see you again.

498
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:11,125
She doesn't know you're the
Vigilante's delivery boy, does she?

499
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:15,295
Nice to meet you,
your highness.

500
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:17,381
You, too.

501
00:29:17,383 --> 00:29:19,466
So how do you know her?

502
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,168
From around.

503
00:29:23,605 --> 00:29:26,974
You don't show up
when you say you will,

504
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:29,693
and when you promise
not to, here you are.

505
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:32,112
It's going well?

506
00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:36,450
Last check, we've taken in
over 200 guns in only 3 hours.

507
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:39,870
Try not to look
so happy about it.

508
00:29:39,872 --> 00:29:41,989
A lot on my mind, alderman.

509
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:46,026
My job is to help
the people in this city

510
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:47,711
with their problems.

511
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:55,669
Two people that
are very important to me are...

512
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,569
having a tough time.

513
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,416
Sisters, actually.

514
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:00,226
And neither one of them

515
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,426
is making it very easy
for me to help them.

516
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:07,181
Sooner or later,
we all go through a crucible.

517
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:10,851
I'm guessing yours
was that island.

518
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,521
Most people there are
two types of people

519
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,156
who go into a crucible--

520
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:18,859
the ones who grow stronger
from the experience

521
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,777
and survive it,

522
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,896
and the ones who die.

523
00:30:22,898 --> 00:30:26,483
But there's a third type.

524
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:28,735
The ones who learn
to love the fire.

525
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:30,237
They choose to stay
in their crucible

526
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,705
because it's easier
to embrace the pain

527
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,924
when it's all
you know anymore.

528
00:30:33,926 --> 00:30:37,177
That's why I'm on the clock
to help this city.

529
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:39,846
Before it becomes used
to living like this.

530
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:41,848
Living is not
for the weak.

531
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:46,086
Old friend of mine
once told me that.

532
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:48,222
That's a wise friend.

533
00:30:55,614 --> 00:30:59,566
Listen up, people.
This is your mayor speaking.

534
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:03,770
Now I don't recall
this here event being sanctioned.

535
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:06,323
What happens in the Glades

536
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:09,409
only happens if I allow it.

537
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:10,877
You're not the leader
of this community!

538
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:14,214
You don't speak
for these people!

539
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:17,150
And neither do you.
Not anymore.

540
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:42,309
Hey! Are you ok? Are you hit?
No.

541
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,145
Sin, you all right?

542
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:47,364
All's good.

543
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:53,870
Go get help!

544
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:55,839
Go!

545
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:02,658
The shooting
was committed by the gang leader

546
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:05,354
known only as "The Mayor,"
who, until now,

547
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:07,002
has never been seen in public.

548
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:08,736
We do want to warn
our audience

549
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:11,122
that some of these images
are graphic.

550
00:32:12,591 --> 00:32:15,710
The coward finally
decided to show his face.

551
00:32:15,712 --> 00:32:18,179
Vanity is going
to cost him.

552
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:21,883
I borrowed the FBI's
facial recognition software.

553
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:23,485
Got a match.

554
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:25,937
Xavier Reed.

555
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:27,839
Did Mr. Reed
serve in the military?

556
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:30,809
No military history.
Family members?

557
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:33,311
Reed was in and out
of foster care his whole life.

558
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:35,113
Wait, hold on.

559
00:32:35,115 --> 00:32:37,649
In 1996, Reed spent
three years with

560
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:40,601
a foster family
and their son, Ezra Barnes.

561
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:43,104
He served three tours in
Iraq. He's stateside now.

562
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:45,740
20 bucks says he was stationed
at Camp Kirby.

563
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:48,109
Pay the man.
The Mayor's foster brother

564
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:49,961
is assigned
to a weapons convoy

565
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,830
that carries
SCAR 16s by truck.

566
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:54,582
The convoy's scheduled to come
through Starling City tonight.

567
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:57,752
FN SCAR 16s are military assault
weapons with grenade launchers.

568
00:32:57,754 --> 00:33:00,255
The man gets a hold
of these, Oliver,

569
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:02,623
it's game over.

570
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:06,127
He won't.

571
00:33:08,597 --> 00:33:12,233
Bullet penetrated
her anterior abdomen.

572
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:14,235
We were able to remove
most of the fragments.

573
00:33:14,237 --> 00:33:15,854
We'll know more
in a few hours.

574
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:29,984
Hey.

575
00:33:29,986 --> 00:33:32,153
I'm going to stick around,
in case she wakes up.

576
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:35,790
Is it ok if I stick
around with you?

577
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:40,979
I mean, you saved
her life, Roy.

578
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:45,133
I guess you can't stop
being a hero, can you?

579
00:33:59,648 --> 00:34:03,568
I want to see how you do
in a real fight.

580
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,003
Good.

581
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:07,688
I was looking for a fight.

582
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:31,596
They're with me.

583
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:35,934
He wasn't.

584
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:42,190
You're done being
all you can be.

585
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,727
Ahh.

586
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:48,896
You and I are going
to own this town.

587
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:52,951
Now let's see
what this bad boy can do.

588
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,457
Drop the weapon, now!

589
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,311
Behind you.

590
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:23,264
Old school weapon. Respect.

591
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:25,400
But can your arrows do this?

592
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:46,504
Come on, where are you?

593
00:35:52,262 --> 00:35:54,812
You hurt a friend of mine.
Let him go.

594
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:57,598
You can't save a city
with forgiveness.

595
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,435
You don't have
to forgive him.

596
00:36:00,437 --> 00:36:02,803
But you do have
to let him live.

597
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:07,608
Bitch. I knew you didn't
have it in you.

598
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:13,965
I really don't like that word.

599
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:22,813
Demonstrations
opposing the construction

600
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,847
of the new Star Lab's
particle accelerator

601
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,650
have reached a fever pitch with
five more protestors being arrested.

602
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:32,433
In other news the recent cash for
guns event held in the Glades

603
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:36,003
is credited for getting
over 800 weapons off the streets.

604
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:38,606
Still a mystery--
the anonymous donor

605
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:42,276
whose generous donation
funded the event.

606
00:36:42,278 --> 00:36:44,529
I guess it's true
what they say--

607
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:46,147
one man can change the world.

608
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:48,182
I'll leave changing
the world to you, alderman.

609
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:50,485
I'm only in the world
because of you.

610
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,370
Thank you.

611
00:36:52,372 --> 00:36:54,622
I was just acting
on instinct.

612
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:58,659
It wasn't instinct.
It was strength.

613
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:00,194
I see the signs

614
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:01,746
and the graffiti;

615
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:03,531
"Blood for mayor."

616
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,883
Now that the "mayor"
is in jail,

617
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:07,218
maybe
you should run.

618
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,422
There is more than one way
to save a city.

619
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:19,514
Mr. Harper?

620
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:21,899
What's wrong, is she ok?

621
00:37:27,072 --> 00:37:29,390
Hey.

622
00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:33,611
You saved my life.

623
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:38,399
I guess I have to keep
your secret now, huh?

624
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:41,669
You know you're dating
a moron, right?

625
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:45,223
It's my first
and last thought of every day.

626
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:46,791
Crap.

627
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:48,626
I like her.

628
00:38:05,894 --> 00:38:08,946
Your friend.

629
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:11,482
I took care
of her medical expenses.

630
00:38:11,484 --> 00:38:13,234
Thank you.

631
00:38:13,236 --> 00:38:16,270
Look, I don't want
Thea to see me--

632
00:38:16,272 --> 00:38:18,906
What's your plan, Sarah?

633
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:22,126
Because right now,
you just...

634
00:38:22,128 --> 00:38:23,961
Well, you're whipping
across rooftops

635
00:38:23,963 --> 00:38:25,913
and keeping watch
over your family

636
00:38:25,915 --> 00:38:27,615
like some sort of ghost.

637
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:29,217
We're both ghosts.

638
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,335
We died
on that island.

639
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:32,753
But we didn't.

640
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:36,140
We both lived.

641
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:39,760
And...

642
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:43,097
I get that you have
been in pain so long

643
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:46,267
that it probably
just feels normal now.

644
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:50,021
But you can let it go
and come home.

645
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:52,907
I mean, I know that the
earthquake brought you here,

646
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:55,109
but your family
kept you here.

647
00:38:55,111 --> 00:38:58,045
You have to tell them, Sarah.

648
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:04,085
They need you.

649
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:07,922
You told them
that I died on "The Gambit."

650
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:09,657
If they know
the truth...

651
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:11,526
They would never--

652
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:14,862
they would never
talk to me again.

653
00:39:14,864 --> 00:39:17,965
Not one of them.

654
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:22,453
But it'd be worth it.

655
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:28,276
My daughter's
in trouble.

656
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:32,230
She's, uh, she's been through
some really terrible things.

657
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:34,148
And...

658
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,569
Instead of facing up to them,
she's running away from them.

659
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:41,873
She's losing herself
in her work,

660
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:45,176
and maybe even worse.

661
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:50,331
She's my daughter, I just want
her safe, I want to protect her.

662
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:59,173
But I guess like we say in our
meetings, more will be revealed.

663
00:40:20,412 --> 00:40:23,614
Your days of screaming
are just beginning.

664
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,447
Sarah?

665
00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:02,436
What the hell is this?

666
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:05,239
This ain't the police station.

667
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:13,381
Why are you wearing that mask?

668
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:15,949
This city
is in chains,

669
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:18,085
and I'm going
to free it.

670
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:21,455
But to do that,
I need an army.

671
00:41:21,457 --> 00:41:24,475
Whoa, what's in that thing?!

672
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:26,143
Get that off me!

673
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:28,012
Get that crap away from me!

674
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:31,682
Are you ready to serve?

675
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,989
Bring me another.

676
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:57,944
Yes, brother Blood.

677
00:41:57,945 --> 00:42:02,945
