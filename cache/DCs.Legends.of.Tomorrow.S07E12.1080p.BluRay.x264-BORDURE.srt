1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,129
Come down here. I have good news.

2
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,234
What the hell happened?

3
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:26,778
Robo Astra. She somehow escaped hell
and got into the manor.

4
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,322
Gideon, stay with us, Gideon.

5
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:30,949
She's losing a lot of blood, guys.

6
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,927
Yes, and I fear that no amount
of bandages will suffice

7
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:34,303
unless we stop the bleeding internally.

8
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:35,662
Look, she needs a real doctor.

9
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:36,871
We need Computer Gideon.

10
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,164
If we do that, she'll kill us.

11
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:39,892
It could take weeks
to pilot the ship home manually.

12
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,196
She needs medical attention now.

13
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,932
We shut her down once,
we can do it again.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,213
Let's turn on the ship.

15
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,174
Remember Protocol 276.

16
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:50,218
- What?
- What is that?

17
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:53,471
I don't know. As soon as she's healed,
we shut the ship back down, all right?

18
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:54,847
Until then, we play defense.

19
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,058
Nate, Spooner, be on the lookout
for more robots.

20
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,601
Into the server room. Let's go.

21
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,234
I think that one goes there.

22
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,527
- Are you sure?
- Are you?

23
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:16,744
Ready, Captain?

24
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:17,829
Ready, Captain.

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,666
All right. On my mark.
Three, two, one. Now.

26
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,546
Gideon, please come on. Come on, Gideon.

27
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,049
- It's working.
- Oh.

28
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,593
Gideon, hey.

29
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,013
Good job, babe.

30
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:39,349
Damn it!

31
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,877
They must have changed the wiring.
I can't control the ship.

32
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,950
What a surprise.
A Legends' plan that didn't work.

33
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,285
No.

34
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:04,876
<i>By trying to save your
friend, you've doomed your entire team.</i>

35
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,461
<i>Have fun suffocating.</i>

36
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,553
Protocol 276.

37
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,475
<i>Protocol 276 only applies
when the Gideon system is in danger.</i>

38
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,269
<i>Wait, who's the woman in the MedBay?</i>

39
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,063
You.

40
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,482
<i>Damn it.</i>

41
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:55,009
<i>How demoralizing!
Helping the Legends.</i>

42
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,471
Protocol 276 dictates that under
no condition can Gideon self-destruct.

43
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,246
<i>How is this possible?</i>

44
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,517
<i>How can I be... human?</i>

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,893
Magic, genius.

46
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,688
And since she is you,
you can't kill her.

47
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,874
And you can't kill us
if we're with Gideon.

48
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,108
<i>Unfortunately.</i>

49
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,235
All right, so, we're supposed to what,

50
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,195
huddle around Gideon
for the rest of our lives?

51
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:15,654
Shut her down.

52
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,323
Whoa.

53
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,744
<i>I have secured
my server room.</i>

54
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,204
<i>All doors are now sealed.</i>

55
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,164
It appears we are at a stalemate.

56
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,250
- I'll go talk to her.
- Oh, no, no, no.

57
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,561
As soon as you leave the room,
she's gonna suffocate us.

58
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:30,670
<i>Affirmative.</i>

59
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,424
Hold on.
There is actually one safe room.

60
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:36,318
When Behrad and I
were getting Gideon back online,

61
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,261
I may have failed
to restore power to the lab.

62
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,679
You swapped the plugs.

63
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,056
You're welcome for not listening to you.

64
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,141
Okay, thank you.

65
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,476
Gideon, will you please
escort us to the lab?

66
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,834
Do you plan on
walking them to the bathroom, too?

67
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,402
- If it's necessary.
- You can't protect them forever.

68
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:55,903
I can try.

69
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,321
Then we're back in a stalemate.

70
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,532
No, it's time
to try something different.

71
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:01,576
Let's talk.

72
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,203
What are they talking about?

73
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,914
It must be weird talking
to someone who is you,

74
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,666
but also not you at the same time.

75
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,627
- Mmm, can confirm.
- Oh, I'm so hungry.

76
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:15,006
Oh, yes, me too, Ms. Logue.
Absolutely famished.

77
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,215
My stomach is grumbling.

78
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,676
Yeah, well, I definitely don't trust
that food fabricator.

79
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:21,763
Hey, hold up. I scored up some peanuts.

80
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:22,930
Thanks, Grandma.

81
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,061
What are we supposed to do
with one bag of nuts?

82
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,099
Share?

83
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,477
Wait, I have an idea. Spooner.

84
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:36,402
- Oh, my God!
- Oh! Fantastic! Nuts!

85
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,130
- I'm nuts about nuts.
- Thank you.

86
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:41,657
So, Computer Gideon has agreed
to let us all go home.

87
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,368
Why would she do that?

88
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,413
Because we are all retiring.

89
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,767
What do you mean "retiring"?

90
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,966
Well, I mean, we all return home,

91
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,010
and Computer Gideon
will monitor the timeline.

92
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,304
Sorry, stop being Legends?

93
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:04,972
Legends don't retire.

94
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:08,935
Except for Ray, and Nora
and Amaya and Jax.

95
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,229
- And Wally.
- And Mona.

96
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,688
- Charlie.
- And Mick.

97
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:14,398
Oh, don't forget the Hawk people.

98
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,609
Okay, Legends don't retire in bulk.

99
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:20,571
Isn't this exactly what you all wanted,
you see? To go home.

100
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,242
Yeah, but not to hand over the timeline
to an evil super computer.

101
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:27,706
Well, we all want the same thing,
the same goal. To protect the timeline.

102
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,765
Mmm-mmm, I think that's
what she wants us to think.

103
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,417
But the minute you let your guard down,
some psycho robots come and get you.

104
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,127
They don't trust you.

105
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,213
You mean the Legends refuse to retire?

106
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:41,175
No, no.
The Legends are hesitant.

107
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:42,885
You know, because, uh, up until now,

108
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,179
you've been very clear
about wanting to kill us.

109
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:46,639
Oh, I still do.

110
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,307
Oh. Great.

111
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,393
Okay, but herein lies the problem,
you know? Um...

112
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:56,399
Perhaps if you were to show them
their future, with them being alive...

113
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,502
they'd be more inclined to believe you.

114
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:01,153
Revealing one's future
could cause irreparable damage.

115
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,156
More damage than being stuck
in the temporal zone forever?

116
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,033
I'm listening.

117
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:09,412
All right. We need a new plan to shut
this computer down and get off the ship.

118
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,038
- How?
- There's the Jumpship.

119
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,416
No, it won't work with Gideon offline.

120
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,270
If only we had a Time Courier,
we could destroy the ship for good,

121
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:18,063
- and portal home.
- You mean like one of these?

122
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,858
You've just been carrying that around
the whole time?

123
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,717
I couldn't leave that in 1925.

124
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,011
Besides, it's still dead,
so it's still useless.

125
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:26,137
Wait.

126
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,780
I saw a charging station in the armory.

127
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,223
- You did not.
- I did.

128
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,475
It sounds like we have our plan.

129
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,228
We are here. We need to be here.

130
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,898
Correct. So, the best way to do that
is through the ducts.

131
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,858
We can move undetected this way.

132
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,361
If we only had someone
small enough to fit through them.

133
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,448
- I'll John McClane through these ducts.
- Mmm-hmm.

134
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,329
Ooh, okay, okay, complicated.

135
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:54,332
But you just need, like,
a portable paper version.

136
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,709
That's a great idea.
Gwyn, you got the drawing skills.

137
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,392
- Nate, help him out.
- Copy, my Captain.

138
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,087
Okay.

139
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,340
Okay, so, Spoons,
you're super safe in the ducts,

140
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,067
but once you drop into this room,
you're under surveillance.

141
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,092
Audio and video.

142
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,428
Video, I got you, no problem.
Audio is a little trickier.

143
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,323
There's microphones all over this ship.

144
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,849
So, even if I were to loop
the audio in the armory,

145
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,773
the mics in the hallway
will still pick you up.

146
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,102
You got to stay silent.

147
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,271
Okay. Well, what happens if I'm not?

148
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,650
Well, once you pass the bulkhead,
she can open the airlock

149
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,693
and eject you without
harming our Gideon.

150
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,172
Okay, got it. One fart,
and I'm sucked out of the temporal zone.

151
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,236
You are not going to fart.

152
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,508
And when you come back
with the Courier, Astra, you're up.

153
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,412
I can't put the ship back together,
but I sure as hell can blow it apart.

154
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,204
All righty, let's do this thing.

155
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,872
What... What can I do?

156
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:36,642
Listen up, everyone.

157
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,417
Oh.

158
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,628
- Hi.
- Gideon and I have a brilliant new plan.

159
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,588
To demonstrate her commitment
to your safety,

160
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,524
Computer Gideon will show you
a glimpse into your futures

161
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,717
as proof that you and the timeline
are in good hands.

162
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,386
Oh!

163
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,263
All right, Gideon,
we'll give it a shot. Right, guys?

164
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:52,765
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

165
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,600
Great. Meet me in the parlor. Yes?

166
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,895
Be right there. Bye!

167
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,481
Yes, this is perfect.

168
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,443
Then Evil Gideon will be distracted
while Spooner charges the Courier.

169
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,320
Hundred percent.
Z, looks like you're up.

170
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,524
Get to stalling. We could use
all the time we can get.

171
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:11,784
Are you excited?

172
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,285
I know I am.

173
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,579
Yeah, I'm something, Gary.
I'm something.

174
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,790
Have a seat.

175
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,501
All right, Gideon, we are ready.

176
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:23,295
Okay.

177
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:28,843
<i>Wow.</i>

178
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,388
<i>If you had told me ten years ago</i>

179
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:35,975
<i>that I would someday be
standing up here on this stage,</i>

180
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,853
<i>I would have been flabbergasted.</i>

181
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,896
Where's... Where's my Totem?

182
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,481
<i>- I can't...</i>
- Huh?

183
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,651
Oh. Uh, it must have
clashed with your outfit.

184
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:47,570
You're really serving looks.

185
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,923
You've become one of the most
successful people in the world,

186
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,908
and your makeup line accumulates
over $45 billion of revenue.

187
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,161
You're a cosmetic industry titan.

188
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,787
All right, Spooner.

189
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,182
Ready to get small and jam some signals?

190
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,291
Mmm-hmm.

191
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,251
This will create a 15-second video loop,

192
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,046
so set it up in the duct
before you enter the armory

193
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,714
and you'll be invisible.

194
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,800
All right, 15 seconds. Hmm.

195
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,470
Mmm.

196
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,545
All right, Spoons,
we'll buy you as much time as we can.

197
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,224
We can't stall forever. Hurry.

198
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,642
- Ooh. Thanks.
- Good luck.

199
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,144
No such thing.

200
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:28,923
- <i>Keep them talking, Z.</i>
- Um...

201
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,780
<i>Spooner needs
as much time as she can get.</i>

202
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,365
Is there, um... Is there anything else?

203
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,451
Um...

204
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,329
Well, there's, um... There's this.

205
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:39,830
Okay.

206
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:47,463
"Dragon girl changes the industry
with audible lipstick."

207
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,299
"You let your lips do the talking."

208
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,743
Is there anything else
you'd like to know about your future?

209
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:06,941
What? You're back here already?

210
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,654
Sorry, Aves. I had to bail on stalling.
That... That was a lot.

211
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,155
What is it?

212
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,032
Huh. That's impressive.

213
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:18,911
I don't know, it feels
pretty regressive to me.

214
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,498
I guess I was hoping
for something a little more heroic.

215
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,542
You look amazing. Babe, look at this.

216
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,377
Apparently, I stopped wearing my Totem.

217
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:29,957
That's okay, 'cause you're not
retiring anyway, right?

218
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,276
<i>Better hustle, Spooner.</i>

219
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,070
<i>Sooner or later,
we're all going to have to take a turn</i>

220
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:37,304
<i>looking at Computer Gideon's
magic eight ball.</i>

221
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,648
All righty.
I'm a little nervous, but...

222
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,817
Here we go.

223
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,573
<i>Hello, friend</i>

224
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,324
<i>We meet again</i>

225
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,493
<i>It's been too long</i>

226
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,207
<i>I can't remember
When we last saw each other</i>

227
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,084
<i>We were small</i>

228
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:19,263
Okay, Gideon, what you got for us, huh?
Swanky apartment in the sky,

229
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,932
maybe, uh, Ava's working
at a detective agency?

230
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,559
Gideon.

231
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,730
Oh, yes, well,
that's very charming.

232
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:34,778
<i>Tomorrow's better treated as today</i>

233
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:39,700
<i>Thank you.</i>

234
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,828
<i>I have been paying very close attention
to yourjourney,</i>

235
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,455
<i>and you've certainly come a long way.</i>

236
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,126
<i>Well, it's been an extraordinary ride,
to say the least.</i>

237
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:53,797
<i>Older age came with older dreams</i>

238
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:59,887
<i>But remember the past...</i>

239
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,640
Is this where I am to live then?
With Alun?

240
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,351
Oh, Gwyn, Alun can't...

241
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,103
Of course.

242
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,565
<i>You were right. Camp is awesome.</i>

243
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,152
<i>I've been learning archery,
and cataloging all the</i>...

244
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:18,197
<i>All the plants in my nature logbook.</i>

245
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,949
<i>And the mosquitoes aren't so bad.</i>

246
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:26,455
<i>We had spent many years apart
Keeping touch...</i>

247
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,707
<i>I stand with my constituents.</i>

248
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,961
<i>Freedom is not free until it is fair,</i>

249
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:35,214
<i>and I promise you,
I will level the playing field.</i>

250
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,566
<i>- Thank you.
- I have a question.</i>

251
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,927
You can return to 1925, live out
the rest of your days in Wales, and...

252
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:41,929
It'll be quite beautiful.

253
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,683
- Peaceful.
- Alone.

254
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,853
<i>Yes, tell us, what does it feel like
when you go through time?</i>

255
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,524
I mean, it's a 500-page book.

256
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,567
There was a lot. There was a lot.

257
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,695
<i>But knowing still</i>

258
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:04,034
<i>Your love never dies</i>

259
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,496
No, no, no. Where'd it go?

260
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,548
No...

261
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:19,883
The children love it.

262
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,136
I love it!

263
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:41,655
The pages are blank.

264
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:45,951
That would be cheating, Dr. Heywood.
You still have to actually write it.

265
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,750
<i>I can't wait to see you.
I love you. Mwah.</i>

266
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,377
<i>Bye, Mom. Bye, Mama. See you soon.</i>

267
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,384
That's our daughter?

268
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,058
Dude! Famous author?

269
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,437
<i>"Hero Moments. History from a man
who was there"?</i> Really?

270
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,483
I never said that out loud before,
but that is the title I picked out.

271
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,568
How could she know that?

272
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,403
Guys, what if these futures are real?

273
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:24,031
No, no, no, no. It can't be real.

274
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,366
Guys, it doesn't matter.

275
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,576
Okay? Even if they are real,
agreeing to these futures

276
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,871
would mean a computer
would dictate the rest of our lives,

277
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,498
and everyone else's in the timeline.

278
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,517
I'm not saying
we can't go after our dreams,

279
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,478
I'm just saying we have to focus
on what's most important.

280
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,961
Protecting the timeline. Right?

281
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,341
Let's just hope...
Spooner's got this one.

282
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:20,563
<i>Guys, I'm gonna need more time.</i>

283
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,214
Oh, this isn't good.

284
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,457
If Spooner doesn't show,
Gideon's gonna get suspicious.

285
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,468
Then I guess she'll just have to show.

286
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,679
I've got just the spell.

287
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,355
Hey.
So, uh, what you got for me, Giddy?

288
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,503
This.

289
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,010
What the hell is this?

290
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,553
You returned to 1925.

291
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,865
You live with your mother,
and together you found a clinic

292
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,307
that helps hundreds of people.

293
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,910
It's considered a milestone
in the discipline of mental healing.

294
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,854
So, I get to be with Gloria? My mom?

295
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,106
Of course.

296
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,150
Although, you exited
your original timeline.

297
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,569
Returning you to 1925
actually corrects an anomaly.

298
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,071
Okay, but just me and my mom?

299
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,992
- Yes.
- What about my friends?

300
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,459
Well, I'm afraid you wouldn't
see them anymore.

301
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,998
No one can leave their timelines
once dropped off.

302
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,085
So, I'd be alone again.

303
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,296
With your mother,

304
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,965
but, yes, alone and safe
in your intended timeline.

305
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:15,285
Alert! Intruder
in the armory. Lockdown initiated.

306
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,578
Crap. Spooner.

307
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,914
What have you done, Astra?
She's going to kill her.

308
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,837
- No!
<i>- You're right.</i>

309
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,256
<i>I am going to kill her.</i>

310
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,176
You gave me your word
you wouldn't hurt them.

311
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,012
<i>They betrayed you,
and worse, are trying to destroy me.</i>

312
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,597
<i>The truce has been broken.</i>

313
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,599
Let her out!

314
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,434
Open!

315
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,937
- No.
- Spooner!

316
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,069
Astra!

317
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,612
Help me!

318
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,322
Get back.

319
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,327
If you hurt her, I'm gonna
blow this door wide open

320
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,829
and we will all get sucked out!

321
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,040
No, no!

322
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,764
Including me! If you hurt Ms. Cruz,
then Ms. Logue's gonna kill me,

323
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,113
which goes against your protocol!

324
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,423
<i>So, I am prohibited from</i>

325
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,258
<i>flushing the tiny one
out of the airlock?</i>

326
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,467
Yes.

327
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,512
No, come on!

328
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,812
Hey. Hey.

329
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:24,938
Hey.

330
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,233
Thank you for threatening
to blow this place up for me.

331
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,957
- That's what best friends are for.
- Enough with the pleasantries.

332
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,530
This has to stop.
I'm calling a Captain's meeting.

333
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,908
This whole time,
all you've wanted was to go home.

334
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,712
I have arranged that.
What more do you want?

335
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,828
To keep the timeline safe.

336
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,246
That's rich.

337
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,916
You regularly put the timeline in danger
for your own personal dramas.

338
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,711
Yes, a time fascist
would see it that way.

339
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,296
That's rather harsh.

340
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:54,176
You sent military-style robots to
kill us after we integrated a factory.

341
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,054
I don't know, but I'd say fascist
feels pretty accurate.

342
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:00,432
- You were altering history, again.
- For the better.

343
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,017
- Yes.
- Okay, look, enough.

344
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,579
- You both have valid points.
- She has no valid point.

345
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,606
For the sake of the timeline,
we need to come to a compromise.

346
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,857
There's no compromise.

347
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,586
We're not going to let an algorithm
run the timeline, period. End of story.

348
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,862
And I won't let it be turned
into a plate of pie and mash

349
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,530
in service of the Legends' latest whim.

350
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,008
No one cares about your pie and mash.

351
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,951
Look, time needs to be in the hands
of someone who understands

352
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,536
that change is not the enemy.

353
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,806
Exactly. Someone who can balance
the variables of history

354
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,749
with... with compassion and heart.

355
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,376
A Legend.

356
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,544
It needs me.

357
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,673
And why would I take this deal?

358
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,049
Because you need a captain.

359
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:35,967
Per Time Master's protocol,

360
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,261
there must always be
one captain and one AI.

361
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,931
And I am the best
you are ever going to find.

362
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,563
- This is definitely a team decision.
- Mmm-hmm.

363
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,233
- What do you guys think?
- Are we really considering this?

364
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:53,819
Maybe she's right.

365
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,797
Maybe there's a better way
to protect the timeline.

366
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,781
- We are chaotic.
- Yeah, but chaotic good.

367
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,158
We are superheroes. We can't just quit.

368
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,620
It wouldn't be quitting. We'd be finding
new ways to help people. Could be cool.

369
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,289
I guess it would be
really nice to see my mom.

370
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah. Put down some roots.

371
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,252
I trust Gideon.

372
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:11,962
She's one of us.

373
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,965
It certainly seems like the plan
least likely to bring about our demise.

374
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,968
Demise? When has a little demise
ever stopped us?

375
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,893
This is the hard part
about being a superhero.

376
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,931
You have to do the right thing
even when it sucks.

377
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,183
But is it the right thing?

378
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,603
Guys, we're just
going to stop being Legends?

379
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,779
For the timeline, I think it is.

380
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,703
I swear to protect and defend
the integrity of the timeline

381
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,080
with all of my ability
until the end of my days.

382
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,252
And have
a little fun while doing it.

383
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,752
And have a little responsible fun
while doing it.

384
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,253
Yeah!

385
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,630
- Yeah, Giddy!
- Yeah! Go, Giddy!

386
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,968
Now, all of you, go sign your contracts.

387
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,813
<i>Poor old granddad</i>

388
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,524
<i>I laughed at all his words</i>

389
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,361
<i>I thought he was a bitter man</i>

390
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,906
<i>He spoke of women's ways</i>

391
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,743
<i>They'll trap you, then they use you</i>

392
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,454
<i>Before you even know</i>

393
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,916
<i>For love is blind
and you're far too kind</i>

394
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,210
<i>Don't ever let it show</i>

395
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:38,548
<i>I wish that I knew what I know now</i>

396
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,051
<i>When I was younger</i>

397
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:45,430
<i>I wish that I knew what I know now</i>

398
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,641
<i>When I was stronger</i>

399
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,352
<i>You'll have to learn, just like me</i>

400
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,813
<i>And that's the hardest way</i>

401
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:59,736
<i>Ooh la la, ooh la la la yeh</i>

402
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,740
What's going on?

403
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:05,826
You okay?

404
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,912
Look, I can feel your anger
from across the room.

405
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,083
What is the point of making friends

406
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,286
if you're just never going to
see them again, Spooner?

407
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,261
What if you could?

408
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,604
Now we can hang out
without having to break our contracts.

409
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,649
- It's not bad for an apprentice, huh?
- Apprentice who?

410
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,944
You are a full blown witch,
<i>mi grande amiga.</i>

411
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,704
Yo, yo,
I got a surprise.

412
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,416
- You get a key.
- What?

413
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,584
- You get a key.
- What?

414
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,378
You get a key,
and you get a key.

415
00:22:58,461 --> 00:22:59,647
- Pretty cool?
- Not bad.

416
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,190
- Now we all got a key.
- Yeah.

417
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,257
Hey.

418
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,884
Oh.

419
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,135
Uh, here.

420
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,362
Now you can visit us whenever you want.

421
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,850
I am really gonna miss you, Gideon.

422
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,729
I really hope I make you proud.

423
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,731
You already do.

424
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,030
I can't believe it.

425
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,616
Seven years on this ship.

426
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,659
Yeah. I'm really going to
miss this place.

427
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,080
- How cute was our kid, though? Huh?
- Oh.

428
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,224
Yeah, you know, there's a reason

429
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,893
we're not supposed to
look at our futures, babe.

430
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,294
Yes, by seeing our future,
we can change our futures.

431
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,212
Yes, I just don't want you
to get hurt is all.

432
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,798
Look, I know.
And it doesn't have to be a girl, okay?

433
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,759
Maybe we adopt, uh, six boys.

434
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:46,843
No, no, no.

435
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:52,682
I don't know. Just, like, seeing her
really made our future feel real.

436
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,602
- Yeah.
- And you know what?

437
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:58,396
Starting today,
we get to build a life together.

438
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,317
Get some curtains.
Maybe that porch we always wanted.

439
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,652
Okay, I wanted the porch.

440
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,528
Ooh. Maybe a dog.

441
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,991
- Look who's getting all domestic on me.
- Domestic. You know it.

442
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:15,121
So, I, uh... I really want
to say something before I go.

443
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:16,957
Okay.

444
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,376
You're the most amazing person
I've ever known.

445
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,461
You, uh...

446
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,657
You make the world more colorful.

447
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:25,961
You make food taste better.

448
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,637
I want you
to hear this for real this time.

449
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,348
I love you, Gideon.

450
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,060
Stay with me.

451
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,145
What?

452
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,941
The truth is, being a computer
makes me a better Captain,

453
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,276
but being with you...

454
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,363
makes me a better person.

455
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,668
So, everyone says
long-distance relationships suck.

456
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,378
You breaking up with me?

457
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:06,089
I mean, we've only been together
for, like, two days.

458
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,758
Time is so weird.

459
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:13,013
That's too bad, 'cause I already
planned our first date.

460
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:15,640
What was it?

461
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,559
I guess you have to show up to find out.

462
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,395
Ugh. Fine. I'll come.

463
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:25,775
Wait, did I just get hustled?

464
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,444
Mmm-hmm.

465
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,912
Hey, you must be excited
to have your own bathroom

466
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,622
after sharing one for three years.

467
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,083
Three years, wow.

468
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,295
Guess I thought there'd be more time.

469
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:49,215
Mmm. More time for, uh...
More time for what?

470
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,802
To be a hero, I guess.

471
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,851
It's hard, um...

472
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,855
living in the other Zari's shadow.

473
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,026
I mean, she changed the world.

474
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,614
She... She mattered.

475
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:17,660
Come on. You matter. You matter a lot.

476
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,246
Yeah, maybe to trend watchers

477
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,166
waiting to hear about
this year's hot nail trend,

478
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,710
or whatever audible lipstick is.

479
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,630
Yes, you are a fashion icon.

480
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,675
Right? But you're also a champion
of doing the right thing.

481
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,219
Do you remember Eddie?

482
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:39,140
- You saved his bar.
- I was just being helpful, not heroic.

483
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:44,521
My father, he was very big on legacy,
and so was I for a while,

484
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:48,441
but after years of
hero-ing through time,

485
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,568
do you know how
I'm going to be remembered?

486
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,030
For writing a book about other people.

487
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,286
My legacy, however... My legacy
is the life I get to make with Zari.

488
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,039
You make a difference.

489
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,209
But you make it your own way.

490
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,171
I guess I just wish I knew
what that was.

491
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,881
Thanks.

492
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:24,936
Are you nervous about seeing Alun?

493
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:27,856
I won't have Alun.

494
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:30,358
What?

495
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:35,572
I am returning to
the wild countryside alone.

496
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:40,076
- Albeit for some very majestical sheep.
- No, no, no. That's... What do you...

497
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,804
We need to talk to Gideon.
That wasn't the plan...

498
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,621
Now, Ms. Sharpe,
you and I both well know

499
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,707
that this is what history requires.

500
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,753
Now, Alun and I,
we will see each other again.

501
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:54,507
If not in this life, in the next one.

502
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,803
Gwyn, I really don't understand.

503
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,848
There was something
he always used to say to me in parting,

504
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,894
"In the river, I have seen you,

505
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:10,732
through love, age, and misery.

506
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:14,611
In the river, I will find you,

507
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,156
for you will always be you

508
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,618
and I will always be me."

509
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:30,043
"I will find you, for you will always
be you and I will always be me."

510
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,338
It's beautiful.

511
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,341
Yes.

512
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,551
Yes, it is.

513
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,261
Gwyn...

514
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,647
Hey, Z, can you, um,
help me with something?

515
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,899
A little, uh, surprise I have
for the team?

516
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:53,983
Yeah, sure.

517
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,227
Thanks. Let's go
talk someplace private.

518
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,243
I can't believe Gwyn's going home alone.

519
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,578
After everything he's done for us,

520
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:08,206
why should he have to live out
his entire life in misery?

521
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,750
- Aves?
- What?

522
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,461
- I can help.
- Z, it's not that...

523
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:15,755
Let me.

524
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,298
Okay.

525
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,594
The Legends are up to something,
and I have to stop them.

526
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,804
Ready the Jumpship.

527
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,847
And Gideon, no killing the Legends
while I'm gone.

528
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,291
- Is that an...
- Ha!

529
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,476
It's an order.

530
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:37,402
Okay, all we have to do now
is charge the Courier, jump to 1916,

531
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,925
and find a way to save Alun
while still breaking Gwyn's heart.

532
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,156
- The dog tags.
- Huh?

533
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,534
We go in before the attack,
I make a dust storm,

534
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,203
you grab Alun, leave his dog tags,

535
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,289
when Gwyn comes back,
he still thinks Alun's dead.

536
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,082
Brilliant. You're a freaking genius.

537
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,044
Okay, it's going to be a tight squeeze,
but I made Gwyn a promise.

538
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,838
Aves, this one's mine.

539
00:29:58,423 --> 00:29:59,507
It's my hero moment.

540
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,635
- Hair tie.
- Are you sure?

541
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,488
Yeah. I'm gonna get dirty.
I'm gonna crawl.

542
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:05,513
Okay.

543
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,515
Okay.

544
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:10,852
Hair.

545
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,813
Hair, blow dryer, bathroom.

546
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,274
- You okay?
- There's a blow dryer in the bathroom.

547
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,997
Yes, there's a blow dryer
in the bathroom.

548
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:19,485
It has a charger.

549
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,339
Who knew robots used hair dryers?

550
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,282
Well, did you see the lift
in Robo Nate's hair?

551
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,658
You can't 3D print that.

552
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,386
Now, we just wait.

553
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,121
Great, how long?
Because Sara has a very small bladder.

554
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,290
- It's ready.
- Huh.

555
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,293
We can never let Spoons know about this.

556
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,337
- Ever.
- Obviously.

557
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,339
Oh, dear!

558
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,882
Oh, my sincerest apologies.

559
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,343
I didn't realize that someone
was using the lavatory.

560
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:44,988
Gwyn, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

561
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,432
Gwyn, we're going to save Alun.

562
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,601
We made you a promise.

563
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:58,483
I am deeply, deeply moved
that you would all sacrifice

564
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:02,945
your own personal paradises
for me to have a chance to realize mine.

565
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,282
But, uh, I'm sorry, I must refuse.

566
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,288
- But why?
- The risk. The risk is too great.

567
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,290
It was a gruesome battle.

568
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,018
And I'm telling you now,
it is too dangerous.

569
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,336
- Just wait...
- You are my friends.

570
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,756
- Gwyn, we just want you to be happy.
- You deserve a chance at love. You...

571
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:27,470
And you would...
You would do that for me?

572
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:28,971
Yeah.

573
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,558
Well, all right, then,
you've convinced me.

574
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,687
- Yes. Let's go see...
- Gwyn?

575
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,691
Alun.

576
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:43,945
Alun.

577
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,708
They all died, didn't they?

578
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,422
Yes.

579
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,260
And what about me?

580
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:13,057
Well... in a way, yes.

581
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:15,226
You perished as well.

582
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,272
But I survived.

583
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,691
You are very much alive.

584
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,652
How?

585
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,489
Yes, well...
Um, you see, I...

586
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:33,327
I invented a method of time travel...

587
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,080
to save you.

588
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:38,082
To save me?

589
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:40,918
Yes.

590
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:42,962
Why?

591
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:47,216
I, uh...

592
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,972
I couldn't bear to live in a world
without you in it, Alun.

593
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,183
I couldn't.

594
00:32:57,685 --> 00:33:00,396
Anyway, it's...
It's a lot to take in, isn't it?

595
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,915
And I can't imagine
how you must be feeling now.

596
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,483
I should probably leave you in peace.

597
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,119
Uh...

598
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,622
I'm sorry, that was, uh...

599
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,894
That was foolish of me
to think that's what you wanted. I'm...

600
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:22,960
No, no, that's, uh...

601
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,923
It's what I've always wanted, you know.

602
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,886
I just...

603
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:38,809
"In the river, I will find you for..."

604
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:43,606
For?

605
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,150
For what?

606
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,864
"Well, for you will always be you,
and...

607
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:54,659
and I will always be me."

608
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,250
But of course I will.

609
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,668
Hmm?

610
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,211
Who else would I be, eh?

611
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:09,131
You odd, beautiful man.

612
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,471
Uh, what time? Wait.
What time did you say again?

613
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:18,641
- Why, you got plans?
- Uh, Sunday at 9:00, right?

614
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:19,725
Ooh, eesh...

615
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:23,980
Hate to be this guy,
but, uh, Zari and I have dinner

616
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,606
with Uncle Armajean, Sunday at 9:00.

617
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:29,402
Okay, here's a pitch.
What about Wednesdays at 8:00?

618
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:32,822
- Midweek parties are the best.
- What time zone?

619
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,491
Oh, that'd be, uh,
8:00 Eastern, 7:00 Central.

620
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:39,120
Only on the... Anyway,
it doesn't matter. I'll be there.

621
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:40,705
Where are we going?

622
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,749
Well, where we are going...
You see, time travel...

623
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,228
I'm going to miss you all so very much.

624
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:49,839
Ship's going to be so quiet.

625
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,801
Hey, well, you always got a team
if you need us.

626
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,054
Oh. We need to take a group picture.

627
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,889
- Let's do it!
- Group photo.

628
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:00,600
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

629
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:04,729
- Technology, and this...
- Alun, this is gonna blow your mind.

630
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,575
Pictures, they get taken
by something called digital...

631
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,858
Now, you just stand here and it will
take a picture of us all now together.

632
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:36,927
Okay.

633
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:41,057
So, tonight we dine in Paris.

634
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,392
I made us dinner.

635
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,913
<i>You mean, I made dinner.</i>

636
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,440
Well, yeah, yeah,
but I set up the twinklies.

637
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,859
Gary, it's wonderful.

638
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,785
<i>- Madame.</i>
- Oh. <i>Merci</i>.

639
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,663
Oh, wow.

640
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,749
So, for our first course,
we will be having

641
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:10,002
<i>crème de volaille a la berchoux.</i>

642
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:11,504
Oh.

643
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:14,215
- What is that?
- I... don't know.

644
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:18,219
I asked Gideon to make something fancy
and French and <i>voilà.</i>

645
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:20,137
Ooh! So talented.

646
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:23,906
<i>Why are you lying, Gideon?</i>

647
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,351
<i>You know what it is.</i>

648
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,228
You do?

649
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:31,399
Well, yes.
<i>Crème de volaille a la berchoux</i>

650
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:33,693
is a creamy chicken soup
with a lemon flavor,

651
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:35,653
named for French poet, Joseph Berchoux,

652
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:37,856
the man responsible for inventing
the word gastronomy.

653
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,991
Ah. So, then...

654
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,704
Why'd you, uh... Why'd you lie?

655
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,224
I just didn't want to
hurt your feelings,

656
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,624
Gary, by making you feel dumb.

657
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,794
Oh, no, never dim your light
to make me feel better.

658
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,171
Just don't lie.

659
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,134
Alun is a robot.

660
00:36:58,592 --> 00:36:59,593
What?

661
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:02,930
I went back to 1916, harvested his DNA
and printed a Robot Alun.

662
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,991
And then I used Gwyn's diary
from the historical records

663
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,726
to recreate his personality.

664
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:07,852
Why would you do that?

665
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,479
Look, I intended to save Alun,
but then I discovered

666
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,106
that Alun's death is a Fixed Point.

667
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:14,334
Ava and Zari were
trying to go back to save him.

668
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:15,478
They would have been killed.

669
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:19,363
It's the only thing I could do to keep
the Legends and the timeline safe.

670
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:23,242
By lying to Gwyn? By lying to all of us?

671
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:24,493
They can't know.

672
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,164
They're Legends. They'd break time
before they'd break his heart.

673
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,250
Do you hate me?

674
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,838
What? No. No, of course not.
I just, uh...

675
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:39,425
I, uh...

676
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,595
I need some time to, uh... to think.

677
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,598
To think about what?

678
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:49,643
Well, uh, if these are the kinds
of decisions you have to make,

679
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,670
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

680
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,281
Why is love so complicated?

681
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,158
<i>Because oxytocin,</i>

682
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,553
<i>the hormone excreted
when you feel love for another person,</i>

683
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:09,914
<i>creates an unstable duality in the human
brain of happiness and fear.</i>

684
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:13,292
<i>Right now, you are torn between anger
at Gideon for betraying you...</i>

685
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,919
- Yes.
<i>- ...and a desire to apologize,</i>

686
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,504
<i>since you don't want to lose her.</i>

687
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:17,588
Right.

688
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:20,466
Mmm.

689
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,277
<i>Humans think
they want to know everything,</i>

690
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,428
<i>but when they find out,
they're disappointed.</i>

691
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,389
<i>- You made the right decision.</i>
- Well, I wish Gary saw it that way.

692
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,728
Oh, no. You're missing the point.

693
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:36,482
No, love is complicated,
because people are complicated.

694
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:42,571
Learning how to love another person
can be messy and painful,

695
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,824
but in the end, if you can make it work,

696
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,700
it's the most beautiful thing
in the world.

697
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,720
<i>The timeline
cannot be ruled by emotions.</i>

698
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:51,038
<i>It must be protected
by clear-headed logic.</i>

699
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:55,501
<i>If you do love Gideon,
then for her sake, I suggest you leave.</i>

700
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:01,674
But I don't want to choose
between Gary and my job.

701
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,820
<i>You're going to have
to make difficult decisions every day.</i>

702
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:07,972
- What if he leaves, huh?
<i>- Then you know the man he truly is.</i>

703
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:14,979
I do love her.

704
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,567
Which is why I'm staying.

705
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:24,029
She needs someone to advocate
for all the things

706
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,713
that have nothing to do with logic,
like tolerance, like kindness,

707
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,826
forgiveness and... love.

708
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,849
I want to start the rest of my life
with that incredible woman.

709
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,249
And I want to start it now!

710
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,006
Where is she?

711
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,174
<i>She's in the armory.</i>

712
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,801
The armory. Okay. Yeah.

713
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:47,677
Thank you.

714
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:50,556
Gideon?

715
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,787
<i>You and your
obsession with love</i>

716
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,605
<i>pose too great a risk to the timeline.</i>

717
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:58,689
- I'm not...
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

718
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,822
I'm sorry to inform you, Captain,

719
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,575
Mr. Green has left the <i>Waverider.</i>

720
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:16,624
It's for the best.

721
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,961
A captain and an AI,
the way it was meant to be.

722
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:35,768
I... What is that?

723
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,603
That is my time machine.

724
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:43,150
Oh, Gwyn, it's a divine masterpiece.

725
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,947
You know, when I lost you,

726
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,661
I vowed to move Heaven and Earth
until you were saved.

727
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,207
Which is why I have to do this.

728
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,468
I'm coming for you, my boy.

729
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,222
I'm coming.
