00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,160
Hey, come see this.
Alma is causing trouble again.

3
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
Is she crazy?

4
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,640
-Fuck, that's wild.
-She's gone too far.

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,680
Has she no shame?

6
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,120
-And I bet it's a lie.
-I don't get why she does it.

7
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Fuck, Mai, she's crazy.

8
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,520
She'll get expelled for this.

9
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
Screw her.

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,560
-Should I call her parents?
-No.

11
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,440
It's unacceptable.

12
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,440
I'm calling the police.

13
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,600
BEWARE! A RAPIST IS HIDING IN THERE!

<i>This is me</i>

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,000
<i>before I was raped.</i>

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,320
The first wife defined him as an idiot.

23
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,640
The second...

24
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,160
JANUARY 2018
FOUR MONTHS EARLIER

25
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,600
Alberto, here.

26
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,200
...accused him of being a pervert.

27
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
The third fainted on the wedding night
on seeing the size of his member.

28
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Hang on.

29
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,720
And when she came to,
she got out of there.

30
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,560
The fourth

31
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,840
forced him to use a cushion with a hole

32
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,000
to have intercourse.

33
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,440
So, here's my question.

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,600
Who can tell me the nickname

35
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,920
of this magnificent specimen?

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
No one?

37
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,680
"The Desired."

38
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,000
Hang on, guys.
For tomorrow, read up on his reign,

39
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,320
and find out why The Desired

40
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,480
was deeply detested by his wives

41
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,440
and by his people too. Okay? Right, bye.

42
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,080
Alma.

43
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
What did you think of the class?

44
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,000
Fascinating.

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,720
<i>Have you ever wondered what they'll say
about you when you're gone?</i>

46
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
<i>Halfway through that last year,
I'd have said</i>

47
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,440
<i>that all that would be left of me
would be a few anecdotes</i>

48
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,080
<i>that people would tell
at high school reunions.</i>

49
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
<i>Like that time</i>

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,120
<i>I flattened a bully with one punch.</i>

51
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,720
<i>Or the time I got caught making out
with a guy in the bathroom.</i>

52
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,120
<i>Or the most famous of all,</i>

53
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,480
<i>when I burned my uniform
at the end of junior high.</i>

54
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,360
<i>I'd actually been the star
of some good times,</i>

55
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,360
<i>though none so extraordinary</i>

56
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,920
<i>that people would remember
my name or my face years later.</i>

57
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,200
<i>But what happened later
was very different.</i>

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,880
I'll put you through to the team.

61
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
<i>What happened at the end of that year
changed everything.</i>

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
<i>No one will ever forget that.</i>

63
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,760
Bro, Canada is fucking dope.

64
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,240
The universities there
have great campuses.

65
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,920
I'm totally sure.
I'm going to do business studies there.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
What are you going to do?

67
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,160
I want to convince my parents
to let me go to the same university.

68
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Long-distance doesn't work.

69
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
What'll she do?

70
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,160
I don't know. But I doubt very much
that bitch will graduate.

71
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,760
Watch it, she's my friend.

72
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,480
It's the damned truth.

73
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,320
I wonder when she'll mess up again.

74
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,360
It's sick.

75
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,920
-See you later.
-Okay.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,960
-What's up, Hernán?
-What's up?

77
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,400
-What are you up to this weekend?
-The usual, I guess. And you?

78
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,400
I'm meeting the guys in the park. Drop by.

79
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,320
Okay.

80
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,760
It's my last one. Shall we light up?

81
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,720
No.

82
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,440
Things are hard enough already
without complicating them even more.

83
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,360
Right.

84
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,920
Yesterday I did a mix.
I stayed up really late.

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
-Really?
-I don't know.

86
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,840
-See what you think.
-Let's hear it.

87
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,440
Ready.

88
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,360
<i>I know I've already lost you</i>

89
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,480
Hey,

90
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,480
it's pretty good, huh?

91
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,280
-I like it.
-You like it?

92
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Yeah, it's cool.

93
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,960
-Shall I send it to you?
-Yes, please.

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,480
Cool.

95
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,920
You'll be one of the few things
I'll miss about school.

96
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,240
Don't get mushy on me.

97
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,160
See you later, Alma.

98
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,720
You got that straight, wise guy? Get lost.

99
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,160
Alma.

100
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,760
Hello.

101
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,800
Was that a joint you threw away there?

102
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,240
No, it was a cigarette.

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,320
Really, you can check.

104
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,960
You were a bit distracted in class today.

105
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,120
You know you can count on us
if you have any problems, right?

106
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,840
Yeah. I didn't sleep very well.

107
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Allergy problems.

108
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,160
Thanks all the same.

109
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,360
Cooper!

110
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,440
Cooper, come here!
What's up with you? Such a cutie.

111
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,280
{\an8}SCREW YOU ALL

112
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,640
{\an8}GRETA:
SEE YOU LATER AT THE MALL?

113
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,680
{\an8}YEP

114
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
Shit.

115
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
Cooper, got any papers?

116
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
Great.

117
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,480
Totó! So you had them all the time, huh?

118
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,480
Police central operations unit.
How can I help you?

119
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,720
I'll put you through.

120
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,760
Hello.

121
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,960
-I was trying to roll a cigarette, but...
-Give it here.

122
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,320
Now give me that.

123
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,120
Alma.

124
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,120
-Don't worry, I'll be here.
-Okay.

125
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,640
Will long hairs come out of there?

126
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,920
Yeah, it's normal. It's called "puberty."

127
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,560
If I don't have any yet,
can I still go to school on my own?

128
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,960
Why don't you want us to go with you?

129
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,800
They let Hugo go alone.

130
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,240
Damn Hugo.

131
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,720
Go change.

132
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,640
I'll see if there's mail.

133
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,800
Shouldn't you be studying?

134
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,200
I didn't sleep well with my allergies.

135
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,840
Tidy up your room, please.

136
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,040
I found some really cool sneakers
in an online store.

137
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
Can I have the card?

138
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,520
They're new. I'm not buying more sneakers.

139
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,320
But these are on sale.

140
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,920
Right, and these are new.

141
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,200
You could listen to me for once, right?

142
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,400
Just to change the dynamic.

143
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,760
You only order me around.

144
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,360
Clean up this mess.

145
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,160
You see?

146
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,920
Like I said.

147
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,160
Hold tight, okay?

148
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Don't cut yourself.

149
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Gee!

150
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,880
Look, I have a super cauliflower.

151
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,040
It looks like a mushroom cloud.

152
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,760
-I'll show it to Mom.
-Okay.

153
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
In you go.

154
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,560
-Can I get my allowance?
-Did you study?

155
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,480
Yes.

156
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,560
-Did you clean up your room?
-Yes.

157
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,200
Should I check?

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,960
-I'm going to miss the bus.
-You're always missing the bus.

159
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,520
Right.

160
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,840
-Be back by 12:00.
-What?

161
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
My friends get home much later.

162
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,800
I don't care
how your friends' parents raise them.

163
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,240
While you live with us,
those are the rules.

164
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,480
Dammit, Alma, about time.

165
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,280
Aren't you my favorite person?

166
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,160
Did I ever tell you
how cute you are, how hot you are,

167
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,760
what a good friend you are,
how good that jacket looks?

168
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,720
How do you do it? You're always...

169
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,400
You're sweet-talking me.
Where have you come from?

170
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,040
-From the park.
-Dammit, Alma.

171
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,560
So, what did I miss?

173
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,360
A new chapter of <i>Wake Up
and Drop That Asshole Once and For All.</i>

174
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,280
Dammit.

175
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,400
If I ever make a fool of myself like this,

176
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,400
I give you permission
to slap me all you like.

177
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,760
-Really?
-Yeah.

178
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,520
Even the day you pooed in kindergarten,
you played it cool.

179
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,320
-Right.
-You even held up your hand.

180
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,120
You're the best friend in the world.

181
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,920
Wow.

182
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,960
Some tits!

183
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,680
It's disgusting.

184
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
It's obscene.
They shouldn't be left like that.

185
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
Something's going on in there.

186
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,680
No, they should put something on them.
Panties or whatever.

187
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,480
The other day I had a dream.

188
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,000
I was naked in the street,

189
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,480
on all fours,
with a girl leading me on a leash.

190
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,320
As if I was a dog.

191
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,320
I woke up dripping wet.

192
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,880
You have to stop watching
that "femmedo" porn.

193
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,880
-"Femdom."
-"Fromedom."

194
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,320
-It's rotting your brain.
-Hey.

195
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,360
-Dammit.
-You were the one who wanted to come.

196
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,520
-Go to hell.
-What? You go to hell.

197
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,280
-Shut the fuck up.
-You shut up.

198
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,680
What's wrong with you? You're going
to scream in my face right here?

199
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,400
-You have no idea who I am.
-Really?

200
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,400
No.

201
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,160
Well, I'd say I know you well.

202
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,000
Fuck you.

203
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,320
No, Nata!

204
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,720
-Leave me alone.
-Nata, please listen to me.

205
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,160
-What a nightmare.
-Hang on.

206
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,160
Nata, will you listen to me, dammit?

207
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
-You're hurting me!
-Just a second.

208
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,040
You're fucking hurting me!

209
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,160
Asshole.

210
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
I just want to ask you
some questions, okay?

211
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,600
Who is ColemanMiller?

212
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,120
I am.

213
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm ColemanMiller.

214
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,840
Are you the person
in the photos on that profile?

215
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,360
Yes.

216
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,880
I'm going to read your first post.

217
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,640
"This is me before I was raped."

218
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,440
Did you write it?

219
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,760
Goddammit!

220
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,760
-Did he hurt you?
-No, it's okay.

221
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,400
I'm fucking sick of him
and his shitty matches.

222
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,840
Nata, he's a fucking narcissist.

223
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,720
I'll fuck a guy tomorrow and post a photo.

224
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,400
What's wrong?

225
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,640
You won't do that.

226
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,640
We've seen loads of your fights,
and it's always the same.

227
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,080
You get over it the next day
and go back to him.

228
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,280
Well, I've said it.

229
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,680
Maybe this time is different.

230
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,320
I don't know, you deserve better.

231
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,200
But hey, if you forgive him,
I'll love you the same.

232
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,200
So cute.

233
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,960
Hey, are you all right?

234
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,200
Yeah, Susanita's weed has hit me a bit.

235
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,760
Don't sweat it. Try this.

236
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,240
It gets you wasted
with a touch of acid. You'll see.

237
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,600
Well?

238
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,840
It's good, right?

239
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,960
-Right.
-I'll go get some air.

240
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,880
Off you go.

241
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,560
Alma?

242
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,720
Hi.

243
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,560
It's Berta.

244
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,960
-Jeez.
-Is something wrong?

245
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,480
No. Berta.

246
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,560
Sorry, that kid reminds me of...

247
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,880
Boo from <i>Monsters, Inc.?</i>

248
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,560
Remember we saw that movie
at one of my birthday parties?

249
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,240
Never mind. How are you?

250
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,480
Great. The usual.

251
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
Your eyes are red,
like you've been crying.

252
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,880
No, I'm fine.

253
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,520
How are you? It's been a while.

254
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,840
Sure, I hang out more
downtown now, you know?

255
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,960
Yeah, arts high school is amazing.

256
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,440
I guess being surrounded by artists,

257
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,120
I'm developing my own creativity.

258
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,080
Do you like it?

259
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,200
-I made it.
-It's cool.

260
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,680
In the school workshop.
We're experimenting with brass,

261
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,280
and with silver too.

262
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,000
I can make you one if you like.

263
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,880
-No.
-No, take this one.

264
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,720
-There's really no need.
-There is.

265
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,320
I want you to have it.

266
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,800
I mean it.

267
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,920
It's bad for me to say it,
being the designer,

268
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,480
but it's gorgeous.

269
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,520
-Hello, Alma. It's been ages.
-How are you?

270
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,560
Honey, we have to go.

271
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,160
My mom's right, it's been ages.

272
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,480
That's not good. Should I call you?

273
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,360
Smile. I don't like seeing you like this.

274
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,160
-Bye, Alma.
-Ciao.

275
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,560
We need to talk.

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,840
Jeez.

277
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,560
Was that Berta?

278
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,240
I wouldn't know her.

279
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,880
She told me she wants to talk.

280
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,240
About what?

281
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
I can't take it anymore.
We argue, he keeps yelling at me.

282
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,040
We used to have moments on our own,

283
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,160
but for months now,

284
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,120
we have his damn posse hanging around,
and it's shitty.

285
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,280
We need to talk.

286
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,520
Alma, are you okay?

287
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,400
Just a bit tired.

288
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,960
I understand.

289
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,840
I know it's hard,

290
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,640
but to open an investigation,
I need you to talk to me.

291
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,240
I know that. It's just...

292
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,680
<i>It's yours for 200.
Your dad has lots of money.</i>

293
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,640
<i>Shut up. Give me the goddamn bag.</i>

294
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,320
Lunch!

295
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,120
Coming.

296
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,000
Pasta is my favorite food.

297
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,200
Mine too.

298
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,080
How was your exam the other day?

299
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Good.

300
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,440
You need to improve your grades
or it'll be hard to pass.

301
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,280
You always say the same,
but I've never repeated, right?

302
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,840
-What time did you go to bed last night?
-Dunno.

303
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,760
You were still awake at 3:00.
I heard you on the phone.

304
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,440
Greta called. It wasn't that late.

305
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
You got up at 12:00.

306
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,120
-It's Saturday, Dad.
-So?

307
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
You could've studied, just a bit.

308
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,840
I'm studying, okay? Really. I promise.

309
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,400
I'll pass everything in June.

310
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,280
-It's delicious, Mom.
-Passing is not enough.

311
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,040
You should try harder
if you want a good average.

312
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,680
We've talked about how important
this time is for your future.

313
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,720
-What'll you do?
-I don't know.

314
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,120
It's January. What are you waiting for?

315
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,000
For June?

316
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,000
-What will we do then?
-I don't know!

317
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,400
I'd love to know.
It'd be a lot easier, but I don't!

318
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,160
I'm sorry.

319
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,240
However much you hassle me,
I won't know, okay?

320
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,560
I won't eat lunch with you again.

321
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,920
Shit.

322
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
Goddammit.

323
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,160
-Can I stay over?
<i>-Let me talk to Greta's mom.</i>

324
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,840
No. Mom, come on. I'm 17 years old.

325
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,600
It's embarrassing to ask permission
to stay the night.

326
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,320
<i>Fine, but I want you here tomorrow
first thing to study. Okay?</i>

327
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,320
Okay. Ciao.

328
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Dammit.

329
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,200
Alma...

330
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,600
-Your mom is cool.
-She's all yours.

331
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,880
-I can't stand her.
-You're dumb.

332
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,680
Seriously, she always sides with Dad,

333
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,800
even though she knows he's wrong.
I feel like hitting her sometimes.

334
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,400
Well,

335
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,160
it's not easy being a mom.

336
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,880
Nata.

337
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,440
Rolling over!

338
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,640
Asshole.

339
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,760
-Hi, how are you?
-Hi.

340
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,680
Nata!

341
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,160
-Hi, how are you?
-Come on, hurry.

342
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,760
-Come on.
-Take it out now!

343
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,320
-Right, okay. Are you ready?
-I can't wait.

344
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,240
-Ready?
-Yes.

345
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,440
Just a second.

346
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,760
Ta-da!

347
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,240
Where the hell did you get that?

348
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,440
A shoebox under my mom's bed.

349
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,680
-Your mom's?
-Yeah.

350
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,520
-You'll end up boarding if she finds out.
-She has no clue.

351
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,960
Her Padel tennis buddies
will have given it to her.

352
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,360
Hey, she really likes big dicks, huh?

353
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,320
-Yep.
-Yep.

354
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,360
-Check this out.
-God!

355
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,560
Eighteen centimeters of pure masculinity.

356
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,080
-It's all mine.
-Nata, someone has used that.

357
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,560
No, no way.

358
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,920
It looks real, right?

359
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,040
-I don't know.
-Right?

360
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,400
I don't know.
I haven't tried as many as you.

361
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,000
Olé!

362
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,440
Hey, watch it!

363
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
Run!

364
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,920
Giddyap!

365
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,800
-Sorry!
-Get up! You're so hot.

366
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,120
Let's take some dirty pics.

367
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,440
Get down and dirty.

368
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,880
-Dammit.
-What's wrong?

369
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
Every couple has arguments. It's normal.

370
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,280
The main thing is we love each other.

371
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,760
Dammit.

372
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
-Come on.
-Okay.

373
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,400
Hi, babe.

374
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,000
<i>Hi, sweetheart. How are you?</i>

375
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,800
Why aren't you wearing pants?

376
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,160
Come on, downstairs.

377
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,360
Let's go see David.

378
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,520
We'll do a...

379
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,280
-Hi.
-Hi.

380
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,320
So quiet.

381
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,160
-Hi.
-Hi.

382
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,200
Hello.

383
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,480
-What are you up to?
-Dying of boredom.

384
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,360
Right.

385
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,240
Hey, can I have some?

386
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,520
We'll smoke in the garden.

387
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,080
Papers.

388
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,920
Papers.

389
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,680
-Thanks.
-Not at all.

390
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,960
What's that drawing?

391
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
I'll be outside.

392
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,320
It's not a drawing. It's a text in Tamil.

393
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,880
One of the three languages in Sri Lanka.

394
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,480
It means "bon voyage."

395
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,040
Are you sure?

396
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,440
Maybe you were scammed.

397
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,720
Maybe it says,
"I'm a fool who thinks he's cool

398
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,680
and has no fucking clue about Tamil."

399
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Yeah, could be.

400
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,920
I have a tattoo too.

401
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,840
-Will you show me?
-No.

402
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,160
No, it's not a good idea.

403
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,720
You know? I don't want to intimidate you.

404
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,120
I've got it in a secret place,
and it's much cooler than yours.

405
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,400
What did I miss?

406
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,120
Well?

407
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,600
-I got my panties wet.
-Right.

408
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
I think for just one second,

409
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,800
I'd bet my tit on it,
he was flirting with me.

410
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,760
Really?

411
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,200
My brother is so damn lucky.

412
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,720
Can I not flirt a bit too?

413
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
-Nothing.
-No? Dammit.

414
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,200
No, but you know,
you do it better every time.

415
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,840
Right. Well, I'll just keep trying.

416
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,720
ALBERTO:
SEND ME A DIRTY PIC

417
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,520
Alma, did you make this story up?

418
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,920
No.

419
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,320
So, tell me what happened.
You're the only one who knows the truth.

420
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,840
I'm going to class.

421
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,640
Hernán.

422
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,840
-Hey!
-What's up?

423
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,720
You didn't come to the park Friday.
Is everything okay?

424
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,720
Yeah, I had to study.

425
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,760
I wanted to ask you
about the guys in that pimped car.

426
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,320
-Kevin and Jota, right?
-What about them?

427
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,600
You tell me. The other day
it looked like you had problems.

428
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,480
No way. They're buddies.

429
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,400
Man...

430
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,680
We've known each other since grade school.
You know you can trust me, right?

431
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I know.

432
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,080
It's nothing sketchy.

433
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,200
But it's great you worry about me.

434
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,680
Hush up.

435
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,840
Next weekend
there's a techno party at Industry.

436
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,400
We could go together.

437
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,760
I don't know. I'll see.

438
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,240
I'm sure you've heard talk
about "post-truth."

439
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,000
It's in fashion now.

440
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,840
It was the word of the year in 2016.

441
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,120
Would anyone like to give
an example to clarify it...?

442
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,200
<i>The results of the makeup exams
are not good.</i>

443
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,080
She failed six exams
in the second evaluation.

444
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,800
It'll be hard for her to pass.

445
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,440
Even if she does,
we doubt she'll be able to sit her SATs.

446
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,600
Alma's attitude is not good.

447
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,600
She's not difficult, but

448
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,000
she's distracted.

449
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,520
We were wondering
if you have any trouble at home.

450
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,480
What kind of trouble?

451
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,720
The crisis has affected kids
more than expected.

452
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,600
A bad financial situation can affect them.

453
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,200
We have no financial worries.

454
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,520
And between you?

455
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,080
Everything okay?

456
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,440
Yes, it's all fine.

457
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,640
We just want to understand
what's going on.

458
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,280
She doesn't have to top the class,

459
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,840
but until now, her grades were good.

460
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,240
She'd take part in class.

461
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,160
Even if only to complain,
but she took part.

462
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,680
Could she be fooling with drugs?

463
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,360
-What?
-No.

464
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,640
The other day, we saw her smoking.

465
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,400
We think it wasn't tobacco.

466
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,120
Maybe you should talk to her.

467
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,560
Thanks. Ciao.

468
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
-Catch.
-So?

469
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,880
All right. David.

470
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,960
He knows the record company executive
who's organizing the party.

471
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,480
-Okay.
-He gave him two VIP passes.

472
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,200
One for you and another for me.

473
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,240
For me?

474
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,600
Yeah, "for Alma,"

475
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,560
literally.

476
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,120
But will David be there or not?

477
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,160
Sure, he's the party's
official dealer or something.

478
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,760
Great.

479
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,840
-Mad...
-You can scream.

480
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,640
-I know you want to fuck him.
-Great! We're partying with David!

481
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,320
She's had it.

482
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,440
GRETA: DO YOU HAVE CLOTHES??? NO TRACKSUIT
OR I WON'T GIVE YOU YOUR INVITE

483
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:48,200
GRETA: AND PUT ON CUTE PANTIES,
MY BROTHER WILL THANK YOU

484
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,680
OR I CAN GO WITHOUT PANTIES

485
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,400
GRETA:
HAHAHAHAHA

486
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,320
Where were you?

487
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,080
-In the library with Greta.
-We need to talk.

488
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,280
Mom, I'm wiped out.

489
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,000
Alma, we had a meeting with your tutor.

490
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,640
What the hell's wrong with you?

491
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,080
You've been fooling us for months.

492
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,360
What are you really doing
when you say you're studying?

493
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,720
Nothing. I can't concentrate.

494
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,400
I'm not into what we do in class.

495
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,360
Are you taking drugs?

496
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,520
What? No.

497
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,480
Nothing? No joints, no pills, no cocaine?

498
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,920
Cocaine?

499
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,400
You know how long
I'd have to save for a gram of coke?

500
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,720
You know how much it costs?

501
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,960
Everybody knows.

502
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,080
Okay, sometimes I have a puff
because my friends smoke.

503
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,320
I don't, I swear.

504
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,280
When was the last time?

505
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,120
I don't know.
Maybe the New Year's Eve party.

506
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,800
No way.

507
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,080
The test only detects drugs
you've taken in the last eight days.

508
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,960
You haven't smoked
since New Year's Eve. Right?

509
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
It must be wrong.

510
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,880
You can't even see the red line.

511
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,400
-You're grounded.
-Dammit.

512
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,720
And you're going to graduate.

513
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,320
TUESDAY

514
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,800
WEDNESDAY

515
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,320
THURSDAY

516
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,000
FRIDAY

517
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,240
GRETA: WHAT ABOUT THE PARTY?
SHALL WE CANCEL?

518
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,680
NO WAY!!!

519
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,960
No!

520
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,880
Stop!

521
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,000
Stop!

522
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,480
No!

523
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,320
No, son of a bitch.

524
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,440
Shit!

525
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,360
{\an8}GRETA:
WHERE ARE YOU?

526
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,120
{\an8}ABOUT TO CATCH THE BUS

527
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,680
{\an8}GRETA: WE HAVE TO BE ON TIME
OR MY BROTHER'LL KILL US

528
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,640
{\an8}OK

529
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,600
Did you miss the bus, Alma?

530
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,560
I'm waiting.

531
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,160
You'll freeze to death.

532
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,040
We'll take you.
We're going through town anyway.

533
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,760
Come on.

534
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,880
Get in.

535
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,440
MOM: ALMA, COME HOME RIGHT NOW.
DON'T MAKE THINGS WORSE... TURN AROUND NOW!!

536
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,160
