00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,640
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,840
- Hello, John.
- You opened the door, love.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,120
And Mallus wasn't the only thing
that got out.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,360
Now there's magic.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,400
The damage that these supernatural
fugitives can cause is unfathomable.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
How much money do you need?

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,000
4.2 billion a year.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,960
Done. I'm going to green-light
additional funding

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,240
to fast-track the completion
of your containment facility.

10
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,280
Hi, I'm your magical caretaker.

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,680
Your creature-handler, she's great.

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,440
- Mona.
- Konane.

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,600
Did someone hurt you?

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,360
These creatures are controllable.

15
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,520
Project Hades is go.

16
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,760
Stop!
Where are you taking him?

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,160
Oh, thank God you're back.

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,520
What is going on?

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,920
Long story, lots of twists and turns.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,120
Some dramatic irony.

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,240
Cliff notes, Gary.

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,360
- The Kaupe is out.
- Director Sharpe!

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,800
Gary, take him down to lockup.

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,800
What an adorable little puppet.

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,400
Eat my fuzzy dung, you stick!

26
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,840
Well, well, well...

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,480
Look who finally decided
to show up for work.

28
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,480
Nice of you to grace us with
your presence, Director Sharpe.

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,120
One of your employees
let a creature loose

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,760
and then, not surprisingly,
got attacked by it.

31
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,160
Wait, Mona let him out?
Why would she...

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,600
I want that wolfman back in his cell,
or you're done.

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,040
And fire that girl.

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,200
Of all the days this could happen.

35
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,320
All right, everyone.

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,360
Screen all calls
to Animal Control and 911.

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,000
Pull CCTV from every corner
in a 10-mile radius.

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,880
- Let's go!
- Yes, ma'am.

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,000
Don't listen to him

40
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,320
Sara, he's right.

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
I never should have left Mona
in charge of those Fugitives.

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,680
I should have been here,

43
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,120
and instead I was off gallivanting
like a...

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,000
Like a Legend?

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
Look, we are on this.

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,320
That Kaupe doesn't stand a chance.

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,480
I will fix this.

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,880
Our potty-mouthed puppet
is locked up.

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,640
Wonderful, because I've got another
job for you, Gary.

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,560
But you're not going to like it.

51
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,360
Mom, Dad? What's going on?

52
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,360
You were in a cycling accident.

53
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,560
I wasn't on a bike.
I was scratched by...

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,800
Konane, no!

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Oh, no. He's out there alone.

56
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,520
- Who?
- I... I can't talk about it.

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
It's work-related, top secret.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,920
We have failed as parents!

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,240
It's all your fault!

60
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,160
Gary, oh, my God.
I'm happy to see you.

61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,600
My parents won't believe
what I really do for work.

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,720
Oh, you mean betraying the people
that gave you a chance?

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,320
Ava believed in you,
and you let her down.

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
You let us all down.

65
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,320
Gary, what are you talking about?

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,440
You released a dangerous beast,
and now he's out there running free!

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,640
Wait, you think I let the Kaupe out?

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,720
It was the Men in Black!
Didn't you see the bodies?

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,080
No, there was only footage of you,
letting Hairy Hunkman out.

70
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,880
And now there's me telling you...

71
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,000
you're fired.

72
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,760
You can't fire me.

73
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,120
I swear, there were two men
who came for Konane,

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,240
but he killed them.

75
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm sorry, Mona.
I really liked you, you know?

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
And I know it hurts now,

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
but in a few seconds,
you won't remember a thing.

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,240
- Don't you dare. I need my mind!
- Hey, let go!

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,960
You do not have clearance
to handle this device!

80
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
You can't take my memories!

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,400
What was I doing here?

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,840
You're here to give me your jacket.

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,280
Right, right, right.

84
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
And also, you were going to give me
your Time Courier.

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,480
Oh, yeah.

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,080
Now take my place.

87
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,320
It's almost lunchtime.

88
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,080
Oh.

89
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,160
Ooh, Jello!

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,520
{\an5}I know you're there.

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,680
{\an5}Stop following me,
or I'll turn your brain into pudding!

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,320
Konane?

93
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,960
You're alive!

94
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,920
I was so worried they'd find you.

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,320
Don't worry about that.

96
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,640
I know you didn't mean to hurt me.

97
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,840
It's them! Run!

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,760
Run!

99
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,160
I won't let them get you.

100
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,640
I'll close this behind you
so they won't be able to follow.

101
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,360
- Mona.
- I have to keep you safe, go!

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,240
Mona!

103
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Mona!

104
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
You're safe. We're the good guys.

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,680
Oh, yeah, who sent you?

106
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,840
Was it the Bureau
or the Men in Black?

107
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,520
Where is the wolfman?

108
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
He's gone, it's too late.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,480
You'll never find him, because
I don't even know where he went,

110
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,000
so grill me all you want.

111
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,160
You...

112
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,720
What kind of gun is this?

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
Did you just try to shoot her,
shoot her?

114
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,240
Any hits?

115
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,720
{\an5}I tried to isolate the portal
from today's Courier activity,

116
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,200
{\an5}but so far, no dice.

117
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,040
It would help
if I had the actual Courier.

118
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,760
Sure, here you go.

119
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Okay, never mind.

120
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,800
{\an5}So, we have a vicious monster
on the loose

121
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,080
{\an5}and no idea where it
might have disappeared to.

122
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
He's not a vicious monster.

123
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,200
People just assume that
because of the way he looks.

124
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,440
He's a demigod. He used to be a king!

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
Hey, what are you doing?

126
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm seeing if this thing
works on her mouth.

127
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,080
{\an5}Or how about we just give
our guest the dignity

128
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,520
{\an5}of hearing her story first?

129
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,160
{\an5}I'm telling you, the Men in Black
are behind all of this.

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,120
{\an5}They're framing me so they can
keep hurting the magical creatures.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,040
- Hurting them how?
- I don't know.

132
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,160
{\an5}But, Konane was terrified
when they came for him.

133
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
{\an5}I was just trying to help him.

134
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,720
Mona.

135
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,520
{\an5}We saw the security footage,
and there were no Men in Black.

136
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
{\an5}Just you.

137
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,520
{\an5}Well, they must have altered
the footage to hide the truth.

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,640
I'm like Mulder.

139
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,200
And those guys are the shadow
government covering their tracks!

140
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,400
{\an5}It's a conspiracy!

141
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,640
{\an5}The truth is out there!

142
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,760
Okay, okay, Fox, okay, Fox.
Take a breath.

143
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,440
We... we believe you.

144
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,240
Right, Sara?

145
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,320
{\an5}Yes, we do.

146
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,920
And we are going to get
to the bottom of this.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,520
But first, we need to find the Kaupe
before he hurts himself.

148
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,440
Can you help us do that?

149
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
{\an5}So, I'll head to the Bureau
and do some digging?

150
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,560
{\an5}What? No.

151
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,360
{\an5}I need you on the hunt
for the monster.

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,480
{\an5}But you said...

153
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,080
{\an5}Exactly what I needed to say.

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,600
{\an5}That girl is clearly bonkers,

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
{\an5}but the Kaupe trusts her
and we need her as bait.

156
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,640
What if she's not crazy?

157
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,280
What if there really is
a cover-up at the Bureau?

158
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,920
Then Ava would know about it,
and she wouldn't allow it.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
<i>Captain, I have found a lead
on our missing Kaupe.</i>

160
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,040
<i>In Mexico City, 1961,</i>

161
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,520
<i>an unidentified drug cartel member
was found dead,</i>

162
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,560
<i>apparently the work of a wild animal
non-indigenous to the region.</i>

163
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,720
That must be him.

164
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
All right, fine.

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,840
Do some digging through the footage,
but keep your head down.

166
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,320
We don't want to raise any red flags.

167
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,720
- Got it.
- Gideon, rally the troops.

168
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,440
We are going to Mexico.

169
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,800
{\an5}I'm picking up a magical
signature this way.

170
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,160
{\an5}As far as hiding places go, smack
bang in the center of a major city

171
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,720
would not be my top choice.

172
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
What is this place?

173
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,240
Oh, it sounds like a real party.

174
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,160
As long as there's beer.

175
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,520
The detector must be wrong.

176
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,520
There's no way Konane could
hide in a place like this.

177
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,000
Are you sure about that?

178
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,360
El Lobo.

179
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,880
The Kaupe isn't hiding.

180
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,280
He's the main event.

181
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,760
- Oh.
- Blimey.

182
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,360
How did our hairy friend
end up with that lot?

183
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,200
It doesn't surprise me
in the slightest.

184
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,760
<i>Lucha Libre</i>wrestling is all
about character and charisma...

185
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,960
a modern-day morality play.

186
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,840
Good versus evil.
The people versus the man.

187
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,960
Well, according to
the altered historical record,

188
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,920
El Lobo arrived on the scene
six months ago

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,240
and quickly rose to the top.

190
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,680
The mystery surrounding
his true identity

191
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,960
inspired novels, movies,
and TV shows.

192
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,280
Aw, bollocks.

193
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,200
This is the one
that I get sidelined for?

194
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,560
All right, let's split up.
Ray, Charlie, stay on the comms.

195
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,720
John and I will cover the arena.

196
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,000
You guys watch from the stands.

197
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,640
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

198
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,240
Tonight, you will witness
a spectacular match.

199
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,200
One that you will tell your
grandchildren of in vivid detail.

200
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,120
<i>Two beers, please.</i>

201
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Hey, we're working.

202
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,760
We can't afford
any screw-ups on this one.

203
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,200
We got to bag this guy quick.

204
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,680
Got to stay Sharpe, you mean?

205
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,680
<i>Los Dos Demonios!</i>

206
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,160
Oh, chillax, love.
El Lobo ain't going nowhere.

207
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,320
It's true.

208
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,480
He's impossible to get rid of.

209
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,680
I tried over and over.

210
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,840
He won't go away.

211
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,600
Hold the bloody phone.

212
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,960
Are you El Cura?

213
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Oh, you know this guy?

214
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,640
Anyone who knows anything about
Mexican culture knows El Cura,

215
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,640
the legendary <i>luchador</i>
and movie star.

216
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
No.

217
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,960
You know, I loved
your monster movies, mate.

218
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
Whoever wrote those gems
had a better handle on magic

219
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,320
than any of those toss-bots up
in Hollywood.

220
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,680
I haven't been in any movies,
<i>my friend.</i>

221
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,360
What... what... what's all this?

222
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,680
You're the warrior of piety
and goodness.

223
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,640
You don't drink.
Not that I'm one to judge.

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,880
I didn't...

225
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,480
until this hairy <i>tonto</i>showed up
and stole everything from me!

226
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,760
And finally, the man...

227
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,200
No, the legend.

228
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,960
You have all come here to see.

229
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,160
You mean the thief!

230
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,920
The undefeated champion,
the hero of the people,

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,880
El Lobo!

232
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
<i>Viva, Mexico, señores!</i>

233
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,360
<i>Viva Mexico!</i>

234
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,560
We don't have eyes on the Kaupe.

235
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
He's laying low.

236
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,400
I need this wrapped up
before tonight, Nathaniel.

237
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,760
I can't have it hanging over
my head during the benefit.

238
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
It's going to be fine.

239
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,120
You guys have been throwing
this fundraiser

240
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
since the first Bush administration.

241
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,320
Oh, is that Nathaniel?

242
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Yes, dear.
But this is a work matter...

243
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,400
Yes, I need... please.
Thank you, thank you.

244
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Hello, sweetie.

245
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,520
So don't forget,
the benefit is tonight.

246
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,960
Mom, I don't know
if I'm gonna make it this year.

247
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I have a work emergency.

248
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,160
- Work can wait. Right, Hank?
- No.

249
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,400
Yeah, your father's nodding.

250
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,960
Okay, darling. See you here at 7.00.

251
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,560
Bye.

252
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
I... No.

253
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,080
<i>The lilies go on stage.</i>

254
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,480
Damn, he's good.

255
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,600
He's too good.

256
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,280
In Lucha Libre,
every match tells a story.

257
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,440
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
so you can rise again.

258
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,480
But there are rules. There is a plan.

259
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
With this guy, there's no rules,
there's no plan.

260
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,240
He just wins every time.

261
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,920
Oh, so that's why you're here, right?

262
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,840
Drowning your sorrows, rather than
being up there where you belong?

263
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,360
Listen, mate. I have had my fair
share of defeats these past days,

264
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,760
but lying on your ass is no way
to get your mojo back.

265
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,080
<i>One! Two! Three!</i>

266
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,720
Look at him.

267
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,560
This is what he's always wanted

268
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,560
to be worshiped and admired
like the demigod he is,

269
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,960
not feared and shunned
like some monster.

270
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,120
Well, he'd better make
the most if it.

271
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,840
The second he gets backstage,
it's lights out

272
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,640
and back to the Time Bureau.

273
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
That wasn't the plan.

274
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,840
He can't go back to the Time Bureau.
It's not safe.

275
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,800
Not my call, don't care.

276
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,400
Oh, good, it's just you.

277
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,680
What are you doing here?

278
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
I was digging.

279
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,840
Mona claims the footage
you saw earlier was doctored,

280
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,440
that there's a cover-up
around the creature's escape.

281
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,120
And you believe this tiny cuckoo?

282
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,120
Maybe you should, too.

283
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,360
According to these
deleted access logs,

284
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,240
security footage was removed
and replaced early this morning

285
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,440
from a wireless device.

286
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,800
Now all I have to do is figure out
who that phone number belongs to.

287
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,480
You don't have to. I know the number.

288
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,840
It belongs to my dad.

289
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,200
El Lobo triumphs again!

290
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,600
Okay, Mona, make sure he sees you
as he leaving the ring.

291
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,760
Then bring him backstage,
and we'll meet you there.

292
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Konane!

293
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,160
Lobo!

294
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,240
You thief, you cheat!

295
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,000
You have disgraced this ring.

296
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,400
You have stolen victories
from too many of us.

297
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,600
And I'm going to put a stop to it.

298
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,800
I challenge you
to a <i>lucha de apuestas!</i>

299
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,640
The loser will take off his mask
in forfeit

300
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,800
and never set foot in the ring
ever again!

301
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,600
You heard it here,
ladies and gentleman.

302
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,760
The gauntlet has been thrown!

303
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,440
Do you accept this match
and its conditions, <i>señor?</i>

304
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,200
Then the fight is on!

305
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,680
Tomorrow night same time, same place.

306
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,320
This will be one
for the history books.

307
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,000
Get your tickets now!

308
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,760
So, he's back on track,
historically speaking.

309
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Now, how's that for a bang-up job,
Lance-y?

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,200
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Hey, get back here!

311
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,440
What is going on?

312
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,120
Out of my way, fanboys. Get out!

313
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,080
Damn it, Mona's going
to get herself trampled.

314
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,520
You can say what you will,
but that Kaupe.

315
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,640
He's a real gent in my book.

316
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,280
So, this is where you've been living.

317
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,400
Wow.

318
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,040
I like what you've done
with the place. It's, um...

319
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,240
It's homey.

320
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,960
It's like you're back on the island.

321
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,520
You miss Hawaii, don't you?

322
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,920
Home?

323
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,600
You miss home?

324
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,680
Home.

325
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Mona home?

326
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,880
Do I miss home? Eh, you know...

327
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,280
Guilt-tripping parents,
lack of a job,

328
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,480
no one who understands me.

329
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,440
Wow, that's beautiful.

330
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,360
Mona.

331
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,600
There has to be a logical reason
why Hank replaced the footage.

332
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
So, let's think about it.

333
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,080
Look, I get that you and your dad

334
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
are in a good place
for the first time in a while,

335
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,840
but we just can't ignore
that this is happening.

336
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,560
But can we please reserve judgment
till we see the footage?

337
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,640
Sure. The original footage
can only be restored

338
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,480
from the device used to delete it.

339
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,880
- You mean my dad's phone?
- Yeah.

340
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,320
We got to go for it tonight.
He's gonna be distracted.

341
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,720
He'll be boozing and schmoozing
at the benefit gala.

342
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
I have a plus-one. Are you in?

343
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,280
Oh, yeah, okay.

344
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,720
You know, as long as
we have to do that thing

345
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,360
where we act like we're dating.

346
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,400
You and I dating would
be totally weird.

347
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,760
Totally weird, yeah.

348
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,120
Text me the details,
and I will meet you there.

349
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Okay.

350
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Bye.

351
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,080
I must be really hungry,

352
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,320
because that actually
looks kind of good.

353
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,680
What is it?

354
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,240
Where is he, Mona?

355
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,600
He's gone. You scared him off.

356
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,960
We just want to make sure
he doesn't hurt anyone, love.

357
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,680
He isn't like that.

358
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,360
He's sweet and gentle.

359
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,560
He won't hurt any...

360
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,600
Eat this, you furball!

361
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,880
Konane, stop!

362
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,120
You got one messed-up definition
of "sweet."

363
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,840
Hey, Gideon said you...

364
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,440
Wow. You got a date?

365
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,920
No, it's not a date.

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,560
I am dressed like this

367
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,880
because the footage you saw
at the Bureau earlier

368
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,440
was definitely altered...

369
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
by Hank.

370
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,120
Okay, wait. Before I do the math
on this, are you sure?

371
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,160
Yeah, Mona was telling the truth.

372
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,160
There is a cover-up at the Bureau.

373
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,640
What are the chances
that Ava's wrapped up in this?

374
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,000
Honestly, I don't know yet,

375
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
but if she's not a part of it,
then...

376
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,440
she's probably in a lot of danger.

377
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,080
Gary!

378
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,840
Close that hospital gown,
or I will report you to HR!

379
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,000
Where the hell have you been all day?

380
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,240
I don't know who I am.

381
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,920
I don't know why anything is things.

382
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,720
I don't know where my nipple went.

383
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,000
Where's my nipple?

384
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,560
Where's my nipple?

385
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,720
Gary!

386
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,320
He was so scared.

387
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,840
I had to do something to stop them.

388
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,720
- Where were they taking him?
- Somewhere terrible.

389
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,360
That's why he can't go back
to the Bureau.

390
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,000
The Men in Black are going
to hurt him again, or worse...

391
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,160
Well, he can't stay in Mexico.

392
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,520
So take him back home...

393
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,880
back to ancient Hawaii,
to his old kingdom.

394
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,400
You saw him in the arena.
He's meant to be a king.

395
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,600
- Mona, it is not that simple.
- Why?

396
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,200
<i>Captain, you are being hailed
by Director Sharpe.</i>

397
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,480
That is why.

398
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,880
Gideon, I'll take it on the bridge.

399
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,000
<i>I'm afraid she's overridden
my security protocols.</i>

400
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,960
Ava. Wow, look at you.
You look great.

401
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,320
<i>Yeah, thanks, but listen.</i>

402
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,880
<i>Sara, the situation with the Kaupe
has gotten much worse.</i>

403
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,680
<i>He now has an accomplice, Mona Wu.</i>

404
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,080
<i>Now, she may not look it,
but she is extremely dangerous.</i>

405
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,560
<i>She completely wiped Gary's mind.</i>

406
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,680
<i>Wait, you've had Mona in custody
this whole time, and you didn't...</i>

407
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,440
It's a long story, but I need
to explain it to you in person.

408
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,680
This line might not be secure.

409
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,560
<i>The line isn't secure?
Sara, what are you...</i>

410
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,160
<i>You have the Kaupe, too?</i>

411
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,840
Look, I just...
I can't explain right now.

412
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,400
<i>Okay, then I'm sending
an extraction team.</i>

413
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,200
Gideon, mask our location.

414
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,680
<i>Sara, you need to bring
in that Fugitive now.</i>

415
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,840
I'm sorry.

416
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,280
<i>Don't you dare hang up on...</i>

417
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,520
Whoa, did you just hang up
on your girlfriend?

418
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,440
Mona, you better not
be wrong about this.

419
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,520
I need to go to that benefit,
so I can talk to Ava face-to-face.

420
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,560
Before you leave, I have a petition

421
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,240
to become interim captain
of the Waverider in your absence.

422
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,600
I have a John Hancock from
every Legend except you.

423
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,280
It looks like you crossed out
part of Rory's signature.

424
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Oh, really?

425
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,440
The team is to keep a low profile.

426
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,200
Radio silence,
and absolutely no time travel.

427
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,360
Captain Palmer's got it covered.

428
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,840
Interim captain.

429
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,000
After your recent unfortunate
misadventures in time travel,

430
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
I created a team-building card game

431
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,400
to help you learn the do's and don'ts
of our prior missions.

432
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm calling it...

433
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,000
Cards to Save the Timeline!

434
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,960
Fun way to learn from your mistakes,
right?

435
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,400
Oh, you've got to be joking.
Vandal Savage.

436
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
That's a real name?

437
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,880
And here's me, thinking
that Damien Darhk's

438
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,560
moniker was a touch on the nose.

439
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,560
<i>Sorry to interrupt, but I'm detecting
a disturbance in the timeline.</i>

440
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
- Oh, thank God.
- Yes.

441
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,840
<i>In the wake of El Lobo's sudden
disappearance</i>

442
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,040
<i>from the Lucha Libre scene,</i>

443
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,040
<i>rumors spread
of government censorship.</i>

444
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,640
<i>Countrywide protests erupted,</i>

445
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,120
<i>and dozens were killed
in the ensuing riots.</i>

446
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm sure we can figure something out
once Sara gets back.

447
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,480
In the meantime, it's game time!

448
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,880
- Oh, come off it.
- Yeah

449
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,960
I mean, weren't you just nattering
on about team-building experiences?

450
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,240
Well, let's go out there
and actually fix something.

451
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,120
Well, yeah,
but Sara said to stay put.

452
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,920
Oh, come on, Raymondo.

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,800
This isn't just important
for some dusty old history book.

454
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,800
This is important for the people
of Mexico.

455
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,520
All we have to do is make sure that
the <i>luchas de apuestas</i>fight goes on

456
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,880
and make sure
that El Cura comes out on top.

457
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,920
- A grand finale.
- Yeah.

458
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,160
- Oh, come on, Rayge.
- Come on, Rayge.

459
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,880
Let's give the people what they want.

460
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,480
Let's give them what they need.

461
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,160
Let's prepare ourselves to wrestle!

462
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,840
Or we could just go.

463
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,920
Why throw such a big fancy party

464
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,800
if you're only going to have
tiny little treats?

465
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,320
- Nathaniel, darling.
- Hello.

466
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,760
- Yes.
- Oh, ho, ho.

467
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,520
What... is this your new girlfriend?

468
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,400
Yeah. This is Zari.

469
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,440
Zari, what a beautiful name
for a beautiful woman

470
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,080
with excellent child-bearing hips.

471
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,880
Not to put a clock on it or anything,
but...

472
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,160
grandchildren would be so lovely.

473
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,880
Any who, I'd better go

474
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,880
make sure everything's good
with your father's speech.

475
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,400
Oh, my God. That went well.
Are you...

476
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,080
Are you blushing right now?

477
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,400
No. Shut up.

478
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,160
Take my toothpick. Stay on task.

479
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,200
We're here to get your dad's phone,
that's it.

480
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,200
You better have a damn good reason
for hanging up on me.

481
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,600
Where is the Kaupe,
and why isn't he in Bureau custody?

482
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,120
- What are you doing?
- Making sure we're not overheard.

483
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,240
By who?

484
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,760
Sara, my ass is already on the line.

485
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,480
Feeling me up in front of my boss
is not a good idea right now.

486
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,360
They didn't plant anything on you.

487
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,800
- What?
- That's good.

488
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,320
Please tell me that nutcase
Mona hasn't gotten to you.

489
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,280
Just dance.

490
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,760
I think Mona was onto something

491
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,000
about secret agents trying
to infiltrate the Bureau.

492
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
That is insane.

493
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,760
- Sara...
- Just listen to me.

494
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,200
The security footage was altered,
and I think Mona was framed.

495
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,760
Even if that was true, which I doubt,

496
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,400
you are still harboring a Fugitive.

497
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,680
- Ava...
- Hand him over now.

498
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,440
We can deal with the rest
of this later.

499
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,000
You know I can't do that.

500
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,880
Then this conversation is over.

501
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,800
Hey, could you help me out, <i>amigo?</i>

502
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,280
I think I might be stuck.

503
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,960
Oh, it's time to whip you back
into fighting shape, eh, mate?

504
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,200
Yeah, you need to shake off
that ring rust by tomorrow night

505
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,640
so that you can win.

506
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,800
What the hell is he doing here?

507
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,400
Be nice! Be nice.

508
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,680
Look, just as you're here
to practice winning,

509
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,680
he's here to practice losing,
all right?

510
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,360
I don't trust him.
He's never done choreography.

511
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,960
For the people to accept me
as their hero again,

512
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,720
my victory must be absolute.

513
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,200
Well, you'd better get to work,
then, hadn't you?

514
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,040
Gentle, <i>El Lobo</i>, gentle.

515
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,400
<i>Yeah!</i>

516
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Yes!

517
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,280
That's what I'm talking about,
El Cura.

518
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,320
You think he can still
pull off his finishing move?

519
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,280
I'm sure all the muscle memory
will kick in.

520
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Konane!

521
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,160
You can't train the mutt.

522
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,240
Konane.

523
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,640
I know you don't like losing,

524
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,720
but it doesn't make you
any less of a king.

525
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,720
In fact, it makes you a hero...

526
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,600
like Buck in my favorite
Rebecca Silver book.

527
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

528
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,160
Where Buck crash lands
on Garima's home planet

529
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,360
and then is forced
into mortal combat?

530
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,520
That one?

531
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Yeah, you read it?

532
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Heard of it.

533
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,760
Konane, <i>E'owili.</i>

534
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,080
Buck loved Garima, and he didn't want
to hurt her sister,

535
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,240
so he threw the contest,

536
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,640
and the two star-crossed lovers
escaped into the night.

537
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,080
If you lose tomorrow,
me and you can escape, too.

538
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,640
I'll take you back to Hawaii.

539
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,200
We can make a life together.

540
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,640
Just like Buck and Garima.

541
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,600
Let's clear out.

542
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Ava.

543
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,680
Where are you going?

544
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Mexico City, 1961.

545
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,840
What, you didn't think I'd find out?

546
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,560
The Bureau's running just fine, Sara.

547
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,360
And we will catch that damn Kaupe.

548
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,680
On behalf of the
American Hemophilia Foundation,

549
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,560
I am honored to introduce
tonight's recipient

550
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400
of the Altruistic Angel Award,
Henry Heywood.

551
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,600
Hey, Pops, Pops, Pops.

552
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,320
How about a quick pic?

553
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,200
You know, for <i>Facebooks</i> or whatever
you old people over-share on.

554
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,640
- Come on, Mom.
- Yep.

555
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,520
Okay, say grand- babies.

556
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,120
Damn it, Ray, what happened
to keeping a low profile?

557
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,480
It's a long story,
but this fight must happen

558
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,680
in order to protect history,
so just trust us, okay?

559
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,480
All right, so entering through
the north and south wings

560
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,120
is the best chance of catching
the Legends off-guard.

561
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,360
- Oh.
- If you...

562
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,240
Should I transfer it to your private
line in case it's...

563
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,920
you know, bom-chicka, wow, wow?

564
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,160
Gary, move.

565
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,880
<i>Ava, I know you're mad,
but can we please just talk about...</i>

566
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,640
this like adults before
doing something rash?

567
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,480
I will put a stop to that fight.

568
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,640
<i>Sara, now is not the time
for one of your crazy,</i>

569
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants plans!

570
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,000
Hand over the Fugitive
before someone gets hurt.

571
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,920
I know this sounds crazy,
but there is no way around it.

572
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,760
Letting the Kaupe wrestle
is important to Mexico's history.

573
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,320
<i>No, allowing an escaped Fugitive to
fight is endangering all of history.</i>

574
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,760
Extraction team, move out.

575
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,120
<i>Introducing the fallen hero.</i>

576
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,160
Once beloved, now disgraced,

577
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,440
a man clawing for a comeback...

578
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,720
El Cura!

579
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,720
El Cura, El Cura, El Cura, El Cura.

580
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,080
Fair-weather fans, mate.

581
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,760
Don't worry. We'll prove them wrong.

582
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,560
And now the man
you're all here to see,

583
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,640
the undefeated champion
of the people...

584
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,080
El Lobo!

585
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,400
<i>Viva Mexico!</i>

586
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,520
Lobo! Lobo! Lobo! Lobo!

587
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,040
Bring it in, gentlemen.

588
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,040
Now, I want a good, clean fight.

589
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,440
No biting, no scratching,
nothing below the belt.

590
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,960
All right, to your corners.

591
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,880
The strongest of us will never know

592
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,320
what it's like to live
with this disorder,

593
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
and that's why I call my work...

594
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,800
Okay, moment of truth.

595
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,600
Because victory is possible.

596
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,280
In fact, it's inevitable.

597
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,440
I don't accept
this Altruistic Angel Award

598
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,640
for myself as some pat on the back.

599
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,960
I receive it as a call to arms.

600
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,720
Let's all come together
and end this fight.

601
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,520
All right, take it easy, remember?

602
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,400
Go on, shake it off, mate.
Shake it off.

603
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,240
Look, I know you feel like throwing
in the towel right now, but trust me.

604
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,160
There's nothing people like more
than a good comeback.

605
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Now go.

606
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,120
Yeah, come on!

607
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,240
You're losing so good. Keep it up.

608
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,640
Play dead, furball.

609
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,240
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an emergency evacuation.

610
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,400
Please exit the building
in an orderly fashion.

611
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,960
We have some uninvited guests here,
Sara.

612
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,920
Give them hell. That's an order.

613
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,960
No outside interference!

614
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,480
Finally, a real fight!

615
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,600
These dudes are trying to censor us!

616
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,680
But we ain't gonna stand for that,
are we?

617
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,000
On your left, mate.

618
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,480
Nice one, Raymondo.

619
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,560
Now, El Cura and his mates,
they fight for the people!

620
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,320
The people!

621
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,840
Now, this is what I call
a bloody good show.

622
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,160
- Now, he didn't abandon you.
- Have a towel, mate.

623
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,960
So, don't you dare abandon him.

624
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,120
Oh! Come on!

625
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,200
Yeah!

626
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,960
Yeah, yeah!

627
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,120
Cura! Cura! Cura!

628
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,720
Cura! Cura! Cura!

629
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,280
Cura! Cura! Cura! Cura!

630
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,680
Cura! Cura! Cura! Cura!

631
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,240
Well, I reckon we should team-build
like this more often, Legends.

632
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,160
<i>Well, looks like you've
saved history again.</i>

633
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,320
Congratulations, Sara.

634
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,800
Ava, just let me explain.

635
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
No need.

636
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,080
It's all very clear to me.

637
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,960
Ava, please, don't hang up...

638
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,160
On me.

639
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Some night, huh?

640
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,320
We just raised over 500,000 dollars.

641
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,560
Roaring success.

642
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,600
I saw the footage, Hank...

643
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,520
the real footage.

644
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Nathaniel...

645
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,840
it was you who convinced me
to fund the Bureau.

646
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Don't...

647
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,400
please don't remind me.

648
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,920
I went out on a limb for you.

649
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,160
I need you to trust me on this.
There's a purpose to what you saw.

650
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,120
Of course, I trust you.

651
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,080
I just need you to bring me
in on these sort of things.

652
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,000
In due time, son.

653
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,400
I got to take this. Yeah?

654
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,160
You cloned all the data
off that phone, right?

655
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,160
Uh-huh.

656
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Good.

657
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,440
Keep digging.

658
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,800
I want to know everything.

659
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,720
What do you mean
you couldn't capture the asset?

660
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,240
<i>Blame it on your son's
time-traveling pals, sir.</i>

661
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,680
<i>How would you like us to proceed?</i>

662
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,760
Kid, come here.

663
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,920
There's something about
Buck and Garima, you should know.

664
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
They didn't live happily ever after.

665
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,280
They came from
two different worlds...

666
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,800
worlds that needed them.

667
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,280
They didn't belong together.

668
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,280
But they loved one another...

669
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,520
a lot.

670
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
How do you know?

671
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,520
The next book in the series
hasn't even been published yet.

672
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
I just do!

673
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Here.

674
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,440
Don't do anything stupid.

675
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,360
I got to take a leak.

676
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,840
I brought snickerdoodles.

677
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,720
I'll just put them here.

678
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,520
Ava, look, I'm sorry.
I didn't come here to fight. I...

679
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,040
I know things got ugly
between us today, but...

680
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,320
I just want to put it behind us.

681
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,800
I needed one thing from you today,
Sara...

682
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,720
for you to be in my corner.

683
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,640
That's all I asked.

684
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,200
Well, I'm here now.

685
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Well, that's great.

686
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,000
Just in time for my meeting
with Hank,

687
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,920
where I'll probably be fired,
thanks to you.

688
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,320
Ava, Hank is the real problem here.

689
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,520
I mean, he's been torturing
prisoners off-site.

690
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,720
Who cares?

691
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,720
A few weeks ago, the Legends
were sending them to hell.

692
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,000
I mean, since when is protecting
magical creatures,

693
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,920
things that shouldn't even be
in our world in the first place,

694
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,400
more important than protecting me?

695
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,760
When have you become so callous
about the prisoners in your care?

696
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,320
My priority is to protect history,
Sara...

697
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,800
human history.

698
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,160
If... if Hank has to experiment
on a few creatures

699
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,480
to try to find a better way
to fight them, then so be it.

700
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,400
Ava, you do not believe that.

701
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,800
Come on, I know you.
You're not like Hank.

702
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,080
This is your Bureau,

703
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,200
and he's doing something
twisted with it.

704
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,880
You don't understand
how any of this works.

705
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
No, Hank is the reason
that this Bureau is here.

706
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,280
If we piss him off, it all goes away.

707
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
Think of how many people,
how many human people

708
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
would get hurt if that happened.

709
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,920
Well, he can't shut us down.

710
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,880
Oh, my God, Sara.

711
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,000
Everything is not about you.
Do you understand?

712
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,240
You're asking me
to risk everything, for what?

713
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,040
For some conspiracy theory?
For a bunch of monsters? I...

714
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,480
For me.

715
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,640
Well, I've already given you
everything I have to give, so...

716
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,480
Today I asked you for one thing.

717
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,160
Ava, don't do this.

718
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,280
Just go.

719
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm done.

720
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,480
Well, Konane,
it's time for our new adventure.

721
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,520
Konane, I...

722
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,360
I can't.

723
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,520
I want to live in your world.
I mean...

724
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
look at it.

725
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,960
It's beautiful.

726
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,960
But I don't belong there.

727
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,760
If I went, I'd just be running away
from my world and...

728
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,560
that's not the right reason
to leave everything behind.

729
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,240
You murdered him.

730
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,760
- Step away from the creature, miss.
- No.

731
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,680
I said step away.

732
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,240
You murdered him!

733
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,720
What the...

734
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,600
You were right.

735
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,440
There's no such thing
as happily ever after.
