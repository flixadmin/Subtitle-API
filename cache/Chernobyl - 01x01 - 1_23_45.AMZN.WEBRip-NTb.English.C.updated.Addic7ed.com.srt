1
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:46,144
What is the cost of lies?

2
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,102
It's not that we'll
mistake them for the truth.

3
00:00:49,104 --> 00:00:53,060
The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies,

4
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:56,104
then we no longer
recognize the truth at all.

5
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:59,352
What can we do then?

6
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:02,102
What else is left but to
abandon even the hope of truth

7
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:06,769
and content ourselves
instead with stories?

8
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:10,977
In these stories, it doesn't
matter who the heroes are.

9
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,603
All we want to know is: who is to blame?

10
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:17,269
In this story, it was Anatoly Dyatlov.

11
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:19,060
He was the best choice.

12
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:21,144
An arrogant, unpleasant man,

13
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:24,436
he ran the room that
night, he gave the orders...

14
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:26,436
and no friends.

15
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,104
Or, at least, not important ones.

16
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:35,406
And now Dyatlov will
spend the next ten years

17
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,532
in a prison labor camp.

18
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:40,910
Of course, that sentence
is doubly unfair.

19
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,187
There were far greater
criminals than him at work.

20
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,977
And as for what Dyatlov did do,

21
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,354
the man doesn't deserve prison.

22
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:57,354
He deserves death.

23
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:15,185
But instead, ten years for
"criminal mismanagement."

24
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:17,269
What does that mean?

25
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,021
No one knows. It doesn't matter.

26
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:26,769
What does matter is that, to them,

27
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,060
justice was done.

28
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:32,728
Because, you see, to them

29
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,438
a just world is a sane world.

30
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:41,896
There was nothing sane about Chernobyl.

31
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,853
What happened there,
what happened after,

32
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:49,187
even the good we did, all of it...

33
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:55,187
all of it... madness.

34
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:03,737
Well, I've given you everything I know.

35
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:08,101
They'll deny it, of course.

36
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,849
They always do.

37
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,937
I know you'll try your best.

38

39
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,728
Lyudmilla?

40
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:09,855
Comrade Dyatlov!

41
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:17,396
Comrade Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

42
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:25,028
Comrade Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

43
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:27,519
What just happened?

44
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:30,686
I don't know.

45
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:32,896
There's a fire in the turbine hall.

46
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:35,771
The turbine hall.

47
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:39,977
The control system tank. Hydrogen.

48
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,387
You and Toptunov, you
morons blew the tank!

49
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,352
- No, that's not...
- This is an emergency.

50
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:46,520
Everyone stay calm.
Our first priority is...

51
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:47,935
- It's exploded!
- We know.

52
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:49,477
Akimov, are we cooling the reactor core?

53
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,394
We shut it down, but the
control rods are still active.

54
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,269
They're not all the way
in, I disengaged the clutch.

55
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,812
Try and disconnect the servos
from the standby console.

56
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:57,435
You two, get the backup pumps running.

57
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,023
We need water moving through the core.

58
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:02,268
- That is all that matters.
- There is no core.

59
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,686
It exploded, the core exploded.

60
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:10,352
He's in shock. Get him out of here.

61
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:11,686
The lid is off!

62
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,561
The stack is burning. I saw it.

63
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:16,519
You're confused. RBMK
reactor cores don't explode.

64
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,935
- Akimov...
- Sasha.

65
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:19,227
Don't worry, we did everything right.

66
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,269
Something... something
strange has happened.

67
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:23,477
- Do you taste metal?
- Akimov!

68
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,477
Comrade Perevozschenko, what you're
saying is physically impossible.

69
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:29,813
The core can't explode.
It has to be the tank.

70
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,269
We're wasting time. Let's go.

71
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,465
Get the hydrogen out of the generators
and pump water into the core.

72
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:39,394
- What about the fire?
- Call the fire brigade.

73
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:43,029

_

89
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,436
You're not on call tonight.

90
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,889
They're bringing everybody
in, military and civil.

91
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:23,728
Pripyat, Polesskoe, Kiev.

92
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,605
This is a big one.

93
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:29,443
But it doesn't look right, the color.

94
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:32,935
Pravik says he thinks they're
shining floodlights or something.

95
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,394
And what if there are chemicals?

96
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:36,730
Chemicals?

97
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,394
The problem's the roof.

98
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:42,269
It's covered in tar, so
it's gonna burn all night,

99
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,935
and it'll stink like hell. That's it.

100
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,771
That's the worst of it.

101
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,102
Go back to bed.

102
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:28,935
- Is it war?
- Where's the dosimeter?

103
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:32,021
Here... Here.

104
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,479
Are they bombing?

105
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:45,144
What the fuck is this?
It's 3.6 roentgen.

106
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:47,769
That's as high as it goes. The
good one's locked in a safe.

107
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,269
I don't have a key.

108
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:53,521
Valera... your face.

109
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:56,477
Come on.

110
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:59,436
I'm going to find
Khodemchuk in the pump room.

111
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:01,477
You... here.

112
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:05,185
Get Shashenok. He's in 604. Go.

113
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:06,935
We need to get everyone out!

114
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:21,477
Shit.

115
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,935
Hey! We need to get to the reactor hall.

116
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:27,019
- The lift's destroyed.
- Up two flights and across.

117
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:30,519
- Right.
- Why are you going there?

118
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:51,811
Have you seen Khodemchuk?

119
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:54,271
- No. Where's Viktor?
- Still in the pump room.

120
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:58,688
Stay here. I'll come back.

121
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,278
Viktor!

122
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:22,545
Viktor.

123
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:25,673
Viktor.

124
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:29,811
Viktor. I'm gonna get you out of here.

125
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:31,769
Can you stand?

126
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,060
Khodemchuk...

127
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,730
Where?

128
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:40,313
Get Khodemchuk.

129
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,423
I dropped the control
rods from the other panel.

130
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,311
- They're still up.
- What?

131
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:29,811
They're still only a third of
the way in, I don't know why.

132
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,538
I already sent the trainees down to
the reactor hall to lower them by hand.

133
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,394
- What about the pumps?
- I can't get through to Khodemchuk.

134
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:37,371
- The lines are down.
- Fuck the phones and fuck Khodemchuk.

135
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:38,874
- Are the pumps on or not?
- Stolyarchuk?

136
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,185
My control panel's not working.

137
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:41,686
I tried calling for the electricians.

138
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:43,394
I don't give a shit about the panel!

139
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:46,019
I need water in my reactor core!

140
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,563
Get down there and make
sure those pumps are on.

141
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,313
Now!

142
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,217
What does the dosimeter say?

143
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,477
3.6 roentgen, but that's
as high as the meter...

144
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:05,229
3.6... not great, not terrible.

145
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,354
We did everything right.

146
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,021
You, connect those hooks!

147
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:08,413
Get the pumps going!

148
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,666
Yeah, over here!

149
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:17,563
We're working bottom to top. Go in fast.

150
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:39,984
Vasily...

151
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:44,185
- Hey, Vasily, what's this?
- I don't know, Misha.

152
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:46,688
Don't fuck around with
it. Hook these up, come on.

153
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,811
Do you taste metal?

154
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:57,021
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.

155
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,498
The valves, Misha! The valves, let's go!

156
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:02,021
The valves! Come on!

157
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,644
What do you need?

158
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,977
We need to get into the reactor hall

159
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:40,396
to lower the control rods,
but the door is jammed.

160
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:43,686
I don't think there are control rods.

161
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,354
I don't think there's a core.

162
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,396
No, you're... You're mistaken.

163
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:51,646
Akimov said.

164
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:10,396
Let's go.

165
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:25,060
No!

166
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:28,894
Ignatenko, get on his hose!

167
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:30,811
It's all right. Breathe.

168
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:32,561
Misha.

169
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:34,563
All right, all right. Easy, Misha.

170
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:13,271
Are you sure?

171
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,062
Akimov...

172
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,979
Move.

173
00:20:41,313 --> 00:20:42,979
Come on, go!

174
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:23,626
Let's go!

175
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:25,021
Let's go!

176
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:27,758
Hey!

177
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:35,894
Hey!

178
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:58,728
Lyudmilla! Do you want to come with us?

179
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,946
Come where?

180
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:02,269
We're going to the railroad
bridge to get a better look.

181
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:04,728
It's not like anyone can
sleep with all the sirens.

182
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,123
I don't think you should
go. It could be dangerous.

183
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,227
What do you mean dangerous? It's a
fire. It's over there, we're over here.

184
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,855
- Mikhail.
- What?

185
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,272
Oh, sorry.

186
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:16,858
Oh.

187
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,394
- Is Vasily...?
- Yeah.

188
00:22:22,396 --> 00:22:24,060
Did he say it was bad?

189
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:25,899
No. No, he said it was just the roof.

190
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:27,476
Well, he's never gotten hurt before.

191
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,104
None of the boys have.

192
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,690
He'll be fine.

193
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,563
Get some rest.

194
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:48,102
The tank, it's big enough.

195
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:52,436
This kind of explosion, the control
tank on 71, it's 100 cubic meters.

196
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:53,853
One hundred and ten.

197
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,686
Hundred and ten. It
could do this, definitely.

198
00:22:56,688 --> 00:23:00,102
It's gone.

199
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:02,269
I looked right into it.

200
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:03,979
I looked into the core.

201
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:07,935
Did you lower the control rods or not?

202
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:12,771
Take him to the infirmary.

203
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,979
Toptunov, take him!

204
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:23,185
- Where's Kudryavstev?
- He fell.

205
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:26,311
- I need a medic! Anyone!
- He's delusional.

206
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:28,811
- His face...
- Ruptured condenser lines.

207
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:30,811
The feedwater is mildly contaminated.

208
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:32,561
He'll be fine. I've seen worse.

209
00:23:32,563 --> 00:23:34,979
Do we still have a phone
line to the outside?

210
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:39,603
Akimov?

211
00:23:39,605 --> 00:23:41,646
Call in the day shift.

212
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,475
- But if the...
- We have to keep water flowing into the core.

213
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:48,646
We need electricians,
mechanics, we need bodies.

214
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:52,021
How many times do I have to say it?

215
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:02,185
I'm going to the
Administration Building now

216
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,811
to call Bryukhanov and Fomin.

217
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:07,229
They're gonna want a full report.

218
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:12,185
Now, I don't know if I can
make things better for you,

219
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:15,021
but I can certainly make them worse.

220
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:19,646
Call in the day shift, Comrade Akimov.

221
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,714
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

222
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,368
You're doing fine.

223
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:02,288
Raise her up.

224
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:07,394
That one, maybe an hour.

225
00:25:07,396 --> 00:25:09,563
This one, not until morning.

226
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:15,685
- How's it downstairs, doctor?
- Quiet.

227
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:17,477
Always is.

228
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:20,229
Nothing at this hour but babies.

229
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:24,060
You know, I once went
two days without sleep?

230
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:26,769
Ten women went into
labor at the same time.

231
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:29,146
- Did I ever tell you that story?
- Yes.

232
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:33,102
Well, I won't need you
in here for a while.

233
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:35,896
If you want, get some
rest in the break room.

234
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:39,019
They haven't brought
anyone in from the fire.

235
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:42,104
- What fire?
- The power plant.

236
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:45,771
Oh. Then it mustn't be too bad.

237
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:48,673
Do we stock iodine?

238
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,592
- Hmm?
- Iodine.

239
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:53,326
You mean disinfectant?

240
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:56,143
No, pills. Does the
hospital stock iodine pills?

241
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,104
Iodine pills? Why would
we have iodine pills?

242
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:13,605
Hello?

243
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:16,104
Hello?

244
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,950
Who else knows this?

245
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,688
Have you called Fomin?

246
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,977
Of course I want you to call him.

247
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:34,187
If I'm up, he's up.

248
00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:14,519
Whatever the cause,
the important thing is

249
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:16,229
that neither you nor I...

250
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,436
I take it the safety test was a failure?

251
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:02,769
- We have the situation under control.
- Under control?

252
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:05,563
- It doesn't look like it's under control.
- Shut up, Fomin.

253
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:09,795
I have to tell the Central Committee
about this. Do you realize that?

254
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:11,977
I have to get on the
phone and tell Maryin,

255
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:13,519
or God forbid Frolyshev,

256
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:15,311
that my power plant is on fire.

257
00:28:15,313 --> 00:28:17,811
No one can blame you for
this, Director Bryukhanov.

258
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:19,603
Of course no one can blame me for this.

259
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:22,771
How can I be responsible?
I was sleeping.

260
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:25,937
Tell me what happened, quickly.

261
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:31,185
We ran the test exactly as
Chief Engineer Fomin approved.

262
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:34,162
Unit Shift Chief Akimov
and Engineer Toptunov

263
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:36,173
encountered technical
difficulties leading

264
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:39,852
to an accumulation of hydrogen
in the control system tank.

265
00:28:39,855 --> 00:28:41,477
It regrettably ignited,

266
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,104
damaging the plant,
setting the roof on fire.

267
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:48,311
The tank is quite large.

268
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:50,436
It's the only logical explanation.

269
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,977
Of course, Deputy Chief Engineer Dyatlov

270
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:56,686
was directly supervising the test,

271
00:28:56,688 --> 00:28:58,048
so he would know best.

272
00:28:58,051 --> 00:29:00,479
A hydrogen tank, fire...

273
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:04,644
- Reactor?
- We're taking measures to ensure

274
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:07,144
a steady flow of water through the core.

275
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:10,185
- What about radiation?
- Obviously, down here it's nothing.

276
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:12,977
But in the reactor
building, I'm being told

277
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:15,102
3.6 roentgen per hour.

278
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:17,352
Well, that's not great,
but it's not horrifying.

279
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:19,019
Not at all.

280
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:22,144
- From the feedwater, I assume?
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:24,519
We'll have to limit shifts

282
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:26,686
to six hours at a time, but otherwise...

283
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:29,271
The dosimetrists should
be checking regularly.

284
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:34,062
Have them use the good
meter from the safe.

285
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:38,235
Right. I'll call Maryin.

286
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,603
Have them wake up the
local executive committee.

287
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:43,853
There'll be orders coming down.

288
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,060
- Here.
- No.

289
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:53,688
You sure? Okay.

290
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:59,354
- What do you think makes the colors?
- Oh...

291
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:03,477
- It's the fuel for sure.
- "Oh. It's the fuel for sure"?

292
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:06,977
What do you know about it? You
clean floors at a train station.

293
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,769
My friend, Yuri, works
at the power plant.

294
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:10,436
He says it runs cold.

295
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:12,623
No gas, no fire. Just atoms.

296
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:15,732
Yuri says the only thing is, you
can't walk right up to the fuel.

297
00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:18,519
If you do, a glass of vodka
an hour for four hours.

298
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:21,519
Isn't Yuri a plumber?

299
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:23,937
At the nuclear power plant, yeah.

300
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,062
It is beautiful.

301
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:34,730
Yeah.

302
00:32:26,173 --> 00:32:28,173
Do you have a cigarette?

303
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:55,646
Do you need help?

304
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,730
It's over.

305
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,603
We've done all we can
from the perimeter.

306
00:34:09,605 --> 00:34:12,438
We need to start making
our way to the roof.

307
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:21,771
Vasily! You've gotta put it out.

308
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,187
That's enough, comrades.
We're pushing ahead.

309
00:34:34,102 --> 00:34:35,726
Come on, boys.

310
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:43,561
Vasily, it's just past, straight up.

311
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:45,479
All the way up, all the way in.

312
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:49,021
Come on!

313
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:03,313
Yeah. Going in now.

314
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,811
What about the auxiliary?

315
00:35:52,813 --> 00:35:56,311
The pumps are gone, electrical's gone.

316
00:35:56,313 --> 00:36:00,229
- The core?
- I didn't go in there, and I won't.

317
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,561
- I think it's time we faced...
- No, we have to get water into the core.

318
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,394
Otherwise, there'll be a meltdown.

319
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:08,394
We have to open the valves.

320
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:10,509
- Sasha...
- What do you want, Boris?

321
00:36:10,512 --> 00:36:12,561
If it's true, then we're dead,
a million people are dead.

322
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:14,730
Is that what you need to hear?

323
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:18,227
We have to open the valves.

324
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:20,436
- By hand.
- By hand?

325
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:23,060
You know, the number of valves,
the amount of time to turn them,

326
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:24,769
you're talking about hours in there!

327
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:26,568
- Then help us.
- Help you do what?

328
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:29,730
Pump water into a ditch?
There's nothing there!

329
00:36:38,937 --> 00:36:40,896
Leonid, I'm begging you.

330
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:56,019
Watch the panel while we're gone.

331
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:57,479
It's not working.

332
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,396
Just watch it.

333
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:24,232
I guess we know why
they called us in early.

334
00:37:24,235 --> 00:37:26,644
Is anyone saying what happened?

335
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,977
They were running the
safety test on the turbines,

336
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:31,104
blew the control system tank.

337
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:33,646
It doesn't make sense to me either.

338
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:37,454
What about sabotage?

339
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:38,998
A bomb?

340
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,560
Sitnikov! Bryukhanov wants
us to use the good dosimeter,

341
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:46,436
but it's in the safe,
and we can't find the key.

342
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:49,853
It's in Building 2. Hasn't...?

343
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:51,521
Follow me.

344
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:04,518
Gentlemen, welcome.

345
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:07,769
Please, uh, find a seat. Plenty of room.

346
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:11,352
I apologize for the
lateness of the hour.

347
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:15,519
Rest assured, we are
all very safe down here.

348
00:38:15,521 --> 00:38:18,269
We built this shelter to
withstand a nuclear attack

349
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:21,563
by the Americans, so
I think we'll be fine.

350
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:25,686
As you can see, we have
experienced an accident.

351
00:38:25,688 --> 00:38:28,352
A large control tank malfunctioned,

352
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:32,311
damaging reactor Building
4 and starting a fire.

353
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:36,060
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Maryin.

354
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:38,394
Maryin spoke to Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

355
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:41,686
Frolyshev to Central
Committee member Dolgikh,

356
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:45,209
and Dolgikh to General
Secretary Gorbachev.

357
00:38:45,212 --> 00:38:46,977
Now...

358
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:52,311
Because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

359
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:56,352
for the work of the
Pripyat Executive Committee,

360
00:38:56,354 --> 00:39:00,354
they have asked me to brief you
on matters as they stand, so...

361
00:39:01,895 --> 00:39:05,727
- First, the accident...
- is well under control.

362
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:11,060
And second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

363
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:14,853
are considered key state
secrets, it is important

364
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:18,269
that we ensure that this incident

365
00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:20,436
has no adverse consequences.

366
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:24,644
Now, to prevent a panic, the
Central Committee have ordered

367
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:27,603
a detachment of military
police to Pripyat.

368
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:29,438
How large of a detachment?

369
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:32,977
Between two and four thousand men.

370
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:39,019
What's really going on
here? How dangerous is this?

371
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:43,102
There's mild radiation, but
it's limited to the plant itself.

372
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,269
- No, it isn't.
- Excuse me?

373
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:50,269
You saw men outside vomiting.

374
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:52,104
You saw men with burns.

375
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:55,644
There's more radiation
than they're saying.

376
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:58,019
We have wives here, we have children.

377
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,811
I say we evacuate the town.

378
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,644
Gentlemen...

379
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:06,808
Please, please. My wife is here.

380
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:08,934
Do you think I would keep her in Pripyat

381
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:10,476
if it wasn't safe?

382
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:14,185
Bryukhanov, the air is glowing.

383
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:17,399
The Cherenkov effect.
Completely normal phenomenon.

384
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:19,269
It can happen with minimal radiation.

385
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:33,646
I wonder how many of you
know the name of this place.

386
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:39,477
We all call it "Chernobyl," of course.

387
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,813
What is its real name?

388
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:46,930
The Vladimir I. Lenin
Nuclear Power Station.

389
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,855
Exactly.

390
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:54,855
Vladimir I. Lenin.

391
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:05,688
And how proud he would
be of you all tonight.

392
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,021
Especially you, young man,

393
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:12,896
and the passion you have for the people.

394
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:17,896
For is that not the sole purpose
of the apparatus of the State?

395
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,646
Sometimes, we forget.

396
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,521
Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.

397
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:31,018
But our faith in Soviet socialism

398
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,937
will always be rewarded.

399
00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:40,686
Now, the State tells us the
situation here is not dangerous.

400
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:43,229
Have faith, comrades.

401
00:41:44,854 --> 00:41:48,230
The State tells us it
wants to prevent a panic.

402
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:50,442
Listen well.

403
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:57,271
It's true, when the people see
the police, they will be afraid.

404
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:00,730
But it is my experience

405
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:04,060
that when the people ask questions

406
00:42:04,062 --> 00:42:07,436
that are not in their own best interest,

407
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:09,436
they should simply be told

408
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:11,605
to keep their minds on their labor

409
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:17,479
and leave matters of
the State to the State.

410
00:42:19,146 --> 00:42:21,229
We seal off the city.

411
00:42:22,396 --> 00:42:24,062
No one leaves.

412
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:26,977
And cut the phone lines.

413
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:29,771
Contain the spread of misinformation.

414
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:35,311
That is how we keep the people

415
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:38,479
from undermining the
fruits of their own labor.

416
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:43,313
Yes, comrades...

417
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:48,646
we will all be rewarded
for what we do here tonight.

418
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:55,486
This is our moment to shine.

419
00:43:07,638 --> 00:43:08,855
Thank you.

420
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:24,313
Comrade Sitnikov to
see the Chief Engineer.

421
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:38,354
Well?

422
00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:48,187
I sent my dosimetrists
into the reactor building.

423
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:51,060
The large dosimeter from the safe,

424
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,977
the one with the
1,000-roentgen capacity...

425
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:54,313
What was the number?

426
00:43:57,563 --> 00:43:58,853
There was none.

427
00:43:58,855 --> 00:44:01,730
The meter burned out the
second it was turned on.

428
00:44:02,563 --> 00:44:04,705
- It's typical.
- See? This is what Moscow does.

429
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,728
Sends us shit equipment, then
wonders why things go wrong.

430
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,019
We found another dosimeter

431
00:44:10,021 --> 00:44:12,060
from the military fire department.

432
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:15,102
It only goes to 200 roentgen, but
it's better than the small ones.

433
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:16,220
And?

434
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:19,436
It maxed out.

435
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:21,021
Two hundred roentgen.

436
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,685
What game are you playing?

437
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:27,185
No, I... I...

438
00:44:27,187 --> 00:44:30,894
I asked him, he took multiple
measurements, he's my best man.

439
00:44:30,896 --> 00:44:33,644
It's another faulty meter.
You're wasting our time.

440
00:44:33,646 --> 00:44:35,477
I checked the meter against the control.

441
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:37,811
What's wrong with you?
How'd you get that number

442
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:40,062
from feedwater leaking
from a blown tank?

443
00:44:43,563 --> 00:44:47,104
- You don't.
- Then what the fuck are you talking about?

444
00:44:51,229 --> 00:44:53,104
I, um...

445
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:58,438
I walked around the
exterior of Building 4.

446
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:02,937
I think there's graphite
on the ground in the rubble.

447
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:05,730
You didn't see graphite.

448
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,454
- I did.
- You didn't.

449
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:13,271
You didn't! Because it's not there!

450
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:15,853
What?

451
00:45:15,855 --> 00:45:19,436
Are you suggesting the core... what?

452
00:45:19,438 --> 00:45:21,605
Exploded?

453
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:24,605
Yes.

454
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,313
Sitnikov.

455
00:45:35,563 --> 00:45:38,185
You're a nuclear engineer, so am I.

456
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:44,477
Please tell me how an
RBMK reactor core explodes.

457
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:48,227
Not a meltdown, an explosion.

458
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:49,987
I'd love to know.

459
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:52,260
I can't.

460
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:54,729
Are you stupid?

461
00:45:55,979 --> 00:45:58,771
- No.
- Then why can't you?

462
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:01,688
I...

463
00:46:03,646 --> 00:46:06,271
I don't see how it could explode.

464
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:10,663
- But it did.
- Enough!

465
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,352
I'll go up to the vent block roof.

466
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:15,811
From there you can look right
down into reactor Building 4.

467
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:19,561
I'll see it with my own... my own eyes.

468
00:46:25,628 --> 00:46:27,211
I apologize.

469
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:30,563
Guards! Guards!

470
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:34,855
Get him to the medic or the
hospital! Whatever he needs!

471
00:46:50,937 --> 00:46:54,187
It's the feedwater.
Been around it all night.

472
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,896
You go then.

473
00:47:00,896 --> 00:47:02,477
What?

474
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:05,473
Go to the vent block roof
and report back what you see.

475
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:06,569
No.

476
00:47:10,438 --> 00:47:14,271
- No, I won't do that.
- Of course you will.

477
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,503
You'll be fine. You'll see.

478
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:25,492
Come on.

479
00:48:06,896 --> 00:48:08,271
Okay.

480
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:11,320
Let's begin.

481
00:48:19,307 --> 00:48:20,849
Leonid.

482
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:25,942
Leonid.

483
00:48:27,146 --> 00:48:28,479
Oh...

484
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:36,644
It's all the way, okay?

485
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,772
All the way open.

486
00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:48,813
I'm sorry.

487
00:48:52,422 --> 00:48:54,810
There's nothing to be sorry for.

488
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:58,146
I told you, we did nothing wrong.

489
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,187
But we did.

490
00:52:50,122 --> 00:52:51,328
Hello?

491
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:53,268
- Valery Legasov?
- Yes.

492
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,894
You are the Legasov who is
the First Deputy Director

493
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:58,477
of the Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy?

494
00:52:58,479 --> 00:53:01,060
- I am. Who am I...?
- This is Boris Shcherbina,

495
00:53:01,062 --> 00:53:03,144
Deputy Chairman of the
Council of Ministers

496
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,853
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

497
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:10,686
There's been an accident at the
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

498
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:11,935
How bad is it?

499
00:53:11,937 --> 00:53:14,185
No. No need to panic. There was a fire.

500
00:53:14,187 --> 00:53:17,400
It's mostly put out. The
system control tank exploded.

501
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:20,853
Control system tank. And the core?

502
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:24,102
We've ordered them to
continuously pump water.

503
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:26,853
Yes, I see. Any contamination?

504
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:29,769
It's mild. The plant manager,
Bryukhanov, is reporting

505
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:31,352
3.6 roentgen per hour.

506
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:33,603
That's actually significant.
You should evacuate the sur...

507
00:53:33,605 --> 00:53:38,102
You're an expert on
RBMK reactors, correct?

508
00:53:38,105 --> 00:53:39,689
Yes, I've studied...

509
00:53:39,692 --> 00:53:42,394
General Secretary Gorbachev
has appointed a committee

510
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:46,102
to manage the accident. You're on it.

511
00:53:46,104 --> 00:53:48,352
We'll convene at two this afternoon.

512
00:53:48,354 --> 00:53:51,519
That late? Forgive
me, but don't you think

513
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:53,352
given the amount of
radiation that it would be...

514
00:53:53,354 --> 00:53:56,658
Legasov, you're on this committee
to answer direct questions

515
00:53:56,661 --> 00:53:59,144
about the function of an RBMK reactor

516
00:53:59,146 --> 00:54:02,185
if they should happen
to arise. Nothing else.

517
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:04,977
Certainly not policy. Do you understand?

518
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:07,977
Yes, of course. I didn't mean to...

519
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:23,268

520
00:58:58,065 --> 00:58:59,935
I'm pleased to report that

521
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:02,097
the situation in Chernobyl is stable.

522
00:59:03,995 --> 00:59:05,561
In terms of radiation,

523
00:59:05,563 --> 00:59:08,378
I'm told it's the
equivalent of a chest X-ray.

524
00:59:11,438 --> 00:59:12,769
No!

525
00:59:12,771 --> 00:59:15,185
The fire is giving off
nearly twice the radiation

526
00:59:15,187 --> 00:59:16,979
released by the bomb in Hiroshima.

527
00:59:18,062 --> 00:59:19,644
It will burn and spread its poison

528
00:59:19,646 --> 00:59:22,269
until the entire continent is dead.

529
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,573
Tell our soldiers,

530
00:59:28,576 --> 00:59:30,227
"You will need to move quickly,

531
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,021
and you will need to move carefully.

532
00:59:33,605 --> 00:59:36,688
These are the most important
90 seconds of your lives.

533
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:40,688
I wish you good health and long life."

534
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:43,956
I serve the Soviet Union.

535
00:59:44,062 --> 00:59:45,730
I serve the Soviet Union.

536
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:48,104
I serve the Soviet Union.

537
00:59:56,855 --> 00:59:59,401
The official position of the state

538
00:59:59,404 --> 01:00:01,769
is that a global nuclear catastrophe

539
01:00:01,771 --> 01:00:03,771
is not possible in the Soviet Union.
