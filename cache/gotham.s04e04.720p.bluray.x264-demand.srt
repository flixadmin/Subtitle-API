1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,209
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,288
<i>Jim, meet my daughter, Sofia.</i>

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,873
Do you ever think about
walking away from it all?

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,040
Sometimes.

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,879
<i>This drawing depicts a man
being healed by water.</i>

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,631
<i>That's Ra's al Ghul.</i>

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:18,716
<i>He wants the knife.</i>

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,311
<i>The opening bid
will begin at $50,000.</i>

9
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,180
A hundred thousand dollars.

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,357
Two million dollars.

11
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,360
Sold to Mr. Bruce Wayne.

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,614
I guess you could say
I'm your number one fan?

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,984
What's black and white
and red all over?

14
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,822
Zebra, with a gaping hole.

15
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,862
I think something is wrong
with your brain, Ed.

16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,490
<i>Gordon, you've got a visitor.</i>

17
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,621
- You shouldn't have come back here.
- I'm a Falcone.

18
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,500
You came looking for a gangster.
That's exactly what you found.

19
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,580
<i>That knife is the key</i>

20
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,211
to everything.

21
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,218
Well, not everything.

22
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,847
Hmm.

23
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,349
Beautiful.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,980
And you bought this at auction?

25
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,236
Supposedly, it was
the embalming knife

26
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,109
of the first-century
Mesopotamian king.

27
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,481
Balahsi.

28
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,489
And what is it that you want
of me, Mr. Wayne?

29
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,195
Anything you can tell me, Dr. Winthrop.

30
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,996
I wanna know exactly
what it is I bought.

31
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,827
Perhaps you should've considered that

32
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,079
before you dropped two million
dollars on it, shouldn't you?

33
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,960
Leave it with me overnight.

34
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,788
I'm back.

35
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,084
Man, you really need

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,167
to clean that room.

37
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,424
My delightful grandson.

38
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,889
I have access to the very clean

39
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,809
historical records room
at Gotham Central Library

40
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,387
and he uses it for his homework.

41
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,055
Oh, Alex, let me introduce you

42
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,728
to Mr. Bruce Wayne and his guardian

43
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,900
- Alfred Pennyworth.
- What's up?

44
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,562
Whoa.

45
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,863
Where did that come from?

46
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,658
That cuneiform's definitely
pre-Phoenician.

47
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,747
Alex is an avid student of history
and sometimes assists me.

48
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,615
A word, Master Bruce.

49
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,623
Now it's all very well involving
an old geezer, but a young man?

50
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,046
Just you remember
who's after that knife.

51
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,668
What so important about it
that Ra's al Ghul

52
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,751
wants it so badly? We need to know.

53
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,337
Dr. Winthrop.

54
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,963
Alex.

55
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,181
I have to ask you
to keep this matter between us.

56
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,229
- Of course.
- Yeah, cool.

57
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,264
I mean...

58
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,978
Yes, Mr. Wayne.

59
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:33,984
I'll check back tomorrow.

60
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,020
Until then.

61
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,735
No.

62
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,413
Come on, Ed. Come on.

63
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,574
You can do this.

64
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:55,044
This has to be the perfect riddle.

65
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,123
No!

66
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,422
Yes.

67
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,466
Yes.

68
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,760
Yes!

69
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,428
Yes!

70
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:12,932
Is that you?

71
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,657
Tomorrow night, Oswald,

72
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,530
is the night you die.

73
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,584
Alex.

74
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,629
Bring me the Palmerian Codex.

75
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,974
Ah!

76
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,726
What is it?

77
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,608
"He, who rises from the waters,

78
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,526
"whom death shall not touch.

79
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,620
"With this sacred blade,

80
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,699
"his final savage destiny

81
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,621
"shall be fulfilled.

82
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,411
"The earth will quake.

83
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,128
"Blood will flow.

84
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,297
"All tremble

85
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,592
"before the Demon's Head."

86
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,844
What's the Demon's Head?

87
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,176
Not what, my boy.

88
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,007
Who.

89
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,056
<i>There is a legend
in the time of this knife,</i>

90
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,016
<i>of a man who could not die.</i>

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,022
Or who died, but was reborn.

92
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,527
Have you ever, in your reading,
come across the name Ra's al Ghul?

93
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,604
He was a warlord.

94
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,903
<i>But those guys always had stories
invented about them.</i>

95
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,617
They're just stories.

96
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,990
My boy, people believe
in these stories.

97
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,664
They kill for them.

98
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,209
<i>I think Bruce Wayne has stumbled
across something</i>

99
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,037
<i>much more complex than he imagined.</i>

100
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,498
And infinitely more dangerous.

101
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,507
No one should be here.

102
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,220
Here, take this into my office.

103
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,301
Stay quiet. Quickly.

104
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,063
Dr. Niles Winthrop.

105
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,644
- What a pleasure.
- Who are you?

106
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,609
The museum is closed.

107
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,323
How did you get past the guard?

108
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,651
My apologies.

109
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,785
But my business is pressing.

110
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,913
"Greek, Vase - second Century."

111
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,533
Oh.

112
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,453
This was made by a forger
in Marrakech in the 15th century.

113
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,040
He had some talent,
but told the most obscene jokes.

114
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,756
Tell me who you are,
or I shall call the police.

115
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,426
I am looking for a knife
Bruce Wayne brought you earlier today.

116
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,557
I don't know what you mean.

117
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,313
The best liar I ever met
ran a brothel in Shanghai.

118
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,316
Her quite considerable gift was that

119
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,226
you knew she was lying,
but didn't care.

120
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,154
You so badly wanted to believe her.

121
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,531
You, Dr. Winthrop,
are a terrible liar.

122
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,071
Where's the knife?

123
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,834
The police, they're coming.

124
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,545
I imagine they are.

125
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,075
End of crime, my ass.

126
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,159
Harper?

127
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,912
- Where's Bullock?
- He asked me to fill in.

128
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,588
He took a sabbatical for a few days.

129
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,000
You baby-sitting me?

130
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,543
Do you need baby-sitting?

131
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,505
- What have we got?
- Dr. Niles Winthrop.

132
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,348
Curator of antiquities.

133
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,387
Looks like somebody snapped his neck.

134
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,136
No witnesses, of course.

135
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,846
Fire alarm triggered security.

136
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,477
Maybe the dead guy pulled it
right before the...

137
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,608
Yeah, thanks. Anything else?

138
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,435
Yes, actually.

139
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,655
According to
Professor Von Dead's log book,

140
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,777
the last person to visit him,

141
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,529
I'm talking
just yesterday afternoon...

142
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,860
Bruce Wayne.

143
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,115
It's all right, let him in.

144
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,949
Detective Gordon.

145
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,408
What...

146
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,002
- What happened?
- We were thinking

147
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,379
we would ask you the same thing.

148
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,462
You met with Dr. Winthrop
just yesterday, correct?

149
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,630
I...

150
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,011
I bought an old knife at auction.

151
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,176
Dr. Winthrop agreed
to examine it for me.

152
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,771
I was coming by
to check on his progress.

153
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,723
When was he killed?

154
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,730
According to the fire alarm,
just past midnight.

155
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,773
Whoever did it
must have snuck past security.

156
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,448
His grandson. Alex.
He's my age, a little bit younger.

157
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,447
- Have you talked to him?
- No one's seen any kid.

158
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,069
I'll get on it.

159
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,534
Where's the knife?

160
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,916
Alfred was right.
I shouldn't have left it.

161
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,501
Bruce, slow down.

162
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,791
What's this knife?

163
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,630
You think someone
would actually kill for it?

164
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,881
Detective Gordon, I'll tell you
what you want to know.

165
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,345
But all I ask is
that you let me come along.

166
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,473
If this is because of the knife,
then I'm responsible.

167
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,226
Bruce, a man is dead,
a child is potentially missing.

168
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,848
This is not time to play detective.

169
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,859
What do you know?
What's so special about this knife?

170
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,021
As far as I know,
it's just an old knife.

171
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,857
But I paid a great deal for it.

172
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,863
And there was another bidder.
A very aggressive one.

173
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,652
Barbara Kean.

174
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,905
Right.

175
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,201
Well, Harper will track down
the grandson.

176
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,420
I'll deal with Barbara. You go home.

177
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,880
I'll call you when I need you.

178
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,472
You're here. Finally.

179
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,934
I've kept you waiting. Apologies.

180
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,981
I see my guests have arrived.

181
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,395
Oh, yeah.

182
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:38,034
Gotta say, they don't do much
for the vibe of the place.

183
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,237
If you had acquired the knife
when I first requested it,

184
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,950
they wouldn't be necessary.

185
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,627
What's so special
about this knife anyway?

186
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,917
Sentimental value?

187
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,175
Only a destiny
born of blood and magic

188
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,461
two thousand years in the making.

189
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,046
Uh-huh.

190
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,965
Now Dog-Boy here is gonna fetch...

191
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,555
His name is Anubis.

192
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,309
And yes.

193
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:19,651
Bring me the knife.
And you can kill the boy.

194
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,001
Boss.

195
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,546
Knocking, Victor. We discussed this.

196
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,755
Uh-huh?

197
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,590
She's here.

198
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,051
Show her in.

199
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,274
Ms. Falcone, welcome to Gotham.

200
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,351
Mr. Cobblepot,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

201
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,027
Call me Oswald.

202
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,981
Please, have a seat.

203
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,025
Thank you for coming to see me.

204
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,660
I learned from my father

205
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,612
when the king of Gotham
summons you, you come.

206
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,288
And how is Carmine?

207
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,158
Can we hope to see him sometime soon?

208
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,833
Shall we just address
the elephant in the room?

209
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,129
By all means.

210
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,210
My father's illegal businesses
hold no interest for me.

211
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,630
I'm here because the Falcone family
has a number of charities

212
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:23,805
that need my attention.

213
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,133
And you can only provide
that attention

214
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,468
by being here personally. In my city.

215
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,561
- I understand your concern...
- Oh, do you?

216
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,436
But I assure you,

217
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,813
it's unfounded.

218
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,068
You know, your father
taught me many things.

219
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,239
Among them was to nurture
a healthy paranoia.

220
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,238
For example, when I took over,

221
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,957
some of his old capos
went underground.

222
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,127
Now, perhaps
they've vanished for good.

223
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,163
Or perhaps they're waiting
for a Falcone

224
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,543
to return to lead a rebellion.

225
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,459
Who knows?

226
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,642
But, I hear your father's voice
whispering in my ear,

227
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,386
"Be careful."

228
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,225
Now...

229
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,483
I need to know that you are not
on some fool's errand

230
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,108
to rebuild your father's empire.

231
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,814
Otherwise...

232
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,360
I will stab you.

233
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,544
I was 13 when my father
first sent me away.

234
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,123
He said that
Gotham was too dangerous.

235
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,251
But this is my home.

236
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,926
I wanted to come home.

237
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,466
That's why I'm here.

238
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,881
Is that enough?

239
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,930
Gotham, Mother to us all.

240
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,860
I think we have nothing
to worry about.

241
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,987
Give your father my best, will you?

242
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,621
Jim.

243
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,333
What a lovely surprise.

244
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,585
Barbara.

245
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,046
Heard you popped up.

246
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,804
Seems like you landed
on your feet, as usual.

247
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,883
Hmm.

248
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,220
A woman has to stay busy.

249
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,097
You seem different.

250
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:38,975
You like this me better?

251
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,440
You recently bid on a knife
at auction.

252
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,447
So much for catching up.

253
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,321
That knife is now missing
and the person who had it is dead.

254
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,868
What were you doing last night
around midnight?

255
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,612
I was here

256
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,160
with witnesses.

257
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,241
We done?

258
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,076
No.

259
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,537
This place.

260
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,631
The money you used
to bid on the knife.

261
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,505
- Who's bankrolling you?
- A client.

262
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,672
And, no, though tempting,
I can't give you the name.

263
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,969
Is it Ra's al Ghul?

264
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,180
If it is Ra's al Ghul, you don't know
who you're dealing with.

265
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,559
I don't know who or what
you're talking about.

266
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,482
Now, should I call my lawyer?

267
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,273
We'll be in touch.

268
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,775
Come here.

269
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,576
You followed me?

270
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,375
After I told you to stay away?
What the hell were you thinking?

271
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,048
I told you I'm responsible.
You should have let me come with you.

272
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,295
It's clear she's lying.

273
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,127
I can help you find the killer,
find Alex.

274
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,337
That's my job!

275
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,545
You wanna help?

276
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,422
Who is Ra's al Ghul?

277
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,428
And why didn't you
mention him before?

278
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,052
I wasn't certain he was involved.

279
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,805
- The way she talked, I...
- You're lying, again.

280
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,026
Ra's al Ghul is the real leader
of The Court of Owls.

281
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,729
He's the one responsible
for the virus

282
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,234
and having me kidnapped.

283
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,283
And you didn't think to mention
any of this before?

284
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,623
Why would he want the knife, huh?
What's so important about it?

285
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,664
I have no clue. That's what
I've been trying to find out.

286
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,916
- Yeah?
<i>- Gordon, the kid's not at home.</i>

287
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,295
<i>Apparently,
Grandad was looking after him</i>

288
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,593
<i>while the parents were traveling.</i>

289
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,136
<i>He's not at school,
no one's seen him.</i>

290
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,212
Great.

291
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,638
Listen, I need all the info
you can get

292
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,090
on a man named Ra's al Ghul.

293
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,758
He could be connected.

294
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,555
<i>Sure. But how do you spell...</i>

295
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,597
No one's seen the boy.

296
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,182
He's either hiding

297
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,108
or the man
who killed his grandfather has him.

298
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,403
The police were triggered
by a fire alarm at the museum.

299
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,695
Alex could've pulled it,

300
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,736
taken the knife.

301
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,442
If so, he'd be hiding, scared.

302
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,445
Where could he be? Think.

303
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,955
I only met him for a second.

304
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,953
You want to play detective?
Now is your chance.

305
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,126
What was he wearing? What did he say?
Give me anything.

306
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,499
He had on his school uniform.

307
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,914
He just came from studying at...

308
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,133
Gotham Central Library.

309
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,177
His grandfather had a room there.
Alex has a key.

310
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,421
If he's hiding,

311
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,131
he's made a choice
not to trust the cops.

312
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,841
If I show up, he might run.

313
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,012
He needs to see a face he knows.
Come on.

314
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,356
Ed Nygma sent you?

315
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,229
The Edward Nygma?

316
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,733
Do it again.

317
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,818
<i>My once friend Oswald, now my foe</i>

318
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,032
<i>It's me, Ed, just so you know</i>

319
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,364
<i>It's time we meet,
I think you'll agree</i>

320
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,700
<i>You'll find me where
the Earth meets the sky</i>

321
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,834
<i>Where water flows and birds fly by</i>

322
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,995
<i>At dusk we'll meet,
I'll see you there</i>

323
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,585
<i>We'll settle things
unless you're scared</i>

324
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,005
What the hell was that?

325
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,590
We should torture 'em.

326
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,638
Just get them to tell us
where Nygma is.

327
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,348
No, he just found us on the street.

328
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,929
Well that's exactly
what you would say.

329
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,013
Leave!

330
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,442
That barmaid who kidnapped Ed
said he lost his step.

331
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,112
Clearly she was mistaken.
He's up to all of his old tricks.

332
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,363
So I'll meet him.

333
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,697
You and your men will hide nearby.

334
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,825
Attack when I say.
Do not kill Ed though.

335
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,702
I want Victor to freeze him again.

336
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,080
- Huh?
- Not you, the other Victor.

337
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,369
Oh.

338
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,579
"Earth meets sky,

339
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,998
"water flows, birds fly."

340
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,088
Obviously, he means the pier.

341
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,253
Gather your men.

342
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,680
I want Ed Nygma.

343
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,300
Historical Records room?

344
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:43,969
In the back.

345
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,195
Alex?

346
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,656
It's me, Bruce Wayne.

347
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,371
You can come out, it's safe.

348
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,333
Alex, please, I just wanna help you.

349
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,504
Alex.

350
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,218
This is Detective Gordon.

351
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,591
You can trust him.

352
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,185
Okay. Okay, all right.

353
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,856
I'm so sorry.

354
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,068
That man, he killed him.

355
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,695
He killed my grandfather.

356
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,196
It was a man? You saw his face?

357
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,823
I only saw him from behind.

358
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,697
It was the knife.
Did you know it was dangerous?

359
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,118
No. I had no idea.

360
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,829
Alex, we need to get you down
to the station.

361
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,131
I can't. That man,
he'll think I saw him.

362
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,089
- He'll come after me.
- I will protect you, I promise.

363
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,795
He'll keep coming
till he gets the knife.

364
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,515
Alex, do you have the knife with you?

365
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,308
No, I hid it.

366
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,142
Take Alex and meet me
at the station. Go.

367
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,498
Who sent you?

368
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,005
Thanks for clearing that up.

369
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,848
Bruce?

370
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,100
Run!

371
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,213
- Bruce Wayne call in?
- No.

372
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,719
We released a city-wide BOLO.

373
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,216
What about that name I gave you?

374
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,762
Zip. I tried Richard Gull,
Ralph Ghoul...

375
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,008
Detective Gordon?

376
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,058
Ra's al Ghul.

377
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,897
Minister of Antiquities attached
to the consulate of Nanda Parbat.

378
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,358
Thanks for coming in.

379
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,783
Nanda Parbat.
That's in the Himalayas, right?

380
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,025
Well done, Detective.

381
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,529
Few in your country have even heard
of our tiny nation.

382
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,449
Why don't we speak
in my captain's office.

383
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,659
A bit more private.

384
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,743
Of course.

385
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,042
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- Thank you.

386
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,043
I don't get it.

387
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,754
This is the guy
that you're looking at for murder?

388
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,838
Why does he just walk in?

389
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,594
Barbara must've told him
we were looking for him.

390
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,471
- Yeah, but...
- The two thugs at the library.

391
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,889
If they're working for him,

392
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,680
they would've told him
that we've contacted Alex.

393
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,311
He could think
that Alex gave us the knife.

394
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,560
I can use that.

395
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,189
Call Alfred Pennyworth.

396
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,487
See if he's heard from Bruce Wayne.

397
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,735
That thing bit me.

398
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,076
- I need to get you to a hospital.
- No. No.

399
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,156
Then the police.

400
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,454
- Detective Gordon...
- No, I can't. I can't, they'll find me.

401
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,956
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,205
I'm scared.

403
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,293
I don't know how you do it.

404
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,178
You fought those men, and I...

405
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,264
I just froze.

406
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,807
Same as when that man
killed my grandfather.

407
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,723
Fear is normal.

408
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,938
In the alley,
when my parents were killed

409
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,732
I was terrified.

410
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,610
I just stood there.

411
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,366
There's nothing wrong
with being afraid.

412
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,494
Once you realize it's normal
then you can put it in its place.

413
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,379
Then, you can act.

414
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,583
Fight back.

415
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,262
I felt bad for you.

416
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,807
When that happened to your parents.

417
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,065
You were all the kids at school
talked about.

418
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,187
What did they say?

419
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,316
That you live alone
in a mansion,

420
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:50,988
don't go to school,

421
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,157
fly around in jets.

422
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,114
They make you sound weird.

423
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,825
- Maybe I am.
- No.

424
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,585
You're cool.

425
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,203
I'm weird.

426
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:08,172
And you're a little weird too,
I guess.

427
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,423
But...

428
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,048
You're weirdly cool.

429
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,150
I'll take you to the knife.

430
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,114
Can I get you anything? Coffee?

431
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,570
That won't be necessary.
I think you know why I'm here.

432
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,535
- Enlighten me, Minister.
- Barbara Kean,

433
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,663
with whom you spoke,
was acting on behalf of my government

434
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,833
to procure a certain property.

435
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,212
Said property is
the cultural patrimony of my people.

436
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,456
Why not bid on the knife yourself?

437
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,382
There were competing claims.

438
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,629
And if we bid officially,
alarms may have sound

439
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,927
and so it seemed better
to do it quietly.

440
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,222
But Miss Kean

441
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,470
failed.

442
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,096
And now,

443
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,937
regrettably, I understand
there's been a murder?

444
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:06,643
Dr. Niles Winthrop.

445
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,070
Curator at the Gotham
Natural History Museum.

446
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,647
That's awful.

447
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,901
But the reason I'm here, Detective,

448
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,362
is to press my claim
on behalf of my government

449
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,494
and entreat you
to return the knife to me.

450
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,666
You say this knife
is important to your country.

451
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,452
Please explain.

452
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,174
There is an ancient story
amongst my people

453
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,553
of a man who could not die.

454
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,758
In his time,
he committed terrible acts.

455
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,351
Raised a great kingdom.

456
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,595
And then vanished.

457
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,305
What happened to him?

458
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,350
If the legend is to be believed,

459
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,611
he walked away from his throne,
vowing that one day he would return

460
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,654
and complete his destiny,

461
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,528
but that would require
a particular knife.

462
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,652
This knife.

463
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,070
A story.

464
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,320
As I said.

465
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,368
But to my people,

466
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,204
very meaningful.

467
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,664
I hope that satisfies your curiosity.

468
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,331
Some.

469
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:12,963
But you see, Minister,

470
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,845
my chief concern

471
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,551
is there's a boy,
the grandson of the curator.

472
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,260
He's being hunted.

473
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,722
Now, perhaps
that's because of the knife.

474
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,348
Or perhaps,

475
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,939
the killer thinks he saw something.

476
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,980
Did he?

477
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,607
No.

478
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,411
- Then he's safe.
- Yes, but you see,

479
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,534
I would have to know that
for certain

480
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,832
before I would do anything
that might affect the case.

481
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,455
Such as release the knife.

482
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,045
May I see the knife, Detective?

483
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,338
It would so set my mind at ease.

484
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,180
Where the bloody hell is Gordon?

485
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,556
Gordon, incoming!

486
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,478
Gordon, where the hell is Bruce?

487
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,639
You!

488
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,477
- Alfred, back off!
- Wait, wait! Get your hands off me.

489
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,437
You don't know
what you've got in there.

490
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,271
I'm starting to,
but you are not helping.

491
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,731
I need you to calm down.

492
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,487
- Let me finish talking to him.
- Gordon.

493
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,238
- Not now!
- Gordon!

494
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,532
He's bloody vanished.

495
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,455
He knows we don't have the knife.

496
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,541
We have to find Bruce.

497
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,128
- Donna Falcone.
- Do not call me that.

498
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,005
- You gotta hear us out.
- No, I don't.

499
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,844
I didn't invite you here.
We're not having this meeting.

500
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,924
Now I'm gonna ask you,
please, politely, to leave.

501
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,678
We served your father for years.

502
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,931
When Penguin took over,
we had to go underground.

503
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,687
Then we heard a Falcone
was back in Gotham,

504
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,348
we knew it was time.

505
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,026
Did you ignore my father
like you're ignoring me?

506
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,856
I just told you to leave.

507
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,192
Just tell us
when your father's coming back

508
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,614
to put that Penguin in his place.

509
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,652
Please understand me,
my father is not coming back.

510
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,945
This is Penguin's city.

511
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,074
And I want you to leave

512
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,872
- before he finds out you're here...
- Too late, I'm afraid.

513
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,410
Victor, how many graves did you dig?

514
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,328
Two.

515
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,871
But they're roomy.

516
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,392
And there we are.

517
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,523
My paranoia is put to rest.

518
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,859
Phew!

519
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,278
You used me.

520
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,705
You had me come to your club.

521
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,699
You knew word would get out.

522
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,625
That my father's loyalists
would find me.

523
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,669
I was a worm on your hook.

524
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,133
With one difference, my dear.

525
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,127
The worm is usually eaten.

526
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,504
So you trust me now?

527
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,215
You're alive, aren't you?

528
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,721
I would plant roses.
They cover up the smell.

529
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,567
My father wouldn't have
killed those men.

530
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:22,274
He would've invited me to his club,
as you did, but then gone further.

531
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,234
He would've invited me to dinners,

532
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,902
had us seen in public,

533
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,784
sent the message
that the old order supports me.

534
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,539
And those men you killed
would've pledged you loyalty.

535
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,209
Now they're fertilizer.

536
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,755
See, my father, he knew how to build
on the strength of others.

537
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,670
But it's your city.

538
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,893
New times, new methods.

539
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,038
There was an ancient Sumerian
jewelry box here.

540
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,406
I just replaced it.

541
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,996
Hiding in plain sight.

542
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,410
Good thinking.

543
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,585
Bruce, there's a legend
about this knife.

544
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,755
That terrible things happen
because of it.

545
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,432
But what if it's not just a legend?

546
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,014
My grandfather is dead.

547
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,813
The man that killed him,

548
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,565
he can't have this.

549
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,850
I won't let him.

550
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,270
I promise.

551
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,315
We have to get out of here. Run, run!

552
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,335
The Nanda Parbat consulate
is giving us the run around

553
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,162
and we can't get in there
without a warrant.

554
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,917
- Bruce still hasn't called you?
- No.

555
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,416
What the bloody hell were you doing
letting him tag along

556
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,627
with some murder investigation
in the first place, eh?

557
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,556
No, you do not get to lecture me
about a lack of honesty and openness.

558
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,758
You and Bruce have been
up to something for weeks.

559
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,427
What have you two
gotten yourselves into?

560
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,730
Damn it, Alfred. I'm on your side.

561
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,307
Well, that may be, mate.

562
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,939
But whatever Master Bruce decides
to tell you is his decision.

563
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,186
Isn't it?

564
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,229
You are his guardian.

565
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,156
You are allowed
to violate his privacy

566
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,483
if it is gonna keep him
out of danger.

567
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,567
Stick to the point.

568
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,454
What are you doing to find my boy?

569
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,406
What can I do, huh?

570
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,201
I have every cop in this city
on alert.

571
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,495
But as long as Ra's al Ghul
thinks he has that knife,

572
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,961
his life is in danger.

573
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,209
Yeah, right,
and what about the other boy?

574
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,415
Did he tell you
where he put the knife?

575
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,922
No. But I have to assume
Bruce is taking him to get it.

576
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,127
All right.

577
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,674
There's gotta be a clue or something
inside here.

578
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,679
- What?
- You stay here.

579
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,763
What?

580
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,433
The access I gave you
depended on trust.

581
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,227
If you can't be honest with me,
there's nothing I can do.

582
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,270
Harper.

583
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,275
If Mr. Pennyworth tries to leave,
arrest him.

584
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,110
On what charge?

585
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,490
She'll think of something.

586
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,100
I went to the pier.

587
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,442
I waited. Ed didn't show.

588
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,103
He...

589
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,774
- God, just get on with it!
- Right.

590
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,026
One, two...

591
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,197
<i>I waited and waited but you never came</i>

592
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,578
<i>You must be a coward or worse,
a lamebrain</i>

593
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,119
<i>I'll give you one chance
to make it right</i>

594
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,587
<i>Meet me again, this time at midnight</i>

595
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,084
<i>I'll make this one easy</i>

596
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,258
<i>This place makes some people lie</i>

597
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,756
<i>Some people speak
and some people cry</i>

598
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:58,967
Honestly, that could be anything.

599
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,551
Can we please just torture them, now?

600
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,635
Why not?

601
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,638
Wait a minute.

602
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,830
Run.

603
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,965
Bruce.

604
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,760
Down!

605
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,644
Let's go. Let's go.

606
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,156
Take him, take him, go.

607
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,241
Get off of me.

608
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,888
It's time you tell me
what's going on.

609
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,061
What is so important
about this knife?

610
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,847
Why are people dying for it?

611
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,107
Excellent question, Detective.

612
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,731
And you shall have your answer soon.

613
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,693
Just give me the knife
and I will release the boy.

614
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,241
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

615
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,529
Of course.

616
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,573
Bruce, hand me the knife.

617
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,626
Bruce. Hand me the knife.

618
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,880
You don't understand.

619
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,585
He killed Alfred.

620
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,757
And then brought him back to life.

621
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,134
And Alex's grandfather
was afraid of this knife.

622
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,137
I can't give it to him.

623
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,599
If we don't hand it over now,
Alex is dead.

624
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,180
- That is all that matters.
- No.

625
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,481
You don't know who he is.

626
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,975
I can't.

627
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,528
Well done, Bruce.

628
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,774
You're finally beginning
to see things clearly.

629
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,193
The question is...

630
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,743
Are you strong enough?

631
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,370
- No.
- Drop the weapon.

632
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,000
Hands in the air, on your knees.

633
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,249
Arrest me.

634
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,559
Ra's al Ghul
is on his way to Blackgate.

635
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,058
And we made contact
with Alex's parents.

636
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,814
It's gonna take them
a couple days to get home.

637
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,559
Bruce.

638
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,814
Ra's is a psychopath.

639
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,616
You're not responsible
for his actions.

640
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,070
I wanna help.

641
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,871
But everything you've said so far,

642
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,204
Alfred dying and coming back to life,
magical waters.

643
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,335
Give me something I can believe.

644
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,126
Perhaps now you understand
why we held back.

645
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,132
It doesn't matter
what you say, Detective.

646
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,672
This is all my fault.

647
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,972
Alex is dead because of me.

648
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,846
I killed him.

649
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:24,815
Oswald!

650
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,569
I waited for you.

651
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,904
Again.

652
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,159
And you didn't show. Again.

653
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,077
You coward.

654
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,457
Where are you?

655
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,417
Here.

656
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,503
And I may be many things,

657
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,678
but I'm not a coward.

658
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,970
Your riddles suck.

659
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,596
"This place may make some people lie,

660
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,769
"some people speak,
and some people cry."

661
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,275
That could mean anything.

662
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,027
Lying, speaking, crying.

663
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,193
You're just describing
a range of human behavior.

664
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,440
No!

665
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,819
I meant, lying, as in "lying dead..."

666
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,366
Laying down. Lying down.

667
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:13,906
As in dead.

668
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,073
Oh.

669
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,494
The answer was Stoker Cemetery.
Clearly.

670
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,080
Only an idiot wouldn't see that.

671
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:25,126
Face it, Ed. You can't make riddles
to save your ass anymore.

672
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,257
I guess she was right.

673
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,681
- What? Who was right?
- Your number one fan.

674
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,183
She said that there
was something wrong with you.

675
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,762
Took me a while to believe it, but...

676
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,853
You're not smart.

677
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,268
I am too smart.

678
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,947
- I'm the Riddler.
- Oh, God, that name again?

679
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,491
Tell me, how long did it take you
to come up with those riddles?

680
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,244
- I don't know.
- A minute? Two minutes?

681
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,404
A few hours.

682
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,406
Six hours.

683
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,375
- Six hours?
- Yes!

684
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,037
For two bad riddles?

685
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,585
Does that sound
anything like the old you?

686
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,678
Well, perhaps I'm still recovering
from being frozen in a block of ice!

687
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,639
But revenge
will certainly make me feel better.

688
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,095
You will never have revenge on me.

689
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,892
Ah! Yeah, I will.

690
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,928
- No, you won't.
- Oswald.

691
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:19,805
I'm gonna shoot you.

692
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:26,445
Yes. You might shoot me, kill me,

693
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,524
but only he can get revenge on me.

694
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,406
The man I froze on that pier.

695
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:39,117
The man who would've killed himself
before writing those idiotic riddles.

696
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,127
The man whose name
I still will not speak.

697
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:45,664
But he's gone.

698
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:48,584
You're just Ed Nygma.

699
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,136
And, not even Ed Nygma,

700
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,927
because Ed Nygma
would've noticed something.

701
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,134
What?

702
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,055
Doesn't it feel kind of chilly
in here?

703
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,436
You remember him?

704
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,863
My other Victor?

705
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,484
I'm going to put you on ice, again.

706
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,953
You want the same pose
or something else?

707
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,406
No, wait, please.

708
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,248
- Got it, same pose.
- No!

709
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,078
Okay, Oswald.

710
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,716
I'm not the Riddler.

711
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,256
Do it.

712
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:38,717
Stop.

713
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,845
I've changed my mind.

714
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,641
I'm not gonna freeze you.

715
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,565
I would only be freezing Ed Nygma.

716
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,312
Who cares about that?

717
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,738
No. A better revenge
is having you live,

718
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,153
knowing that you're not him

719
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,492
and you never will be again.

720
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,116
Goodbye, Ed.

721
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,798
Who am I?

722
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,348
I must have been seven or eight.

723
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,677
It was late.

724
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,104
I snuck downstairs to find my father

725
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,353
with a man before him on his knees.

726
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,401
Begging for forgiveness.

727
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,897
My father stabbed him in the neck.

728
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,405
The next morning,
there wasn't a trace of blood.

729
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,154
And we had breakfast at that table.

730
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,917
Now you'd think I'd want to stay
far away from Gotham

731
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:50,715
but this house, this city,
is in my veins.

732
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,459
I'm home, Jim.

733
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,139
Word on the street is three
Falcone capos have gone missing.

734
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:02,844
They were in hiding.

735
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,722
Penguin used me as bait
to draw them out.

736
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,639
And killed them.

737
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,143
And you let him?

738
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,987
Don't act the innocent, Jim.

739
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,986
You came to Carmine Falcone for help.

740
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,817
It was never going to be bloodless.

741
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,365
So is that your plan?

742
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,542
Get close to Penguin,
gain his confidence, what then?

743
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,497
I need to know
what you're going to do.

744
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,875
No, you don't.

745
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,832
You want this city back from Penguin.

746
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,299
I'll give that to you.

747
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:37,969
But you have to trust me.
