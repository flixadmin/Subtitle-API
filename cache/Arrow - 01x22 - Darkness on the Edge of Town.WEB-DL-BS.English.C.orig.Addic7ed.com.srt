1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,309
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,579
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,064
survive.

4
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:11,882
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:14,101
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:16,604
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:20,191
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:24,061
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:27,331
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,732
<i>Previously, on</i>
Arrow...

11
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:30,501
Rescuing your father
and stopping Fyers

12
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:32,420
is not going to be
some walk in the park.

13
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:35,122
- Yao Fei!
- Ba!

14
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:37,124
How did you
escape?

15
00:00:37,126 --> 00:00:40,644
I didn't.

16
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:42,463
You told me to stay away
from your family and I did,

17
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:44,482
but your family isn't
staying away from me,

18
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:46,684
which means something
must be done about it.

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,937
You're going home.

20
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,522
About my mother,

21
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:53,607
and about her involvement
in the Undertaking.

22
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,276
She's working
with Malcolm Merlyn,

23
00:00:55,278 --> 00:01:00,114
and they're planning
something terrible.

24
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:04,101
So, I was
wondering--

25
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:06,153
there's a late night
happy hour at Stella's.

26
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:07,705
You know, the place
across the street.

27
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:09,606
You mean the place
that's always playing

28
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:12,043
loud salsa music at all hours
when I'm trying to work late?

29
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:13,461
That--that would be
the one, yeah.

30
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:16,113
Anyway, I was
thinking that, um,

31
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:18,332
maybe, you know,
if you wanted to,

32
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:20,634
we could perhaps
grab a drink?

33
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:24,221
How about two?

34
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:27,258
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,676
Please.

36
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:31,679
I did everything
Mr. Merlyn required of me!

37
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,797
He knows,
Dr. Markov,

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,816
and he thanks you
for your service.

39
00:01:44,643 --> 00:01:46,360
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

40
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:48,028
Freeze!

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,167
- No!
- Open the door!

42
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:56,837
Get down on the floor!

43
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:25,733

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,324
I've been watching your mother for
days now, Oliver, and nothing.

46
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:35,075
She goes to work,
she comes home.

47
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:37,161
Occasionally
she goes out for dinner.

48
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:40,197
She seems to particularly
like the salmon tartar at Table Salt.

49
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,632
I'm linked into her home
and office phone.

50
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,250
Nothing out
of the ordinary.

51
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:44,802
No mention of Walter's abduction
or the Undertaking.

52
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:47,221
Just a few innocuous calls
to Malcolm Merlyn.

53
00:02:47,223 --> 00:02:49,390
Why wouldn't she
call him?

54
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:52,876
They're old friends.

55
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,646
We're all
old friends.

56
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:59,099
Are you ok?

57
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:01,485
My mom and my best
friend's dad

58
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:02,937
are involved
in a conspiracy

59
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,905
that may have dire
consequences for the city.

60
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:06,941
And I'm pretty sure
they murdered my father.

61
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:09,715
I'm not planning
on using the word "ok"

62
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,363
again any time soon.

63
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:13,397
Listen, all we know for sure
is that Malcolm

64
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,249
and your mother are planning
something for the glades.

65
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,084
And that Walter and I
were getting too close to it,

66
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:18,536
that's why
they had him kidnapped.

67
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:20,004
We have to find out
what this Undertaking is.

68
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:22,573
I got to ask her.

69
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:25,426
Well, no. The last time the Vigilante
paid your mom a visit,

70
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:28,295
you got shot, and I got
to play doctor with you.

71
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:31,415
Ahh! My brain thinks
of the worst way to say things.

72
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,750
This time it'll
just be me asking.

73
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:36,604
Friendly
mother-son chat.

74
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:48,365
Laurel? What are you doing here?
It's not even 7:00 a.m.

75
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,868
That's just after
closing time, right?

76
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,954
How's business?

77
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:55,573
Well, it's busy.

78
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:58,158
Busy. It was easier when
Tommy was running things.

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,411
- Tommy's a good guy.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,246
Are you?

81
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,380
What do you mean?

82
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:05,132
Last week,
I told you

83
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:06,834
that I wanted
to get back with Tommy.

84
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:08,919
That I needed you
to go to him

85
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,339
and explain to him that you
didn't still have feelings for me.

86
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:14,308
But instead,

87
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,627
you told me that you did.

88
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:19,630
As I'm sure you can
probably imagine,

89
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:21,865
I haven't been able
to think of much since.

90
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:25,002
I shouldn't
have said that.

91
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:26,470
Then why did you?

92
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:29,156
I didn't...
have an agenda.

93
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:30,855
I didn't mean to make it
more difficult for you

94
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,549
to fix things with Tommy.

95
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:36,280
But what if you did?

96
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:43,587
After you disappeared--

97
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:47,258
with Sara--

98
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,044
I was sorry
I ever knew you.

99
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:52,771
But now, things
have happened that

100
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:54,516
I never thought would.

101
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:57,518
You coming home.

102
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,056
My parents being
in the same room.

103
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:04,174
And you.

104
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:06,727
What if I'm finally
starting to see you

105
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,362
for who you really are?
No, Laurel, it's--

106
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:10,064
And maybe
Tommy was right.

107
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:12,066
Maybe he and I
weren't meant to be.

108
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:15,619
Maybe I'm finally
ready to admit that...

109
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:19,073
that I still have
feelings for you, too.

110
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:24,545
Nothing's changed.

111
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:27,164
My life hasn't changed.

112
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,466
I haven't changed.

113
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:33,887
I got to go.

114
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,007
Walter's coming home.

115
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:49,269
Everything's exactly
as you left it.

116
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,905
How are you feeling,
Walter?

117
00:05:51,907 --> 00:05:53,824
I'm on the mend,
thank you, Oliver.

118
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:55,626
Oh, I'm so glad
you're home.

119
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:57,077
That makes two of us.

120
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,829
All of us.

121
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:00,864
We've prepared
a delicious brunch for you.

122
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:01,999
All your favorites.

123
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,018
Oh, yum,
English food.

124
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,570
Actually, I'm more tired from
the drive than I expected.

125
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:09,089
So I think I'd like
to lie down for a bit.

126
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:11,975
Yes, of course.

127
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,643
Walter doesn't really
seem like himself.

128
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:31,879
He's gone through a lot.

129
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,382
It's just...
going to take a little bit of time.

130
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:37,434
I'm really sick of us

131
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:40,037
all having to go through
a lot, you know?

132
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:46,627
Six scientists
and three security personnel

133
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:48,862
are confirmed killed
in the massacre.

134
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:52,483
Among the dead, respected
seismologist Brian Markov.

135
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:54,284
A spokesperson
for Unidac Industries

136
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:55,636
says a comment
would be forthcoming.

137
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:56,720
Mom, we need to talk.

138
00:06:56,722 --> 00:06:59,289
Oh, uh, later,
Oliver.

139
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,957
...co-workers, parents
and families of all the victims

140
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,811
to see how they're coping
with their loss.

141
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:35,158
- You!
- Save it.

142
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,161
We don't have the luxury
of indulging in vendettas.

143
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:39,763
- Ba!
- Shado.

144
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:42,299
You led Fyers
right to us, you coward!

145
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:45,185
Fyers was about
to fire bomb the entire forest

146
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:46,437
just to eliminate you.

147
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,839
This way, you all
have a chance.

148
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:51,358
Well, pray I don't get the
chance to repay your mercy.

149
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,176
How fitting.

150
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:55,145
Everyone reunited
for the end.

151
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:57,898
The end of what?
What is all this for?

152
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,535
HKIA, this is
Ferris Air flight 637 out of Paris,

153
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,520
nonstop to Hong Kong.

154
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:05,989
We are steady on approach
at 33,000 feet

155
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:07,691
and winds at 15 knots.

156
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:09,993
ETA, two hours,
15 minutes, over.

157
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:12,696
Ferris 637, this is HKIA.

158
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:14,465
Adjust course
to 0.6 degrees south.

159
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:16,383
11 minutes, over.

160
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,252
Roger, HKIA.
Why the course change?

161
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:20,420
Nothing to worry about, 637.

162
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:22,873
Just looking to make sure
you avoid a little turbulence.

163
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,725
Roger that.
Adjusting course now.

164
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:26,226
They're altering course,
sir. The plane

165
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,011
will be in range
of Lian Yu in 26 minutes.

166
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:29,813
Good. Keep tracking it.

167
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:31,899
That's a commercial
airliner, Fyers.

168
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:33,367
It's not like it can land here.

169
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,519
It won't be landing
anywhere, Mr. Queen.

170
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:37,437
I'm going to destroy it.

171
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:44,495
Arrows are black,
not green.

172
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:45,863
Copycat archer again.

173
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:47,664
Psychopaths are color-coding
themselves now.

174
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,500
- That's helpful.
- Yeah, except we haven't seen

175
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:51,084
the copycat in quite a while.

176
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:53,504
Ok, last time he took hostages
to draw out the Vigilante.

177
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:56,740
This time, he massacres
a bunch of lab nerds?

178
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:59,409
I want a press lockdown, nobody
hears about the other archer

179
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,011
and we need to get a list
of all Unidac employees

180
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:02,796
and find out what
they're working on here.

181
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:04,548
Apparently it was
a tight group.

182
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,583
Anyone who knows
anything about the project is dead.

183
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,769
And the copycat fried all their
computers and burned their research.

184
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:10,754
Whatever's
going on here,

185
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:13,140
someone doesn't want
anyone to know about it.

186
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:17,027
Where did you even
get that camera?

187
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,614
Come to think of it,
where did you get this car?

188
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:22,065
I borrowed it.

189
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,650
Illegally.

190
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,786
You know, when I imagine
being in a car with you,

191
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:27,788
this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

192
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,857
Yeah, well, you're the one who said
you'd help me find the Vigilante.

193
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:32,492
I know,
but it's been two weeks,

194
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:34,444
and the closest we've come
is snapping photos

195
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:36,214
of the cop who hates
the Hood just as much

196
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,799
- as you worship him.
- I don't worship him.

197
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,801
I just need
to find him.

198
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:43,787
You don't need to find him
to be somebody.

199
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:47,123
Besides, it's not like you're going
to meet him any time soon.

200
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,227
Just that the cops
don't have a clue.

201
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:53,730
We don't know
what they know.

202
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:57,851
Ok, I officially
do not like that look.

203
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:00,187
You still work
at CNRI, right?

204
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,612
Hey, Mom.

205
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:12,148
Walter's upstairs resting.

206
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,618
I think he's...
doing well, don't you?

207
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,670
Who took him?

208
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:19,256
Well, we don't know yet.
But I'm going to make sure

209
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:21,842
all the resources of Queen
Consolidated are behind it.

210
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:24,294
That's the answer that you
gave to reporters yesterday.

211
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:28,432
Tell me the truth.

212
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:30,100
I don't know
what you mean.

213
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:32,219
I think you do.
A couple months ago,

214
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,941
when I showed you dad's
notebook, you seemed

215
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:35,356
to know something.

216
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:37,441
Something about our
family being in danger.

217
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:39,726
Are you suggesting
that I knew something

218
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:41,845
about my husband's kidnapping?

219
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:43,647
I'm just suggesting that
maybe you were scared.

220
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,600
That maybe you didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

221
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,852
But it was harder
than you thought.

222
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:50,988
And now you're barely keeping
your head above water.

223
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,523
Please, Mom.

224
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:56,076
Let me help you
before you drown.

225
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,079
You need to stop asking these things.
Do you understand?

226
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,931
I need you to stop.

227
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,382
I can't.

228
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:04,568
I need to know.

229
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,803
Is that a power outage?

230
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:08,588
I don't know.

231
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,677
Oliver! Oliver!

232
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,310
Mom!

233
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:37,895
Oliver.

234
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,114
Are you ok?

235
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,482
Oliver?

236
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,651
What--what--

237
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:46,120
we got to get
out of here.

238
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,539
Moira Queen...

239
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,058
You have failed the city.

240
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,211
It doesn't make any sense!

241
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,946
Why do you want
to blow up a plane?

242
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,715
When the New York
Stock Exchange

243
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,133
reopened after 9-11,

244
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:03,053
the Dow Jones dropped
nearly 685 points.

245
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,955
Can you imagine
what would happen to China,

246
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,340
the world's second
largest economy,

247
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:08,842
if all air travel
in and out of China

248
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,394
were to be grounded
indefinitely?

249
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,230
You want to destabilize
China's economy?

250
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,650
It's not what I want,
but rather my employer.

251
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,686
We have enough
missiles here

252
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:21,405
to shoot down any aircraft
approaching the mainland.

253
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,658
And that will
decimate China's economy.

254
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,994
Especially...
once a rogue element

255
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,030
in China's own military
claims responsibility.

256
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:34,484
You see, inconvenient
though you occasionally were,

257
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:38,255
you're always worth
more to me alive than dead.

258
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,923
Then you should
have killed me.

259
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,126
Because I won't do it.

260
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:49,283
Ahh!

261
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:52,052
Shado! Shado!

262
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,271
I said I need you alive,

263
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,057
but I can kill
everyone you care about.

264
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,651
Help you with something?

265
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,370
Yes, um, I'm from CNRI

266
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,841
and we're investigating claims
of racial bias in SCPD arrests.

267
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:16,477
So I'm going to need
a copy of each file

268
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,681
from every arrest in
Starling City January,

269
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,706
2011 to the present.

270
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,416
It's almost 9:00 at night.

271
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:24,084
Yeah, well, tell that
to Judge Crow.

272
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:25,753
He's the one who signed
the court order.

273
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:31,708
Wait here.

274
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,894
I don't know, it seems
like a bit of a reach.

275
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,979
Yeah, which is what you do
when you got nothin'.

276
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,481
'Cause all I know
is the copycat,

277
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,883
he torched every record
down at Unidac.

278
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,735
And all we got are
phone records

279
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,553
and they show
that this Markov guy,

280
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:46,056
he made a couple of calls to
an unclaimed line at Merlyn Global.

281
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,192
A couple of calls?
Did I say reach?

282
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,110
I misspoke. I meant leap.

283
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,995
Just get someone down
here from Merlyn Global

284
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,414
to answer a few
questions under oath.

285
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:00,170
Did you find anything?

286
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,404
Lots.

287
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:03,573
- Anything helpful?
- No, still looking.

288
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,742
What about you?
You learn anything from the cops?

289
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,262
As a matter
of fact...

290
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,746
I like the sound of that.

291
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,265
You know that
copycat archer?

292
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,133
Yeah.

293
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:15,585
Turns out he's connected to
Merlyn Global somehow.

294
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,271
Or, at least
his victims are.

295
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,923
We're looking for the Hood,
not some crazy wannabe.

296
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,975
Well, the guy
with the black arrows

297
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,593
seems to hate the guy
with the green arrows, so...

298
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,362
So what, we just
show up at Merlyn Global

299
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,447
and hope the Hood
shows up, too?

300
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,983
Last I checked,

301
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:32,236
you don't have
any better ideas.

302
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,873
Please!

303
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,125
Do not hurt my son.

304
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,378
Tell me what the Undertaking is
and I won't have to.

305
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:50,921
No!
Tell me!

306
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,306
Please!

307
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,957
Leave my son alone!

308
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,592
What is Malcolm Merlyn
planning?!

309
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,811
I can't tell you!

310
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,181
He'll kill me,
he'll kill my family.

311
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:04,101
You should be more worried
about what I'll do.

312
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:07,137
No!

313
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,324
Malcolm is planning
to level the Glades!

314
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,278
He said so he could
rebuild it, but...

315
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,330
How?

316
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,749
- There's a device.
- What device?!

317
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,002
He says that it can
cause an earthquake.

318
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,337
How is this possible?

319
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,671
I don't know.

320
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,458
It was invented
by Unidac Industries.

321
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,996
Malcolm used my company's
Applied Sciences

322
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,383
to turn it
into a weapon.

323
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:41,471
Why would you get involved
in something like this?

324
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,575
My husband...

325
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,527
He got involved
without my knowing.

326
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,563
He was just trying
to do some good.

327
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,949
He was lost. He...

328
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,535
His decisions
left me vulnerable

329
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,738
to Malcolm,
and I had no choice.

330
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,240
I had to protect
my family and my children.

331
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:03,076
This device...
Where is it?

332
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:04,861
I don't know.

333
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,630
If you don't tell me,
I can't stop Merlyn!

334
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,715
Oh, you can't stop him.

335
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,552
It's too late.

336
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:20,510
No, no, no,
I told you everything!

337
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,886
Oliver!

338
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,189
- Oh, sweet--
- Dont.

339
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,242
Please, I know what you must be
thinking, sweetheart,

340
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,778
but I never intended
any of this to happen.

341
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,164
You know I would
never willingly

342
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,500
be a part of
anything like this.

343
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:50,040
I don't know anything anymore.

344
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:03,968
Oh, my God.

345
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:05,468
You said you were going
to pull your punches!

346
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,921
- I did.
- Let me get you an icepack for...

347
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:10,506
- Everything.
- I'm fine.

348
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:13,313
I need you to dig up
everything you can

349
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:14,689
on Unidac Industries.

350
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:18,663
Well, we know Queen Consolidated
acquired them seven months ago.

351
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,549
That's when we met.

352
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:23,501
I need information
about what I don't know.

353
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:27,069
Unidac is a small
research and development

354
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:28,540
technology company

355
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,727
that specializes in
seismic infringement.

356
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:34,729
Merlyn plans on
leveling the Glades

357
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:37,649
with a device that triggers
a manmade earthquake.

358
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:40,101
You're kidding.

359
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:42,153
What else
does it say?

360
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:44,406
More information
on the stock auction

361
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:46,274
and, you know,
the latest

362
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:47,659
on what the media's
calling--

363
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,077
The Unidac massacre.
There's no way

364
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,328
this timing is a coincidence.

365
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,080
Oliver,
there's a website

366
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:54,732
claiming the police
suspect a copycat archer.

367
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:57,168
- What?!
- So the other archer works for Merlyn?

368
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,454
He's tying up
loose ends.

369
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:01,122
Erasing all evidence
this device exists

370
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:04,092
so no one can trace
the devastation back to him.

371
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:06,428
All right, so you're going to have a
pointed conversation with Mr. Merlyn.

372
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,579
Well, even if I take out Merlyn,
the other archer is still out there.

373
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:10,932
He can set off the device.
We need to find it.

374
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:12,917
Then Merlyn
can get his.

375
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,637
Well, maybe there's another
way to get Merlyn to tell us.

376
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:17,272
What do you have in mind?

377
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:20,108
As I keep proving,
people keep secrets.

378
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,443
Computers don't.

379
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:23,612
Felicity, are you hacking

380
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:25,096
into the Merlyn
Global mainframe?

381
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:26,898
"Hacking" is such
an ugly word.

382
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,067
No. I'm...

383
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:32,787
Yeah, totally hacking
into the Merlyn Global mainframe.

384
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:35,674
Stop!

385
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:37,108
I'll do it.

386
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,411
I knew your good judgment
could be counted on.

387
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:41,329
Come along now.

388
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:42,797
We need to get you
back into uniform.

389
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:11,776
It's Fyers.
It's happening.

390
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:13,695
Understood.

391
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:15,413
That was Fyers.

392
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:19,000
Everything is proceeding
to your plan.

393
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,289
It truly is very kind of
you to come all the way out here.

394
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,042
Walter?

395
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:29,544
Who are you
speaking to--

396
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,179
Moira.

397
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,514
How are you?

398
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,149
Well.
Thank you.

399
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:36,434
Actually, you look
a little bit out of sorts.

400
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,386
Oh, no, no,
I'm fine.

401
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:43,224
Malcolm stopped by
to check up on his nemesis.

402
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:44,976
On the racquetball court.

403
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:47,896
I didn't get a chance
to talk to Walter

404
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:49,397
at the hospital.
Like everyone,

405
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:52,617
I'm glad he's back
where he belongs.

406
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:54,386
With his family.

407
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:57,072
Yes.

408
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:58,540
I'll let you get
some rest.

409
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,542
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

410
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:03,445
Uh, I'll
walk you out.

411
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:07,916
Your assassin
wasn't too subtle

412
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:09,718
in eliminating those
people at Unidac.

413
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,970
Well, now the police are focused
on the copycat archer

414
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:14,305
instead of the Undertaking.
As for our collateral damage,

415
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:16,257
I had to limit our exposure.
I see.

416
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:18,093
And does paying Walter
a visit just now

417
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:20,095
fall under
the same category?

418
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:22,147
You held him
for nearly six months.

419
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:24,899
Surely you had him questioned.
He was.

420
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:26,651
And I assume
that if Walter knew

421
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:28,870
something you'd rather he
didn't, agreement be damned,

422
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:32,023
I would be a widow again.
Am I wrong?

423
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:34,325
Rarely.

424
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:39,948
Well, we discovered
a few phone calls

425
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,616
between one
of the Unidac victims

426
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:44,068
and someone
at the Merlyn Global group.

427
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,571
Which is why I asked
for someone at your company

428
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:48,739
to help me
with my investigation.

429
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:49,978
But naturally, they send down
the one guy that's been

430
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:52,861
working there 30 seconds
and knows nothing.

431
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:56,581
Detective Lance,
if someone from Merlyn Global

432
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,999
is involved
with those deaths,

433
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,684
I want them found
as much as you do.

434
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:03,254
Give me more to go on
than some phone calls

435
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:04,881
and I will help you
in any way that I can.

436
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:06,882
Thank you.

437
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,263
What are you
doing here?

438
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:16,401
Helping your father
with an investigation.

439
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:19,204
Uh...

440
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:20,938
Call me

441
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,624
if you need
anything else.

442
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:25,493
Thank you.

443
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:28,997
One second, sweetie.

444
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,715
Ok, someone at Merlyn Global
could be connected

445
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:32,597
to the copycat archer,
all right?

446
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:34,123
Any chance you can have
a little snoop around

447
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:35,628
their computer systems?

448
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:36,890
You'll need a warrant.

449
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:40,726
No, we'll need a judge
who owes me a favor.

450
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:43,328
Hey.

451
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,165
You never did tell me what had
you and Merlyn on the outs.

452
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,717
No, I didn't.

453
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:52,170
You don't have to tell me.

454
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:55,307
Oliver.

455
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:56,975
Come on.

456
00:21:56,977 --> 00:21:59,644
I know.
I know. Say it.

457
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:02,463
You--you think
I'm crazy.

458
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:04,316
I mean, Oliver,
he cheated on me,

459
00:22:04,318 --> 00:22:06,601
he broke my heart,
he led Sara to her death

460
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:08,947
and you would probably
rather drink acid than

461
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:10,156
see me with him again.

462
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:12,908
Dad...

463
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,277
I am sure you're
disappointed in me.

464
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:25,203
Since Queen's been back, he's...

465
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,689
Different.

466
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:32,360
I'll deny ever
having said that.

467
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,546
Hmm.

468
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:38,016
Let's eat.

469
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:46,174
Anything?

470
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:48,443
Just for the record,
I will pump my fist in the air

471
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,395
and scream, "yes!"
If I get in.

472
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:51,696
You know, you can just say
this isn't working.

473
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:53,114
This isn't working.

474
00:22:53,116 --> 00:22:54,616
All right, there has
to be some other way

475
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:56,117
we can find out where
he's keeping this device.

476
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,186
Unless I can waltz up
to Merlyn's mainframe

477
00:22:58,188 --> 00:22:59,938
and plug in my tablet directly, there's
no way of getting that location.

478
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,790
Then we waltz.

479
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,491
Excuse me?

480
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:05,193
You need direct access
to the mainframe,

481
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:06,878
so we get you direct access
to the mainframe,

482
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,247
and we figure out
where the device is being kept.

483
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:11,216
Oliver...I did mention

484
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:13,418
that the mainframe
is located inside

485
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,970
Merlyn Global Group's
main headquarters,

486
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:16,721
on the 25th floor?

487
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:18,473
It's only accessible through
a restricted access elevator.

488
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:20,809
I know.

489
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:23,128
We're going
to have to break in.

490
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:36,062
Hi. Oliver Queen.

491
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:38,731
I have an 11:30
with Tommy Merlyn.

492
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:43,452
I have a super deluxe
big Belly Buster

493
00:23:43,454 --> 00:23:47,123
for a Mr. Andrews.
I think he's in security.

494
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,208
He a good tipper?

495
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,577
You can go on up,
Mr. Queen.

496
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,196
You can wait a second.

497
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:55,748
New guy,
you order food?

498
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,633
Yeah, I'm addicted
to big belly burger.

499
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:59,085
Never had it.

500
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:01,137
I'll split it with you.

501
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:05,174
Keep the change.

502
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:16,902
Hold that.

503
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:21,323
Where you heading,
sweetie?

504
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:22,575
19th floor.

505
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,110
Too bad,
I'm going to 13.

506
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:26,612
Damn it!

507
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:32,751
Mr. Andrews
got his lunch?

508
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:36,205
One belly buster with benzodiazepine.
Hold the mayo.

509
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:45,347
Sleep tight.

510
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:56,025
Mainframe's on 25, guys.
That's as close as I can get you.

511
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:09,872
Come on.

512
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:31,310
Don't look down.

513
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:32,794
Too late.

514
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:35,014
I should mention,
I'm afraid of heights,

515
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,565
which I just
learned.

516
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,734
- Hey, Felicity.
- Hmm?

517
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:40,436
Hold on to me tight.

518
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,822
I imagined you saying that under
different circumstances.

519
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:47,109
Very platonic...
circumstances.

520
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:54,083
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

521
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:15,804
Come on.

522
00:26:17,357 --> 00:26:19,775
You all right?

523
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:21,060
I'm fine.

524
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,612
Yeah, this is just
my "about to hack" face.

525
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:25,898
I always...
Oh, look like this

526
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,117
right before I,
you know, hack.

527
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,868
Security patrol's on
a ten minute cycle.

528
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,238
I'll have my meeting with Tommy
and be back in nine, ok?

529
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,623
Ok.

530
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,325
Ok.

531
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:40,629
Dig, you got
eyes on her?

532
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:42,498
Five by five.

533
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:05,154
Ok.

534
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:09,575
Sure beats
the back of a bar.

535
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,243
I saw your name
in my schedule,

536
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:12,661
I thought it must
be a typo.

537
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:15,614
Why so serious?
Did someone decide

538
00:27:15,616 --> 00:27:18,067
that they didn't want you putting
an arrow in them today?

539
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,603
I thought it was
past time we talked.

540
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,954
About what?

541
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:24,340
Me leaving the club,
you being a serial killer?

542
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,241
We're not lacking
for topics.

543
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:29,595
Let's start with Laurel,
since you're still in love with her.

544
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:31,130
So are you.

545
00:27:31,132 --> 00:27:34,433
I can't be with her, Tommy.

546
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:35,768
You know why I can't.

547
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,803
So what?

548
00:27:37,805 --> 00:27:40,055
I'm her consolation
prize? I'll pass.

549
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:43,025
She's not anyone's... property.

550
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:46,278
Laurel makes
her own decisions.

551
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,315
And she chose you.

552
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,967
Until you couldn't handle it.

553
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:55,821
Lord knows I am guilty
of a lot of things between us,

554
00:27:55,823 --> 00:27:59,408
but not you and her.

555
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,544
That's all I came to say.

556
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,971
What exactly do you do here?

557
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:16,558
I work closely
with my father.

558
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:32,441
- Guys, you got trouble.
- What?!

559
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:34,743
Felicity's about to have some head
of schedule company.

560
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:36,328
I'm not there yet
on the download.

561
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,747
Hold tight,
I'm on my way.

562
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:40,532
Oliver.

563
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:42,368
Mr. Merlyn.

564
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,820
I must say, I'm surprised
to see you here.

565
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:46,872
Tommy and I just had
a little unfinished business.

566
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:48,824
Ahh. I know things have been
challenging between you two,

567
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:50,992
but I trust you're
working things out.

568
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:52,795
- Felicity!
- Just a few more seconds.

569
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,213
Yes.

570
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:55,831
I'm sorry, I have to go.

571
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,549
There are some investors
waiting for me back at the club.

572
00:28:57,551 --> 00:28:59,051
I'm heading out
to a meeting myself.

573
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:01,186
I'll walk you down
to the lobby.

574
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:04,606
She's going
to get made, Oliver.

575
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:08,026
Oliver, did you hear me?!

576
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:14,132
Felicity!

577
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,000
What? Just a few
more seconds!

578
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:18,035
Come on, come on, come on.

579
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:21,138
You don't have
a few more seconds.

580
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,792
Yes! Wow,
I really do do that.

581
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:33,550
Damn it, Oliver, she's in trouble,
where are you?

582
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:35,135
This is
a restricted area.

583
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:37,822
Let's see some I.D.

584
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:39,440
I.D.? Um...

585
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:41,492
Tell your mother
I said hello.

586
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:43,761
I will.

587
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:46,697
Got held up.
Heading back upstairs.

588
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,199
Ollie?

589
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:51,452
Thea?

590
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:52,953
What are you
doing here?

591
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:55,122
I, uh, just saw Tommy.

592
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:56,790
Yeah, me, too.

593
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,408
I'm going to run back up,
I don't want to be late.

594
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,378
Oh, I thought
you just came down.

595
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,547
There you are!

596
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:05,966
Thanks a lot, man,
this one snuck past security.

597
00:30:05,968 --> 00:30:07,434
One of Merlyn junior's
bimbos.

598
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:09,103
She's pissed he never
called her back.

599
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:11,305
Copy that.
I read the tabloids.

600
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:13,440
Yeah. Thanks again.
Let's go, Barbie.

601
00:30:13,442 --> 00:30:15,476
Your new last name
ain't going to be Merlyn.

602
00:30:15,478 --> 00:30:17,778
But I love him!
He's my man!

603
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,065
You're my knight
in shining armor.

604
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:26,120
Is that
your friend Roy?

605
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:28,205
- No, um...
- No?

606
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:30,274
Yeah, he gave me a ride.

607
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:32,960
Thea, what are you
really doing here?

608
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:34,611
The truth, please.

609
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:36,413
- The truth?
- Mm-hmm.

610
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:39,091
Um...We're trying to find
the Vigilante.

611
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:39,618
What?

612
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:42,138
Roy's been kind of obsessed
with him since he saved

613
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:43,171
his life at the subway.

614
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:45,339
And I overheard
Detective Lance saying

615
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:48,292
that the other archer was connected
to Merlyn Global, so--

616
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:50,811
- Hey!
- Roy.

617
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,147
We haven't met. I'm Thea's
disapproving older brother.

618
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:55,816
Yeah, I know.
Good to meet you.

619
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:59,653
Don't mess around
with the Hood.

620
00:30:59,655 --> 00:31:01,155
He's a psychopath,
he's dangerous,

621
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:03,190
and anyone who gets
near him winds up dead.

622
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:05,276
That will not be my sister.
Do you hear me?

623
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,532
Ok.

624
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:14,285
Take her home...now.

625
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,629
What are you doing?

626
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:27,681
The Vigilante's not too fond
of guys who sell Vertigo.

627
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:30,684
I know a guy who claims he still
has a stash to sell.

628
00:31:30,686 --> 00:31:32,502
Maybe we could
stake him out,

629
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:33,854
hope the Hood
shows up for him.

630
00:31:33,856 --> 00:31:36,023
Did you not hear
what my brother said?

631
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:37,641
What does your brother
know about him?

632
00:31:37,643 --> 00:31:40,894
Uh, for one thing, the Vigilante
once saved his life,

633
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:44,198
so if he's telling us to keep away,
that should say something.

634
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,233
No offense, Thea, but your
brother's kind of a wimp.

635
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:49,653
- Don't say that.
- Why not? It's true.

636
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:52,957
My brother survived
five years alone on an island!

637
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,525
Five years I thought
I had lost him.

638
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:58,329
Yeah? Well, I lost
someone, too.

639
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:00,831
And they aren't coming back.

640
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,333
Who?

641
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:04,752
It doesn't matter.

642
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:06,971
That is why I need to find him.

643
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:09,223
So he can teach me
to be like him.

644
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:12,142
I'm not losing
anyone else ever again.

645
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:16,096
I can't do this, Roy.

646
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:18,098
If you don't give this up,

647
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,400
you're going to lose me.

648
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:22,236
Better now
than later.

649
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:34,915
Oh, good.

650
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:36,500
I was just coming
to check on you

651
00:32:36,502 --> 00:32:39,670
to see if maybe
you'd like some tea, or...

652
00:32:39,672 --> 00:32:42,306
What is this?

653
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:47,094
Walter...

654
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:49,430
Please.

655
00:32:49,432 --> 00:32:52,266
Divorce is an extreme reaction.

656
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:53,801
Well, considering
the circumstances,

657
00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:55,585
I find it
somewhat reserved.

658
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:56,770
Or do you think
I believe that

659
00:32:56,772 --> 00:32:58,522
my abduction
on the night you told me

660
00:32:58,524 --> 00:33:01,308
that I was getting too close
to your conspiracy

661
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,360
was a coincidence.

662
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:05,479
You--you were in danger.

663
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:08,148
This arrangement,
it saved your life.

664
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,983
Well,
that's ironic.

665
00:33:09,985 --> 00:33:12,986
Because it feels like
you've destroyed it.

666
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:14,455
Walter...

667
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:16,457
You know, I read about
people in forced captivity.

668
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:18,876
Some of them said
it was a simple thought

669
00:33:18,878 --> 00:33:21,628
that got them through
the isolation and fear--

670
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,582
returning
to their loved ones.

671
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:28,285
So I don't know
really why I'm still alive, Moira,

672
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:30,254
because I didn't
have that.

673
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:31,505
Walter, please...

674
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:33,123
What do you think
you can say to me

675
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:36,510
to convince me that
everything I knew, my whole life...

676
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,695
hasn't just evaporated?

677
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,438
Where are you going?

678
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,940
Come here.

679
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:07,508
Detective?

680
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,343
What'd you find?

681
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:12,379
Merlyn Global's cyber security
is off the charts.

682
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:14,932
Firewalls, NSA-grade
I.P.Sec protocols...

683
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:17,768
What's that, tech speak
for "I struck out, boss."

684
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,653
Yeah, but I wasn't
the only one.

685
00:34:19,655 --> 00:34:22,389
Somebody else tried hacking into
Merlyn Global systems.

686
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:25,692
Same pathways I used,
same result.

687
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:27,311
You're saying that someone
else was looking

688
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:29,146
for Merlyn's connection
to Unidac?

689
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:30,237
Yeah, someone good.

690
00:34:30,262 --> 00:34:31,950
Knew how to reverse
engineer her footprints.

691
00:34:31,951 --> 00:34:33,901
- I almost didn't catch her.
- Her?

692
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:35,736
Yeah. She works
at Queen Consolidated.

693
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:38,438
Name's Felicity Smoak.

694
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,126
Who the hell
is Felicity Smoak?

695
00:34:42,128 --> 00:34:44,361
In addition to the download,
I also took the liberty

696
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:46,363
of uploading a trojan
to Merlyn's system.

697
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:48,665
Figured it might
come in handy.

698
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,417
That's smart. If Merlyn thinks
he's been compromised,

699
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:52,302
it'll help
if we know first.

700
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:54,054
Can you locate
the seismic device?

701
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:55,722
I'm working on it.

702
00:34:55,724 --> 00:34:58,142
But there's at least a terraflop
of data to go through.

703
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:04,431
You all right?

704
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:07,351
My father, he told me
that he failed the city.

705
00:35:07,353 --> 00:35:09,893
Asked me to right his
wrongs, but I never knew

706
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:11,856
what he meant until now.

707
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:14,408
It's the Undertaking.

708
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,744
I promised myself that when
I crossed all these names

709
00:35:17,746 --> 00:35:20,581
off the list,
I'd be done, but...

710
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:24,751
Taking down these people,
it doesn't honor him.

711
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:29,122
I was just treating the symptoms
while the disease festered.

712
00:35:29,124 --> 00:35:32,292
I stop the Undertaking...

713
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:35,629
I wipe out the disease.

714
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:39,049
What are you saying, Oliver?
You would hang up the Hood?

715
00:35:41,135 --> 00:35:45,055
Merlyn's plan is what I returned
from the island to stop.

716
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:48,809
Where are you going?

717
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:51,361
Out.

718
00:35:53,816 --> 00:35:55,616
Hi.

719
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:57,401
Can we talk?

720
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:01,872
Thank you.

721
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,562
What did you want
to talk about?

722
00:36:08,564 --> 00:36:14,051
Wow, I thought this was going
to be easier to say.

723
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:17,204
But now
I'm standing here...

724
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:19,723
Looking at you,
and it's--

725
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:21,558
Just say what you have
to say and go, ok?

726
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,294
Ever since I've been back,
we've been doing this dance.

727
00:36:24,296 --> 00:36:28,398
We come together,
and then I pull away.

728
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,901
Something pulls me away.

729
00:36:30,903 --> 00:36:34,571
But I think...

730
00:36:34,573 --> 00:36:37,624
finally...

731
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:40,894
that something
might be over.

732
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:45,532
What are you trying to say?

733
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:49,870
That... you know me
better than anyone.

734
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:52,155
And that you...

735
00:36:52,157 --> 00:36:56,627
are more important to me
than anyone.

736
00:36:56,629 --> 00:37:00,681
I just hope I didn't wait
too long to say it.

Felicity found
the Markov device.

754
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:12,794
Merlyn's keeping it
at a warehouse

755
00:38:12,796 --> 00:38:14,262
his company
owns in the Glades.

756
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:15,914
Good. Coordinate an attack.

757
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:18,250
You take the device,
I'll take Merlyn.

758
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,634
Got a location?

759
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:21,386
Yeah. According to
Felicity's trojan,

760
00:38:21,388 --> 00:38:23,922
Merlyn's logged on to his computer
from his office.

761
00:38:23,924 --> 00:38:26,725
I'm on my way.

762
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:30,762
The uniform
suits you, Yao Fei.

763
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:35,050
Any time
you're ready.

764
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:38,437
To the people of China
and citizens of the world,

765
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:41,156
I make this statement
voluntarily,

766
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,191
taking responsibility
for the shooting

767
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:45,777
of Ferris Air flight 637

768
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:49,498
to protest the People's
Republic of China's treatment of me;

769
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
for betraying
and abandoning me

770
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:53,668
to the island of Lian Yu.

771
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:59,458
Consider this my righteous
delivery of powerful vengeance.

772
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,259
Thank you.

773
00:39:03,346 --> 00:39:06,098
- No!
- Ba!

774
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,050
- Ba!
- Sir.

775
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:09,634
Plane is within range.

776
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,503
Very well.

777
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:46,421
I'll be in touch.

778
00:39:46,423 --> 00:39:48,924
Can I help you?

779
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:51,159
No...

780
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:53,395
I wasn't
talking to you.

781
00:39:56,315 --> 00:39:58,567
Malcolm Merlyn...

782
00:39:58,569 --> 00:40:02,037
You have failed this city.

783
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,538
And how have I
done that?

784
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,990
The Undertaking.

785
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:07,159
It ends now.

786
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:08,493
Oliver, the device...

787
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:11,746
It's gone.

788
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:15,267
Where's the device?

789
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:17,169
Safe.

790
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:19,504
I don't know how you got
that trojan onto my system,

791
00:40:19,506 --> 00:40:22,874
but it prompted me
to take precautions.

792
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:27,095
There is nothing you can do to stop
what is about to happen.

793
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:29,598
And you shouldn't.

794
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,517
This city needs
what is about to happen

795
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,169
in order to survive.

796
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:36,504
The people who are
destroying it from the inside

797
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:38,974
need to be erased
from the map.

798
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:40,759
Fine.

799
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:43,145
Let's start with you.

800
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:47,432
Ironic, isn't it?

801
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:50,385
Last Christmas,
I almost killed you.

802
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:53,572
A few months ago,
you saved my life.

803
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:55,523
And now you're here
trying to kill me.

804
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:58,543
You should
make up your mind.

805
00:40:58,545 --> 00:41:00,328
Done.

806
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:41,536
Oh, no.

807
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:46,561
