1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,400
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legend Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,480
That's my dad.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,880
This must be one of his secret
government projects

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,680
- he could never tell me about.
- Yeah, my whole life,

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,960
I always believed my power was evil.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,280
Nora Dark, hands up!

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,800
It's time for me to pay for my past.

8
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,280
I just believe
she can be a better person.

9
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,520
Amaya. It just looks like her.

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,800
She's a shape-shifter.

11
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,200
She's still adjusting
to her new home.

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,800
I'm gonna green-light
additional funding

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,120
to fast-track the completion
of your containment facility.

14
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,720
Is that a Kaupe?

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,840
I can't believe you guys
have magical creatures here.

16
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,600
This is, like,
the coolest place ever.

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Hey, Ava, hope I'm not too early.

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
It's Director Sharpe.

19
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,000
And you're not early, Mona.
You're late.

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,480
Oh, no, are you firing me?
Why does this always happen?

21
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,200
I'm not firing you, Mona.

22
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Awesome, because I cannot
wait to decorate my cubicle.

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,000
There's Rose from "Golden Girls."

24
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,040
She's, like, the OG of girl power.

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,440
- Am I right?
- No.

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,920
Take that off
and anything else that's metal.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Leave the toys with these guys.

28
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
You do not want to bring anything

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,320
into the containment unit
that can be used

30
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
as a weapon against you.

31
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,520
But Rose couldn't hurt a fly.

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,960
Your job is to feed
our various magical detainees.

33
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,200
Keeping these creatures secure

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,520
is the Bureau's newest
and highest priority.

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,280
Aloha, Kaupe.

36
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,480
Good to see you.

37
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,400
Each cell is encoded

38
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
with the captive's genetic signature,

39
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,720
allowing you to pass
them provisions

40
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,360
all while keeping you safe
from the monsters.

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,080
Well, this place
definitely needs decorating.

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,480
Now, for the Kaupe,
we're gonna need a palm tree,

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,880
- some volcanic rock...
- This is a prison, Mona,

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,240
not a home.

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Let's go.

46
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,360
And they are our prisoners,
not our friends.

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,320
Which is especially true
of our most recent acquisition.

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,520
Nora Dark.

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,880
Of all the creatures here,
she's the most despicable.

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,760
Hi, I'm Mona.

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm your magical caretaker.

52
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,440
So if you have any
dietary restrictions

53
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,960
or special requests,
be sure to let me know.

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,480
You should have this.

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,240
It just came out.
It's called "Uncaged Desire."

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,160
Actually, there is something
you can get me, Mona.

57
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,200
Anything, just you name it.

58
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,880
Some peace... and quiet.

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,200
I think you just learned
a very valuable lesson, Mona.

60
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,360
Don't fraternize with the prisoners.

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,920
I told you, no interrupt...

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,560
Well, you're not Gary.

63
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,800
Perceptive.

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,000
And those are not work shoes.

65
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,160
What are you doing here?

66
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Don't play coy with me.

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,160
Happy birthday, Director Sharpe.

68
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,480
Oh, sweet God.

69
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,960
Wow.

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,360
You know that I don't normally like

71
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,600
to celebrate my birthday, but...

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,320
Well, I am here to fix that,
so close your eyes.

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
What?

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,160
I said, close your eyes.

75
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,560
Okay. Okay.

76
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,280
Are you ready
for your birthday present?

77
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Yes.

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,240
Are we really doing this?

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,320
Director Sharpe, we need to talk.

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Of course, sir.

81
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,360
I... I was just meditating.

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
There's this great app that...

83
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,920
Meditate on this.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,360
- Oh, my God.
- Exactly.

85
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,680
These are expenses generated
by the crew of the Waverider,

86
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,040
the tip of the Time Bureau spear...

87
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,680
Your Legends.

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,160
You said they were worth
the additional funding.

89
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,680
Let me refer you to some
of my favorite line items.

90
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,440
135 million dollars
for a new Timecore.

91
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,600
What was wrong with the old one?

92
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,040
Oh, well, Rip blew it up

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,080
when he sacrificed his life
to save the world.

94
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,360
Sacrifice is right.

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,040
1.7 million dollars
for historical costumes.

96
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
Well, admittedly,
their costumes are flamboyant.

97
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,880
A line item for, and I quote,

98
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,920
"assorted condiments."

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Assorted?

100
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,960
No one ever accused
the Legends of starving, sir.

101
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
If I didn't know any better,

102
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
I'd say you were in bed
with the Legends.

103
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,640
Either that,
or this Captain Sara Lance

104
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,200
is simply screwing you.

105
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,240
What? Screwing me... Sara Lance?

106
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
Sir, that is, that is crazy.

107
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,880
Which is exactly what
the Pentagon is going to call me

108
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,640
unless we find a way
to justify these numbers.

109
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Got it, sir.

110
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,280
I... look,

111
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,200
I know that your team
is worth the money,

112
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
- but I...
- I will talk to the team,

113
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,320
- see if we can tighten our belts.
- Thank you.

114
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,120
I increased their budget

115
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,480
so they can build
magical containment cells

116
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
to start capturing these creatures.

117
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,920
Meanwhile, they're running
a nine-figure deficit

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
on a timeship.

119
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,280
Okay, take a deep breath, Hank.

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,720
If you knew what the Legends did,

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,000
you'd realize they're... they're
worth every single penny.

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Now, how about this?

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
I'll set up a ride-along.

124
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,080
You can meet the gang
and see where I used to live.

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
I can see where my money's going.

126
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
- Sure.
- You're right.

127
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Why don't we go now?

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,360
Now?

129
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,200
You know we should
probably give them a chance,

130
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
you know, to clean up.

131
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
We can't warn them we're coming.

132
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,560
That would defeat the purpose.

133
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,280
Okay...

134
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,440
I mean, I got to hail the Waverider,
and that's gonna take forever.

135
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,800
Nathaniel, as your boss,

136
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
I demand you take me
to the Waverider.

137
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,680
Gonna play the boss card again?

138
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,480
Okay, then, sir Captain Heywood.

139
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,720
Let's go see
what the Legends are up to.

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
{\an5}I can deal with Hank,
and we still have

141
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,560
{\an5}plenty of time to get things
on the ship back in order.

142
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
What are they...

143
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,760
- I should probably...
- Go! Go. Go.

144
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,920
Delivery for Sara...

145
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,120
Damn it.

146
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Sorry.

147
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,680
Wait, don't forget your...

148
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
Birthday cake.

149
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Red alert, Nate is on the ship,

150
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,240
{\an5}<i>and he brought his dad
for what's got to be</i>

151
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,760
{\an5}<i>a surprise inspection.</i>

152
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,560
We are so not ready for guests.

153
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,120
Nate's here?

154
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,600
{\an5}I could really use a hug
and get his advice on Nora.

155
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,520
{\an5}<i>Did you forget
who else is on the ship?</i>

156
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Charlie. You can't let him see her

157
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,360
{\an5}until we have time
to explain why there's

158
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,880
an Amaya look alike on board.

159
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,320
{\an5}<i>- Right.</i>
- Last time I saw her,

160
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
she was in the lab.

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,920
<i>Everyone,
keep Nate away from the lab.</i>

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,240
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

163
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,160
Any tour of the ship
should start here.

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
{\an5}This is where the Legends
have team meetings

165
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,440
{\an5}and hold lively symposiums
of ideas and solutions,

166
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,480
all led by Captain Sara Lance.

167
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
And where is this Captain Lance?

168
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
It is a little quiet,

169
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,320
but I assure you
Captain Lance is securing

170
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,360
the Legends' next daring mission.

171
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,240
{\an5}Next up, the parlor,
which we spell with a U

172
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,160
{\an5}because our first captain
was British.

173
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,880
So, why does a ship

174
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
formerly manned by a single person

175
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
now need...

176
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,960
Need a crew of six?

177
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,160
- I can explain.
- Hey, Ray.

178
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,200
Oh, he means five. You mean five.

180
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
I mean, five... I mean, five.

181
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,800
I must have been thinking
about Gideon as a real person.

182
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,200
<i>Are you trying to hurt
my feelings, Dr. Palmer?</i>

183
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
Oh, wow, Gideon.

184
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
Hubba, hubba.

185
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,360
Love the new look.

186
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,440
<i>Ms. Tomaz gave me,
in her words, a face-lift.</i>

187
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,160
This is a talking computer?

188
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,760
{\an5}<i>Actually, I'm a quantum-enhanced
A.I. program,</i>

189
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,000
<i>capable of operating
completely autonomously.</i>

190
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,160
So what you're saying is,

191
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,120
{\an5}you don't need any people
on the ship.

192
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,480
Oh, no, no, no, no, we do.

193
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,880
{\an5}Ray, why don't you show Hank
what you do in the...

194
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,400
Not the Lab.

195
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Hello, sir.

196
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,880
You should take him to the library.

197
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,800
It's very impressive,
and there are... books.

198
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,760
- And bookshelves.
- Bookshelves.

199
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,560
See, Hank, it takes a village.

200
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
Follow me.

201
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,720
{\an5}- God.
- It was a good save.

202
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,040
Now, the library is my domain.

203
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,480
{\an5}I've assembled quite
a collection of...

204
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,920
Nate, it's good to see you, mate.

205
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,480
You haven't seen
the laboratory yet, have you?

206
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,760
No, why?

207
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,640
{\an5}Because you should always
save the best for last.

208
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
Yeah, you should really

209
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,520
{\an5}put some clothes on
when we have guests.

210
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,320
So, this is your domain.

211
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,960
Why don't we move on, huh?

212
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,880
Mr. Heywood, welcome aboard.

213
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,800
{\an5}I see you've already
had the complete tour.

214
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,640
He hasn't seen the lab yet.

215
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
That's a great idea.

216
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,040
Wait till you see this.

217
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Hey, so maybe your dad

218
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
would like to see the galley.

219
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,440
Or the cargo bay with all the crates.

220
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,920
{\an5}Or... or the bathroom.
It's a marvel of efficiency.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Look, you guys need
to pull it together, okay?

222
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,720
Look, I know my dad sprung
this on us,

223
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,040
but we have dealt
with crazier things...

224
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,240
Amaya?

225
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,840
So, this is the ex-girlfriend
you can't shut up about?

226
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,080
Look, I'm sorry.
I should have told you...

227
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
She came back.

228
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,960
I knew she'd come back.

229
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,480
{\an5}No, you don't understand.
It's not...

230
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
You look beautiful.

231
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,800
Get your stinking mitts
off of me, you knob.

232
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,400
We should just we're gonna...

233
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Yeah, just go. Go.

234
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You've changed.

235
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,920
What the hell's going on?

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And what's with that accent?

237
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,400
I mean, I dig it,
but what's going on?

238
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,200
Well, I'm not your
disco-loving ex, mate.

239
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,600
Meet the newest member
of our team,

240
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,720
Charlie.

241
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,520
Charlie here is a shape-shifter.

242
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,120
Except she can no longer shape-shift.

243
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,960
It's actually a pretty crazy story.

244
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,480
Let me guess
she turned into Amaya

245
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
and conned you
into not sending her to hell

246
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,240
and Constantine put a spell on her
and now she's stuck like this?

247
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,400
That is...

248
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,400
- weirdly accurate, yeah.
- Yeah.

249
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,840
I guess it's not such a crazy story.

250
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
It's insane, Ray!

251
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,240
I told my dad you guys
were good at your jobs,

252
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,280
and now you're adopting
some magical creature

253
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,480
who's pretending to be Amaya?

254
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
Hey, I'm not pretending
to be anyone.

255
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
That said,

256
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,520
Hank's already looking
for ways to slash our funding,

257
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
so maybe it's not the worst idea

258
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
to fake it for one mission.

259
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,960
You want me to pretend
to be this wanker's ex?

260
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
What...

261
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,760
Sounds like classic Legends
hijinks to me.

262
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,680
We can't let Hank know
that we're harboring a fugitive.

263
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,000
We just need to show him
one mission,

264
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,160
send him on his way
before anything can go wrong.

265
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,560
Okay, then maybe
it wasn't the best idea

266
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,000
to leave him with those three.

267
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,360
- We should go.
- Yeah.

268
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
All right, team, showtime.

269
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,400
- Drinking at work.
- Who said anything about work?

270
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,040
Hey, Legends, you hear that?

271
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,520
We got a hit on the magic-o-meter.

272
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,680
Oh, where in history
are we gonna end up next?

273
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Where will it be?

274
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,560
The Wild West, medieval China, or...

275
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,960
Paris in the Roaring Twenties?

276
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Oh, la, la.

277
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,400
Gideon, plot a course.

278
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,560
<i>Yes, Captain, right away.</i>

279
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,640
So explain to me how this
magic-o-meter of yours works.

280
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Oh, well...

281
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,200
Thingy goes beep, and we kick ass.

282
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,240
Meaning we investigate
each time period.

283
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,520
We find the creature.
We bring it to the Bureau.

284
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,800
And hopefully learn some
life lessons along the way.

285
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,280
And it takes six of you to do that?

286
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,640
- Seven if you count Amaya.
<i>- Eight if you count me.</i>

287
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,960
Sounds a little inefficient.

288
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,920
Which is why we separate
into two very important teams.

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,840
Zee, John, Ray, and Amaya

290
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,360
will stay on the ship to quarterback

291
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,080
while the rest of us go in search

292
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,600
of whatever is wreaking havoc
on gay Paree.

293
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
I thought that was,
in politically correct.

294
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,320
Politically incorrect.

295
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,480
Hey, it's our first mission together.

296
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,280
Don't worry, if anything
goes wrong in the field,

297
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
I got you covered.

298
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,160
Yeah, but...

299
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,920
I didn't get cold cocked by a girl.

300
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,960
Have you ever been hit
by a girl, Hank?

301
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
No, ma'am.

302
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
We should head out.

303
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,160
Cafe du Dome, 1927,
home to the Lost Generation.

304
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,600
Writers, artists, ex-pats,
they all...

305
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,200
All right, so where's this monster?

306
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,440
Yeah, who needs historical
context and wonderment?

307
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I need a drink.

308
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,000
What he means is, we need
to blend in with the locals.

309
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,280
This is a recon mission.

310
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,400
I believe...

311
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Oh, my God. It's him.

312
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,280
Salvador Dalí.

313
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
What, the creep
with the weird mustache?

314
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Don't point.

315
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,680
He's the father of surrealism.

316
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,000
This is your plan?

317
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,160
To catch this creature,

318
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
you ask a bunch
of artsy-fartsy fools...

319
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,440
Oh, my God. It's him.

320
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,280
It's Papa.

321
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
Papa? What,
your grandfather's here?

322
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,840
- No.
- Thought he blew up in space.

323
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,200
You are so insensitive.

324
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,000
Not that Papa.
Ernest Hemingway.

325
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,680
He's, like, my dad's spirit animal.

326
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,640
I say if we want to get things done,

327
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
we ask the original man of action.

328
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,560
Your dad
is totally geeking out right now.

329
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
My entire life,

330
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
my father would go on
and on about Hemingway

331
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,520
and how that was his
idea of a real man.

332
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,360
And that is when I was attacked

333
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,200
by the monstrous man
of the Catacombs.

334
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,200
Well, it's time to talk
to some artsy-fartsy fools.

335
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
Pardon moi.

336
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,880
Oh, you said you saw
a monstrous man.

337
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,600
- Can you explain?
- Of course.

338
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,120
Oh, there was a logarithmic
curve to his form,

339
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,680
the drama of his movement expressing

340
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,080
deep personal cosmogony.

341
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,200
Can you draw me a picture?

342
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,720
Okay, let's try one more time.

343
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,480
My name is Amaya Jiwe

344
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,240
of the, the Justice Society of

345
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,040
complete and utter
bloody rubbish, wouldn't it?

346
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,640
Yep, it sucks.

347
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,800
Now, just remember, the yanks,

348
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,320
they don't say "rubbish."
They'd say...

349
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,560
"That was absolute garbage.

350
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,680
"I'm American, soccer,
yardsticks, ranch dressing, weasel."

351
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,280
You know what? I quit. Yeah.

352
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
I'd rather get some fresh air

353
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,600
than pretend to be this twee old nag.

354
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,160
You can't quit. She can't quit.

355
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,920
Sara needs us to quarterback
the mission.

356
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,280
You don't really think that's
why she left us here, do you?

357
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,880
She just doesn't want us
making a scene

358
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,240
in front of Nate's dad.

359
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,880
"Efficiency" is the new watchword,
gents,

360
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,920
and while Hank is around,
the three of us...

361
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,880
- Four, if you count Charlie.
<i>- Five, if you count me.</i>

362
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,560
Are extraneous.

363
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,480
You know, mate, you could just

364
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,480
walk straight off this ship

365
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,880
and no one would even
bleeding notice.

366
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Well, maybe I'll test that theory.

367
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,880
Except I'm not walking.

368
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,040
I'm taking the jumpship.

369
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,480
The answer is no, Ray.

370
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,440
But you haven't even heard
my pitch yet.

371
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
You want access to
a secret containment facility

372
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,160
for magical creatures where,
I might add,

373
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,720
there are no conjugal visits.

374
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,680
Wait, what?
You think that I want to visit Nora

375
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
so that we can...

376
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,840
I just want to make sure
that she's okay.

377
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,120
Oh, that is so sweet.

378
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,480
I almost believe that story,

379
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,000
you big lovable teddy bear, you.

380
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,360
But the answer is still no.

381
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,120
With Nate's dad watching
our each and every move,

382
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,320
there is just no time...

383
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,280
for love at the Time Bureau.

384
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,320
There's always time for love.

385
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,640
- Were you eavesdropping?
- Maybe.

386
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Or maybe I was meant
to hear your plight.

387
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm sorry, who are you again?

388
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,640
Name's Mona, and I know where
they've got Nora locked up.

389
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,640
You do.

390
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,080
And while I can't sneak you in,

391
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,920
I can help you sneak in
the next best thing.

392
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,680
A love letter.

393
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,800
The bull is not the enemy
of the bullfighter.

394
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
He is his partner.

395
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,640
They are dancers
locked in a dance of death.

396
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Whichever dies, man or bull,

397
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,200
the dance is a thing of beauty.

398
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Hey, we got to go.

399
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,080
I got a lead on
that thing we're hunting.

400
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,360
You're hunters?

401
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,640
Stay out of this, Hemingway.

402
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,200
Perhaps you'd like to settle
our differences like men.

403
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,800
I don't have time
for this macho crap, man.

404
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,120
Okay, you two with me.
Roy, keep him busy.

405
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,120
Fine specimen of male vitality.

406
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,920
Fellow pugilist, no doubt.

407
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Author.

408
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,960
My kind of man!

409
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Join me.

410
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,400
Okay, Dalí saw the monster firsthand

411
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,640
when it attacked him
in the Catacombs,

412
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,880
and he drew me this.

413
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Wait.

414
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
What the hell am I looking at?

415
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
No, no, no, here.

416
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,720
Yeah, I still don't see it.

417
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,360
All right, ignore the melting clocks.

418
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,720
We got to get this back to the ship,

419
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,600
and I have to find a match
to Dalí's drawing

420
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
somewhere in the library.

421
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,360
We're supposed to protect history
from the library, Nathaniel?

422
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,800
Okay, I see that you're
really into drinking

423
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,440
the Hemingway Kool-Aid,
and by Kool-Aid,

424
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,280
I mean scotch, but we are here
to catch a monster.

425
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,400
Of course,

426
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,960
but I know we sure
as hell aren't gonna

427
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,040
find out what it is by studying
some finger paintings.

428
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
We got to go back to the ship
to figure out what we're doing.

429
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,160
That's the way we do things, right?

430
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,400
Yes, when the mission isn't
also showing Hank a good time.

431
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
I'm sorry.

432
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You know,
I thought this would be good

433
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
for the both of us, but...

434
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,200
Hank is at his happiest

435
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,480
when he's telling me
what I'm doing wrong, so...

436
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,160
Mission accomplished.

437
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,480
Oh, cheer up, bud.

438
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,120
You are right, so Rory and I,

439
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,320
we will keep an eye on Hank,

440
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,200
let him have a few laughs
with Hemingway

441
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,400
while you go figure out
what this thing is.

442
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,120
We bag the creature,
we keep our jobs.

443
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Okay.

444
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,680
Where are you all going?

445
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,400
Henry here told me of a creature
hiding in the Catacombs.

446
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,960
Oh, did you, Henry?

447
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,560
- Therefore, we hunt.
- Let's go get our monster.

448
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,720
Nate's right. We have no idea
what this thing is.

449
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,880
A man hunts not
to learn about his prey

450
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,400
but to learn about himself.

451
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,120
We need to regroup with
the team and get some backup.

452
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
What better backup
than Hemingway?

453
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm finally starting to understand

454
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,760
what it is the Legends do.

455
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,400
Marcel, fetch me my rifles.

456
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,960
Right away, sir.

457
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,240
I need a Marcel.

458
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,200
Yeah, just a little
drunk hunting with Hemingway.

459
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,040
What could go wrong?

460
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,040
Have you ever held a gun before?

461
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,040
Once or twice.

462
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,920
Your friend is much woman.

463
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,560
Have my own.

464
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,880
Signature weapon, I like it.

465
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,320
The drunk painter was right.

466
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,760
The creature is hiding
in the Catacombs.

467
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,680
- And it's getting closer.
- We need a plan.

468
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,000
We have no idea what this thing is

469
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,880
and if it can even be stopped
with bullets.

470
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
I've found that in life,
the shortest answer

471
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,680
is doing the thing.

472
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,320
Let's do this thing.

473
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,440
I knew you couldn't resist.

474
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,160
Did you get to the end,
where the correctional officer

475
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,560
convinces the judge to send her
to prison so he can go free?

476
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
Well, I have now.

477
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,960
Sorry, didn't mean to ruin it.

478
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,280
But I brought you an even better one.

479
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,200
The hell is this?

480
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,880
It's a letter from your crush.

481
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,560
Ray left it behind for you.

482
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,720
Don't you see?

483
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,960
Yours is a love no bars can contain.

484
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,240
No, I... I don't want it.

485
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,160
But don't you
want to at least open it?

486
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
No.

487
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,440
What if you change your mind
or your heart?

488
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
Not gonna change my...

489
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,040
Take the damn letter.

490
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Look what you made me do.

491
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Sorry.

492
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,560
<i>Oh, I swear
it's one of these buttons.</i>

493
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
What the hell?

494
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Are you okay?

495
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,160
Did she attack you?

496
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
It's fine.
Just, just a misunderstanding.

497
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
The hell is this?

498
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Where'd you get this?

499
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,520
Did Mona deliver this to you?

500
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,320
Okay, since neither of you
have anything to say,

501
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,640
I'll let the letter speak for itself.

502
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
No!

503
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,880
Requesting emergency assistance!

504
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,760
I... I didn't... didn't mean to...

505
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,880
We're stuck.

506
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,280
Well, at least, we're all here
together, right?

507
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,000
Now, I know why you took
my shoelaces.

508
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,120
Oh, pardon.

509
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
<i>American.</i>

510
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Lost?

511
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
No, I'm good.

512
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,560
'Cause you're heading
in the wrong direction.

513
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
The Waverider's over there.

514
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,840
I don't need directions from you.

515
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,440
Listen, sunshine.

516
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,880
I don't know what beef
you had with your ex,

517
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,600
but don't bring it on me.

518
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,760
Zelda, dear, I do believe

519
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,320
they're giving us a run
for our money.

520
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
You're the Fitzgeralds.

521
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,600
And we pride ourselves

522
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,880
the most quarrelsome couple in Paris.

523
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,880
Don't worry. We're not a couple.

524
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,440
Well, the night is still young.

525
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,960
You should join us for a drink.

526
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,640
Besides, no one should be out
on the streets alone tonight.

527
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,400
There is a monster on the loose.

528
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,640
- You heard about the monster.
- Come with me.

529
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,760
What conversation isn't better
had over a gin rickey?

530
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Do you hear that?

531
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,840
Dalí's the only one
who's seen the beast.

532
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,040
Take it for what it's worth.

533
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,640
Well, I spoke with him myself,

534
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,880
and according to Dalí,
this is what it looks like.

535
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,720
I can never make heads
or tails of Salvador's work.

536
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
That's a Minotaur.

537
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,600
A beast-alf man, half bull,

538
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,320
spent its whole life
lost in a maze?

539
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,120
Oh, now, that's the common myth,

540
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,760
but I heard a different story.

541
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,120
The Minotaur, he's not lost.

542
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
He's hiding.

543
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,360
Rejected by his father,

544
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,160
he felt that he had no place
in the real world,

545
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,000
and so he chose to stay in the maze.

546
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,480
If Dalí thinks he's seen one of these

547
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,600
I want what he's drinking.

548
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,000
Where you going?

549
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,360
I am going to figure out

550
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,520
a way to catch a Minotaur

551
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,640
and show my father

552
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,360
what a real man of action
looks like.

553
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,960
There it is, awaiting the fight.

554
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,560
I got this! Mine's longer.

555
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,160
- Fall back!
- Wait, I've got the shot.

556
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,520
We have to go now!

557
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,680
I'll never surrender.

558
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,720
But I will strategically retreat.

559
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Get back!

560
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,040
Gideon, Hank's hurt.
Show him what you can do.

561
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,240
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

562
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,960
Dad, are you okay?

563
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Please don't blame the Legends.

564
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
I should have been there.

565
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,920
Because then you would have seen me
lock eyes with the beast,

566
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,840
and it was in that moment

567
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,480
that I felt a deep
and mutual respect.

568
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,200
Wow, someone's been
bonding with Papa.

569
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,080
- Yeah.
- Respect that gave way to resolve

570
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,080
as the beast drew its blade.

571
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,520
The dance had begun.

572
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,080
- Okay, Gideon.
<i>- Initiating scan.</i>

573
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,840
So Cliffs Notes
big ax, bigger monster,

574
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,640
knows we're on it.
We need a plan B quick.

575
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,640
Okay. Dad, you heal up.

576
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,360
- We've got this.
- No, like hell.

577
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,120
I owe it to him to finish
this... fight.

578
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,520
<i>Sedative administered.</i>

579
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
And you thought a Minotaur
was bullheaded?

580
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Oh, mythology burn.

581
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,600
It's good to have you back.

582
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,840
There has to be a way out of here.

583
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,480
Well, it's a prison cell.

584
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,320
Or an incubator
for our burgeoning friendship.

585
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,080
Isn't breaking out of prison
your thing?

586
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,120
Only reason I escaped last time was

587
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,720
because Ray gave me a Time Stone.

588
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Tell me everything,

589
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
because I am big-time shipping
you two.

590
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,400
No shipping the inmates.

591
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,200
It's the reason we're stuck
in here in the first place.

592
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I know that getting
your boss locked in a prison

593
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,960
isn't the best way to start a job,

594
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,920
so if it comes to it,
I'd like you to eat me first.

595
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
No one's eating anyone, Mona,

596
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
but when we get out of here,
we do have to talk about

597
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,360
your continued employment
at the Bureau.

598
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,520
Wait, no, no, no, you can't fire me.

599
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
Give me one good reason why.

600
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,440
Okay. Okay.

601
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,160
I was gonna save
this for upstairs, but...

602
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,720
surprise!

603
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,000
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

604
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,480
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

605
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,720
This isn't making
things better, is it?

606
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,400
No, it's fantastic. Keep going.

607
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
So, that's it?

608
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,560
I finally find a job
where I can use my skills...

609
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
Debatable.

610
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,200
And I blow it in the first week.

611
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,320
Guess I'm stuck
doing my fallback plan,

612
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
going back to law school.

613
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,480
At least, Yale wants me.

614
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,480
Wait, wait, that's the fallback plan?

615
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,680
Law school?
What are you even doing here?

616
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,520
This is my dream job.

617
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
It's my mom who wants me
to be a lawyer.

618
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,560
No, you can't give in
to what your parents want.

619
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,400
That's what I did,
and look how that ended.

620
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,840
Okay, you're not gonna take

621
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,640
life advice from Nora Dhark, right?

622
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,920
That's rich.
You should listen to your parents.

623
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Think about your future.

624
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,640
Oh, easy for you to say.
At least, you had a future.

625
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,240
When I was a kid, my dad convinced me

626
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,440
to be a demon vessel.

627
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,840
You think it was easy for me?

628
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,960
At least, you got to be a kid.

629
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Try being a clone from 2213, okay?

630
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,760
The only taste of childhood
I've ever had

631
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,760
was almost being killed
by a Shtriga at summer camp.

632
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,960
Wow, okay, I need to hear

633
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,800
your entire life stories right now.

634
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,960
No.

635
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,280
We might as well
get to know each other

636
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,440
if we're stuck here.

637
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Or...

638
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,280
at least have a drink?

639
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Where did you...

640
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
We need to bag ourselves a Minotaur

641
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,040
before your dad gets himself killed.

642
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,640
Oh, what is that smell?

643
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,240
Did you guys get a team dog
without me?

644
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,720
Because that was my idea.

645
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,840
Bet you guys are having

646
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,160
post-mission pizza parties now too.

647
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,120
This is the artificial musk
of a female Minotaur.

648
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,960
See, Minotaurs have
a very sharp sense of smell

649
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
when it comes to tracking prey,

650
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,320
but with this little bad boy,

651
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,360
I can lure it in by convincing
it that I'm a potential mate.

652
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Then what?

653
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,600
You two gonna ride off together,

654
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,960
get a nice little flat in Soho?

655
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,800
It's good, but we still need
a way to tame it

656
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
and get it to the Bureau.

657
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,120
Taming the beast. Taming the beast.

658
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,520
I read about this. I read about this.

659
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,560
Let's see,
"The Magical Treatise of Solomon."

660
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Here we go.

661
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,840
"To ease the Minotaur's rage,

662
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,680
"his mother would play him a lullaby

663
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,400
on a lute built by Daedalus."

664
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
That's it.

665
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,480
We'll lure it out
and lull it to sleep.

666
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,880
No one gets hurt,
not even the Minotaur.

667
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,440
And then we'll have a pizza party.

668
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
And that's when I found out

669
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
I was from the future.

670
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,280
- Whoa, the future.
- Yep.

671
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
It was all fake

672
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,360
my parents, my memories,

673
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,680
growing up in Fresno.

674
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,200
Still better than
spending your childhood

675
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,120
with The Order
of the Shrouded Compass.

676
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,400
Is that like the Sisterhood
of Traveling Pants?

677
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,840
Even worse. Death cult.

678
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,680
And before that,
I just moved around

679
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,680
from one mental institution
to the next.

680
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,960
Point is, you're lucky.

681
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,080
I'm lucky?

682
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,000
I just wish my past was made up.

683
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
What, so you can wake up one day

684
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,960
and realize that you don't
have any family, friends,

685
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,520
or life experiences to hold on to?

686
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,080
Doesn't sound that different

687
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,640
from waking up in a prison cell.

688
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,480
<i>Touché.</i>

689
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,600
Are you two kidding me right now?

690
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,000
Ava, you're a clone from the future,

691
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,160
and you run the Time Travel Bureau.

692
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,920
And you're a witch.

693
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,320
And you escaped a cult

694
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,640
and a real-life demon.

695
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,880
I did.

696
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,560
You two are, like,
the two coolest women

697
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,320
I have ever met,

698
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,160
and I once met Gillian Anderson

699
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
at an "X-Files" meet and greet.

700
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,720
Wow. Mona, you are a gem.

701
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,960
You know, we can't have a birthday

702
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,320
without birthday cake.

703
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,480
Yeah!

704
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,480
Back on your feet already, Hank.

705
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah, your gal patched me up good.

706
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,480
I'm just running
through our strategy.

707
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Oh, wait, you let him use
our "D&D" miniatures?

708
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,000
No, I didn't let him touch Cyndra,

709
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,120
Lord of the Dark Elves.

710
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,720
You guys "D&D" without me too?

711
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,080
Son, why are you holding
a tiny guitar,

712
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,520
or do I even want to know?

713
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,040
Oh, this... this is a lute.

714
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Someone say loot?

715
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,960
This is what we're gonna use
to put the Minotaur to sleep.

716
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,240
I thought you said that was loot.

717
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
I don't understand.

718
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,840
Well, I suppose it is more of a lyre.

719
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,960
Everyone's a liar.

720
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,800
This is how we're gonna catch
our creature, Dad.

721
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.

722
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,760
We're facing a literal monster.

723
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,680
You think you can destroy it
with a lute?

724
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,920
Well, in the hands of a master,

725
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,560
a lute is a formidable weapon.
Just look at Sting, mate.

726
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
<i>Sorry to interrupt, but there's
a change in the timeline.</i>

727
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,760
<i>An attack at Cafe du Dome
is imminent.</i>

728
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,920
<i>There will be no survivors.</i>

729
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,240
The Minotaur must be
tracking Hemingway's scent.

730
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Let's move out.

731
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,880
Nathaniel, get out of my way.

732
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,240
I don't have to do
what you say anymore, Hank.

733
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Really? Because as your superior,

734
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,480
I'm telling you to stand down.

735
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,840
You're going for
the superior thing again?

736
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,320
You know, you don't want to
listen to me or understand me.

737
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,960
You just... you just
want to be better than me.

738
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,440
Well, you're one
to talk about listening.

739
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
You've ignored every lesson
I've ever tried to teach you.

740
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,920
Because it's the same lesson
over and over again.

741
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,040
You want me to be
more like you, Hank.

742
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,080
But guess what. I'm not like you.

743
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,840
I don't like televised golf
or Tom Clancy books

744
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,240
or '70s folk rock.

745
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,840
I don't know if you happened
to notice,

746
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,600
but I'm a grown-ass superhero...

747
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,960
who's just trying to play
the lute for a Minotaur.

748
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,960
Fine, don't want to listen
to your old man?

749
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,880
Maybe you'll listen to your captain.

750
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,680
I'm sorry, but I'm with Nate.

751
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,920
I know his idea sounds crazy,
but he's right.

752
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,800
That's what makes him a Legend,

753
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,640
no matter where he is.

754
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,480
Look, you said you wanted
to see a Legends mission.

755
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,600
Well, you're about to,

756
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,680
and if it goes wrong, well,

757
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,320
you go ahead and fire all of us.

758
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,240
The beast advanced.

759
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,360
I turned on him, gun raised.

760
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,840
Seeing we'd reached an agreement,

761
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,160
- I fired!
- Oh!

762
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,480
So, I don't think we'll be seeing
that creature anytime soon.

763
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
And what is that?

764
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,120
Back for another go, are you?

765
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
Oi, fuzz ball, come on.

766
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,040
Have a nice little whiff
of this, will you?

767
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,000
That's your cue.

768
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,320
Okay.

769
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,080
I haven't had much time
to rehearse, but...

770
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,640
Now we end this.

771
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
No!

772
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,440
I warn you, I will strike a woman.

773
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,840
That's for being on my summer
eighth grade reading list.

774
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Oh, guys?

775
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Nathaniel!

776
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,080
Always preferred Faulkner.

777
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,360
So not a bad birthday, huh?

778
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,520
Considering my original plan

779
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,800
was a "House Hunters" marathon...

780
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,760
That actually sounds pretty great.

781
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
You know what?

782
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,800
You should have this.

783
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,000
You know you want to read it.

784
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Look,

785
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,080
I learned from being locked up that

786
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,680
the only way to survive
is to shut down.

787
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
If you don't have a future,

788
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,840
it's best not to look forward.

789
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,600
Not to meals or birthdays

790
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,160
or relationships.

791
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,640
Just because this is your present

792
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,000
doesn't mean
it has to be your future.

793
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,200
Who knows?
Maybe someday you can

794
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,120
get out of here
without having to escape.

795
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,360
Yeah, and aren't you glad
you didn't shut down today?

796
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,480
Well, this cake is pretty good.

797
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,040
Come on. Come on.
Who doesn't want to see

798
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,680
a Ray Palmer love letter?

799
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,400
You have to open it.
There's probably glitter in it.

800
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
I really should...

801
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,680
Open it. Open it. Open it.

802
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
You know what?

803
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,360
Oh, hi there.

804
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,720
- Ray?
- Yeah, hi.

805
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,280
Oh, could I get some help?
I'm a little stuck.

806
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,000
- Get behind the bar!
- Good idea.

807
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,760
I meant for cover.

808
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,720
Well, I like your version.

809
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,720
See, it looks just as I drew it.

810
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,680
You leave that weirdo alone!

811
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,000
Your fight is with me!

812
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Toro!

813
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
Come on.

814
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,280
Now the dance begins.

815
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,120
I needed to make sure
she was okay.

816
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,880
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

817
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,240
Actually, I just really wanted
to see her... you.

818
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,280
And then I thought I'd deliver
the message myself,

819
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,280
but then I got stuck in the glue.

820
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,040
That was sweet.

821
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,720
Stupid but sweet.

822
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,880
No, it's unacceptable

823
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,200
but, in this case,
clearly convenient.

824
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,720
So since you are so good
at getting people out of prison,

825
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,760
let's get the hell out of here,
shall we?

826
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
Yeah.

827
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,440
Let's just hope the team
wasn't missing their QB.

828
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,880
That's my boy!

829
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
Over here!

830
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,440
<i>There is a young cowboy</i>

831
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,720
<i>He lives on the range</i>

832
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
<i>His horse and his cattle</i>

833
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,840
<i>Are his only companions</i>

834
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,440
<i>He works in the saddle</i>

835
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,880
<i>And he sleeps in the canyons</i>

836
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,160
<i>Waiting for summer</i>

837
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,120
<i>His pastures to change</i>

838
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,760
What is happening?

839
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,760
James Taylor, and it's good.

840
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,240
<i>And as the moon rises</i>

841
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,280
<i>He sits by his fire</i>

842
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,800
<i>Thinking about women</i>

843
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,960
<i>And glasses of beer</i>

844
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,280
<i>And closing his eyes</i>

845
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,720
<i>As the doggies retire</i>

846
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,320
<i>He sings out a song which is soft</i>

847
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,880
<i>But it's clear</i>

848
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,120
<i>As if maybe someone could hear</i>

849
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You got this, Dad.

850
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,040
<i>Good night, you moonlight ladies</i>

851
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,760
<i>Rockabye, sweet baby James</i>

852
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,040
<i>Deep greens and blues</i>

853
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,640
<i>Are the colors I choose</i>

854
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,400
<i>Won't you let me go down in my dreams</i>

855
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,840
<i>And rockabye, sweet baby James</i>

856
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,320
Now, that is how you finish
a Legends mission.

857
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,600
You did good, son.

858
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,960
Right back at you, Dad.

859
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,640
I learned it from you, Nathaniel.

860
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,480
- Hola, Chupi!
- Hola!

861
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,760
- Privet, Baba Yaga.
- Privet.

862
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,760
What's up, Nora?

863
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,800
Thought you were headed to Yale.

864
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,600
After last night, I marched home

865
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,800
and told my parents
I didn't want to be a lawyer.

866
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,120
And also that I was craving nachos

867
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,760
and wanted to do karaoke.

868
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
The rosé had really kicked
in at that point.

869
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,360
Oh, and here,
my mom's homemade congee.

870
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,960
Great hangover cure.

871
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,480
Hey, can you do me a favor?

872
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
I wrote...

873
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,000
I wrote Ray a letter.

874
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,920
It'd be an honor to deliver it.

875
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,360
Yeah, anything for my
generation's Ross and Rachel.

876
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,760
Oh, morning, Director Sharpe.

877
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,920
A word, Mona.

878
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
What?

879
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,520
Wait, are you firing me this time?

880
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
No, Mona.

881
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,560
After yesterday, I realized...

882
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,080
there is some room for a little
humanity in this place.

883
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,800
Aloha, Kaupe.

884
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,760
Permission to scratch his tummy?

885
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,840
Permission granted.

886
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,760
And you should deliver that letter.

887
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,840
Well, that was a chaotic,

888
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,520
reckless, wasteful mess.

889
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,400
I think I finally see
the value in the Legends.

890
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,120
Yeah, you could have led
with that last part.

891
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,440
We're glad to have you on board.

892
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Well, this has been fun,

893
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,600
but it's time for me to get back.

894
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,440
Yeah, you know what? I'll...

895
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,680
I'll meet you back there, Dad.

896
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,400
He's right. This was fun.

897
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,160
It's good to be back.

898
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,160
Well, the door is always open.

899
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
You know, coming back here,

900
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,120
I thought it'd be like the old days,

901
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,840
but I don't know
what's more surprising,

902
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,960
the fact that so much has changed

903
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,040
or at some point,
this became the old days.

904
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,800
You'd think we of all people
would understand

905
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,920
- that time makes no sense.
- Yeah.

906
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But I guess it's something
you never accept.

907
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,960
You know I love you guys, right?

908
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
But...

909
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,480
I belong over there.

910
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
I get it.

911
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
I'm proud of you.

912
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,000
So go on. Go do your adult thing,
and we'll see you around.

913
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Okay.

914
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,080
Though if you're not in a rush...

915
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,680
It's a pizza party.

916
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,720
Yeah, here he is.

917
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,280
- Hey!
- Welcome back, ugly.

918
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,280
Yes, what other bright ideas
are you gonna leave us with

919
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,400
before you bugger off?

920
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Softball team.

921
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh, no, only electronic sports.

922
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,160
Piñata Fridays.

923
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
How many times do I have
to say no to that?

924
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,080
Unionizing.

925
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,360
Oh, don't let Hank hear you say that.

926
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,440
You know, it's still weird
not having you around.

927
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,040
Oh, man, I'll always be
right there, big guy,

928
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,560
in that giant heart of yours.

929
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,000
And I'll be at the Bureau,

930
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,840
so you guys can literally
stop by whenever you want.

931
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,440
But, you know, before I go,

932
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
I do want to say one thing.

933
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,120
When I first stepped onto this ship,

934
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,600
I was, you know, trying to get away
from all my baggage back home,

935
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,480
and I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

936
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,720
Hemingway once wrote,

937
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,080
"Can't get away from yourself

938
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,960
by moving from one place to another."

939
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
And thanks to you guys,

940
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,960
I don't have to run anymore.

941
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,360
Being here with you all has turned me
into the man I need to be,

942
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,000
and this place is special.

943
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,200
And you never know
when it's gonna be over.

944
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,800
So I say, Legends,

945
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,000
enjoy the ride while it lasts.

946
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Hear, hear.

947
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,320
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

948
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers, cheers.

949
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,400
Oh, you'll find your place here.

950
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I know I did.
